<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm prepping up for our first attempt at the Rallos script.  I've already gone through and typed up a full strat and made some homemade maps and all that.  The only thing is i'm not quite too sure about some of the more &quot;behind the scenes&quot; mechanics that you don't see as just a member of the raid (i've done RZTW before with another guild).<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me with a few specific questions i'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
1.) The proc that Rallos uses (I believe both RZ and RZTW) Sedition (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2445&amp;source=Live).  I see that it's 18 Curse Counters.  Which is both annoying in the fact RGC only cures 9, and Radiant Cure3 only cures 16 (regardless of the recast of it, and that Sedition is a proc).  The question I have here, is attempting to cure this a viable option? As is now I'm going to try and slap one RGC'er on me to just chain cast RGC (Depending on raid size, if i can spare two, I'll use two).  This is of course assuming Sedition doesn't proc TOO frequenty, as two RGC's need to land to cure it.  The idea is to at least give substantial breaks from this -450 AC debuff.<br />
<br />
2.) Scripted adds for RZTW fight.  When exactly does the first wave start? I've gathered from a log posted at www.scienceofwar.net that every 55 seconds RZTW spawns adds in the arena.  I've heard at 95% is when the scripted adds start.  My question is at 95% does just the 55 sec timer START (i.e. no adds at that point).  Or at 95% does a wave of adds spawn AND the 55 sec timer start?<br />
<br />
3.) Vallon Zek.  From what I remember in my RZTW raid I attended it was not necessary to abuse VZ's tether and run him north to split him from his 4 guards.  I believe merely moving the raid to a S/SW corner in the hall (past the &quot;tether&quot; point of that side) and just monk splitting is suffice because Vallon Zek outruns his ogre guards easily so you can drop VZ solo in the SE corner.  Again, is this true?<br />
<br />
4.) The timer restraints for each &quot;Event&quot; in the script.  I haven't been able to find concrete numbers regarding this.  For both Decorin triggers I have 9 min, for TZ/VZ combo I have 18, for RZ I have 9, for RZTW I have seen 18, 30, &amp; 40 listed.  Would just like to be sure of these numbers come crunch time.<br />
<br />
5.) I also remember RZTW spawning up in the pit with about 5-6 Decorin ogres pretty much shoved up his arse.  The guild I was with seemed shocked as if it was new to them and almost completely wiped when they just tried to run RZTW to camp and the decorins came.  I assume this always happens, and I seem to remember the monks then splitting him off trivially.  But I can't remember who stayed and who pathed back or what not.  But I vaguely remember that either the decorins or RZTW himself did not path back, while the other did.  Then again I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Other than that I'm pretty sure the strat is solid and a took a lot of time putting it together and putting the maps together as well.  I just had those few uncertainties I would like to clear up if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
1) Dont bother curing it unless you are tight on healing, we never had issues with MT dropping on RZtW. Have the curer nuke instead.<br />
<br />
2) Think timer starts at 95% - seemed so, but not sure.<br />
<br />
3) Always used the thether and a DA bard, but probably not needed.<br />
<br />
4) No time limit on triggers afaik, and we always aimed to do the raid like this: wait a few minutes on killing triggers if repops are more than 10 mins away. Then we started the event and killed TZ, repops, VZ, RZ, etc.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the exact timers, was only an issue for us on VZ. I'd estimate it to around 25 mins.<br />
<br />
5) Easily split by a monk or two. Ogres walk back I think.<br />
<br />
- someone probably has more accurate info just thought I'd help if I could :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhisz</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, and if I'm not mistaken RGC removes 45 curse counters? Just in case you plan to stick with curing it :)<br />
<br />
Remove Greater Curse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2880&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It removes 9 curse counters from up to 5 slots.  RZTW is a great fight to show this example of counters and slots.  Say you're the MA, and you get both the proc (18 curse counters) and AE DoT (9 curse counters) landed on you.  Then, someone casts Remove Greater Curse on you (9 counters x 5 slots).  Say the Proc is higher on yer buff list.  it removes 9 curse counters from that &quot;spell slot&quot; (leaving 9 to go), then it looks for any other slots with curse counters.  It finds the AE DoT, and removes all 9.  Now its got 3 slots worth of cures left.  Finds no more slots, RGC ends.  Now the RGC'er casts again.  It cures the Proc now since it only has 9 counters left.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense.  But each &quot;Slot&quot; is basically one buff when considering cures.<br />
<br />
But yea if Sedition procs like mad, its useless to cure it.  But i'm sure I can spare the 1-2 RGC'ers from our heal team if it will help.  Our heal team is great.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response though, it helped a lot.<br />

<br />
 Have a bard playing ae fire/psalm and get a circle of seasons or whatever to resist the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I thought, that 450 AC debuff is a huge hit against the MA.  I think a semi-decent comparison would be a relation between The Avatar of Water and the &quot;a burrower parasite&quot; from The Burrower event in The Deep.  Both mobs hit for 1100, both flurry, both unslowable.  However AoW has a much higher ATK rating than burrower, so burrower hits like a kitten.<br />
<br />
I figure a similar aspect goes with RZTW.  When you tank him with 450 less AC, he's going to be whacking you for max dmg a LOT more often.  So I figure it kinda like this.  Hypothetically if the AoW buffed himself every 30 seconds with an ATK buff that would be the difference between him hitting like burrower and the real AoW, would you not attempt to dispell that buff?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response though, just really needed to know if Sedition proc rate isnt insane so that it is a viable option to cure.  You say one RGC'er is sufficient?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with 450 less AC, Rallos is still not as hard to tank as Bertox or Mithaniel Marr.  Don't sweat about Sedition too much.  Sweat about your raid's DPS and add kiting instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well his atk is pretty high so my guess would be you're probably going to be getting hit for max anyway but then really his dps isn't that high anyway, looking at about quad 650 in defensive.  Your explanation of curse counters and slots is wrong I'm pretty sure.  Seditation will be cured with one cast of rgc.  Have a shaman or paladin do it while clerics should be in the rot and druids doing a mix of charming and nukes.  <br />
<br />
Charming is a good way to make up for a lack of dps, of course it has it's risks too.  About rgc I'll just put out two examples that come to mind http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2823&amp;source=Live takes two casts of rgc to cure(full 54 + another 18 from another cast)   http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3019&amp;source=Live  Takes one cast to cure.  So pretty sure seditation is one also.  The AE is a low resist check -100?fire so most should be able to resist it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way RGC works is it removes 45 counters in 5 sets of 9.  Basically the cure has 5 attempts to cure it, each time removing 9 counters at a time.  It will definitely reapply the 9 counters to a debuff if that one has more than 9 counters.  The way it's set up means only that it's allowed to cure more than one spell at a time.  <br />
<br />
This is different than say, Abolish Poison (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=97&amp;source=Live), which only has one attempt to cure 36 poison counters.  AP can only cure one spell per cast, because the 36 counters are lumped into the one set.  The upgrade on the other hand, Antidote (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1525&amp;source=Live), has 4 attempts to cure 64 counters (4 sets of 16), so it can cure up to 4 spells.<br />
<br />
Ex: <br />
<br />
You get 3 debuffs.  One has 3 counters, another has 21 counters, and the third has 8 counters.  RGC will apply it's 1st set to the first one, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th set to the second one (as 18 won't cure it, but 27 will), and the 5th set to the third.  This will cure all three in one cast.<br />
<br />
You can test this yourself with a shaman using the spell Pure Blood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3693&amp;source=Live).  Have them slow themselves (16 disease counters), then cast 2 of their low level poison DoTs on themselves (Envenomed Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=434&amp;source=Live) and Tainted Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=277&amp;source=Live) are good for example).  Then cast Pure Blood and it'll cure all three.<br />
<br />
So yes, Sedition will be cured in one cast.  I now return you to your regularly scheduled strategy discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. We don't bother with it, but I think RGC is 36 counters?<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Seems like first wave is slightly longer than subsequent waves. I haven't timed them but seems like around 60 to 75 secnods on first wave, then a little under a minute on subsequent.<br />
<br />
3. We don't move the raid from TZ kill spot any more. Monks have no trouble single pulling VZ. Can't answer how, never seen it done.<br />
<br />
4. I've never tested triggers. We were always told 2 minutes so we always kill both immediately. Off tan one while raid kills first one then do second one. 20 minutes on TZ&amp;VZ, 20 minutes on RZ and 20 minutes on RZtW. We've done this so many times and timed out on all levels over the last year, for various reasons.<br />
<br />
5. He has been spawning with Decorin for a few months now. they run slower than him though so a good monk can run RZtW to a wall, then have someone tag him in when he is split from the Decorin. The Decorin will eventually add into the fight but not immediately if careful. Worst case scenario, once they spread out a little, have some kiters pretarget and kite them if enchanters can't mezz them. Keep in mind once you agro RZtW and are running him you probably have started timer to adds respawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  We run him to the NE corner by the port box, then pull the Elites and kill them.  Then we start in on RZ, it's not a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">20 minutes just seems like an awfully tight restriction to AE Xloc to port stones, SoE everyone (Yea MGB FoE, but you know theres the 6-10 who load slow/etc), Corpse summon if needed, go get charm pets, and make sure everyone is setup on the wall.<br />
<br />
But to add to it with pulling the decorin and killing them before RZTW? That's gotta be tight.  How long does it take you to do that, and was that how you did it first time? Or after you had a few under your belt so more people were comfortable with the script?<br />

<br />
20mins is a lot of time to AE TL, MGB FoE outside ... kill 3 trash mobs and drop into the pit to prep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">20 minutes just seems like an awfully tight restriction to AE Xloc to port stones, SoE everyone (Yea MGB FoE, but you know theres the 6-10 who load slow/etc), Corpse summon if needed, go get charm pets, and make sure everyone is setup on the wall.<br />
It's more than 20 minutes for RZTW.  I think the final step gives you 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
On last week's RZ, we spent 5 minutes TL/summoning &amp; moving RZTW, 2 minutes moving to pit, and 11 minutes pulling pets for enc/dru/nec.  We did not rush through it.  We did not kill the decorin/elites.  RZTW died around the 22 minute mark.<br />
<br />
The first wave of adds is definitely delayed a little bit.  It happens about 70 seconds after the MT engages.  After that the waves are 50 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
It is pretty easy to judge how the fight is going based on that first wave.  If RZ is above 80% when the first wave spawns, then you are probably going to fail.  If RZ is below 70% when the first wave spawns, then you are pretty much assurred to win.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After running RZtW for the first time (we won too!), yes, I have to agree, focus on your adds that will come during the last stage. Our CC group was heavily burdened and I actually had to area taunt a whole stack of them that was coming to our RZ melee area (my kiting didn't last long though haha   :p  )<br />
<br />
Also, the PP has a SHORT timer. So, make sure non invis casters have means to get potions asap, and that all mobs still in the pit are trained away from RZ's corpse and PP in the center. Worry about CR later, if all shit hits the fan, you can still log off and CR some other time, since the corpses pop in the graveyard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't get cured much, used BBB to tank RZ for once (was always worried about losing agro with 1handers) on our last go, and he only did 600dps to me. So yeah, it's not too big. DO NOT DUAL WIELD on him, he WILL do like 180 unneccesary DPS to you.<br />
<br />
Mage weapons on pets was huge for us. Normally, we'd have 4th wave spawna round 5-15%, and the adds would be coming for us. Our last one though, we used all pets possible, gave them double mage weapons, and we plowed him. I think he was 40% by the time wave1 popped, wave2 spawned around 8%. Don't forget to haste those pets either.<br />
<br />
A trick I use on TZ/VZ - Have melees click haste off. All that extra unneccessary DPS. You want slow static damage on both of em from max melee, both fights need to go slow. VZ isn't so mean as long as he doesn't get a solid flurry on ya.<br />
<br />
Having a solid CH chain that can keep your MT up after disc falls also seems to be a very good idea, 1 more warrior with disc can kite then. We have warriors set up to rush out and intercept wave4 if it spawns to prevent adds from rocking us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since my guild is pretty ranger heavy, we have times of massive burst dps if all 9-10 of them use their Trueshot discs.  That is, alone, about 2500dps just from those rangers.  Now, ever since Sony revamped the collision system, cornered mobs can now be pelted like no tomorrow with arrows.  Since we're also blessed with a solid chanter crew (Our druids charm for this even too), we push ~10 rangers + ~8-10 charm pets on Rallos Zek, all for some horrendous dps.  <br />
<br />
God I wish I tanked for that time we killed him so fast though.  I would have actually had a parse if I did.  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We gave it our first attempt ever last night.  Things went alright for the most part and for most of TZ.<br />
<br />
We did TZ very well until about 20% when the paladin bombed and we ended up pretty much zerging TZ into the ground.  Made a little changes for that to be cleaner next time.  We had to rez about 10 people because of it.<br />
<br />
We pulled VZ and I had greatly underestimated the effects of his proc/ae.  Granted the tank was looking west for him regardless of my /shouts that he'd be in SE corner and didn't engage him til late.  But we're just going to use our Bloodfrenzy/Hategiver (both Anger 3'd) tank or a pally tank next run.  Should smooth that out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would the fights with TZ/VZ have to be slow?  TZ just toss a good paladin in and there shouldn't be problems with aggro.  Just have everyone bag any stun/hate/debuff weapon or if you really need to, pulse your attacks.  VZ a warrior can tank or a knight again if you want to.  Max range isn't as crucial on VZ.  The main pain about VZ is all the flayers that spawn with him especially if you had a bunch of deaths on TZ.  Main thing about TZ is just having clerics way back using SR(too close possible chance of eating the ae on inc before the knight is able to turn him to the side) and people not standing around near TZ until the knight has him locked.<br />
<br />
I guess I'd agree about saying your casters have to start off slow but clicking off haste is unnecessary.</div></div><hr />
