<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I'm wondering, does augmenting a non-magic weapon (such as fine steel) turn the weapon &quot;magic&quot;?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask this is because I'm considering carrying 2 Anger 3 augmented fine steel daggers for the rare cases that I want to do some pre-aggroing on mezzed mobs beyond incite, and knowing that non-magic weapons will not &quot;awaken&quot; mezzed mobs, I'd like to build up a nice lead using anger procs.  Fine Steel daggers, because delay is the lowest I know of for non-magic weapons.    Anyhow, the problem is that Anger 3 is pretty damn expensive from a cost perspective, and I don't want to waste AP's, so I'd like to know if anyone's tried to aug non-magic weapons, particularly with Anger and if the weapon remained non-magic or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Frod</div></div><hr />

Dang, that's a good notion.  I have no answer, but Cold Slimestone Fragment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42003)  is only 20 points at Guk for a quick and cheap experiment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could you also use this on rooted mobs via the camp out the snarer method?<br />
<br />
Just um....wondering?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I doubt adding an augment would change a non magic weapon to magic since as far as i've seen, no augments are flagged magic. <br />
<br />
As for the idea though you'd be surprised how many mobs you can still hit even without a magic weapon =) I'd be careful before you start swinging away thinking you'd be safe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is Anger3 Aug Magic?<br />
If so, weapon should turn into magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nah,<br />
<br />
You can hit mezzed mobs with no magic, but a lot of mobs are immune to non magic weapons.   It's easy to find out which ones by taking a swing prior to mezzes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also if you triggered a proc on a mezzed mob wouldn't that wake it up ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm still going with the bang for the buck being on rooted mobs $$ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only damage would wake up the mob.  A proc with zero damage (like anger 3) would not wake up a mob.  To test it you can use incite on a mez'd mob, won't wake it up =)<br />
<br />
One test you might want to do Frod, is just make sure that no damage because of immune doesn't wake them up, just to be sure.  Unless you already know that, in which case I'd like to know for sure.<br />
<br />
Very nice idea, if it works I'll probably go through with it also heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you have that many pts frod your glad to try it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ldon mobs dont require magic though atleat as far as i have encountered, good idea for pop stuff though. if it dosent make them magic. wouldn't a low delay weapon be better though higher chance to proc per swing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At max dex you will proc at 2 ppm on 99.999% of weapons.  Delay of the weapon doesn't change that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats very true, but, it is relative to the delay. Say you swing something every second, well, thats 60 swings a second, so a 1/30 chance to proc on the first swing. <br />
<br />
Now say you swing something that hits once every 15 seconds ( weighted axe ), thats 1/4 chance to proc on the first swing, only its a hella long wait before you swing number 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For Frodlin's purposes, delay is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Venr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I added the 20point aug from guk to a rusty broadsword, it didnt become magic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nice, thanks Venr.<br />
<br />
Also, low delay is preferable for me, since the swings themselves produce aggro (ask any Enchanter who's done Rathe Council), as though they landed for full, so low delay will generate a good deal of &quot;potential damage&quot; aggro, as well as the procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Venr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">low delay will generate a good deal of &quot;potential damage&quot; aggro <br />
<br />
Not necessarily, if you look at the thread on melee aggro (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=18154&amp;highlight=melee+aggro) on sk.org aggro per swing is heavily influenced by the dmg bonus on a weapon, you may be better off augmenting a 2hander</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The real issue though is this:   Is there a non-magic 2 hander that has a dmg/dly that will exceed the per-swing aggro generated by dual wielding augmented fine steel daggers?   If I'm not mistaken, the answer is no, as the Reaver is now Magic, and I haven't seen a non-magic weapon that can pull it off, at least theoretically.   Non-magic 2-handers are generally crapola.   The other thing which wasn't covered is the lack of a damage bonus in the offhand weapon (obviously since SK's can't dual wield, this wasn't covered), and how &quot;potential damage&quot; is calculated on the offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">side tracked oh well, just for hussar<br />
<br />
no one refutes the 2ppm, just simple math though 60 seconds min delay aloowed by log 1 second lvl 65 natural tripple max of 180 swings 180/2 = 90 1 in 90 swings procs or 1.1%<br />
<br />
take a 51 delay or @2.5 second same as above 72 attacks /2 = 36 1 in 36 proc or 2.7%<br />
<br />
instead of saying 2ppm can say it 1.1% chance to proc per swing or 2.7%. higher the delay the greater chance to proc on a swing.<br />
<br />
nothings changed except the way its stated.<br />
<br />
had the goal been to get a anger proc fast as possible a higher delay weapon would provide a better chance to proc on the first swing. aka getting slowed and removing all haste before rampageing with a earth shaker.<br />
<br />
ok back on track<br />
<br />
very interested to hear your results frod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Venr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well looking at the thread it took 29 swings from a fine steel great staff to out aggro 4x terror of thule but it took 134 swings to do it with a 3/20 dagger so even assuming you get twice the aggro because you can dual wield its better to use the 2 hander</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My point is, what does it matter?  He will get 2ppm.  If I understand his intentions properly, then delay won't matter for this situation.  I am assuming that he is speaking about using this on a mez'd mob for an amount of time, not just a few swings.  I make that assumption based on the fact that he is considering procs, which never proc when you want them to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Before you blow the points you should test it on the mobs you normally fight. You would be surprised how many mobs don't require magic weapons to hit them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Frod, I am guessing maybe Rathe Council in question?<br />
<br />
In theory, augmenting fine steel should give you the desired effect, and Frig, he is talking about hate augments, so a non damage proc would not break mez.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, I was thinking Rathe + Mezzed time mobs, and some others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Edone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">swarmer piercers from DN beetle traps 10/19 lore/nd not magic would be good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">several of the weapons dropped in LDoN adventures arent magical either as well as having decent damage and include (minimal) stats. they also look better than a FS dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm considering carrying 2 Anger 3 augmented fine steel daggers for the rare cases that I want to do some pre-aggroing on mezzed mobs beyond incite, and knowing that non-magic weapons will not &quot;awaken&quot; mezzed mobs, I'd like to build up a nice lead using anger procs <br />
<br />
Wow thats a cool idea.<br />
<br />
Easy test is against a ghoul...they are non magic immune and pretty easy to find.</div></div><hr />
