<br />
The subject? Knights (paladins in particular) constantly wingeing on about my oh-so-shiny raid role and how it justifies making me the red headed step child of Exp groups.<br />
<br />
They tell us it's the trade off for tanking boss mobs conveniently forgetting that defensive doesn't exist until the mid 50's, do none of them comprehend how much more we gave up to be 'the tank'? Are they so spoiled that they can only think me, me, me?<br />
<br />
How many times in their careers did they root or snare a mob so that they could make it to the zone out safely, how many times did LoH save their and their parties asses, how many times did they kill the green mob that forced you to run to the zone line cause you couldn't catch the little f**ker when it ran, how many times did they kill a mob solo that would've kicked your ass straight to bind point, how many times did they invise past a mob whilst you prayed to god and trained the zone, how many times did they have to wait around feeling useless whilst we waited, able to contribute nothing til some other guy took pity on us and sow/invise/EB/whatevered us, how many times did they stand and die because there was never any choice in the matter, how many times did they grit their teeth and make the unbuffed unassisted naked corpse run, how many times.....<br />
<br />
Well, you get the picture. :p <br />
<br />
As to the raid role thing, have they never really looked at their abilities or what? With so many options available to them I can only think any knight who can't find something to add to a raid is a lazy biatch who doesn't make any attempt to find himself a useful role, they sure as shit have more options than we ever had....<br />

You cannot say a class is balanced because we have one high profile raid role.  You cannot use that as an excuse to say we should not be balanced for exp groups.  I have zero desire to play alts whenever there is not a raid.</div></div><hr />
