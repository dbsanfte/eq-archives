<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carnatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow mellon thumpers!<br />
<br />
I am looking for an indepth explaination of each of the warrior AA's including GoD AA's. Information like:<br />
<br />
What exactly does this AA do? <br />
How is it calculated?<br />
How do the different levels advance as far as cost of AA points?<br />
<br />
This was I can determine which is the best bang for the buck.  There is a lot of advice on &quot;take xx before taking yy&quot; but until I see the statistics it is all just opinion, and we all know what opinions are like... :)<br />
<br />
I am curious about the AA's involving HP specifically, but all the others as well.<br />
<br />
Here are some quick questions incase the documentation is not already availble for someone to link.<br />
<br />
What does sturdiness cost schedule look like?  4,4,4, or 4,6,8...<br />
<br />
Which of the HP AA's will give the greatest effect to total?  <br />
<br />
The mitigation and evasion AA's are very useful, but when folks evaluate one warrior against another, they basically look at HP and AC, so I want to make sure I choose AA's wisely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sturdiness is 100 hp per level, the cost scales by 4 each rank, so 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 == 60 aa for 500 hp.<br />
<br />
ND is 2, 4, 6 AA and appears to be greatest bang for your buck. Plus it gets your archtype title out of the way.<br />
<br />
What I did was play with magelo, giving myself each AA, and calculating out how many hp/aa I got. Provided magelo's calcs are reasonable (which they seem to be) I came to the conclusion that the best HP order was:<br />
<br />
ND3 Sturdiness1 PE PD3 Sturdiness2-4. YMMV.<br />
<br />
Mitigation AA's help a bunch, but you're right people only ask about hp/ac so they're not much good for e-penii comparisons / getting groups.</div></div><hr />
