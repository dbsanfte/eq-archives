<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Better combos? <br />
<br />
Looking at the following:<br />
<br />
CoF / Heavy tooled weapon Belt<br />
<br />
SBC / Heavy tooled wep belt<br />
<br />
RBB / Pernicity Cloak<br />
<br />
CCoM / pernicity cloak / heavy tooled belt<br />
( ---^  Obviously better but WAY expensive )<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look for the combo which maxes haste and stats you want, generally hps and AC.  that being said, CoM, Belt and Pernacity would be your best bet.  SBC should'nt be in consideration due to low haste value on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a similar dilemna too. I chose to go with a Fierce Heraldic helm, Hiero Cloak, and a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rubi Girdle, Iksar hide Cloak, and Cowl of Mortality.  You'll thank me when your stamina is capped.<br />
<br />
That weapon belt is WAY too expensive for 10 stamina that's gonna get thrown away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can raise the kind of plats needed to buy a CoM, then you can just put off your purchase a little while and get a way better combo. Seriously, once you get to the point where you are spending 100k+ then you might as well go all out.<br />
<br />
Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
Cloak of Flames<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
<br />
That will last you forever, or until to the EPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;CCoM / pernicity cloak / heavy tooled belt&quot; <br />
<br />
Helm of Rallos Zek/Pernicity Cloak/Heavy Rubi Girdle (leave the tooled weapons belts for the monks who drool over it) and Silver Bracelet of Speed or Woven Shim Choker.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's what I'd do.  First, throw out anything that's less than 36% haste, don't give up haste for anything.   Then just add up the AC and HPs (including hps from STA if you're not maxed with buffs) and total cost.  Then decide which combination gets you the most bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guess i've grown far too attached to my custom velious crown to even consider a Helm of Rallos Zek anymore hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really don't see what's so great about that Cloak of Greater Pernacity. It just seems like an alright cloak that's overpriced. What am I missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's also a new 31 percent haste belt from Veksar that's very easy to get with 9 AC 10 STA 30 HP. Soulscream Belt is what I think it's called. That's what I'm wearing atm till I can get a new haste item. I was wearing a CCoM before, but then got an AoW helm from the guild bank and now I can't give up the UV and high AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">IMO Hiero cloak &gt; Pernicity cloak.<br />
<br />
Sure you get 6 STA and 2 AC for the 25 HP, but it's so easy to max STA now that the STA is wasted anyway. In most cases raw HP &gt; STA HP. Plus, you can get the heiro cloak cheaper on my server anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;What am I missing?&quot;<br />
<br />
That it's deceptively expensive.<br />
<br />
All you really need to buy is the gold-tipped boar horn these days, if you're not flagged for tactics.<br />
<br />
Rest of it is very easy to get on your own for free.<br />
<br />
Making it, at least on my server, much cheaper than a Heiro cloak.<br />
<br />
If you're going to just buy the cloak outright, I'd say Heirophant's Cloak is the way to go.<br />
<br />
But I ended up questing Pernicity (which I flipped around into 3 Valorium rings), and got much more bang for the buck (not including the good trade).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cloak of Flames, Heiro Cloak, Heavy Rubi Girdle.<br />
<br />
dont even look at raw stam ... look at raw HP, more Raw HP &gt; Raw stam, as stam is easy to cap with buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I could probably go for another haste item.  I'm useing an RBB (31% haste), but they're not exactly the greatest despite being rather expensive.  <br />
<br />
Back slot is out of the question though.  Well, at least for a long, long time.  Gotta love quests sometimes! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I decided to go with Back haste as well.  Took some work but I think it pays off in the end.  Mostly because you can shoot for a 100hp back item with high end haste (Cloak of the Fire Storm) but there aren't any belts with 100hps+high end haste that I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mandragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mine: Helmet of Rallos Zek/Cloak of Greater Pernicity/Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt.<br />
<br />
Doubt I'll really change it out much; my STA rarely gets maxed, so it still matters to me.  The difference between 34% and 36% haste isn't enough to justify buying a CoF or losing the HoRZ; that may change once I can manage to acquire something at the high-end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When you're dealing with 305 sta, how many ppl don't have issues maxxing it?<br />
<br />
Sure, if you're maxxed or close to it raw hp are better, but don't make the trade off too early...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When you're dealing with 305 sta, how many ppl don't have issues maxxing it? In most cases the difference in total STA from 3 slots is not going to justify taking a hit in haste % regardless of whether you can max STA or not. Plus, don't forget that you can get 80 STA from a shaman so you really only need to get 225 STA to be able to max it.<br />
<br />
For the sake of having a good comparison, here are the stats from the combos we are talking about:<br />
<br />
Back haste				<br />
	HoRZ/CoF/HRG	HoRZ/CoF/HTWB		<br />
AC	90		77		<br />
HP	235		220		<br />
STA	19		25		<br />
Haste	36%		36%		<br />
				<br />
Head haste				<br />
	CoM/Hiero/HRG	CoM/CoGP/HRG	CoM/Hiero/HTWB	CoM/CoGP/HTWB<br />
AC	51		53		38		40<br />
HP	210		185		195		170<br />
STA	17		23		23		29<br />
Haste	36%		36%		36%		36%<br />
<br />
Waist haste				<br />
	HoRZ/Hiero/SSHB	HoRZ/CoGP/SSHB	HoRZ/Hiero/BD	HoRZ/CoGP/BD<br />
AC	75		77		75		77<br />
HP	200		175		205		180<br />
STA	23		29		24		30<br />
Haste	34%		34%		31%		31%<br />
While the Heavy Tooled Weapon Belt and Heavy Rubi Girdle are pretty close in stats, when you look at the combo it becomes pretty obvious that the HRG is the superior belt. While you gain 6 STA with the HTWB, you lose 15HP and 13AC which is not really a good trade off.<br />
<br />
Also, as you can see from the comparison, going with a CoM for haste is a bad idea for a warrior. You are giving up a ton of AC for little to no gain in STA/HP. If you want 36% haste, CoM is not the way to go.<br />
<br />
So that leaves us with back or waist haste, like the original poster was asking. The stats are a little closer here, but Helm of RZ+CoF+Heavy Rubi Girdle still comes out on top by a pretty large margin. You lose 4-11 STA, but in exchange you get at least 2% haste, 15ac, 30hp.<br />
<br />
BTW, I didn't include the Loyalist Shield of Honor because it is a pain in the ass quest and the shield is NO DROP.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that if you can't afford a Helm of RZ the comparison changes pretty dramatically and the CoM becomes a much better option. However, the difference in price from a CoM to a HoRZ is small enough on most servers to justify saving the extra plats to get the superior combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Helm of Zek<br />
Cloak of the Fearsome / Cloak of Thorns<br />
Girdle of living thorns / Belt of dorf slaying<br />
Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying.<br />
<br />
That combo is teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Back is the way to go.  Period, mostly for long term thinking, you want to look to eventually getting a 40% haste item that has at least 100hps on it.  Now, the easiest of these to get are Cloak of the Fire Storm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6311) and Silver Braclet of Speed (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6096).  Now, you can make a case for the Feeliux's Cord of Velocity (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6269) but in my opinion it's much easier to complete a Doz quest than it is to take out Vulak.  I personally went with the cloak because we have a ton of melee in my guild and everyone wants the bracer.  I figured I'd go ahead for the cloak and I was the only one.  So, I completed the cloak quest before anyone in the guild had finished the bracer.  Now, if you have the choice of a CoF/HRG I would take that so that you already have a nice hp belt when you move up to the Cloak of the Fire Storm.  My next goal is a better belt as that I traded my RBB for a back haste item so I had to take whatever hp belt I could easily come by.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What are the prices of this stuff on your servers?<br />
<br />
For me, the helmet is not really even an option.  Almost never find it for sale, and last time it was certainly over 200k.<br />
<br />
Prices are around:<br />
CoM 120k<br />
CoF, SSHB 80k<br />
RBB, soulscream 50k<br />
(dunno what BD is)<br />
Hiero, CoGP 15k<br />
HRG 40k<br />
HTWB 120k<br />
<br />
At these prices, CoM/CoGP/HRG is around 175k (less than the helmet alone), but HoRZ/CoF/HRG is well over 300k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">BD is broken drive belt (PoI drop 31% haste). Your server is a more extreme difference than mine, but even at your pricing, how much is the difference between 175k and 300k in the grand scheme of things anyway? If you can save up 175k, then you can surely come up with another 125 to get the better combo.<br />
<br />
On my server:<br />
CoM 120k<br />
CoF 60k<br />
SSHB 60k<br />
RBB 30k<br />
BD 35k<br />
Hiero 12k<br />
CoGP 15k<br />
HRG 25k<br />
HTWB 100k<br />
HoRZ 200k<br />
<br />
So a HoRZ+CoF+HRG = 285k<br />
<br />
The best option usuing a CoM would be<br />
Com+Hiero+HRG = 157k or CoM+Hiero+HTWB = 232k<br />
<br />
But, like I said - when you are spending 157k or 232k, doesnt it make more sense to save up the other 128k or 53k to get the considerably better stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thank you Garoar, I was not aware of that item.  I try to keep up as much as I can, but I took a several month Hiatus from the game right after PoP came out, so I'm still trying to catch up on items.  I have no idea where that belt comes from, but I've got a decent idea it's a bit out of my reach at the moment.  However, it sure gives me something to look forward too :)  I still stand by my earlier statements though.  If you're looking at buying a haste item like an RBB or a CoF, then belts like that one are way outside your range (as far as what you can collect with your guild).  However, Dozekar is a joke these days so his quests are fairly easy for a mid level guild to accomplish.  That is if you aren't on the Rathe server like me.  Doz is a rotational mob so my guild only get's to take him down once every couple of months.<br />
<br />
That's just my mentality, I really dont' dream of the PoTime items, I look for the next closest upgrade for my gear, then shoot for that.  The next hardest mob for my guild etc.  I dream in little steps.  Keeps me from setting the bar too high and getting discouraged.  It also keeps me focused on my guild as a whole.  I've been in this same guild since I was level 20 and the &quot;grown up members&quot; were still dreaming of the new quest armor dropping in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, I wish this discussion came up about a month ago.  I had more cash lying around for some reason.  Once I get cash from some of my outstanding items, I think I'll try auctioning to see if anyone's willing to sell the helm that's not using the bazaar.<br />
<br />
After my server transfer last year, it took me 3 or 4 months to get my gear in order, and the biggest expense was the CoM.  Saving for a HoRZ would have added another 2 or 3 months onto that.<br />
<br />
Well, at least it gives me something to think about other than a stonewood bow that I know is going to keep dropping in price after I get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hang in there for a HoRZ Este. I had never seen one sold before last March, now there is always at least one up for sale. As more guilds hit the elems, more and more RZ helms are getting banked for Raex's. Coupled with the fact that AoW is a chump these days has made the helm much more common. My server is about to get it's 4th and 5th elem guilds soon so I imagine that AoW loot is going to be flooding the market even more that it has already. Player made elem items are all read 50% less than they where 2 months ago, so gear options are going to increase a ton for the non-uber warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The Loyalist Shield of Honor is one of those yes and no deals.  The shield itself is freaking awesome, but boy is it ever a pain in the ass to finish!  If you have the patience and dedication of a Theravada Buddhist monk, then by all means do this quest.  Expect roughly 60-100 hours doing this quest, 90% of which are waiting for a single damn vampyre to spawn.<br />
<br />
However, the quest is not hard and is easily attainable even by a Kunark level guild.  On top of that, the more you camp the Tenebrous Castle waiting for Heratius Grolden to pop, the more you will see the 4 named coteries pop as well which all drop cash loot.  So, in the end, you're basically doing two things at once.  You're questing for a badass back wearable shield and you're saving up for a good item to buy at the same time.  <br />
<br />
In the process of doing this quest written by Satan himself, I think I made about 35k overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">counting on finishing dozekar quests is crazy heh, the cloak is sweet but just not something i would count on getting. the symbols you need to finish the quests after u get the tears(the good ones are rare) are also rare. the symbol droppers are 7 day spawns too. dozekar is nice to do no doubt, but we found out hes not the way to try and equip a guild. after CoF, there really isnt an easy upgrade for back haste, no matter what guild you're in. all the items in question are sellable so not like future upgrades really matter anyways.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt sweat it too much, hopefully you use your cash to get the best available weapons first, even an rbb + vallon is max haste.<br />
<br />
RZ helm isnt exactly common off AoW and normally someone needs one if it does drop, dont expect to find it much or the price to drop.</div></div><hr />

Sure, if your guild is at the level where they need AoW loot. However, many of the RZ helms that have been looted for the past 2 years+ are now being replaced with Raex's helms. I don't know about your guild, but it didn't take long for every HoRZ to end up in the bank once we broke into the elems. On my server they are common in the bazaar now and the price is down to 200k. When the next 2 guilds that are about to get kill rZ finally succeed, I am sure there will be another dozen helms going up for sale as those guilds start gearing up.</div></div><hr />

If someone could please look at my magelo, seems that CoF comes out on top but wanted the opinion of you guys without thinking of the HoRZ or CoM as an option or even all those bad ass quests you talk about or POP no drop stuff... question being then<br />
