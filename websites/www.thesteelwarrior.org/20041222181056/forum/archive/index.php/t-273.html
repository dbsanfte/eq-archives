<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was following allakhazam's description, and ran into a problem here.  I tried like it said, to slowly move forward to turn in the yakmen meat, as his aggro range was smaller than trade range.  Well, as I moved forward, I got attacked, and still was out of range for trade.  Since he was aggro, I couldn't open a trade window.  So I backed off, then I ran towards him and opened a trade window before he could aggro.  Gave him all the meats, and he gave the &quot;I don't need this item&quot; line, and gave one back.<br />
<br />
I then tried talking to the gnome, but he wouldn't reply, then gave him a meat, and he also returned it.  I asked the serverwide channel, and was told to kill bloodmaw.  So I did, but the gnome still won't respond or accept the meats.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm wondering if anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, I would really appreciate it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally got it to work this way: I would run up and try to open a trade window before he attacked.  If I could do that, I would try to press trade, once again, before he attacks.  If he attacks before you hit trade, he'll just give it back.  So I did one meat at a time, finally did it 4 times and he despawned.  I assume a lull or charm would make this 100x easier, but I didn't have either available =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Annoys me that I had to camp it with a druid and just log the warrior on to loot.<br />
<br />
For stormfeather just turn your speakers up, alt tab out and browse your favorite steel warrior forum.  Click back into EQ when you hear flapping.</div></div><hr />

I spent 45 minuts this morning trying to get Bloodmaw to take my meat (so to speak)!!!  Thank you for this thread, I can't wait to try this out when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klozz</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again Hussar.  Your idea worked beautifully for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad it helped =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did:<br />
<br />
Grabbed a guild enchanter and brought her to Bloodmaw's cave.  She charmed him, and I handed in the meats.  After the turn-in, he depopped, and the gnome repopped with a new name.  This new gnome will give you the piece of map you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BabaHanz</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids also work for charming Bloodmaw.  At least, that's how I did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh can't find an enchanter on TT?  heh you just had to go to Nexus and grab one of them KEI_bots and pay them 200pp to go charm the bear; granted they own any other spell but KEI :D</div></div><hr />
