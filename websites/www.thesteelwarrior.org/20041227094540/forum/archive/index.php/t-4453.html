<br />
I do a ton of soloing, and find its a great way to get crap done around the house in between mobs while I am waiting for my hit points to climb back up to 100... <br />
<br />
I herad it said that you can bind wound to 100%?  How do you do that?<br />
<br />
Also -What kinds of items do you recommend to make your own bandages.  All I've seen is a weapon that only procs during combat, or an item that makes bandages but only has limited charges.  Is that all there is?<br />

<br />
I recommend the gauze press because it is the most convenient thing to have for bandages unless you are a mage. ( I heard the leaf that drops in chardok was nerfed ) But if you really wanted to you could make your own with the tailoring skill.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather buy bandages at that rate... any other devices?  I've never made bandages with my tailoring but I guess I could.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasco</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Embalmer's Skinning Knife pocs at level1, number of bandages per proc is one half your' level, so at level 4 when it procs you'll end up with 2 bandages, level 30, 15 bandages. Also the knife is not lore, so, you could dual wield them untill you have your' self a full backpack then switch back to your' regular weapons.<br />
<br />
As far as binding up to 100% you can't do that until you are level 57 and have a bind wound skill of at least 201. Level 57 is when you can reach that point, you will also have to have the general bind wound AA at the third rank.<br />
<br />
So to break it down, once you are level 51 and spent 3 points on your' Bind wound AAs you can bind up to 70%. Then at level 57 once you get your' bind wound skill up to 201 you can bind up to 100%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;You have to be level 51 and have your bind wound skill to 210.

<br />
The above statement is TRUE for monks.<br />
<br />
It is FALSE for warriors.<br />
<br />
As Varaho states, it's a few levels after monks.<br />
<br />
I will know the exact level if I ever get my 52 warrior up a few more levels.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
To review, the way to get 100 percent Bind wounds capability:<br />
<br />
1- Get your bind wounds skill up to 201. Anything after 201, allows you to bind wounds to 70 percent of your health.<br />
<br />
2- Get all three levels of the general alternate adavancement ability, First Aid. It costs 3 points. It allows you to bind wounds for another 10 percent of your health for each point spent. So level 1 would give you 10 percent more. Level 2 another 10 percent. And level three you would have added a total of 30 percent more health you can bind up to.<br />
<br />
70 percent + 30 percent = 100 percent.<br />
<br />
Monks get the first aid AA ability because it's a pre-requisite for one of their class abilities, Critical Mend.<br />
<br />
Warriors tend to ignore it, since in their 50s, they tend to never use bandages much.<br />
<br />
Plate tanks tend to have healers in their entourages. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all so much for your help!  You've all giuven me a lot of info to check out.  I'm bummed it has to take so long to get the 100% bind wound capability, but I'm happy it is possible at least - gives me a goal to shoot for :) <br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
Zhen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vack</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as first aid goes. you cannot bandaid till 70% til 56th level. unless you spend some AA on it. First aid at 1 point each up to 3 and that will allow you to bandaid up to 100%. <br />
<br />
This is a skill that gives you some utility if you are in downtime to mend people up. But over all not a great skill. Even with the class aa it doesnt make a huge difference on you but it is neat bandaid your encanter 10% of his health per bandaid or newbs completly to full with them<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One last thing - when you get your bw skill to 201, the amount you heal per attempt also goes up significantly.  Up until that point, you get 1/4 your skill level in hp per bind wound - so about 50 points at skill 200.  My understanding is that once you hit 201, that goes up to about 80 hp per attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know how many hp are healed with a BW from someone with allllll of the BW skills?<br />
First Aid 3<br />
Bind Wounds 3<br />
Mithaniel's Binding (2?)<br />
<br />
espec since there is rumor of them shortening the time it takes to bind wounds, this might be useful....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A sort of useless note, but I thought I'd add it anyway.  Beastlords can get to 201 skill at level 51.  (My twinklord's sitting at 205 skill at 52.)  I highly recommend getting the gauze press if you use bind wound often.  1 class one mana battery costs about as much as a peridot, which gets you 20 charges, each charge giving you 20 bandages.  400 per battery isn't bad.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceris</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did Run 3 / First Aid 3 for my general AAs.  I think I do about 80 points per bandage, which is 40 points / tick.<br />
<br />
I've powerlevelled a couple people using bandages and the damage shield from ragefire arms.  It's a neat party trick.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of you are talking about mana batteries... I'm afraid I've never used or purchased one.<br />
<br />
I'm looking at my bazaar window right now and I see a class five and a class six for sale...<br />
<br />
What are the differences between the different classes?<br />
<br />
Does the class have to do with the number of charges?<br />
<br />
Would any class work in the gauze press, or just the class one?<br />

<br />
Even if you could use type 5 or 6 I would still use type one to recharge because they are way cheaper.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend steering away from the bandaging AAs...I had planned on going that route originally, but  as my hp total got larger and larger, it became less and less of a utility and more of a waste of AAs.  I went run3/metabolism3 and haven't looked back since.  :)<br />
<br />
(I used to solo fairly often, btw, and used BW extensively up until 56 or so.  It kinda became a waste after that)</div></div><hr />
