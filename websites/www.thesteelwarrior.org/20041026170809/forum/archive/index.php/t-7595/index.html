<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How much HP?? How hard hitting? Some one told me DT every 2 minutes. and hit for 700's. Seems to me this would be like a gimp Vindi fight other than the DT factor.  Was told you need a tank rotation. Shouldnt you be able to kill him with only 2 DT's going off?? One DT from agro and one DT after 2 minutes then dead. <br />
Any info would be great. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">has a luclin amount of hp, so it will take more than 1 DT. he hits amazingly weak, only 1 healer needed for a decent tank, rampages, spawns adds whenever a person or pet dies or FDs. the event is a little more complicated than youre thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a pointer, you can do him without DT's with a certain spell~ Drops a nice mask, and good range item - worth farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What Bc said. yes shei hits for gimptastic number and if you kill him and get the cloak all the bards in your guild will love you, but it is a little more involved. Every death spawns an add which also has a retarded luclin amount of hitpoints. oh yea and the rug shei is on is a trap that casts some type of mana drain. gotta set casters up on steps behind shei have warriors on shei and everyone else kill adds. NO one but the DTed warrior can die or u will be screwed. Oh yea there is some trick to pulling the guards out of the room before you start, but I am just a dumb warrior the monks and bards know the trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all for the info. <br />
  I did have a question. Has anybody taken out this guy and offtank the adds? Much like you would simply offtank the adds on the PoV dragon and some of those other encounters that you get adds on. Or does the adds have some sort of special deal where they are hard to offtank? This encounter  at first look seems real real easy. The only thing im not liking is the DT facter along with the adds. If its just those week  robe type mobs that you take out on the way to IV and such then i would call for offtanking for shure and take out Shei Vinitras first.  I would rather be in SSRA or flaging anyway. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Experiment with the kill, learn it yourself, get a strat down and farm farm farm! atleast thats what we've done to get where we are today (not too far since were only solro flagged, but have killed everything pre-pop minus emp) /rude greenish metal droprate.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can kite the adds, offtank the adds, kill the adds then pop back on shei, you can mez the adds, you can move the adds and get summoned, etc... Shei is a good mob to have on your farm list, or atleast until all your bards have that cloak, and some of your melee the mask.<br />
<br />
Hint; Its in the spell line that comes from EC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hes talking about Color Cloud. Paladins can also stun her. As for the add trick, its to get rid of the first 4 mobs that spawn when shes aggroed. Move your raid into the north room just outside of Sheis room. Have a monk or bard or whatever aggro merchant shei, 4 mobs spawn. Grab these 4 mobs and train them to the west, fade and move raid into sheis room. Put your healers and casters in their cubbies, attack merchant shei and have a useless berserker sit in the middle of the rug to take the first deathtouch. Grats, when she spawns you onnly have one add to deal with instead of 5. <br />
<br />
I only do her when bored to try to get a cloak and last time we did her I think we had 36 people on, which was mad overkill, and we just mez mezzable adds, or have a tank TM like however many unmezzables spawn and dps her down. Shes wussy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Berzerkers to eat the DT?  Ooo, so they're the new rangers?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bah Dariuse you suck~ just give away the strats so everyone can do the encounter and start farming it non-stop~ I still laugh when I see guilds wiping with 50+ people on this event because they dont know what to do with the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">~&quot;Experiment with the kill, learn it yourself, get a strat down and farm farm farm!&quot;~<br />
Ya I was just wondering what some others did  and such. I plan on figuring out when the time comes.  Wipe and learn IMO~ Firstt ime we did AL in SSRA we wiped lol never even made it to him. didnt know about those nasty nasty traps. Now we do and he on our  timer.<br />
There is no rotating with other guilds like people do on non pvp servers. Its you get on timer and fek everybody els to keep it that way. lol<br />
Thanks again guys for the pointers. Will definatly help when we go to do this guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its 3+ years old...let it go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wiping on Shei sucks because shes blown for like what, a week i think her spawn time is. Just know what your doing going in and rape her!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">can you cast the stun any time and reset timer? or do you have to do it like a few seconds before it goes off so he's stunned when he was supposed to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can keep her perma-stunned with a couple paladins if you wanna be tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Divine aura  / harmshield will block the DT.   Stun no longer resets the DT timer and I never had any luck permastunning.  Avoid the first DT, eat the 2nd, and should be dead before third.<br />
<br />
My preferred strat:<br />
<br />
- Set up raid in hallway south of 4-way<br />
- Pull ALL the adds out of shei's room without aggroing merchant shei<br />
- Send in bard to pop 4 adds and park them somewhere (north room works)<br />
- Pull and kill merchant shei<br />
- Have an SK charge shei, warrior 10 sec behind him.  SK pops harmshield before charging, first DT bounces.  <br />
- SK clicks off harmshield and HTs shei.  Warrior AE taunts and uses furious with a big 2-hander.  By this point the rest of the raid should be set up on the dias behind shei blasting away.<br />
- Chain nuke till OOM.  Aggro wont be an issue after HT and furious.<br />
- Gasp in amazement at the crap hammer she drops.</div></div><hr />
