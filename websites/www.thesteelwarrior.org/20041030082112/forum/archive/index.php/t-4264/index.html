<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to pull Grieg without aggroing the guards around him?<br />
<br />
If not, what is the best strategy to clear (pull and split) his guards before taking Grieg himself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i beleive that greig is non aggroable until all his guards are gone, so clear those first, it takes like 5 minutes then go for greig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We tried him last night.  Our monks had enormous difficulty splitting his guards, as they seemed to have link aggro.  And they also aggrod Grieg himself, with his guards still up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ytek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its been awhile since I have done grieg but we would Pull grieg into the large room right after you port in and fight his guards in the hallway.  We setup, a rez station in the hallway and keep all clerics their. We leave all of the other casters up top, at the mini shrine port.  This is before the zone revamp, so Im not sure how out of date this strat is. <br />

<br />
Part of the challenge (for my guild anyway) of the grieg encounter is managing the spawn times.  We used to do him with about 15-18 people with crap weapons.  This was our strat:<br />
<br />
- All warp into the bottom room<br />
- kill the 3 pops in bottom room and one on stairs as fast as possible.  Start a stopwatch when the first one dies.  Repop (was) 15 min.<br />
- Pull one, two, eventually all the adds from griegs room.  1 tank on each, each tank positions them at the 4 corners of the bottom room.  <br />
- Melee spread out, beat on each equally.  They have a metric ton of HP.<br />
- Beat them all down to 10% life or so until the 10-12 min mark after repop.  Dont kill them, if necessary just tank them.  They repop in like 8 minutes i think, so you need to leave enough time to clear the room + stairs repops.<br />
- Kill them all within a minute or so of each other<br />
- Med up, kill room + stairs pops<br />
- Everyone but MT + Puller in entry room along right wall<br />
- Puller brings grieg to bottom of steps but on the stair-side of the door and FD.  <br />
- MT standing there, grieg still is dubious and not aggro.  Position yourself carefully so you're knocked straight back into the wall and grieg is pushed to the door corner.<br />
- Engage, lights out. (unless you have bard in your group and uber Fire resists)<br />
- Phone your buddy whos also there so he can tell you which way to move :p <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  Its probably unnecessarily complex for a raid force with a lot of DPS.  But back in the day this is how we did it to get a controled, relaxed grieg fight free of adds.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone on the seventh hammer will read this and go kill Grieg religiously.  Some of my guildies spot him up and want to go kill him for old times sake.  /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Weve been doing Grieg for the last 2 months and its not really a difficult encounter. I guess some strats have changed since the revamp of the zone but this is basically what we do. Weve done this with as few as 22 people, so not a difficult encounter.<br />
<br />
Kill the two shadow masters in the port in room. Have monks pull Griegs guards, MA then tags them. You should get about 5-6 simply have tanks pick em up and kill. Grab the rest of the guards, kill. You should have plenty of time to kill Grieg now because I think the respawn is 30 minutes not 15 for his guards.<br />
<br />
The first time we did him our MA pulled (he thinks hes a monk) brought back about 8 we handled them but had a few deaths. If its your first time try to pull as few as possible, but I think its difficult to split his guards any lower than 4-5.<br />
<br />
So yes kill the guards first before Grieg. Killing Grieg is the interesting part. Its a fun fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&gt;I think the respawn is 30 minutes <br />
<br />
Woah, thats news.  I Havent done him in 6 months.  <br />
<br />
Please ignore everything about timing that I posted then.  Pull everything and kill it then use doorway position for grieg.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Post-revamp, there are 2 shadow masters in the portal room and I think 10 in Grieg's room.  Grieg won't move and can't be hurt until the shadow masters are dead.  The shadow masters are nonaggressive but social, and invis themselves, so make sure your pullers have see invis.  Any feigning class can easily split them - they wait a bit before walking home and do so at different times.  Grieg himself, once he's attackable, is no different than pre-revamp, except that he actually changes into the human form when he gets low rather than despawning/respawning in human form, and is now a ranger (ooh scary).  We've done him with as few as 8 characters (NToV/BoT tower level guild).</div></div><hr />
