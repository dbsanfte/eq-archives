I have a lvl 64 troll warrior who sits at like 6.8k hp with a Kazad, Pot 9, Fo7 and a Stamina....... weapons are Copper Hammer and a Sword of Bloodsworn. Gear is decent will link it if i figure out how.......<br />
<br />
Now my problem...... I would one day love to get to lvl 70 but i am not sure what all i have to do before i get there...... I only have like 7 aa's regen and STA and i have started doing those again until i get a plan for my next few lvls.... I know i need more HP but i only have like 10-12 hours a week to play and it is only on weekends. I have thought about LDoN and I have heard it takes forever to do too. I ooc'd one time and had a lvl 70 warrior try to set me straight but all he did was inspect me and tell me i need to get 120 aa's then hit lvl 65 then do LDoN till i am blue in the face........... at my playing rate I could be 70 i about 10 years....... please send me some direction if you can...keep in mind my time is not eternal.....thanks guys</div></div><hr />

Sony blows alot of smoke up ur ass saying shit like, yeah...its for casualy gamers too.  its realy not, point of the game is to progress, see new stuff....etc...well for me anyway.  I play with a bunch of friends on the Bertox server, all with one common goal, progression, gear, and fun.  Even to show off some gear you got, i mean why not, you work hard for it, you play 4hrs a day...if not more, you wanna show it off..its like anything in life, work hard play hard, get rewarded hard.  my advice bro, and nothing personal...learn what a &quot;twitch game is&quot; stick to those, cuz seriously....its almost pointless to play games such as everquest, swg, WoW, eq2 if ur only gonna play 4 hours a week.  /shrug, thats my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

The question should be asked whether or not you want to have a completely rounded character or not, though.  You could theoretically reach level 70, and not do a single other AA, but you would then be sorely &quot;under-skilled&quot; compared to the majority of all other level 70 tanks out there.  I'm assuming that you are not in a raiding guild, due to your low play-times, so you are going to be really limited on your gear options, since most of the &quot;high-end&quot; gear will be unattainable to you.  You will also be limited on some higher xp zones due to flag/key issues.  But OoW has some excellent areas for you to group in that would rival xp that you'd get in elementals/KT/Qvic.  Your best bet will probably get a group of friends that you enjoy xp'ing with, because if you aren't looking to advance your character AA-wise, etc. your selection of groups will be limited.</div></div><hr />

I have any number of friends who play 10 to 15 hours a week, and enjoy the hell out of EQ, and are able to advance.  EQ is wonderfull in that it has so many different ways you can enjoy yourself playing.  Some take more time and commitment than others, but all are perfectly valid.  Sorry, but EQ is  largely for casual players, at least as much as it is for harcore raiders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ding 66, then work AA's. Work on getting the heavy defensive AA's and AE Taunt first. After you've done that, work on getting Weapon Affinity and Planar Power. Do maybe one rank of Sturdiness until you get to about 100 AA or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fjalarr</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you are 64 now. You are getting to the part of the game where the long time players are running about. They won't keep a non-aggro holding tank around very long. The groups at 65+ levels looking to do exp/aa grindage are wanting a tank that holds aggro so that they can dish out the big damage. If you can't keep aggro then it's seeya when you grow up. Sometimes you think you are holding good aggro and really it's the group not willing to do major damage because you don't hold enough aggro. That means the dps classes are using small damage to make up for your lack of aggro. I know this sounds a bit harsh, but at these upper levels alot of players really generate major amounts of aggro using dps abilities and they really don't want to be the tank. That's your job if you can do it well enough. The clerics at these higher levels tend to be &quot;super&quot; healers so the exp groups aren't so concerned about your hitpoints as your ability to hold aggro. You might see some concern about hitpoints and ac on raids, but you have a long way(gear) to go before you reach MT for raids anyway. The most you might get is Ramp Tank or backup/off tank. If your guild is willing to gear you up(AC/HITPOINT) then by all means do your best to be the &quot;Tank&quot;. If your just looking for groups willing to do some exp/aa then get yourself some super aggro abilities so they can kill faster and you will get invites alot. The nice thing about warriors is we can make up for AC by using our disciplines alot &quot;evasive/defensive&quot;. The two things you really need are the aa's ID5/LR5, and the enraging blow on a weapon. That will place you in the competition for being a good exp group tank.</div></div><hr />
