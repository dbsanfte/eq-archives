<br />
I'm debating getting ND2, which would cost me a grand total of  6points. And then along with that... CA2, or CA1 and CS1, then moving to get AETaunt.<br />
<br />
Is it just better to go to ND3? Is CA1 or CA2 worth much, or is it CA3 that is the prize? Does the sky really rain cats and dogs?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks forthe help.</div></div><hr />

Also getting CS2 soon after ND2 might sound like a good deal but you'll have to get 6 points before advancing either.<br />
<br />
CA &amp; CS are nice, get both. CA *seems* to be better but CS helps too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I know I gotta get them both, but I was wondering if it would be more benefitcial to not &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like should I get nd3, get aetaunt then comeback for CA and CS? or should I get ND2, CA2 (or Ca1 and Cs1) and come back and finish them off after aetaunt? <br />
<br />
Or does it not matter at all, because in the long run I'm going to get em all anyways?</div></div><hr />

A fair number of knights I talk to go for some mitigation/avoidance first to be able to talk the tough shit a little better, but isnt as big an issue for you.<br />
<br />
That aside, you'll get em all anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is another question.  Do you notice much at the first level of CA? or is it something like stalwart endurance (which This is only what I hear) and only really good at the third level?</div></div><hr />

nd 3 (6)<br />
ca 2 (4)<br />
cs 1 (2)<br />
<br />
then get PE, AE taunt finish cs and ca.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ND3 is 12 points total (2 + 4 + 6 = 12).<br />
<br />
Max your ND3 first, I'd say.  The Overlords I asked about it said &quot;AE Taunt has saved more raids than level 65 has... get it&quot;.  Go back for your other abilities (CA/CS, and don't forget the PoP ones once you're the level to get them) afterwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You won't notice a change with just CA1, but your clerics likely will  once you get CA3.</div></div><hr />
