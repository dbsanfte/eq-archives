Still ouch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if 65/easy points have been nerfed too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a few level 65 easy LDoN adventures tonight.  The first time--I dinged 66 on first kill.   I got 1/2 a blue real exp for the whole adventure and 52 adventure points.  I think my group all got 50 points each and they were all 65.  On the second one, a 66 shaman was with us.  The shaman and I got 51 points each and the rest who were 65 got 49 points.  I ended up doing 3 easy adventures and have about 1.5 blues into 66.  <br />
<br />
My friend was in KT and he said it took him about 8 hours of non-stop pulling to get to 67 with a few hydra DPS helping.  He has somewhere around 11000 hp I am guessing so he isn't a gimp but still it seems like that is awfully slow leveling in KT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
KT was running about 1 % per 5 to 6 kills for me.  Single group Ikk was 1 % per 4 to 5 kills.  KT had, by 10 o'clock, over 40 people trying to exp in it =\.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the exp zones aren't gimped from hitting 66 you just need a good amount of xp.  I grinded to 67 in PoEarth and yeah it's about 5 to 6 mobs per % I think.  Not too bad imo just so used to doing aa's which take all of 45mins heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodheart</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 4 hours in Muramite Proving Grounds netted 20%. We explored a bit, though. Just a LONG level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lesiter</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hit 67 by chain pulling in PoE at the dust ring temple.  I was getting 1% per 3 kills (I'ma gnome) and it took me from 8pm to 4am to get 50% of level 66 done.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was in KT for the first 50% of my level and I was getting 1% per 3 kills there also.<br />
<br />
The best exp was in the Proving grounds in Oow at 1% per 2 kills, but I wasn't beefy enough to tank there at 1900ac and 11000hp.  Mobs were chewing through me.  Most had a 710pt proc that went off with the same regularity as chaos claws, and they had really high attack.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I picked up roughly 300hp for 66 and 67.. so figure 260hp for leveling and 40hp for raw stamina increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The HPs are nice, and I picked up the improved LR when I dinged 66.  Its pretty nice I'd say.  My guild mates were saying that OOW had some better spots for xping, like getting 1% per 5-6 kills.   I was in a PoWater group (say what you will), and it took like 20 mobs to get 1% in 66...I thought that was a little nasty.  THough I still got 2% AA xp at 66 in PoWater per mob.<br />
<br />
I figure the xp isn't anyworse than when folks first were getting 60-65.  When I was 57 and is PoI trying to level, I thought making 15-20% in a few hours was amazing xp.   Looks like OOW is the same way.</div></div><hr />

Well 67 must be a bonus HP level. At 65th my magelo was off by one HP (low) and lists me at 5522--with correction 5523. Standing in game with no buffs (and no change to stm--its in the 240s) I am at 5586. <br />
<br />
That would be 53 HP--with ND3 and PE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, that's the same calculation I came up with last night based on xping in Hate...(good to see my rough guess matched the monk board  ;) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I was estimating more like 10AA.  I went from 93% in 65 to 17% in 66 in a run through Tipt last night.  People without the expansion got about 2 AA in the same time.<br />
<br />
I think I got 84 hps for dinging 66 but my STA was still maxed.</div></div><hr />

I got over 100 going from 65 to 66 as well, and I also bought the fisrt lvl of stat increase so sitting at 315 str, sta, dex, agi. I think it's probably scaed on stamina and all the HP aa's including sturdiness. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I didn't think about sturdy 5 but if it goes up based on your naked hps that could make a difference, I only have 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crizpin</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From 65 to 66, I jumped 83 hp (23 of which was from stamina going up from 305 to 310). I then bought the stat increase AA raising my stamina to 315, and my hp jumped 23 more. So, if they keep the same hp upgrade for each level (50 before modifiers), then with the new stat cap thanks to AA (355) we should see just over a 500 hp upgrade going from 65 to 70, assuming that the hp jump is the same for each level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took me better part of 10hrs to do 66 last night.  spent about an hr in the proving grounds which was pretty good XP per mob, just the mobs were spaced so you had to keep the group moving, mob DPS wasnt significantly greater than KT though.<br />
<br />
Spent the rest of the level in KT, seemed a shame to be grinding in GoD zone while theres all these new zones to check out, but I spent over an hr LFG after the OoW group so by that stage was willing to take any XP on offer.<br />
<br />
KT seemed about 10% per hour, so anyone who thinks its slow XP has just been babied by PoP.  59 in Seb used to take 2hrs to get a blue as a hell level, and through most of the 50's a blue per hr was considered good XP.</div></div><hr />

Spent about 4 hours last night in Nobles Causeway/Wall of Slaughter and had like 4 blue to show for it. Just seems slow after being used to working on AA's.</div></div><hr />

Can't be that bad in the OoW/Late GoD zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you stick to level 68+ mobs, you can ding 70 in under 24 hours of killing. That's really not bad when you consider how long the 50s were pre-nerf. I remember not long after I got 60, a wizard decided to do 59 in one sitting. Between various Seb AE groups and a bunch of quad kiting, he took a little over 30 hours of nonstop exp to ding 60. Now THAT is a hell level.</div></div><hr />

Think we all just lil spoiled from doing aa's and the nerf of past levels.  I remember it took me a solid month and a half to get through 59, killing kazillion frogs in seb.. <br />

Yah but if we are going old school, lets hear it for dinging levels 55-60 by being the organizer of giant epic raids and stacking your group with wizzies and rogues LOL...I always felt a little guilty about that...but then considered it my pain in the ass raid leader pay for services rendered :)<br />
