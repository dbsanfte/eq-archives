<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My first post on here. Been lurking /anon for a while and finally decided to ask this question.<br />
<br />
Looking to see what might be worth upgrading for my toon. I've been playing her for about 3 years now.<br />
<br />
You can view her magelo HERE (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=488364) <br />
<br />
I am currently in a VERY small guild. Tough to assemble over two groups for a &quot;raid&quot; sometimes as of late (lots of people leaving for 'bigger guilds' these days). I tend to be our primary tank for most things. All in all I am proud of gear as it all things I have gotten on my own. I am not flagged for anything, and probaly wont be for some time. I attempted my first PoP flag raid the other night via our flagraids channel on povar. Didn't go so well and we did not get the flag due to a problem, but I did get the Honorable Longsword drop off AD.<br />
<br />
Most things for camping an item purposes would be 1 group or duo. So I end up with things I can camp myself, or /bazaar items.<br />
<br />
I currently only have 10k to spend (which is about what I can come up with in the course of a month or so), as I typically let the clerics have the loot in exp groups or whoever wants it. No greed here.<br />
<br />
LDoN is possible, but I get bored after about a half a mission. I don't have the patience for them.<br />
<br />
So my question is: Is there any upgrades I can do around 10k that would make a difference in my HP/AC? Or what should I do with my gear? <br />
<br />
Povar seems to have an inflated economy most of the time, so when I compare prices people list here it tends to be quite abit more on my server.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just as my opinion, I would try to get new arms, Cobalt have No HP, altho you can keep em in a bag for the clicky :)<br />
The IGS while they have 20ac, again, they have no STA/HP, maybe some new shoulders (Theres an easy quest in nurga for some 14ac 40hp +stats shoulders, Dingy Pauldron of Brawling).<br />
Since you have a NODROP belt and its quiet nice, and you are using your haste in your neck, I cant really think of something... you could use a good upgrade on your neck, but you always need worn haste... there are some neat armor pieces in LDoN, and you wont be able to buy that kind of armor (unless you can pay for Ornate, and even some EF pieces have more HP than Ornate, for 760 points), you can even buy a helm and put a haste aug on it, leaving your neck free for something with more HP (Amulet of Mummy Wrappings? Or that neck from GoD...cant remember the name).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fierce heraldic Shoulders and mask jump out since you have +0 HP in those 2 slots. FH legs would also be an upgrade, though not as huge as those other 2 slots. For the mask, you could also head to Siren's Grotto and camp this for face:<br />
<br />
Flawless Steel Mask (Augmented)<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: FACE  <br />
AC: 20<br />
STR: +10  DEX: +10  STA: +5  CHA: +10  <br />
AGI: +4  HP: +55  MANA: +20  ENDUR: +20  <br />
SV FIRE: +5  SV DISEASE: +5  SV COLD: +5  SV MAGIC: +12  <br />
SV POISON: +5<br />
Recommended level of 55.<br />
<br />
Has only +4 dex unaugmented. Killed her with a Bard Warrior Cleric and Wizard, all 65.<br />
<br />
Obvious earring upgrades that are past your 10K budget would be Mosquito Earring from CT, Iron Scream Earring, or Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement. (Think I put them in order from least to most expensive)<br />
<br />
LDoN can get boring, but it really is the way for family guild folks to gear up. The EF in some slots can be just as good as the more expensive north Ro since conservation of points is a high priority for folks that are not terribly enamored of it. Plus unfortunately, it's almost a given that you will have to grind some adventures in EF or S Ro for aggro augments you your weapons<br />
<br />
Grats on the Longsword :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks. will definately look at that face piece...thats been a major complaint of mine is my face piece (same one since I was level 20)<br />
<br />
the quest in nurga might be a little tougher seeing as how I'll have to get some guildies rounded up for what looks to be longer then 30 minutes (lol)<br />
<br />
thanks for the info though. :) :)<br />
<br />
edit: looks like that mask gonna be pretty tuff to muster the forces for as well.. gonna chat with the guild tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree about the mask and shoulders. FH would be an upgrade (and within your budget, I think, especially if you or any of your guildmates can smith it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">will check /bazaar this evening for FH mask and shoulders... FH getting harder to find in there these days..but thankfully price on it seems to have come down. I paid 25k for that BP and saw it two days ago for 7.4k  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I say try and get into a nice guild and start raiding. An &quot;uber&quot; oldschool place to get into for fun and decent items is ToV =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While that's a suggestion... it's not really an option for me. I've known the people who have stuck in this guild for quite a long time. They are family to me. I have a few RL friends in there as well. I'll stick with them to the end. We tried things like &quot;Ubah&quot; Mob night... NToV (when we still had enough people) but interest was too low to keep them going. We only managed to do NToV 2, 3 times maybe...with no drops worth mentioning. We managed to take down a few mobs on the nights... but  nothing of mention.  (was really hoping we would have succeeded at Lcea Katta  :(  )<br />
<br />
Pretty much my gear is dictated by farming plat (boring) and buying in /bazaar so mostly I look at droppable gear.<br />
<br />
Thank you though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even with 1 group, there are plenty of things you can do to obtain upgrades not only for you but for other people in your guild.<br />
<br />
For starters, try camping to obtain a Copper Hammer of Striking, main hand that one and off hand the Sword of the Bloodsworn. It'll be one of the best dual-wield combos other than trying to obtain a Sceptre of Destruction or Blade of Carnage.<br />
<br />
See if you can try going PoStorms and hunt the Diakus in the Desert area to complete the Diaku Emblem Quest for alternate access to PoTactics, farm the mobs in there for Highly Polished Gem, and find a Jewelcrafter to craft Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.<br />
<br />
Try getting into BoT groups, farm named and if you get Ornate drops, you can either swap them in to obtain Ornate upgrades, or sell the Ornate molds for cash to upgrade your other slots.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just woke up and kindda groggy, but those are my suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nurga's mobs are mostly green, some Light blues, thats why the quest is easy :) If you have a healer friend, you can go down there and break havoc :D<br />
<br />
About the face.... ever tried a Eyepath of Plunder? Maybe you get lucky with the Stormfeather spawn as I did :D (Quest starts in Iceclad if you wanna look it up).<br />
<br />
Highly Polished Gems drop off Ogres in Tactics, not seen many of em, but I really never hunted much in Tactics outside the pit :)<br />
<br />
Ornate bracer in BoT drops off Thangbrand in Mid sands, Ornate gaunts drop of a mini boss in Water, left side of rooms as you enter the wing. Those are some &quot;easy&quot; obtainable ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">magelo updated to reflect some changes made when i logged in tonight.<br />
<br />
i upgraded the cobalt vambraces to fierce heraldic.<br />
<br />
sold some stuff and bamboozled my way to get my hands on the gold boar horn... picked up other items..had wires in bank (didnt even realize it) and did the cloak of greater pernacity quest. leaves me broke but with some decent upgrades... shoulder and face are my next priorities...<br />
<br />
eyepatch of plunder is a quest i am working on... lodi just keeps getting burned down before i get there... grrrrrr<br />
<br />
also am putting broken hynid claw in range slot when not using bow for a little extra boost to ac/hp and str</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd lose the neck item and get something better.  You're going to need something better than 21% haste pretty soon, and it's overall the weakest slot statwise I see in your magelo currently.  You could either camp a soulscream belt in veksar and  sell your neck item and get something with more AC/HP, or just haste aug one of the items you're wearing if you dont see an upgrade for them coming any time soon.  Mosquito leg earrings should be obtainable if you can drag some friends to CT.  The champs crown could be replaced with LDoN armor pretty easily.  My champs crown was the last piece of champions I had, and I finally replaced it with a helm from EF LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">would like to thank everyone who made suggestions. Has allowed me to reeavluate my gear. 3 years and I still dont know much on her IMHO! lol<br />
<br />
got things to focus on for now on her so the help has been much appreciated. <br />
<br />
(and can I say that camping the Dire Wolf Stalker in IC is a PAIN without a tracker...running around for hours! lol Thats the thing most things I need to be able to do on my own.)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion on the soulscream and mosquito, unfortunately dragging the people I know to those zones is almost impossible. Veksar we did too much in the past (where i got my legs) and CT we've never been able to do past the entrance quickly enough for people to not get bored and leave.<br />
<br />
Time constraints are the biggest issue. Which is why I have to stick with things I can achieve on my own or duo'd with a 65 shammie when he's not on PoP raids.<br />
<br />
once again THANK YOU :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just checked your magelo again and snooped. Looks like you're dropping some AA points into Innate Stamina. I'd really really really advise against this. The most benefit you'll ever see from each of those AA is 12 HP. Save up and start working on your Natural Durability. you should get anywhere from 75 to 100 HP for the first level alone.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion even as a stop gap item for the face would be a Death mask of Elysians. 12 AC and 35 HP.<br />
<br />
You said you are a tradeskill junkie. How about getting a Solstice earring? % Ac % sta and 55 HP, and perhaps you can make all the gifts yourself so will only cost you farming time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also not sure what classes you have other than the Shaman to group with, but there is also a nice haste belt that drops off a named Seahorse in Siren's Grotto <br />
<br />

<br />
 Has 4 agility unaugmented. Also get veliuos quest gems and spells dropping often in there, so maybe can talk your guild into making a night of it.<br />
<br />
I'll stop pimping SG now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For haste you could try taking a group and camp the junk beast in plane of innovation.

Haste: 34% <br />
<br />
Has a fairly large loot list according to Alla's and I dont know if this is common or rare cos it was the 1st time I have killed him, but its a nice belt and he drops gear for alot of classes so shouldnt have too much trouble getting people keen to help.<br />
<br />
While you are there you can collect some bits for the clockwork talisman quest - 50hps and 10svall in the neck slot is ok, no AC but its always good to have a gate clicky in your bag once you upgrade.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic legs will be good once you can afford them, and for the face slot either Fierce Heraldic or for cheap you might be able to find a Grob Hide mask, or miniature nose ring (which drops in Siren's Grotto off a named that can spawn near zone in if you want to try camping Abividad's belt.<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice is great value too, about 3.5k to buy the bits (on my server anyway) for a 55hp earing is pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You might want to try to do the Draconic Pauldrons quest. There are four MOBS to kill in WW just to the left of the zone in from SG. Only thing is I think you have to be ally with SS.<br />
<br />
Trong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Also check Cazic Thule.  Sewers drop a nice belt (and FT3 caster/priest boots).  Avatar pyramid has some nice earrings, plus amy chain mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sucana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You might want to consider taking a solid group to xp in the plane of mischief.  There are several plate items in the ac:20 hp:50 and minor stats range, and more importantly, there are also items for everyone else.  It will be challenging but rewarding once you learn how to handle the zone.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule has a few nice item spots, and siren's grotto has already been mentioned.  Oh, soulscream belt in veksar, also.<br />
<br />
If you can manage ldon, everfrost malevolent greaves are the cheapest major item, and everfrost also has anger augments and some minor AC augments.<br />
<br />
edit: I forgot about chardok-b, the halls of betrayal.  I got a ring, bracer and range slot item there.  My other ring is the coldain quest (ninth ring), which is quite doable with minimal help.  <br />
<br />
NOTHING on my magelo profile is beyond you.  I obtained it all with a single group or less.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;You might want to try to do the Draconic Pauldrons quest.

<br />
I second this suggestion, although you do not have to be ally.  I know that it is less than Ally because I had the quest stuff and was trying to get up my faction when I thought why don't I just go and see?  I went and hailed and was getting friendly answers so I went ahead and did the quest.  More like amiable.  I did this quest and still have the pauldrons.  They are AC12 or 15 and STA 15.  They are a nice stopgap until you can get something better.<br />
<br />
Alos, look into the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest.  This shield can be worn on the back and it is 50AC and +75 HPs.  It is not that hard.  The hardest part is the last mob and the hardest part about him is that he is rare.  <br />
<br />
The Loyalist shield quest starts in Katta Castellum with Phenic Dionicas.  I am almost positive you can one group the final mob, and you can duo or solo all the rest.  A good friend got me the last piece (Thanks Beralt :)) actually before I even needed it.  But, he said he was one grouping there for experience or something and the guy popped for them without them trying.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps, and one last thing.  Even if you cannot get your guild to stick around for any amount of time, but you still want to stay in the guild, seek out hunting buddies.  You can find them all over.  Befriend people, find out who people are.  On my server, one of the guys who got the Loyalist shield said they wiped on the final mob (they were average level 62 I believe) and a bunch of people they knew came and helped and brought friends.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
Bjarki</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i think the povar flag raids has had some success.  i wouldnt give up on them and its something to do if nothing else. some ppl take a loss harder than others. <br />
<br />
they have done all the mobs to get solro flagged successfully, but i doubt once solro flagged, those ppl keep doing the open raids.<br />
<br />
i didnt see the hard ldon mentioned, but if you have a good puller, these are really pretty trivial while pulling 3 ldon mobs to you camp usually spells death. ive seen 90 hp belt and ft1 90hp earring from guk hard. i believe a 90hp melee earring from nro.  someone mentioned a 90hp cloak from EF hard. cant remember what else, but hard ldon is great way to upgrade if you have a good puller or good CC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all good suggestions :) and have made me work on some things..<br />
<br />
see my updated magelo. made a nice jump in HP without sacrificing any AC so far and my sta/str are both up considerably in the process<br />
<br />
changed the following:<br />
<br />
cobalt arms became fierce heraldic <br />
mithril plated girdle became soulscream belt<br />
IGS became Draconic Pauldrons<br />
worn gold tooth became ancient mummy wrappings<br />
tribal war mask became frozen mana face<br />
<br />
all in nice suggestions by all (i modified some a little)<br />
<br />
not sure where to go now...but its a start :)<br />
<br />
was really hoping Lcea Katta would drop her mask last night... /sigh<br />
<br />
I assembled 15 of us last night for a try at her. We took her down on second try :) <br />
no mask though :(</div></div><hr />

Cannot believe this post has produced this many replies. Just look at the facts above, and one will see there is no hope. No hope at all. <br />
<br />
(1) I agree, you wont be flagged for anything in the near future. <br />
<br />
(2) With that very small amount of plat, you better start fighting over that loot and quit giving it to the clerics.<br />
<br />
(3) Your only hope for good equipment is the high end LDoN gear. If you are a warrior, this is at Tak. It's very nice gear, especially since you are not in a guild (and you aren't), and even pretty darn good when augmented correctly. This will take a few hundred &quot;normal&quot; missions to get all the gear and aug's you probably need, so if you get bored after &quot;half&quot; a mission, you wont do well in this endeavor either.<br />
<br />
(4) Maybe you should take cooking lessons for a hobby or something. You dont seem serious about EQ.</div></div><hr />

well i know this is a week old reply to my original post... but I haven't had time to stop by... I feel obligated to reply to this.<br />
<br />
1. actually I've actually finally been having luck with my server's flagraids channel, which despite alot of losses has yielded me a PoJ trial and Grummus flag... It will take some time but it's getting there.<br />
<br />
2. sorry if 10k seems little to you but it's decent for me... and since this reply and people giving me ideas on different pieces of gear, I've been able to spend time farming in twilight sea (tradeskill ingredients, decent selling items) and have actually upgraded several pieces of gear since the original post. I'm up almost 1k in HP since the original post. the point to the post was to give me ideas in whihc to work from... that goal was accomplished. And I have done this WITHOUT changing my policy on loot in groups. I farmed and traded my way with specific pieces in mind. And not only do I have the upgrades but i also now have 19k banked from which to start the cycle again with (actually saving for my first piece of ornate)<br />
<br />
3. I am in a guild. and very happy in that guild. LDoN's too me are still a casual once in a while thing and whatever random camp... sorry but that expansion is still not my cup of tea. As to my guild. It's a smaller guild... yes but I am happy there.<br />
<br />
4. 3 years. and I play to have fun with people I consider friends. end of line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I find Krek's post irritating in tone and largely unproductive in substance.<br />
The last paragraph in Bjarki's post, however, is excellent long-term advice for a warrior in your position, Tynaeya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">aye most posts had alot of good information... that has helped me alot (for anyone who has watched the change in my gear at all.) I'd say a boost of around 1k in HP since opening this thread with a boost in AC and no loss of other stats is decent..and I thank everyone here for making suggestions that got me on the right path...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jonnas Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I like how Krek said something about 'you're not serious about EQ, find another hobby.'  Things like that are what ruins games.  Your philosophical wisdom regarding EQ is then, I take it, something along the lines of 'do whatever you can to upgrade your ac/hps and aggro, and don't be concerned with having fun, this is too serious an endeavor in your life to waste it having fun' right?  It's a game.<br />

   Anyways.... I can give you a 50hp face item if you want it.  Grimling Contraption. Just find me on sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Narcy Mirrorgazer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">While that's a suggestion... it's not really an option for me. I've known the people who have stuck in this guild for quite a long time. They are family to me. I have a few RL friends in there as well. I'll stick with them to the end. <br />
<br />
I am also in a family style guild.  I'd never leave.  We have lots of numbers but not necessarily the levels.  We lost a number of ambitious or 60+ members to the more raid oriented guilds on Fennin Ro.  Recently, we joined an alliance of guilds to form a raid team.   It's been very effective for us.   The higher levels and ambitious players get to &quot;stay home&quot; and also advance through the Planes and GoD.<br />
<br />
I can't say enough good things about it.  We are surely benefiting by the host guilds strength and organization.  As more of us play within the raid team more ties are made and more opportunities at other targets are available.   In my estimation it has to be led by a strong host guild with a very effective raid leader and lots of clear communication.  Check out www.councilofdragons.com Team Dragon. There is also opportunity for members to rise to raid leads as well.<br />
<br />
Check around on your server for a chance like this if it sounds interesting to you.  Start your own or ally with someone with good groudwork laid.<br />

I never dreamed I'd get flags - I heard the horrors of open raids and thought No thanks!<br />
<br />
I've attended eleven events.  Only two failures.  One expected and one bug.  Two nights ago we got Rydda'Dar and Agnarr in one sitting.</div></div><hr />
