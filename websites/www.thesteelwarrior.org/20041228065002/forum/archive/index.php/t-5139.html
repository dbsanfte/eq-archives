Anyone on test notice any improvements to the flawed system that was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't expect to see any more melee changes until, oh, March.  Maybe April.  The Devs are currently in crunch mode, trying to get GoD out the door.  Then they will be fixing GoD.  <br />
<br />
For whatever reason, they can make multiple revamps to spells whenever it suits them, but actually finishing the melee changes has proven to be too much for them.  I count us lucky that we got the three most important components - incite, aggro timers, and mitigation boost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, they have different teams working on different projects.  That the GOD team got their product done on a certain time, or the spells team theirs, doesn't indicate a lack of attention on the part of the melee programming team.<br />
<br />
I would imagine that overhauling the entire melee system is a bit more comprehensive an undertaking than spell modifications, or even the creation of a new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShaikYerbooty</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's my understanding also, though I don't recall or have a source for why I thought that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarn_Rider</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I hope that's what made me think that then.<br />
<br />
I'm not really considering buying GoD at this point in time. Would suck if I had to buy it just to get more melee skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like casters need to buy new expansions to get new spells, we'll probably have to buy the new expansion to get new abilities beyond those that they've already shown us on Test (existing openings, monk lull ability, rogue sneak attack ability, etc.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've been busy with expansion issues since returning to work.  <br />
<br />
Shaik, my assessment of when they will get around to doing anything else was based on experience.  They always maintain this polite fiction that they have distinct teams that concentrate only on their assigned project, but as Khavok's statement shows, this is simply not true.  When the crunch is on to get an expansion out, attention to other projects suffers.  I've seen this way too many times to think that this time it will be different.<br />
<br />
I am happy to see that the openings system will probably not be going live.  I am also wondering why we haven't had a similar post from the dev team here.</div></div><hr />
