<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm on FV server so everything is tradeable. I'm picking out which weapons I want to upgrade to and needing some reassurance/input.<br />
<br />
I plan on getting a GBoS since they run around 30k-40k and for the 2nd weapon I am rather confused on. Was thinking SotB which runs 75k.<br />
<br />
My options are:<br />
SotB: about 75k<br />
OSoW: 200k, can probably get one for 150 if I look long enough<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled: was told 200k, have yet to actually see one<br />
Bloodfrenzy: rare, seen one at 300k<br />
BoC: norm is about 250k<br />
Blackout: 55k<br />
CHoS: 8k<br />
Hammer of Battle: 10k<br />
<br />
I have been looking for but yet to see a blade of ornate symbols or sword of primordial power for sale or trade.<br />
<br />
Correct me if im wrong but my thought was I could use a GBoS in prim and SotB in sec and thatll be rather nice, is the OSoW that much better than SotB to justify its price? or BoC? Are the price differences really worth it or would I see much better agro sticking with maybe a GBoS and CHoS and upgrading haste from 36 to 41?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually I was way off, all I had seen is SotB for 80+k since I filter out weapons 10k and below but in fact they sell for 6-8k =) I bought one just to toy with, what would be a very noticeable upgrade for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sword of the Bloodsworn is over 75k? On Prexus you can get it for 4k or less...<br />
<br />
Putting that aside, go for CHoS unless you have the funds for a Bloodfrenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So weird that all those no drops are sellable... how much does a Darkblade go for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No it was my mistake, SotB goes for 5k, which is best SotB or CHoS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Copper Hammer will do marginally better damage and has a few more hp. Bloodsworn proc will interupt casting mobs up to 65 vs. 55 for CHoS.  For aggro, a stun is a stun, so they are equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if BBoTE is 200k ... BoC is 250k ... and BF is 300k .... i'd go with the BF hands down if you can afford it.<br />
<br />
<br />
GBoS sounds like the best deal though ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BF doesnt sell for 300k ( if it did I'd have one ) Cheapest I've ever seen one is 600k &amp; I check the bazaar almost every day when I log on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">how about a 2hander like Anthema (sp!) EB procin' drops of Inny in hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the info guys, how does Innovator's Hammer stack up as a agro weapon, http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21865 , it seems like it would be on par with an OSoW with its ratio and higher dmg proc, does it have a procratemod does anyone know? Its not listed on the agro library weapons is why im asking, and they sell for 100-150k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I was way off, all I had seen is SotB for 80+k since I filter out weapons 10k and below but in fact they sell for 6-8k =) I bought one just to toy with, what would be a very noticeable upgrade for it?<br />
<br />
Thank god you have come to your senses.<br />
<br />
Sqar on FV as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You have seen BF for sale in Bazaar?  ummm, maybe once every month?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The big deal about the OSOW is that its proc has an AC debuff.  This angers mobs, almost as much as a stun, which is good.  The Innovator's Hammer proc is just pure damage, which mobs don't really seem to mind at all, so it's not a good choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">so is BoTW tradeable on FV and raex gear never really asked but very curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so is BoTW tradeable on FV and raex gear never really asked but very curious<br />
<br />
botw is, raex im pretty sure it is but never seen it actually for sale. Iv heard theres 15 no drop items on FV, only ones I know of that are no drop are some of the GM range items/bags summoned by them and epics.<br />
<br />
I guess im going to stick with GBoS with a CHoS/SotB and use rest of the plat to buy kizrak's BP (upgrading from bladesman's BP) for about 100k, and bank the rest for a rainy day I guess. From the feedback here it seems there wont be as big of a performance increase going from a chos to a osow as the price difference would suggest. Maybe ill try to loot a blasphemous blade of the exiled later down the road one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so is BoTW tradeable on FV and raex gear never really asked but very curious<br />
<br />
almost EVERYTHING is tradable in FV bar Epics and Shirikens of Eternity to name a small few</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And newbie notes! I've heard of people selling elemental molds in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was always curious about that, figured it was tradeable but never actually knew lol, thanks folks.   I guess ebaying on FV is probably big bucks compared to other servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Still not sure of my solution, you all have been very helpfull ruling out some of the other weapons, I am left pondering about these, its really coming down to what weapon I choose dictates how much armor I can upgrade.<br />
<br />
GBOS &amp;<br />
<br />
CHoS (7k)<br />
<br />
Blackout (50k I have seen)<br />
<br />
Frostreaver (25k how would frostreaver compare to a gbos/best above weapon combo?)<br />
<br />
After I upgraded some equipment slots I am left with about 200kin plat and older items im trying to sell. So with a 200k budget what would you do?<br />
<br />
I need a face item since I sold my eyepatch of plunder after getting kizrak gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Severely need to upgrade rings and atleast 1 earring and maybe shoulders (not alot of good shoulders out there that i know of for a reasonable price)<br />
<br />
I am trying to trade my shroud of dar brood + 10k for a cloak of flame or cowl of mortality, which is why I am holding off on upgrading helm.<br />
<br />
I could upgrade Bladesman BP with Kizrak's BP (kizrak's sells for 100k, bladesman's I could sell back for 30k+)<br />
<br />
Forgot magelo, http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1042154</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would explain a few people I have grouped with lately...I like the server because you do run into alot of people who want to roleplay a bit more than other servers I played on, the absence of no drop items was a perk for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Some upgrades I am thinking of getting that arent too expensive:<br />
<br />
Ears: <br />
Tear of the Rainmaker 24k<br />
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement 10k<br />
<br />
Face: Grimling Contraption 8k<br />
<br />
Fingers: 2x Valorium Ring of Gallantry 4k each<br />
<br />
That would leave me with 150k to upgrade BP, Helm, Weapon, and/or other</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really enjoyed my Frostreaver, I was surprised how good of aggro it actually was. A GBoS and something else likely beats it out in both aggro and DPS, however. I'd go GBoS and SotB or CHoS.<br />
<br />
  The ornate BP is probably worth it. Very few BPs out there compare to the warrior ornate at 63ac 115hp and the clicky is just a very nice bonus. The 6ac 65hp rings are surprisingly good still, just get 2 of them for now. <br />
<br />
  Basically, use the standard 1ac = 1sta = 6hp = 1 point until sta capped for now, and then convert the armor stat upgrades into pp per point. Then, spend your money accordingly. Always get an upgrade that will last compared to an upgrade that you'll likely replace soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, I think I will buy the BP, even if I get better down the road I can always hang on to it for the click when not with a shammy.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of spending whatever I have left over on aug's but I want to make sure I aug the pieces I will be using the longest. My guess would be Kizrak gauntlets and greaves, 1 kizrak bracer, tear of the rainmaker, and rallos zek bow would be the pieces I would have the longest that sound right?<br />
<br />
The Grimling Contraption vs mask of frozen mana? or similiar masks perhaps? How do you put regen vs stats? 1 regen = 15sta? 10sta? I'm not sure as a former caster I always put FT above everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I rank regen fairly lowly. Each point of regen is 10hp per MINUTE, which, although it adds up, is very insignificant. Attack items are similar, cumulative but not generally worth the cost. I don't have a number for them, sorry. Too subjective. They are NOTHING like FT, nothing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Klund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I knew they werent rated as highly as FT I thought maybe 10sta = 1 regen I guess maybe now 5sta? heh thats a tricky one. Trying to choose between grimling contraption vs mask of frozen mana...Maybe I'll wait a while see if any new masks I dont see in bazaar often pop up for sale thats better than those two. Thanks for the input though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'd go with whichever one is cheaper. 27 &quot;points&quot; vs 21 &quot;points&quot; with regen. I'd call that fairly close. The grimling contraption was over priced though, last I remember. <br />
<br />
  What level are you, btw? Recommended levels do come into play if you're not 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled: was told 200k, have yet to actually see one&quot;<br />
<br />
I think the price is closer to 300k actually ( thats what a bought it for anyway ) &amp; I must say I have ZERO aggro problems since I got it. I'd save for this if I were you cause there is nothing more frustrating than loosing aggro as a warrior.  I simply love this blade, my favorite piece of equipment I own. <br />
