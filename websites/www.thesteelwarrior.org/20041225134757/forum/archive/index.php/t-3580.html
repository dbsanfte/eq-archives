Now I know rogues have weapons like Tendonslicers, Darts of Immobility... monks have  TStaves..<br />
<br />
Do warriors have anything specifically interesting for pvp use?<br />

Eh I never use my bow enough to put Ykesha on it. Plus the fact that bow damage has been nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Run around with a big dog like the aforementioned great hammer. <br />
<br />
Too bad that Hammer is, oh, about 250k. A Windblade is decent for jousting along with this: Double Edged Ga'Nak (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65549)</div></div><hr />

Anyway, There's also utility items, such as Tash sticks, Truncheon of Doom, and that hammer that procs snare....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">plankton in pvp is situational at best.  Dathor is 99.9% useless.  The best way to use plankton is when your chasing someone, swing with plankton/kick, if kick lands flip to blade of war or a faster weapon and you will get another attack before stun wears.  As for using plankton full time, if you do your a total newbie and are clueless as to how pvp works, its just entirely too slow as any caster can sit there and tank you all day long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've played a rogue for 63 levels on Rallos and a monk for 44 so I know my melee..<br />
<br />
Just curious about gear choices, and what to expect to be capable of/wary of.<br />
<br />
Aspit? Advice?! :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">holodmer</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well unless someone is snared/rooted/blind I wont count on getting anything else but 1 round every few seconds on him<br />
<br />
there are pretty much 3 sceens posible ... Mass PvP, Group PvP, 1vs1 PvP<br />
<br />
1vs1 PvP is either Melee or Casters ... if your fighting a melee its usually just plain jousting ... the better gear wins usually (add lag and minor skills) high damage such as plankton is god given there since you it hardly matter if you have a 30 delay or a 15delay (if both have same speed, aka run speed, SoW, SoE, Selos) once a person is faster and has the better ratio he can usually dominate the figth<br />
<br />
If you figth a Caster 1vs1 it depend on his strat ... some casters stand there and tank you while they heal and nuke ... good ratio wins there ... <br />
... other casters run around and sometimes stop to nuke/dot/wahteever ... high damage wins there because they will usually start running once your kick interupts them, which means you only get 1 swing at them if they dont run once stuned you should prolly use a good ratio weapon<br />
<br />
<br />
as for mass and group PvP, it usually comes down if someone is rooted/snared/blind ... if those stick the better ratio weapon is prefered ... (unless its a REAL large figth ... then they migth not be alive for another melee swing ;)  ) if they dont stick its pretty much same as for 1vs1 ... if they run go high damage, if they &quot;tank&quot; go ratio<br />
<br />
like Aspit said its very situational aand common sense will get you though most figths<br />
<br />
<br />
as for other &quot;toys&quot; such as ToD and tash sticks ... dont waste your time on those, by the time they proc your a corpse usually<br />
<br />
gear advice ? well you played a rogue ... same rules apply to warriors ... get HP ... AC/Resists/Atk after HP (until a certain point, but its gotta be a while before you can say you have &quot;enogth&quot; HP), well make sure your MR is high enogth<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: @Aspit I dont think every caster can sit there and &quot;tank&quot; you with plaknton (esp. you) ... since there are quite a few casters (lower levels, less geared) that would die in 1 maybe 2 swings :p<br />

I didn't recommend the proc or use of the bow for the damage aspect.<br />

I was just suggesting that first he should focus on getting procs on his weapons instead of becoming a ranja :P<br />

I went insane camping the Dathor Hammer, not to mention got KS'ed a few times...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konjunktion</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you actually expect the bow damage to interrupt any sort of casting at that level, or is it all in the proc? And that Ykesha proc can be resisted can't it?<br />
<br />
If it's really that crucial, why not just use a Sturdy Wrapped Bow?<br />
