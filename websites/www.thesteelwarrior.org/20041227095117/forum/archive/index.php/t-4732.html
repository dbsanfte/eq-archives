To that end I thought I would post a simple poll in the hopes of reflecting that. PLEASE try to limit your selection to the top THREE you use. <br />
<br />
While I have no illusions about this being remotely conclusive it should be at least somewhat illuminating to see which ones are used more than others in terms of hard numbers.<br />
<br />
PS<br />
<br />
It shouldnt really be surprising at all to see whats rated 1/2/3 etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
evasive because i been fight suff with a high min and low db<br />
defencive when i fight the high db stuff.<br />
<br />

Wil be interesting to check in the future to see if/how attitudes change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right Valeris.  I pretty much used defensive or evasive and an occaisional fellstrike before the changes.  Now I use furious, fortitude, agressive, and even resistant now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mainly use Aggressive and Defensive.  Someimtes I'll use Fell Strike, but others I really don't bother with too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with unhooked timers I just dont see many of our disciplines (nearly half) being used much if at all...<br />
<br />
Maybe if they ramped up at 65 than it might be different... But they dont and from everything ive seen there are no plans to do that... Soooo while seperate timers ARE very very nice, and should be commended, I simply dont think that the independent timers in and of itself is going to make certain disciplines any more attractive or useable. Fellstrike,  Mightystrike, Resistant, Charge, Precision and Fearless will all remain relatively useless.  <br />
<br />
Thats SIX of eleven (soon to be 12) disciplines that are more or less useless.</div></div><hr />

I use Aggressive the most followed by Defensive and then Evasive.  On raids I almost always just use Defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mightystrike isn't useless. It's great for impressing the hawt cleric chicks. At least until some pansy showoff ranger starts shooting their bow...<br />
<br />
Edit to correct spelling</div></div><hr />

I used to know...and the amout I use anything other than defensive, I did not even vote for the next 2...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive, Evasive or Fortitude if I'm really in a bad situation.<br />
<br />
Never use the offensive ones - Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is no different than casters who only use a fraction of their spellbook. Most of the discs you don't see used are lower level versions of the good ones that came later.<br />
<br />
Haven't used charge since i got fellstrike and agressive, doesn't mean it was useless at 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">except that it really was pretty useless at 53.  I know that if I used anything at 53 (which was rare), it was evasive.</div></div><hr />
