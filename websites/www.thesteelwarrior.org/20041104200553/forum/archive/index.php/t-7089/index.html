<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sterix_VA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK,<br />
I am in elemental guild, usually ST. We have killed FR and Arbitor so far, so it is long way to Time but we are killling in lower planes less and less.<br />
<br />
I have used Basalt Greatsword of Protector with anger3 when tanking, it has worked very well, but could be much better.<br />
<br />
Naturally I have been looking for BoW, but due to our point system I will not get the next BoW, and we do RZTW rarely anyway.<br />
<br />
We just did our last cursed run before leaving the rotation. I got free BBotE. I already had BoC in bag.<br />
<br />
Now my problem is. I have one anger3 saved up, and I would rather use my ldon points for hp augments than countless anger3s as I dont really have time for ldons from all the raiding...I am semi-casual gamer.<br />
<br />
So, should I augment BoC, BBotE, or wait for BoW and just use my auggged Basalt or non augged dualwield?<br />
<br />
I am ALMOST inclined to aug BBotE and use it on mainhand due to increased proc rate.</div></div><hr />

You already have 2 very good agro weapons. A3 the BoC and the BBotE and you are set until you get to Time, leaving you all of your points to get armor. When you have to tank a heavy hitter and are worried about being 1 rounded due to riposte, break out the Basalt Greatsword of the Protector. Waiting around for a drop that you are unlikely to get is counterproductive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">more aggro is better, but if you're not a heavy ldon runner, i would just use your augmented 2hs and start saving up for 40hp augs for any raex armor that might be coming in.  in the long run, it will get you where you want/need to be faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you aleady have two great aggro weapons.  <br />
<br />
Stick with what ya got for the time being and get more hps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BBotE augged with A3 will not dissapoint you. That is what i use and it is extremely solid agro.  <br />
I am also of the opinion that waiting for a rare drop from a heavily contested spawn is not worth it. When and If you get a BoW it wont seem like a lot of work to get the points to aug it. Adrenaline and excitement alone should power you through enough LDoN to get your aug, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Gonna agree with this post. You've got what you've got, and not sure when you might get a BoW. If you do get one, it really won't seem like that bad to get anger 3 on it. Your DW setup is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BF/BoC &gt; BoW &gt; BBotE/BoC &gt; Basalt Greatsword (assuming all are anger 3)<br />
<br />
the BF/BoC is slightly better aggro than the BoW, id say that my BoW seems to generate about 80-85% of the aggro the BF/BoC did.<br />
<br />
if yopure not next on the list and chances are slim you shouldnt wait for the BoW, just aug your BBotE/BoC and go with that for aggro. its gonna be better than basalt greatsword as the basalt with a3 is about the same as gstaff of 4 winds with a3 and im positive dual wield would beat that</div></div><hr />
