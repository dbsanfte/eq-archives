Bro's SK Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=992632)   If I wanted to try a God trial with a group of mixed 65-70th lvl guys do you think my warrior could tank it or should I try my Brothers SK?  I don't care if I die, the attempt is the important part and we have evac ability.<br />
<br />
PS:  My normal group is able to handle alot of stuff that my Guild has problems with on raids so we are all pretty good at what we do.<br />

<br />
PPS:  My guild is not likely to progess through PoP in the near future so if we can do some GoD in group then we will feel like we are progressing.</div></div><hr />

Ya, I had considered that, but may box my Shammy in group, not sure just depended on what the rest of the group wants.  Either way I do generally 2 box unless someone really wants one of the slots.</div></div><hr />
