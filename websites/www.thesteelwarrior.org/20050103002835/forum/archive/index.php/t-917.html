<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aalanek</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After looking at this thread (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=801)  which completely makes the warrior epic an unbalanced pos (more so than before) and how they did the same to the ranger epic with Inny ... I want to know ... where's the upgrade to the epic???  I know they said they'd never do this, but come on!!!  <br />
<br />
They're not gonna stop with PoH, it's almost a sure bet they'll do Sky and Fear as well, and that's gonna muddle with more epics and make the reward completely unbalanced ... something's gotta give here.</div></div><hr />

Reports are that he can be pulled without interfering with the script in any way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, it dropped off of mini's BEFORE the revamp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... I belive that you think the hand still drops off maestro? If I'm wrong, then you don't need to read below.<br />
<br />
<br />
near the maestros building, in his sort of church spawns a gigantic hand named &quot;the hand of maestro&quot; Its a hand just like the ones in KC. He isn't hard at all. I hear he is the same toughness as the maestro pre-vamp, but I never fought him, so it's hard to tell.<br />
<br />
He lifetaps for like 175 and doesn't hit for much.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, it's easy to get too also. It's pretty much the exact same, except in a different location. The exact same mobs leading up to the hand. Past the hand in that building all the way down is the maestro along with some higher level (probably PoV golem toughness mobs), then the maestro himself. You can go right into the maestros room and watch him play his organ as long as you clear the mobs near him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't fret! It's still easy as before!</div></div><hr />

DAMN YOU VI ... for making me look like a fool ... twice ...</div></div><hr />

Maestro wasn't up, but we did kill the Hand of Maestro...2 warriors on raid and I lost the roll :(. Was first time in hate, so don't know if the Hand always drops the hand or if we just got lucky, but seemed pretty easy, only lost a Shaman that kept trying to slow too soon</div></div><hr />
