<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has been up to Hate a few times recently for various epic drops (mainly the mage drop, but looking for other drops as well).  Our camp spot is generally the steps of the Cathedral, with the doors at our back.<br />
<br />
I know that the Hand is just on the other side of the door.  How difficult would he be to take down?  Most of the membership is in the low to mid 50s.  Our higher level 'core' would include:<br />
<br />
65 Mage<br />
62 Cleric<br />
62 Enchanter<br />
61 Druid<br />
61 Ranger (druid and ranger dualboxed)<br />
60 Paladin (me - and almost certainly MT as well)<br />
59 Necromancer<br />
<br />
Would this group by itself be able to take down the Hand?  If not, what kind of support would it need?<br />
<br />
Also, we've had somewhat spotty attendence over the last few weeks for various reasons (for example, the dualboxer is on the East Coast, and I suspect Isabel had something to do with his time on-line lately).  Last time I was up, for example, I had a level 55 druid handling the healing.  If the above group wasn't there for some reason, what would be needed to take down the Hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a group of 65's can easily do hand. He has quite a lot of hp, but his dps isn't that high. (don't underestimate it tho)<br />
<br />
I've duo'd him with a SK (me being cleric)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saddorie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two groups in high 50 low 60's can handle with out problems.  Just handle his rampage properly and he is an easy take down.</div></div><hr />
