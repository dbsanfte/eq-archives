<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting an itch lately to come back to EQ. I've been away for a while and haven’t seen any of LDoN or GoD. My question is did either of these expansions add the content I enjoy doing. I like to have fun in challenging 1 group-able environment with my friends. That means never sit on ass and pull, but always keep moving instead. Revamped CT when it used to be hard was my favourite zone. I also enjoy good quests like most of newbie quests and coldain rings and epics and hate things that require useless faction pharming and huge time sinks aka Charadok quests and VT key. Raids and especially any pre PoP raids are not my idea of fun really. PoP had some fun raid content, but requirement of having zerg numbers to progress sucked balls. I mean I still raid for the gear and to help the guild progress, but I rarely have fun and especially so after encounter has been beaten more then once or twice.<br />
<br />
So are LDoN dungeons versatile and fun? Do they get repetitive quick? Are there cool 1 group-able mini raids, which don’t require uber geared (anything more then EP gear) group or unusual group make up? For example I loved killing Greig's end minis. Also is 2 boxing using one comp still an option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GoD has some tough trials where you move around alot, you also dont sit around in ldon, youre constantly moving. the EPs have alot of 1 groupable nameds but youre usually sitting on your ass waiting for them to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LDON sounds like your cup o tea, but people say it gets reptitive if done alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taneldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When LDoN first came out I didnt like it much...but that was due to being in groups with people that just outright didnt know shit about how to play there class. Biggest problem was mobs not being snared even after having a few run off.<br />
<br />
Now that i have a semi regular group of people i adventure with it is alot more fun. The loot in lvl 65 hard adventures isnt half bad and  you can get some decent stuff with adv points.<br />
<br />
It seems to get boreing after doing about 5 in a row....but we useally just switch around and do a diffrent camp when/if we get bored.<br />
<br />
As far as GoD....well I havnt done much of it. But from what i hear you can camp some nice items with 1-2 groups. Oh and some of the leadership abilitys that came with GoD are pretty neat//helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">God has some fun and challenging single group content. And the mobs are very fun they have very high dps, but low hp. Ldon can and does get booring but it is fun for the first 50 or so. And anger III and the 40 hp augs are nice so you need to do them. Also the charm upgrades are nice if you do enough of the Ldon. Also in GoD some of the regular non instanced zones are places were you need to keep moving constantly so that is enjoyable also as long as you have a decent puller<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn i said also alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;God has some fun and challenging single group content.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is THISCLOSE to becoming my new sig! Typo and all!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to agree with you on the PoP thing.  I find the encounters kinda zergy.  Well, not always zergy, but if 1 little thing goes wrong sometimes it turns into a zerg fest to survive...OR you have events like RZtW where raid needs TL'd, adds need to be suicided off...it just reeks of bad design to me.<br />
<br />
Timed events kinda suck as well.  I'd rather battle a mob not a clock..just my opinion though.<br />
<br />
Anyways, you might like LDoN in that you move around alot.  Although the dungeon designs are very &quot;pre-fab&quot; in feel.  They lack any real character for the most part.<br />
<br />
GoD provides instanced zones liek LDoN that require you to crawl through them.  Most of GoD is beyond my current gear abilities but I was able to get as far as completing the Tipt trial.  I find the low hp/high dps thing to have a zergy feel myself but I can look past it if the overall experience is a good one.  You may very well enjoy GoD.<br />
<br />
GoD has a badass quest...the BiC quest.  It basically works it's way up through the zones as you progress.  Each portion yields a reward (loot) as well as the piece for the next step.  Although some require small raid forces (maybe large forces too later on) and drop items along with the final quest piece for that portion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">GoD Tipt/Vxed and Sewers trials offer a very challenging single group environment.  Vxed is more boring, requires less movement, but all are fun to do, with sewers being by far the easiest.  LDoN normal adventures are pretty *yawn* after a while, but the hard adventures are very challenging.  Both GoD events and LDoN hards net very nice results for the difficulty (in my magelo, greaves and right earring are from vxed).  Additionally, the ability to augment items is pretty neat, though you have to do a lot of LDoNs to afford many of their augments.  Tipt in GoD drops several nice augments, as well as the boss dropping an amazing bracer for each armor type.<br />
<br />
I initially thought GoD sucked, and I was burned out on LDoN.  Then I started doing hard LDoNs, and working through GoD trials, and I am having a lot of fun in the game.  I'm glad I stuck it out, and didn't give up on the game.  GoD and LDoN hards, in addition to guild advancement, are keeping me in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another good thing about LDoN is that it pretty much forced a lot of outdoor zone only, soloing retards that didn't know the first thing about how to group in a dungeon to actually learn some dungeon crawling skills.  At first there were some growing pains, but now it's rare to find someone who doesnt know the basics of dungeon crawling.  Also, it's more realistic because there is no respawn, you just move through the dungeon and kill until you've completed the mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no respawn? Thats sweet. Thanks for you advice guys.<br />
If anyone has any other comments please do keep em comin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if u have a decent computer, 2 boxing is still viable. heck u dont even need to use eqwindows. i just run EQ twice.<br />
<br />
LDON is still reasonably fun. but i think the key is to either get in a guild or have a group of friends to do them with. pick ups can be... interesting, but sometimes not, and there allso all the time u will spend sitting around waiting for  agroup.<br />
<br />
i think its a fairly exciting time now to bein eq, theres as much to do as there ever was and there seems to be stuff coming through quite a lot. sony do seem to listen a little more than they used to.</div></div><hr />
