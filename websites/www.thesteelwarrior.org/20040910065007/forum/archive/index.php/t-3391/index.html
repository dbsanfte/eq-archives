<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, it certainly takes a good deal of insanity or self hatred to run raids, specially if you do it every day for 72+ people.<br />
<br />
It's a lot easier when you are dealing with 36- people that you know well and who work together... but then you can't do anything 'high end' until LDoN... but the 36 person raids are still pretty demanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was it a guild raid or pickup raid?<br />
<br />
Leading Vox/Naggy are the biggest pains. Guild raids aren't so bad because you know the people and they know you, but on pickup raids, everyone is the expert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only lead 2 raids in my life, 1 in SG a long time ago and 1 last weekend to PoSky... and yes, its stressing like hell :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MT *and* raid leader? ugh =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/comfort<br />
Raid leading isn't my most favorite of activities, either.  <br />
(This is why I often bug an officer to do if I'm MT.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been doing Raid leader/MT duty for awhile now, and yeah its can get stressful. Specially when people dont listen, because you have a mob to worry about keeping aggro on, and keep your raid alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One word: Delegate.  And never MT and RL unless you are the only available tank and must be the RL.  My guild has a lot of folks who handle the chores, it keeps us all sane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i made a thread just like this, having asprine and a good beer on hand works well</div></div><hr />

On top of that I was the MT screaming to no avail at least 5 times per monster to everyone on assists and positioning.  I have a headache, there's a knot at the back of my neck, and my back hurts.  On top of that my pets won't come near me with this dazed confused look in my eye; and i've grown pretty fond of this bottle of bourbon i now keep on my desk. Mithaniel help me. Baby Jebus took the rest of the year off and I'm running out of deities to help me follow this path of infinite confusion. I'm running another one next week; that is if the psych ward will loosen up these restraints a little after my partner committed me using my pets as witneses to my sudden paranoia.  Hats off to all you raid leaders; we'll all meet soon on the vanilla pudding line in the looney bin for our food while only being allowed to use plastic dull utensils.  I'm going to go take a nice long bath now and light some candles and pick up and read a copy of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary and memorize the entire thing. Just because it seems easier.  <br />

:D <br />

I know just how ya feel :D Congratulations. Welocme to watching your last semblance of sanity slip away !!</div></div><hr />

Take a look at who is shouting raid instructions in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS :)<br />

This was the beginning of the Drinal Flag Rebellion. Luckily for me I had Panamah and Trewayn to help shoulder the load.<br />
<br />
When we got done though, I would sit there for 2 hours with a gigantic Endorphin rush and usually some aspirin :)<br />
<br />
p.s. Grummus raid = 217 people in three+ raids (I.e. Three separate raid windows led by three people (Same fight), Later we did Behemoth with 108 people and then brought the gnome to the zone in and flagged about 300+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OMFG Shik, I hurt again from laughing so hard.  Going to take more aspirin now :D</div></div><hr />
