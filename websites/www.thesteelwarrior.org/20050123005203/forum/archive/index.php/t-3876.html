I finally decided to quit my shaman, and want to start a warrior. I know that the war class isn't in the best of shape atm but I hope by the time I level my new one up, the changes will be in effect. Anyways with 100k what would be the #1 2 3 4 5 things you would buy? Race, not sure probably troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">look at my mangelo if it helps. I have had most of this since around level 20 or so. I would not recomend the weapons until much later though. A simple Lamination and Frost Bringer will do very nice. My gear is a bit over the 100K mark but things might be a bit lower on your server.  Also what diety you pick plays a big part in what you can get that is good too. At 44 my cultural armor has more AC and HP than many people I raid with that have planes armor and are in their mid 50's. Well worth the investment IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I'd suggest:<br />
<br />
Take 10% of that (10k) and twink your new warrior.  That'll give ya plenty to work with, until you decide if you like your warrior.  Crustacean gear will make you a happy twink through 40 or so - after that it's considered average gear, and not suitable for a real twink :)  6/65 rings are a must of course.  For BP, I'd probably go Barbed Ringmail for HP and AC, and should be fairly cheap on most servers, no recommended level.  For head, it's hard to beat the Skull Shaped Barbute.  My kinda-twinked warrior had one until 55.  Silver Chitin Hand Wraps for haste is good - no recommended level so you get the stats.  By then, you'll know if you want to keep your warrior or not.  Basically, grab any +HP/+STA items you can without a recommended level, but don't spend too much - 10k can go far on a warrior early on.<br />
<br />
Once into your 40's go ahead and grab your cultural.  It has a recommended level of 45 or so, but the stat hits won't be too bad at 40 (could probably even do this earlier, say mid 30's).  Move up to 31% haste or better.   With that, you'll be pretty much ready to go.   <br />
<br />
What about weapons?  Basically sub 40, any 1H weapons with around a ratio of 2 and no recommended level.  Lammy or Jade mace would work just dandy for main hand.   Something under a 2 ratio for the offhand, again with no recommended level, and you're golden.  One note - the Copper Hammer of Striking has a recommended level, but procs a 170DD at level 1.  But a 1/20 weapon is the bleh.  Might consider getting one of these and using it once the ratio becomes 9/20 or so.  <br />
<br />
So basically, go cheap early, and go nuts later once you really can use the good stuff, and the expensive gear would make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off whatever race you choose make sure you worship Rallos Zek (or the tribunal if you are a barb or half elf).<br />
<br />
Most important things to start with will be your weapons and haste item.  For levelling up I'd also buy a fungi, really depends if you plan on soloing, grouping or 2boxing, but up till level 50 nothing compares with the fungi.<br />
<br />
Haste: Cloak of Flames, Soulscream Belt, Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt or Rune Bolster Belt.<br />
<br />
Weapons: For levelling up I'd grab a reaver for 2hs and some fast decent ratio one handers - Lammy, guard captains mallet and crystal spider fang should keep you covered for weapon skills until you're big enough to use weapons with recommended levels on them.  Then you'll want to pick up a Great Staff of Thunder, Sword of the Bloodsworn, Copper Hammer of Striking and either a Windblade or a War Marshall's Bladed staff.<br />
<br />
Fill up your armour slots with Fierce Heraldic or Helanic Tundra armour (depending on race / deity), <br />
<br />
65hp 6ac rings - replace with Valorium rings of Gallantry or Steel rings of earthen resilience (sp) when you make the recommended level.<br />
<br />
2ac 35hp Black sapphire earrings - replace with Mosquito leg earrings or Bloodmetal earrings of engagement when you make the recommended level.<br />
<br />
Course thats a load of money to spend on a new twink so Paladiin makes a good point - spend a fraction of what you have to twink the toon with gear that will last you to 40's / 50's and then do the big spend.  Will give you a chance to see if a warrior is really what you want to be playing and by the time you reach your 40's you should have a better idea of what sort of gear to get for yourself without asking TSW for how to make a cookiecutter twink.  Prices also may have come down by then.</div></div><hr />
