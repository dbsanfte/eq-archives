Isn't much else you can trio for drop ... <br />
<br />
You could group in BoT and get a rare dropped Shortblade of Lightning and main hand it, off hand the Split Blade.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule Fleshgrinder main hand and off hand the Split Blade<br />
<br />
Unfortunalty with out 9 other people your limited... atleast till Droga/Nurga/revamped zones/ and New Expansion<br />
<br />
You could 2hs with War Marshal/Windblade/or Great Staff of Thunder  .  All do able with 3-6 folks... slowly with less then 5 though :/<br />
<br />
You could keep hunting Veksar for the Remains super rare drop Hooked So'Knar and off hand the Split Blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And hey there.  I play CT as well <br />
<br />
/hugs and well met</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shirmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hyas 8) when ya said i could stay in veksar i was wondering if you had seen me in there the last week or so. We have killed remains 3 times now an havent seen the one sword gave the others away. Nice to meet you aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wondering if you had seen me in there the last week or so <br />
<br />
No, just did the Remains guy on zone release and never saw the Hooked weapon (((  Seen that parry weapon rot alot :/<br />
<br />
I saw you saw you play on CT when I was re reading post.  All my guild mates &quot;live&quot; in Veksar now, which is great, but I've burnt out on Remains, LOL.  Shame the drop rate and spawn rate on him is so AWFUL<br />
