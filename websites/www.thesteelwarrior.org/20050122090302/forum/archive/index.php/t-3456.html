<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HeartView</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior is now 24th and doing well.  My main is a Beastlord (about to ding 44) and have retired other mains before him (Enchanter and Shadowknight, to name two).  I started a Ranger recently and had messed with a paladin for a while as well.<br />
<br />
It seems every other melee has utility of some kind (monks can FD, rogues can backstab and do other useful but situational things).  Rangers, Paladins, and Shadowknights all have spells and provide utility as well.<br />
<br />
So, my question is simple.  Why do YOU continue to play a warrior?  I'm not trying to start a fight, only understand where people are coming from.  I love my Warrior and will continue to play him.  It seems my Ranger can keep up to him in damage output and still provide a lot more to a group, though.<br />
<br />
Just curious how you guys continue to choose your warrior in the face of all that.  My reason?  It's fun to take a beating and return it without blinking.  Can't seem to do that with my ranger, SK or Paladin.  What are your reasons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;It seems every other melee has utility of some kind (monks can FD, rogues can backstab and do other useful but situational things).

<br />
2 things:<br />
<br />
- FD will surpirse you at how little it really is utility-wise, if you play a monk past the 40s.<br />
<br />
- Rangers, Paladins, Shadowknights are NOT melee classes. Many of them like to consider themselves melee classes. But, they are not. Sure, they melee mobs. But they are NOT melee classes. All of them can do stuff to monsters at range. Warriors, Rogues and Monks (the melee classes) can not.<br />
<br />
As to why do I continue to play my warrior alt? Because he's fun. Because I like him. He really helped me get through a bad time with my main class (monk). And I never feel gimp as my warrior since I play with my friends and have fun, so it's never an issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the warrior is the only class that can truly sense the rhythm of a group (don't know anything about raids).  This is why I like to play it.  When I'm in a group I can sense when my group is ready to advance, stand down, attack, withdraw.  I like calling out the group to retreat as I hold off several mobs.  I like going down with fuggin ship!  I like to know all have survived because of my sacrifice.  I like to know that my loyalty to my comrades can never be questioned because of that.  I like taking aggro long enough for a cleric to camp.  I like taking aggro long enough for the Wiz to blast the dying mucus out of a mob.  I like to play with the purple bar.  I don't get this sense from any other class.  A sense of death is ultimate at any time and that death albeit painful is good for the whole!  That is why I like being a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but my Ranger main (56) is just not holding up very well as a tank in my standard group (rogue, 2 druids, monk, me.)  So I decided a real tank might be worthwhile, since I'm *always* the group's tank.<br />
<br />
Sure, the group loses out on the ub4r atk buffs, but it's not that big of a deal.  All of the other utility my ranger might provide can be handled by the two druids.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing a ranger at times, but it's become fairly amusing to me that my just-dinged lvl36 Barb warrior can tank the same mobs in Dulak almost as well as my Ranger at 56.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me, playing a warrior well requires a sharp mind and quick reflexes. I don't have to sit on my ass and med. And it's pure.<br />
<br />
When I play, I more feel like the skill is in me than in my spell book. More than any other class I have played.<br />
<br />
I am not saying it doesn't take skill to play other classes.. it certainly does. But for the warrior you depend on that skill the most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogmol</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, playing a warrior is simply fun for the most part, without a lot of complications of ui. Probably why i like playing a wizard, both cases, its simple, destroy that which lies before you, be it either by weapon or by spell. Not to mention, as an ogre warrior with near maxxed stamina, having enough HP to go a few battles with minimal healing is fun too.  I mean, 30% health for a casters means near death, for a warrior, it just means yer going bezerk and fixing to whack someone really really bad. :D :D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there's a few reasons... most of them bad...<br />
<br />
1) I love playing a warrior, specially one who is able to aquire magical items.  And most of all being able to enter 1 on 1 melee combat with NPCs/PCs and Win!  Of course since EQ is broken... this is mostly impossible now.<br />
<br />
2) I have already leveled a warrior and cleric to 65, necro to 54, monk to 40, and every other class to about 20-30ish.  I can't stand being a newbie anymore or starting over again.  If I could, I would restart as a Troll SK or maybe Troll BST.  Or maybe a perma AFK exp leeching loot sucking Dark Elf Wizard...<br />
<br />
3) I've got a lot of unique/removed from game items on my warrior.  Which makes it hard to retire him and play a character who's a 'noob'.<br />
<br />
4) I can't stand doing CH orders with my cleric.  Patching, group heals, etc are fun, but doing endless CH is even worse to do all the time than my cronic kick/taunt habit.  I've come close many many times to switching to my cleric as my main though... and have done it for 1-6 months during different times... and have also switched to necro as my main focus a number of times...<br />
<br />
5) Sometime a couple years ago I made a paladin, sk, and ranger... I got bored of them all for various reasons, but the biggest one was that I couldn't 'crit/cripple' with them... of course this warrior 'perk' has been mostly nullified now, and even wizards can crit as newbs now....<br />
<br />
6) I'm not a big fan of dying... thus there's no way I could play an Ench, and even a wiz/necro/etc die too much for me... warriors were some of the best 'survivors' in exp groups, other than maybe Pal/SK/Monk... but of course now days this doesn't matter anymore since you always get ressed 100% of the time, people have exodus, and on raids warriors seem to die more than anyone else...<br />
<br />
7) In the hopes that some day warriors will be more 'fun' than 'annoying' to play in exp groups and that someday we'll be able to solo again just as well as any other class, if not better.... like it was when I created this character.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
8) Oh yeah forgot about the medding, and only seeing spellbook 90% of the time thing... of course it's just another thing that made warriors 'better' that has been removed from the game in order to make spell casters 'better' and warriors even more pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forget who said this, but it pretty much sums up my pride in being a warrior:<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter what the situation, we go out and do our job.  We kick ass no matter what&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, something like that.  I've always played the warriors in any RPG/Fantasy game.  I like being the one who takes a beating.  Over the years, I've really learned to love seening mobs hit me for hundreds if not thousands of points of damage.  I really enjoy being on the point of the blade if you will.<br />
<br />
Sure there are problems now, and it can get borning (any class can), but when I've had a hard, stupid day at work, I like nothing more than logging in, knowing that I'm going to kick the crap out of something.  Now with my DPS, or with my &quot;incredible&quot; agro skills, but with my class.<br />
<br />
Hokey, yes.  True, yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
My first character ever was a warrior.  I layed him down and started a necro.  Made another warrior, and he's my main.  Since then, I've started a cleric, a chanter, and a rogue, but I always come back after about 2 hours.  It's hard to put into words.<br />
<br />
My guild just got into VT not long ago, and part of it is a sense of leading everyone, making sure everything is in the right spot and moving in the right direction, then lauging at the paladins in the tank channel. :D <br />
<br />
That, and standing up to gigantic things, taking the hits and lauging.  Fuck em all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxus Diablus</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always liked the idea of the DE warriors from the Salvatore novels.  They were always the most feared &amp; talented warriors of the world.  I also liked the inherent contradiction of being little elf who can take beatings from giants &amp; dragons, even gods.  I like doing one thing &amp; doing it well.  Finally, as primarily an xp warrior, I like leading groups.  I set the pace, and I make things happen.  Call it vanity, but I like being the focal point of a small team.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first character was a pally...back then i didn't know a thing and my corpse rotted somewhere deep in blackburrow with all the leather armor i bought from merchants on it. Next was a monk...and suddenly i wanted to play a noble knight, and made a pally(again). I started thinking pallies are extremely weak soon(and the fact that everyone else was a twink and i bought gear from NPC merchants didn't help). Then i had a druid...And actually played him to 34!!! While playing the druid i actually learned that merchants rip you off and you gotta buy stuff from other people, but i also realized that not being the best at something(not the best heals, not the best nukes, not the best dots, etc) wasn't my thing. And with crappy gear i couldn't kite stuff - and i thought kiting is ridiculously stupid and boring. Also, as i grouped more, i noticed that i wanted to be a warrior and take charge of the situation. And once i saw a barbarian warrior in nexus, in a full suit of warlord's, with a willsapper and red blade, and i was amazed by the sight. So...i ported people around Norrath and made enough money to twink out a warrior...with some crafted, a wurmslayer, and a lammy. That was my first twink, so i thought that was extremely uber. So...that's how it started. And that crafted was there until 50! Anyway...reason i keep playing is because my favorite thing to do in EQ is tank some giant dragon. It's the greatest feeling, that non-warriors can't understand. The aggro isn't a problem in groups as far as i see it...After reading many many things and learning how aggro and taunt work, etc. it's not bad at all. Only reason knights get bashed by warriors is because with them rogues don't have to evade and wizzies can overnuke like complete fools, et; so stupid people who don't know how to playtend to choose knights as tanks. And another thing...not being in charge is *horrible*. I took my 35 cleric(my only alt)  on a dungeon run with some pickup people, and i ended up doing everything. But leading the group as a cleric with no crack isn't easy, since i gotta heal them too and they don't control aggro at all. Sadly, many high level people are no better these days, i guess that's why people don't like pickup groups so much. So i guess it's tanking and leading my group, and having lots of hp that keep my playing :)</div></div><hr />

You have to be on your toes at all times using your skills that you have honed and a good bit of wile.  Finally, there is a certain satisfaction in telling the cleric to camp out or call for an evac as you go down valiantly in battle for your comrades at arms.<br />
<br />
My main alt is a druid, which was a knee jerk reaction to not being able to get in a group with my warrior after LFG for hours in my 50's.  However, now that my druid is in her 40's, she has gotten to the point where she sits and meds so damn much.  It drives me up the friggin wall.  And I have too many needs for my warrior to buy her a damn horse.<br />
<br />
Also, I started playing when Kunark came out as an expansion, and I've put in way too much time, effort, blood, sweat, and tears (not to mention pp) into my warrior to give up because of the idiots like Absor at SoE.  Basically, you are either a warrior or your not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't do well with casters so melee classes have always appealed to me.<br />

I won't reroll at this late stage in the game but sometimes I do wish I'd rolled a rogue.  But by the time I PL a rogue to 65 and oodles of AA's and get her EP flagged, WOW will be out.</div></div><hr />

I like raiding and working with a large group of people where there is a sense of accomplishment when you can advance in the game.

The most enjoyable thing for me since I first set foot in a dungeon is laying waste to its inhabitants. Even today I still go back to old dungeons and WIPE the place clean with my weapons. I get a sick kick out of ripping up weaklings with no effort. Laughing in their faces as I dismember their bodies and slit their throats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like basketball, football, baseball, etc, but when you get down to it, the most fundamental sport at a visceral level is still boxing. <br />
<br />
I like standing there taking the hits, being at the center of the action.  <br />
<br />
I like not turning off attack even when I'm low health. <br />
<br />
I like the 'last man standing' concept - I don't run till everyone else is gone. <br />
<br />
A story: <br />
<br />
A long time ago, I'm in a group in Crushbone, working the yard outside the castle - a HUGE train comes out of the castle - I engage a mob and tell my group to run, knowing I'm going to die. <br />
<br />
Pretty soon I have this massive number of mobs hitting on me, mostly yellow and red,  but I start seeing buff icons appear - there is a high level druid there for faction - now buffing and healing me.   So I just stand there all alone slugging it out.  This went on for what seemed forever.  <br />
<br />
Finally two mobs left - the druid sends me a tell - &quot;OOM - run for it&quot;.  But I just stand there and keep whacking.  Last mob drops with me at less that 10% health. <br />
<br />
Group members ask - &quot;What happened?  Did you get out?&quot; <br />
<br />
You tell your group - &quot;I killed them all.&quot; <br />
<br />
That's why I'm a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
Grouped with my friends on about day 4 of the FV server being live.  Down in the Warrens, a group of level 5-6 toons in way over our heads.  Fighting about 5 mobs.  I go down.  Land at my bind point just outside the warrens (was lucky enough to find someone to bind me there).  Run back in, naked of course, loot my weapons and start swinging.  Killed the rest of the mobs wearing nothing but my bra and my kilt.  All the guys in my group needed a personal moment after that.<br />
<br />
Even more:<br />
<br />
Same group, higher level.  Fighting for our lives in SolA on the bridgework right at the entrance.  Doing the deadly dance with a coulple goblins we didn't expect on a narrow lava bridge.  Server was only a couple weeks old, so no higher level friends to come in and help you find your corpse if you fall.  No big stash of plat to buy new gear if you lose your corpse, and there we were slashing away at a couple of goblins on a bridge too small to walk past each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always had warrior alts running around because in every other game before EQ, those are the characters I played (warrior or ranger). Sturgis is the first one that made it past the 20's, mainly because I started a second account for him.<br />
<br />
My main is a 65 shaman, and EQ is really the first game where I have played a caster before a fighter type. But I've been playing Sturgis a lot more since LDoN came out than I have my shaman. Sturgis has about 40 dungeons under his belt, the shaman has done about 10.</div></div><hr />

We were doing vindi one night, and the MT's died, so my alt warrior stepped up, clicked defensive on, and saved the night.  I always really enjoyed playing a druids. . .but I can't tell you the difference between feeling like you barely contribute to a raid (as a druid back then) to saving the raid. . .For so long as a druid on raids, I felt like it didn't matter if I was there. . .when my guild disbanded, I joined the next guild as a warrior.  <br />
<br />
I do have to admit that I became a much meaner person as a warrior.   *grin*  Also, there's the whole problem of getting your nuts bashed in every night over and over.  Maybe that's what did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started out playing a dark elf enchanter.  He kept dieing  and after losing his body in Kithicor at level 4, (he was jumped by Bixies, millions of them) I decided to make a warrior to farm bonechips in nek woods to equip my chanter.  I made something like 10k selling bonechips to necromancers who would come sit on the newbie log and buy them for 5 to 10 plat a stack.  Once I got up in levels, I found that I hated being a weak chanter who dies when the wind blows on him and I really hated looking at that stupid spell book when I medded.  Now I have decent gear, can make huge trains of 100 mobs in paludual caverns and wipe them out, and I never need to med.  Warriors are the center of the raid and its non-stop action playing a warrior.  No other class has been able to hold my attention as well.  I got my chanter to 52, my sk is 48, my ranger is 40, bst is 31, necro is 30, shaman is 23, and rogue is 20 and none of them are as fun as my warrior is.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to become a choice class for groups, so I'd actually get groups.<br />
Made a warrior.<br />
<br />
Although the class is now really really bad... I stick to it because I dont have much choice.<br />
And I still get those 3mins on a raid where I hit defensive and save the day. So yay for that.<br />
<br />
But if I could have the time to start all over, and if I wanted to actually go through all those level again...<br />
Then I'd be a shadowknight or a bard.<br />
Groups would love me, I could solo, got lots of things to do, fun... quite the opposite of the warrior :p</div></div><hr />

ah one more thing! There are only 2classes in EQ! Warriors and NON-warriors :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...........  I have a necro I played to 65.  Have a few warrior friends and we played together a bit.  Then I have a very well equiped warrior come and join our little band of merry men and women for a couple juants around Norrath.  I watched him do things I thought were impossible.  Granted I play in a very, very small guild.  Never played in a large one.  Don't raid etc.  So, I'm thinking damn that looks like a blast!  And I was right.  Nothing like pulling mobs, kicking ass, taking the death, watching friends get out alive.  As a necro, I watched them die from the floor lol while that was fun as well, nothing like saving the day.  Im level 58 now, found people in pick-up groups basically suck (another story) and my group of friends is just a bit higher and we are kicking ass!<br />
<br />
So, while it might just be the 180 degrees out from playing the Necro, theres nothing wrong with that i'm thinking.  Different needs on different days I guess.  And its always nice to be able to supplement my income with the farming he can do ;-)</div></div><hr />

 Call it a sickness:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my first character was a ranger (this was pre-velious). i didnt seem to get anywhere with him so i gave up. then i started a druid and was having reasonable fun but after the long slog to get him into the 40s (in hell level days), i just didnt see the fun in doingit all the way to 60. <br />
<br />
i also started to have a yearning to get in the face of mobs, and not worry about running oom or even having to run around when being whacked on.<br />
<br />
that left three classes. warrior, paladin and SK. i guess i intuitively picked the warrior as it seemed the most toe to toe and pure class.<br />
<br />
if you ask me why i didnt pick the others, well, there something in my nature, i guess its a RP thing, that wouldnt allow me to play a SK. as for a pally, i guess, even with the power they wield today, i guess deep down i feel they are inherently gay. i mean cmon, if your going to fight, fight. dont dick around with being a healer and in touch with your god and all that crap.<br />
<br />
and to this day, i havent really looked back. even now, when things arent going that great, i have a good guild and friends, and so ive never encountered that tedius lfg syndrome that have afflicted others.<br />
<br />
since then ive dabbled in other classes, rogues, more recently a sham, ive also started playing my druid again. but i never have as much fun as i do going toe to toe with my warrior.<br />
<br />
right now, when your starting out, it may seem hard to understand the affinity we have with our alter egos, but it is a personality thing, and i will never reroll another main. and i can tell you this much, one day, if you stick it out, you will find your self the Main Assist in a raid, up against some named mob or dragon, with a bunch of clerics backing u up and everything depending on how well you can take the punishment.  it is the raison d'etre of what we do, and if you can experience that, then you will come to understand why we are the way we are.</div></div><hr />

After a week I saw a barbarian warrior and I was drooling all over the place, cause he looked so damn cool! So I sold all my stuff and made a barbarian warrior.<br />
<br />
So I picked barb warrior because of the looks and I am pretty happy with him. I have tanked almost everything in the game, except some Time gods and I love tanking! And I dont mind dying either :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started in May 99 as a Gnomenecro and it was fine. Well there were times when I felt that there was someting missing and so I created several others in the time ( still alive Barbrogue okt 99 now retired 51 ). In December 99 I decided to blame all and I created a female gnome warrior and all ppl. said ... Bah that cant be a real tank.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I played my necro as main till Kunark. She was 47 pre kunark and take a large rest when she hitted 53. At that point my gnomish tank was level 30 and my barb rogue was 16. I then played the rogue till she was level 30 and then decided that standig behind a mob was nearly the same boring stuff than action as a necro in groups. So I digged out my warrioresse and ... yeah .. it wasnt so boring any more.<br />
<br />
Now my necro is 62 ( 120 Days ), my warrior is 65 (230 Days ), Cleric 59, Druid 57, Rogue 51 and the newest member Shaman is 49.<br />
<br />
Choose the gender = female<br />
Choose the race = gnome<br />
Choose the class = warrior<br />
<br />
Result = Da Best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are YOU a warrior? <br />
<br />
I am a Warrior because it's in my nature to always put others needs before my own. I like to do things for others and defend. I strive for honesty and justice, always and I will not stand alone.<br />
<br />
Many times in game I have been in a situation where I could just run like everyone else, or train people for my own safety, but it's just not in me to do that.<br />
<br />
I've been in BoT hub many times fighting along with other groups when people train. Rather than see a few groups of people go down with the train I try to aggro them all (with Ae taunt usually) defensive up and run them back from where they came! It's oddly fun to derail trains this way. :) I like knowing I am useful and that groups need me. (Yes, I know. I'm not as useful as I once was, and no where near as needed in groups :( ).<br />
<br />
These are the reasons I am a Warrior at heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh in the last 4 days i was able to get online i still got responses dealing with grouping :<br />
<br />
we need DPS<br />
&lt;plain silence&gt;<br />
we need a necessary class<br />
we already got a tank<br />
ur gear sucks ( exact terminology )<br />
<br />
And I'm still a warrior :D God only knows why.</div></div><hr />

When i started EQ in the middle of 1999, i made a wizard, played him for a few months and decided he was pure crap and died too much.<br />
<br />
So i made dima, figured taking more hits = the win for everquest<br />
oh, i picked RZ diety too, which warrior wouldn't worship the god of WAR? you picked war damnit, stop bitching about not being able to wear fierce and reroll ! =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belwolf</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like to be upfront in the thick of things. i love being the first one in and last one out. i save my groups by biting the dust and loose a little exp but so what healers love me and slowers who wait until 97% to cast do too (great agro weapons lol)<br />
<br />
Warriors HAVE to know about the abilities of other classes and need good timing while casters can just take it easy and that is BORING as hell. beside i like to be able to drag the corpses of casters and complain about their tanking skills lol.</div></div><hr />
