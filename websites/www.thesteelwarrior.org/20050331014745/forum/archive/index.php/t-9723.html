<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dxkj21</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60 Warrior 1 aa (EoE for dps, or CHoS and SotBS)<br />
60 Rogue 3 aa<br />
60 Monk 0 aa <br />
65 Shaman 63 aa<br />
65 Cleric 63 aa<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior @ 4800 hps unbuffed. 1300 AC (with cleric and SHM buffs, close to 7k)<br />
Rogue and Monk ~ 100 dps each depending on mobs<br />
Shaman and Cleric have decent mana and hps, AA, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our goal is to take this group from 60-65 (cleric and shaman will be getting AA during this time), and then at 65 grind through AA's until the warrior has ND3 CA3 SD3 PE LR5 ID5 (and any other AA that might be suggested before moving on to level 70).<br />
<br />
The group does not have OOW yet. We will buy that once the group hits the AA's for the Warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where should we fight? Any suggestions are appreciated. Also if there is a post somewhere with AA order for a purely defensive warrior, that would be great to have as well.  <br />
<br />
As you note above we have practically no CC, so somewhere that requires that is out. The monk should be able to pull solos in most places i imagine (he split the guards from Vindi at level 54). Looking for a few upgrades for the group as well, since we are all friends no rolling. I figure BoT might be a good place to go, and try to add a few more people to hit up the Tower guys. (sidenote: How much hps, etc for the warrior to successfully tank one of those guys?)<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

There are no trains, and the rare drops would be upgrades. If your feeling tough you could chain pull the 1st trial to the safe zone in point, everything would be single pullable, the plow to named Turepta might be hard/impossible for a few levels though. Trial 2 has patrollers at zone in and would be more annoying for you. That's the GoD option.<br />
<br />
PoP, maybe consider Tactics including the pit later, if you have access.</div></div><hr />

Did that in griegs end in about 1.5-2hrs, pretty quick exp there right now. Might go to 62 there and &quot;try&quot; BoT and see how that goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the cleric being level 65 and some good AA's and the shaman the same, you would probably be able to kill some normal mobs for some good exp.  The only possible problem I would see is that named mobs and kriegers can pose a bit of a problem.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Ok dinged 62, going to BoT tonight. Will see how it goes, and go from there I guess.</div></div><hr />

I prefer to tank them in defensive myself (65/21, CS2/CA2/ND1), but it's certainly not necessary, especially once they've been slowed.  The only thing you have to be careful of is the DD procs.  Some of them hit for 1.5k DD, and if you're extremely unlucky (like I was with Gaukr twice in one night), they can take you down hard and fast.<br />
<br />
Even with my moderate at best gear, I could tank most everything in BoT at 63.  Your gear is a little better than mine, so you shouldn't have many issues.  Some of the harder nameds will keep you on the edge though.  Good luck =)</div></div><hr />
