I don't have strengthened strikes, and it's not a crit, or crip.  Is the crit message for kick just bugged or something?

Don't think it's a bug, I noticed levelling past 65 that kick seems to have a much higher maximum damage than it used too.  Before I think max was around 120 (without Strengthened Strike), now it's not too uncommon to see 150+ kicks, with 100s quite often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spirit of might (SHM 67) and Lion's Strength (DRU 67) both are 5% damage increasers, I doubt this would explain it, plus kick has a higher max damage even without these buff, I see higher kicks all the time soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had no new buffs.<br />
Think Ill attribute it to level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was something that occurred either right at OoW release or after one of the early patches after it. Suddenly (even at level 65) you could kick for 170+. It's great when you fellstrike crit a kick for 320 or more!<br />
<br />
I pointed it out in TSW channel a couple of times but no one had much to say. So I suggest that Sony implemented Gonads!! Every now and then you land that kick SMACK in the mob's groin and BAM, extra damage. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed this too. With strenghtened strike 3 my usual max kick is 57. But i will frequently get kicks in the 182-185 range, and this is without a critical hit message.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing its the crit message that simply bugs out sometimes, but dont know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah it's not the crit message bugging out. I regularly (like once or twice a day) crit one of those big kicks and land it for over 300.</div></div><hr />

That's the highest I've noticed so far :)</div></div><hr />

I am just curious. I have always used slam being a barbarian. I know kick stuns after lvl 55 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suporma</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not noticing any harder kicks yet. I was wondering what mobs you're fighting to get these hits? It could be possible that the mobs you're fighting are weak against kicks. Since OoW came out there has been some kind of new enemy weakness system implemented that has certain mobs weak to a rogue's backstab. The new spirocs in TD for example. Perhaps these mobs you're fighting are just weak to kicks? I'll haven't fought an infernal chimera since this was posted, so I may have to give it a look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten these huge kicks against everything, everywhere. They're pretty damn rare though. <br />
<br />
As for kick vs slam... I first noticed the big kicks when I had an illusion that wouldn't let me slam and since then I've switched to kick only because I haven't personally noticed any similar magnitude slams. However I think the slam cap is still higher (I need to check that, I noticed kick has gone up with new levels but slam hasn't). If it does still have a higher cap it will land more often.</div></div><hr />
