<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone explain to me where the theory that you can only flurry after you get a successful triple attack started?<br />
<br />
I see people quoting this statement all the time.<br />
<br />
Fact: Warriors get an innate chance to triple attack at level 60<br />
<br />
Fact: The Flurry AA can be done at level 59<br />
<br />
If the triple attack theory was true than a level 59 warrior could never ever flurry, but they can.<br />
<br />
So what are the facts with Flurry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess the rumor got started from the in-game description of raging flurry: &quot;This ability further increases the chance of performing a flurry attack upon successfully scoring a triple attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Certainly not an altogether crazy assumption, given that description.  As to what the facts are...  I dunno - I don't have flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the way i'm reading it, class flurry triggers when a double is scored. it also triggers when a tripple is scored since a double always has to be scored before a tripple can be scored. now, the way i read the raging flurry AA, you get an increased chance to score a flurry on tripple attacks but not on double attacks.<br />
<br />
*edit* so in short, flurry works on double and tripple. raging flurry does not work on double but gives a better chance to work on tripple....at least that's how i understand it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whoah time out.  I remember a study awhile back that showed that Punishing Blade triples were not dependent on double attacks.  I'll have to go hunt the thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would wager that someone at SoE just had their head up their ass when they wrote the description, I really doubt there are 2 seperate flurry procs going off for flurry and raging flurry.<br />
<br />
I could do a parse, but that would require me to turn misses on.  I still should...we'll see how motivated I get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did. Going from flurry 0 to 6 didn't change the number of single attacks as a percentage, lowered the number of double attacks and triple attacks, added a lot of quads and a small number of quints.<br />
<br />
Analysis of that - flurry only works after a double attack, and can occur whether or not triple attack goes off.<br />
<br />
Testing was done without any punishing blade AA's, which unfortunately means that I can't repeat it; from what other's have said though, punishing blade also relies on double attack and is independent of any other attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the purpose of my explination i was considering flurry independently from the other AAs. i also dont have punishing blade (no decent 2h weapon :( ) so it was more of my personal point of view. <br />
the problem with testing each ability independently is that the AA in question would have to be the first one you spend your points on since you cant go back and turn off ferocity, or flurry, or PB to see the results without your previous AAs being subjected to the finilaized, over-all product. each time you spend AAs and do a phrase your moving in a liner path which prevents you from starting back at the unaltered, origional point.</div></div><hr />
