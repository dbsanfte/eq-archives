Greetings all,<br />
<br />
I am pleased to announce that the designers and programmers have decided to implement auto-fire for archery. This will be making its way to the Test Server in the next couple of days. Once it is on the Test server please feel free to post here with your feedback, and to report any problems you find with the new ability.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />

Man, it took them freaking long enough to do this.  Grats to Rangers and hell, any class that uses ranged attack.<br />

Yeah, sure would suck to fire an arrow tomorrow and still be shooting next thursday huh?</div></div><hr />

But, if you had a fast bow and weren't paying attention you would use quite a few more arrows than needed.  Sure, there isnt much difference when you think of it along the lines of 1 arrow versus 3 or 4, but that means you would run out in 1/4 the time you normally would, and that is no fun for any class that doesnt get endless quiver.<br />
<br />
Personally, I dont think any class other than ranger will get auto-fire, at least thats what I hear from my ranger friends.  They all say its going to be part of the ranger class, or possibly part of the endless quiver AA.  Not saying I think it should be limited to ranger, nor am I saying I know it will be, just saying what I heard.<br />
<br />
If they implement this AA, they need to implement the EQ AA for all classes.  Making extra arrows to pull with or extra fish-bone darts is not fun at all, nor does it add to the ambiance of the game.  I mean, come on, they put in AA's that let you never need to breathe, so why not put one in that makes you never use ranged items.</div></div><hr />

  That's why I don't use autoattack anymore  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for endless quiver i doubt warriors will get such an aa. it isnt just useful in reducing downtime making arrows. endless quiver allows you to afford very expensive high damage arrows. giving the ability to warriors would allow them to use them and seriously increase their (insignificant) arrow damage. it would go from insignificant to .. umm .. well ok maybe it wouldnt be so unbalancing )</div></div><hr />

I can put a caster mob under 95% before it gets to me with my Featherwood bow and some cheap ass silver tipped arrows.<br />
<br />
But I still wouldn't hold my breath for endless quiver.  Last I heard, they weren't happy that rangers had it, they ain't gonna be handing it out to anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, my guild could set up a ranger who has EQ/AM3 during the raids and bot him for archery without needing someone at the controls all the time.  Not like Archery takes a lot of skill on the simple fights (i.e., no AE or adds).<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm sure they were deliberating exactly that too.  Good change though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time I grouped with a Time / High end GoD ranger his melee DPS was far better than archery DPS.  I asked him what it was, he said about 240-250 melee and 170-180 with a bow.<br />
<br />
While it may not be as useful for them, I'm sure the huge number of non-Time/GoD rangers will find it very useful.  Gratz Rangers~</div></div><hr />

I dont see myself shooting many arrows anymore except to tag off the puller on inc. Anyways, would be nice to see Sony throw the rangers a bone, they need some kind of compensation  :)</div></div><hr />
