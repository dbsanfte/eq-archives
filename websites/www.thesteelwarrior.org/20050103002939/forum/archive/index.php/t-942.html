Got this from a guild page and wondering if it's real as I've never seen anything about it.  I did a couple searchs here but didn't see it.<br />

** Experience System Change - Small Groups ** <br />
<br />
With the upcoming changes to the experience system, we expect a variety of game styles to be impacted. At the core, we expect most groups to generally grow in size allowing many less utilized players a chance to compete alongside highly sought after players. <br />
<br />
In a massively multi-player game, there are many dynamics involved. And any mechanic that encourages interactivity is better for the community as a whole. However, the existing benefits of fighting in smaller, talented groups will be lessened, thereby opening the door to less skilled players. <br />
<br />
As it stands in Everquest, a players abilities have some relative merit. We will refer to this as 'Skill'. In practice, players with Skills are often more successful than those without. However, there is no way for players to know the relative skill of new party members. <br />
<br />
In the past, we have attempted to make the user experience more friendly to those with less Skill. However, as of this patch, Skill will now affect all non-raid combat. <br />
<br />
A new character statistic, 'Skill', will be added for all players. Each player starts with a base skill and players will be able to earn or lose Skill points once they have achieved 50th level. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Players with low skill will have their names flagged in red, while players with high skill will be flagged in green. <br />
<br />
- The Looking For Group window will now include a Skill filter and a sort by Skill option. <br />
<br />
- A new UI option will be available for all character buffs. A player will now be able to designate character buffs as 'Important'. <br />
<br />
- A new UI option will be available to flag a group member as 'Main Tank'. <br />
<br />
- A new UI option will be available to flag a 'Primary Healer'. <br />
<br />
- Rangers will be able to sort players by Skill in the Track window. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Some of the best items should not be used by players with inappropriate Skills. To reflect this, some powerful items will now have a 'Required Skill' and 'Recommended Skill' flags. <br />
<br />
- Groups with high skill will receive modifiers when determining loot. <br />
<br />
<br />
** NPCs ** <br />
<br />
- Some NPC's will react based on player Skill. We think this change will add exciting new content for players. You have been warned. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Changes for Players ** <br />
<br />
- Since skill is a reflection of your overall performance, players will gain Skill slowly during combat. <br />
<br />
- Melees will lose Skill if they do not hit a target NPC at least once or if more than 50% of their attacks are 'out of range' or 'cannot see target'. <br />
<br />
- When an Important buff wears off, the original caster will recieve a tell. Casters will lose skill if Important buffs are not recast within 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Players that get hit before the 'Main Tank' will lose skill. <br />
<br />
- Snaring classes will lose skill if an NPC flees more than 100 feet. <br />
<br />
- Bards will lose skill if they do not twist at least 2 songs during combat. <br />
<br />
- If the Main Tank's hit points fall below 5%, the Main Healer will lose Skill. <br />
<br />
- Int based casters will lose skill if no offensive spells are cast against a target NPC. <br />
<br />
- Whenever a monster attacks a party, any players that are more than 50 feet from the Main Tank will lose skill. <br />
<br />
- Non-Main Tanks will lose skill for breaking mezz. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Players will low skill will no longer be able to advance in level. Instead, experience awarded will be automatically applied to Alternate Advancement. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Misc ** <br />
<br />
- Vendors will be aware of player Skill when setting prices. <br />
<br />
<br />
We realize that we are, essentially, manufacturing a new caliber of player. As players, we also realize that it is the people who spend most time in groups with unskilled players that suffer the most interruptions and setup time. It simply makes sense to penalize players that are not paying attention or who have poor skill. After all, that's the whole point. <br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing how these changes affect the Test community. <br />

<br />
** Experience System Changes - Round Two ** <br />
<br />
In the test server update that occurred earlier today (server downtime), and in the PoP Zones Update that just occurred (PoP zones downtime), there were a number of tuning changes made to the new experience system and the PoP zones themselves. <br />
<br />
The effect of these changes should more closely match the intent that was described in the original message. The first round of changes, by the numbers, didn't. <br />
<br />
It went the right direction in all cases, and a number of the group size vs target type combinations were covered well. However, there were a number of cases where the target was overshot. <br />
<br />
Among these: <br />
<br />
- Not generous enough vs PoP NPCs for groups of all sizes, the smaller groups and soloists being the hardest hit. <br />
<br />
- Too generous with 4-6 man groups vs Non-PoP NPCs who can, in some cases, barely hurt their attackers. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you're interested in helping test these most recent changes, here is the list of combinations that we're trying to make sure all reward appropriately: <br />
<br />
Solo - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range <br />
Solo - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range <br />
Solo - PoP <br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range <br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range <br />
Small Group (2-4) - PoP <br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range <br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range <br />
Group (5-6) - PoP <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind while testing out group experience, as always, group bonuses only apply according to the number of people who are in range. <br />
<br />
Feel free to try out as many combinations as you can. As before, we look forward to hearing opinions on these changes via the boards and Dev Corner. Thanks very much for helping out! <br />

anyone want to actually answer the question?  how are the xp changes?  <br />
<br />
I was in a mostly full group in PoJ last night, got 20% in 56 in a couple hours.  Hard to say too much about the exp because we were moving around and rotated several members in and out during the course of the night.  <br />
<br />
I would say it was better exp than PoJ used to be, but not amazing.  I really like the idea of improving group exp though, I hope this goes live without getting watered down too much.  I really liked the idea that the exp per mob per person for a 5 man group is the same as a 6 man group, so you can add a 6th person to your group without hurting your exp, no matter who it is.  In that condition, there's no reason not to add a 2nd warrior or cleric or whatever, they can only improve your exp, even if they bring very little to the group.</div></div><hr />
