<br />
wearing them in my magelo if you want the stats shoman. too tired to do the clicking this morning. that would probably run you the full 100k you have though. at least here on drinal.<br />
<br />
you're only a few upgrades away from the point where anything you can buy to upgrade is 100k+ it's a pain in the ass for those unable to raid often.<br />
<br />
buyable upgrades i see (drinal):<br />
<br />
-bloodmetal ear (14k ish)<br />
-black plated collar (80k +)<br />
-amygdalyan chain mask (55k ish)<br />
-steel rings (50k ish)<br />
-horn spiked shoulder plates (100k ish)<br />
-boots of the storm (100k ish)<br />
<br />
lots of other stuff out there, but these are just things that i have on my list. my horribly agnostic list. hehe if only i would have known.<br />
<br />
try plotting out a chart of your gear and your obtainable upgrades. assign ac/hp (or any other stat you heavily value) a point value and rank everything on your list. compare this with the cost of the items on your server, and figure out what will get you the most bang per upgrade. working nicely for me.<br />
<br />
but yeah, you're kinda close to the point where any upgrades are no drop.<br />
<br />
EDIT: might be at the point where you want to grind out your AC augs too. i'm not at that point just yet, so don't listen to me. just something to ask around about a bit.</div></div><hr />

Once you get your non auged of those slots with 10 ac, save up for more and remove those agility augs from your gear, replacing them with 10 ac (who needs agility anyway, what are we monks?). Also, forgot to check, but if you don't have A3 augs on weapons either buy those before ac augs or start grinding EF ldon.<br />

<br />
Neck - Black Plated Collar - 50 - 80K, also there is the Serpentine Necklace which is a good upgrade for around 15K.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Horned Spiked Shoulder Plates - Around 80K  or,<br />
                   You Can get the Grand Pauldron of Study From Inside the Castle in                PoM which drop pretty common and are a decent Upgrade for free<br />
<br />
Finger - Valorium Ring of Gallantry - 5K<br />
<br />
You can also Look at Upgrading your Weapons or at least One of them to a Velium Gemmed Long Sword and Put your Anger II Aug on it ... Has decent stats and to Aug slots you can add more stats to.<br />
<br />
You can check out my Wares not that great but at least you can get a look at the Weapon and the Pauldrons, i still need a Decent Neck, Legs and Boots yet but slowly coming along ))</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's not wrong, but some people still think that ratio means a shit in aggro generation, which is why the splitblade of destruction is so expensive, yet it's an absolute garbage weapon for the only class that can use it.</div></div><hr />

If you are into quests,you may want to look into the strength of the elements quest for a 100hp shoulder item.</div></div><hr />
