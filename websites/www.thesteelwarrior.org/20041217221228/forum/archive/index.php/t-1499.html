<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm interested in asking my guild to take down Vaniki for a willsapper.  I know nothing of the encounter and zone except for what's posted on Allakhazam's.  Can anyone who has killed this mob post where he spawns, strategies for getting to him and killing him, and anything else that could be useful?  Also, if you have other suggestions for a good aggro weapon a small 55+ guild could acquire that would be great, having ALOT of trouble holding aggro in PoP zones with my current frostbringer/ornate sword of the general combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 55+ guild would need 30 40 people to hope killing him.<br />
<br />
He's doable with 1 group of 65 with decent gear.<br />
<br />
Cant say more :(  Met Vaniki just twice and i was CoHed.<br />
<br />
Hits for 300s ? And has a nasty 300hp proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">he spawns all over, a ranger is best to find him up, druid and bard track will often miss him. his spawn points are really far away from each other too, best to take an exp group or two down there and learn the area, its pretty good xp actually if u dont die. nasty habit of gating so fight him at spawn point, he does corpse camp so u can pull him away and then pull any guards close by and then pull him back to spawn point to engage.<br />
<br />
pretty nasty critter for lvl 55s, maybe 3 groups could do it but he puts out some nasty dmg for a 55 tank.  i would bet your agro problems are related to lvl pop, taunt button not working on yellow and red con mobs, and missing too much cause you're under lvl. trust me, willsapper isnt insta agro, i doubt it would solve your problem even if you managed to obtain one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jezzibell</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vaniki Doubles 200's, I would guess 40 - 50k hp, Flurries, Gates, Lifetaps as a proc for 1500dd.  <br />
<br />
He spawns in the tunnels in my experience, Go east across the zone, past spiders, past Jaled's shade.  South east of Jaled is the entrance we use, should spawn down there.  <br />
<br />
To kill the fool, 2 chanters alternating runes on a warrior in evasive, let him build agro a bit then have your dps go all out to minimize the heals he gets from lifetaps.  <br />
<br />
Its a burst fight, as he has some staying power with the lifetap proc.  <br />
<br />
Trick is really just to use rune and evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i PLed a ranger to lvl 32 for this bastard and camped him a month, he can spawn by fire elementals, waterfall or actually inside zland lair right at mouth of it. My advice is get a monk to pull him to zone since he corpse camps, have your raid or group at zone in have monk FD in arrow range and everything will path away and Vaniki will stay then peel. Have Encs and bards sieve and if your lower lvl have em rune you. Hes slowable so slow him. Make sure you sieve good and nuke hard at end. =D</div></div><hr />

I quit the game about a year ago and my guild evaporated while I was gone, I have a solid group of friends that I hunt with, 65 druid 65 cleric 65 monk 65 enc 61 cleric and me 63 warrior, I wanna try and get a willsapper as none of my weapons have any kinda proc except epic (yuck) and im too poor to buy something decent.  We just killed Lord Doljonijarnimorinar easily with the previously mentioned group.  Can that group handle Vaniki? if not what else would I need.  thx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your group should have no problem with vaniki... hes a push over once u get him slowed...<br />
<br />
i suggested killing him on spawn point b/c ive sieved him for like 20 mins and had him gate anyways before... but if you have a lot of dps you can burn him down...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slow makes him a easy pickings. He's very rare from my experience however. Finding him up was the hardest part about getting a Willsapper for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's a random spawn from apparently just about any rat spawn point.<br />
<br />
That group could probably do him, wouldn't be easy though.<br />
<br />
He also casts necro spells (ie dots like pyrocruor, hard to resist; and darkness line dot/snare, pretty easy to resist.)<br />
<br />
Sucks if he gates though.</div></div><hr />
