armor is from qvic and beyond. Named mobs seem to be about a 4 group encounter and meldstones are not an issues as you will get enough while clearing to named and if you do any exp in qvic. Look on Lucy for new armor - each armor is named after the person on the boat that has the quest for it. see some other posts on here for discussion about vadd's armor for more info.</div></div><hr />

Our normal camp is the small hill outside before the path to Qvic starts.</div></div><hr />

Ya after the Named change where they pop every 12 hours instead of every 1 hour, Meldstones drop more in ratio with armor drops-  Named used to only drop 1 piece, now they drop 2 pieces, or a mana / hp aug in place of one of those 2 possible loot slots.  More are wearing this armor now that Uqua has been made into cake.  It also used to be 2 groupable, now takes 30ish to win, and the mobs were given about 10 times more Hp lol and Area effects, thus why its ot 1-2groupable anymore</div></div><hr />
