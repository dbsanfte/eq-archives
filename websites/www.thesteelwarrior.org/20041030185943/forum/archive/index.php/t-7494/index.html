<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello....This is my first post on site. I dont have magelo set up so yall cant see what gear i have but i have a question about my weapons. I am a 64 warrior with 79 AA's. I have WA3 and half defensives done. I am currently wielding a BoC mainhand w/ anger 3. In the offhand I am lucky to own a Double Edged Stormblade. I also have anger 3 on it. I am not currently Ele-flagged as I need MM, HoH trials, Carp, Bert and RZtW. <br />
<br />
Just wanted to know how long my current combo will last me...i would rather concentrate on LDoN for awhile and flags when I can instead of running around looking to get in on a BF or Cord Spike Driver (er whatever it's called).....So...should i keep up the search for better wpns or grind out AA's and LDoN pts and flags?<br />
<br />
Also, I dont have much trouble w/ aggro atm... I was grouped w/ a Time-geared monk other day who had debuff procs and other ridiculous gear and was able to hold aggro so I'm quite happy w/ what i can do...just wondering what my next step should be....<br />
<br />
Thanks all !! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're happy, then good. 2 anger 3 augmented weapons is kick ass, one being a good aggro weapon is great. You're probably just fine right now. I'd personally suggest jumping at the chance to upgrade that double edged stormblade if you want to maximize your aggro, because the proc just isn't good aggro. You can probably focus on other stuff right now though, and worry about it more later.<br />
<br />
  On a side note, there's no reason for you to have 79 AAs and not be 65. Get 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess my question is then...how far can I go in the game with this setup? I have not tried hard LDoN's yet. I am wondering if I will need to upgrade before tanking in the ele's....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild's SA tanks fine with the stormblade and other a3 dps weapons in ep's.Just a matter of getting better when you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are set, you can get better. But nothing to complain over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hard to say how you'll do in a hard LDoN without knowing your magelo<br />
<br />
If you can buff your HPs to over 8k, I'd say its doable.  If you can buff to 8.5k, I'd say you should be just fine assuming you have a competent cleric and a slower (puller is a must, as well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get level 65 asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks....I can buff to 8250 raid buffed at level 64...will ding 65 today and have 9 aa's saved up to finish PD and PP and get Sturdiness 1....so i should be at 8500 raid buffed (i hope to be at least).<br />
<br />
I think i will stick w/ the stormblade for awhile. I got it on a PU raid so can't complain at all. <br />
<br />
Will prolly stick to beefing up more LDoN points too (7200 total ldon pts to date)....so i can get more gear to triple aug. Those 40 hp augs seem like nice additions to visible slots heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did ding 65 few days ago and put some AA's into hp and am now at 8637 raid buffed (1450 ac). I tanked my first hard LDoN last night and won with this wpn setup (even with necro boxing a cleric). Was fun and will be looking forward to tanking many more hard LDoN's. <br />
<br />
Too bad everyone was too lazy to go after the named,  bah =(</div></div><hr />
