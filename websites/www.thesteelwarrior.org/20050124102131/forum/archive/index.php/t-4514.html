<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyynde</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive made a few upgrades since my last ck here and have gone up a few levels:D  I know I really need new Geaves and am waiting til I can get Helanic Greaves. I have a few weapons in my Packs along with an FBSS for Haste. I have some money to spend for upgrades not including amount for Greaves. Ive been trying to balance out my stats too. Is the lifetap augment in MM worth getting? Im 3 points away from amount needed. I do have the Heated Blade on My lamination...thanks all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I'd say you should probably never have your haste item not on your person.  0% haste = less damage, and less agro.  I can't think of a single situation where I wouldn't want my haste on. <br />
<br />
That said, it's probably time to move up from FBSS anyway.  Go for Soulscream Belt, Enchanted Sash of Wonder, or dragon haste (ie CoF, CoCW, CCoM).  Anything to move you into the 30%+ haste range.  <br />
<br />
Next, GSoT is gonna do you good for 2H, but if you do duel wield, you need better weapons.  Some situations dual wielding will be advantageous, so plan accordingly.  Droga weapons (CHoS/SotB) are a great combo for when you need to dual wield.  Not urgent, but like a boy scout, it's best to &quot;Be Prepared&quot;.  Feel free to get rid of your lammy+proc and get a new Takish proc'er for your new weapon of choice.  <br />
<br />
As for the lifetap proc, I'd probably say skip it and try for the Ykesha augments from Guk.  Lifetap isn't much agro, and really is situational at best.  I have a Blood Point for when lifetaps are helpful (ie in my 2box setup where agro isn't important), but I couldn't see spending that kind of points for a lifetap augment.  However, it's not going to hurt you if you do decide to do it.<br />
<br />
One other minor upgrade - take a look at a Jagged Bone Hoop for your ear.  It would be a decent upgrade from what you currently have.</div></div><hr />

2) Ears: Get 2 earrings, like earrings of the Tempest for example.  Mosquito Leg, etc. <br />
3) face: Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
4) another 6/65 ring<br />
5) MQ 2 Thurgadin quest bracers<br />
6) belt: not sure there are a few out there that are like 20 AC.<br />
<br />
That'll get you going.<br />
<br />
Since you are an LDoNer, most of the armor you have, such as the bracers, arms, legs, and helm, can be replaced very nicely with drops from Miragul.</div></div><hr />

They're better than warlord's and cost about the same as the gems for velious quest bracers (at least on povar) :D</div></div><hr />
