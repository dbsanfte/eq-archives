<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You mean for soloing? If you really have nothing better to do, and if you cant find a pick up group when your friends are not on... I guess any kind of xp is better than nothing hehe.<br />
<br />
I would advice you to group up with your friends or some pick ups, it would be much better xp :) Even in GD if you are in need of Coldain / CoV faction. There are dozens of other zones with better xp tho, specially dungeons (not necessarely LDoN, just dungeons) cause they have an xp bonus :) And now you have the Hot Spots, some are LoY zones, pretty good for your lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xaipax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i can get a pickup group but i just dont see the point. during the week i only play 1-2 hours a day so soloing is kinda the only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1-2 hours is enough for a LDoN :)<br />
The downtime for a warrior soloing at that lvl might be too big to be worth the hassle really, just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could also try going to the &quot;hot spots&quot; for your level (per the recent patch.)  I haven't been to these lately, but I suspect this is where a lot of lower levels are going for xp nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xaipax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">oh and am i doing good with my equipment? heres my magelo.<br />

its all accurate accept the bloodguard ring(im workin on gettin that)<br />
thanks for the help guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd look at filling your waist slot first, since it appears to be empty.<br />
Then the disease earring and the bandit bracer.<br />
You're also wearing RZ cultural armor but your profile says you're agnostic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Before all the xp changes to groups I sometimes soloed thurgadin mines 35-40.Usually pulled at 50 pct and bandaged up.Close zonelines and guards.Could be tuff at 35 depending on gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xaipax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks for telling me it said agnostic i didnt notice lol. but i decided not to get the bloodguard ring and am saving up my plat for a better haste belt. i have about 7kp and if i sold my old silver chitin hand wrap i could have a total of about 10kpp. i was looking at the sash of the dragonborn but its 24% and the handwraps are 22% does it make that big of a difference or are the stats on the handwraps worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly, it is probably cheaper to buy your haste through tribute instead, until you get a &quot;keeper&quot; item that is 31% haste or higher.  That way you do not have to compromise on stats in any of your slots in the meantime.<br />
<br />
I have a pair of &quot;twinks&quot; on a different server from my mains.  They are totally untwinked and only have the money they have looted themselves through soloing and duoing from 1-40.  Even so, I am easily able to afford tribute for both of them.  21% haste and FT1 are dirt cheap tribute effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xaipax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">dont you have to have GoD for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes.<br />
<br />
If you are missing expansions, it would be best if you mentioned that before you ask for gear advice. :)  Are you missing GOD?  LDON?  POP?  LOY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>xaipax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">everything exept GoD.<br />
lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another viable haste choice is the Worker's Earring of Efficiency. 5ac 55hp 21%(or so) haste ear slot, with no rec/req level... perfect for twinking, and can commonly be found for under 5k. All of the low-20's% haste items have such miniscule differences in haste that getting the one with the best stats is better than paying for something with like 3% more haste but a lot worse stats.</div></div><hr />
