I'm picking it up this weekend and they want me to roll a  tank, a role I enjoy.  So any ideas on a template to work towards?  Best Race?  Any hints at all that will help me avoid re-rolling are welcome.  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

A warrior specialization outline was posted in this forum a few days ago, you might wanna look for it.</div></div><hr />

Find out what faction your friends will be playing on, then choose your favorite race out of the available ones on that faction.<br />
<br />
Each race has a different set of skills or abilities unique to their race, which provide some nice bonuses (ie: tauren have an innate war stomp, which stuns - trolls have innate regen, and have an ability that increases your attack speed when you're below 20% HP, etc), however, they're just nice extras. None of the abilities are ground breaking, and most of them can be made up for or provided by equipment and abilities you'll get later on. You can't really make a bad choice, but tauren ARE pretty attractive for the HP bonus and war stomp.</div></div><hr />
