<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know how much the piercing cap affects the dmg, we are to the point where i could get one just wanted to see if it was worthwhile.  Basically it would just be as a nonagro/pure dmg setup when not tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutalliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well:<br />
<br />
if maximum damage is true to be around:<br />
<br />
(level + skills + str ) / 100 + &quot;dam on weapon&quot; + damage bonus<br />
<br />
(65 + 240 + 305 ) / 100 x 17 + 13 = 116  max hit. (rounded down)<br />
<br />
1 hs it would be max hit = 118<br />
<br />
Approx: 2 % difference in max hit.<br />
<br />
That will affect your dps. Another worthwhile thing to notice is your atk rating will be a little less.<br />
<br />
What I dont know really is how SKILL affects accuracy if it does at all? But using peircer would be a litte less damage overall, but I think the difference is small, and the ifir would outweigh the negative sideafffect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, Gorlab and Brutul parsed a Primal 1hs and a Primal piercer, the DPS difference was 1.5-2.0%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea I parsed this out back in early luclin and it wasn't significant.  I was using a willsapper at the time so I wanted to know how much it hurt you.  Also keep in mind that if you use the piercer offhand it won't lower your atk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think you loose 30atk with piercer.<br />
The DPS loss must be really minimal.<br />
<br />
As for the ATK loss on ur character, you only see the ATK rating of your mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also keep in mind that if you use the piercer offhand it won't lower your atk. <br />
<br />
Hmm, it won't show on your atk rating cause that rating is for primary hand only.  But of course the lower attack is gonna affect you.  Ever tried using a weapon off-hand where you had no skill at all?  You never hit and when you do it's for very low numbers.  That number is just not showed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not certain if it's going to have a difference of only 1-2%, but keep in mind that lower skills mean that your hit percentage will be lower, something atk items do not affect (maybe the time stuff with accuracy, who knows).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I don't think we can say exactly how it would effect you.  All I mean is that if you equip a piercer in your mainhand, your ATK stat goes down.  If you equip it in your offhand, it doesn't.  It is reasonable to assume that you will do slightly less damage than with an equal dmg/dly 1hb or 1hs in your offhand.  But from parsing, even using it mainhand, it didn't make a very significant difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">90% sure weapon skill doesnt effect max hit... I rmemeber having same max hits as warriors with my primal 2hder... with 225 weapon skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Max hit on a 17 damage weapon is 114 not 118.</div></div><hr />
