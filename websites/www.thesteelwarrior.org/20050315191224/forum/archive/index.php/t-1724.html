<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maineeak</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am a 56 warr 2 boxin with a 51 cleric. i also have a 54 chanter that groups with me about as much as my 2 boxed cleric , lol. I have been wanting to get a ToD , but i don't really know OS all that well and have been looking at as much info as i can on the net to see if this is accessable to me now. <br />
<br />
<br />
can some1 tell me if its in my range to not only be able to hang in os with those 3, but be able to get to camp and hold camp so i could aquire 1? my cleric is equipted nicely with a clicky cheal bp , and about 245 wis unbuffed. the chanter i consistantly group with is a great chanter and has hunted in os a couple times , but has never camped the armsdealer before. any info on the type of mobs i would fight in route to camp would be great. i have been recently hunting yard trash in VL , and would like to know how the mobs in vl compare to those in route to the armsdealer camp , as well as the mobs in the armsdealer camp.<br />
<br />
like what do they hit for? are a majority of the mobs at camp or in route to camp casters? is the armsdealer a caster?does any mob both in camp and/or in route to camp summon ?if any of the mobs in route or at camp are casters, do any of them gate when loh? are there any traps in route to the camp ? <br />
<br />
any detailed information on this would be greatly appreciated, and thanx ahead of time to all who answers.</div></div><hr />

(there's more of these slippery things but that's the only one in your way).<br />
<br />
if i remember right, the armorer room is right before bar room. can camp there and pull from the general surroundings. casters will try to gate. some will gate out of pursuit range, some will be 51+ and summon you, some will gate and come back with or without friends.<br />
<br />
get snare. having a puller who knows old sebilis like his pocket would be a plus.</div></div><hr />
