  Dropped in here for some &quot;expert&quot; advice :)  My main is a wizard and I have a lvl41 Agnostic Ogre Warrior that i'm currently trying to gear up.  I've debated on re-rolling him just for RZ deity purposes, but am really at odds to do so.  What would you all suggest for gear upgrades?  I only have about 10k that I can devote to  him.  Looking mainly at &quot;bang for the buck&quot; upgrades.  Also, what gear could I farm for with a 65 Shaman and 65 Wizard?  I've done the Fellspine camp before, but he didn't drop the belt. Plan on going back for that in the near future.<br />
