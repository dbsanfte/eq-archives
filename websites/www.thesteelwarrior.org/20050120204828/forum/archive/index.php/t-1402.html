People like this are a threat to the lives of others, have absolutly no morals or consiounce, can't be expected to get one in prison, and will probably not hesitate to repeat their actions if they lawfully or unlawfully get out of confinement.<br />

It is sick that kids can go around planning murder knowing for the most part that they will likely only get a slap on the wrist. Corporal punishment may be harsh on kids, but it at least shows them whos boss.</div></div><hr />

 An act of this kind of nature would be inflicted back apon the criminals through use of the same tools, by the family members of the victim. No liberal hippy red tape would prevent my termination of the criminals, no blaming of the pop culture or an affect of a beatles song written years ago. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. And violence and terror can only be quashed through violence and terror in return - no amount of therapy, mental healing or jail time can bring back a murder victim. <br />

Id send a message out to criminals everywhere. Hell Id even broadcast the execution on live television, charge millions for on air advertising like the Superbowl and re-invest the money made into healthcare =D</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine anyone having such a callous lack of regard for the sanctity of human life.  I'm not equipped to judge these children (and I use that term loosely) for their actions, I'll have to leave that to a higher power.  I do hope that the judicial system is swift in arranging for them to meet him.</div></div><hr />
