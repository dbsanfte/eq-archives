After the patch/nerf/bug where VZ would add during the TZ fight, we simply split our raid and killed them simultaneously.  Casters/archers burned down TZ while melees played with VZ on the opposite side.<br />
<br />
All in all neither of em are too hard these days.<br />
<br />
For RZtWL just burn dps and set up a solid kite crew.  A method we tried a few times that worked well is to have 3 paladins 2 rangers and a bard outside with selos.  Just as RZ was engaged they would all zin and drop down into the pit, kiting waves as they popped.  If RZ wasnt dead (or close to dead) by the time selos wore off, it was a wipe anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximiusm</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heres what we do:<br />
<br />
after we down tallon and head to RZ trigger area, we clear the left side set a chanter parkign the first trigger. we drag him around the right and get the other trigger mezzed. once we ready to start puller gets in possition and we split the raid by groups on the triggers, 1/2 on each. get raid set in the corner.<br />
<br />
they die at the same time so u have the absolute most possible time. down the brothers... keep 1 tank away from the fight down the hall to avoid the agro debuff so you can chain pull the zeks. usualy use a SK or paly to tank the brothers for snap agro, that agro debuff blows.<br />
<br />
once tz / vz down, that tank runs up and tags RZ of the monk, and fights him above the first stairs keeping the raid outa AE ramp. at about 70% a wizard MGBs TL ( make sure the raid is bound in the egg tunnel ) and as soon as ralos poofs, take the TL.<br />
<br />
necro outside MGBs dmf, and everyone zones back in. 1 group stays outside with a bard, keeping selos clicked.<br />
<br />
raid moves in and heads to pit, while necros summon / rez any dead.  puller grabs pigs n such for the chanters / necros to charm, and the newly rezzed catch up... if u did this without any deaths or very efficiently, you should have a nice 10 mins left on your timer.<br />
<br />
when MT pulls, the first 2 members of the group outside zone in. they run in and get their right about when teh first mobs spawn (i usualy kite, AE taunt is nice on this). 30 seconds after the first 2 zone in, the next 2 do, then the final 1, leaving bard outside. when the selos starts to run low for the first 2, (minute or so left) click out and get a fresh one. so on an so fourth. or just die and click back in. kiters usualy take a few deaths. <br />
<br />
when RZ is at 1%, another wizard AE's TL, and everyone takes it RIGHT when rztw goes down. Kiters keep kiting, anty anyone who can helps out so people can get their hails done 9no invis, dont forget). corpses are dragged to the corner u killed RZ in, and clicked while loot is done.<br />
<br />
$money$<br />
<br />
its worked every time for us, think the lowest we did it with was 40ish, non-ep geared peeps, MT buffed to about 11k.</div></div><hr />

You just have to make sure they're dual wielding and hasted.  When I was doing my epic pre-quest, I was fiddling around with various charm pets.  I had to give the decorins 2x 2HS weapons in order to activate their dual wielding, but once it was going, they were doing ~550dps a piece.<br />
<br />
Charm pets and Ranger Trueshot fucking destroy RZTW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once upon a time i watched a time guild backflag RZ with a 72 mana raid.  RZ was dead so fast they got a whopping *one* wave of adds (and they almost didnt get that).  Soon as RZ was dead adds were trained into camp and it was an ae slaughterhouse.<br />
<br />
This fight is optimally abuot marginal tactics and insane dps.  The longer RZ lives, the harder the event is.</div></div><hr />

Was rather fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been in a raid where we killed RZTW so fast he only spawned one wave of adds.  Optimally, you should be able to do this just before you enter Time, but different guilds have different class percentage makeups, so this isn't always the case.  For a pre-elemental guild, RZTW's hitpoints (~1.2 million) look very daunting, but by the time you enter the Plane of Time, 1.2 million hitpoints should take you ~2.5 minutes at the very most, and that's not including charm pets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrem</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fairly certain it's around 18-20 min like someone said for each portion.<br />
I'm not sure if it's 2 portions or 3, I've always believed (and raid leader did too, that it was 2 portions)<br />
1. decorin/tz/vz<br />
2. RZ/RZtW<br />
<br />
Strat is pretty much what everyone listed.<br />
<br />
My old guild would tag the first decorin on the left and kill around to the second decorin, pull any adds on the stairs etc, then position a pal/sk for TZ spawn then kill both decorins simultaneously.<br />
<br />
We always did tz and vz separately and fortunatly never had to do him when the script was bugged (tz/vz coming at the same time).<br />
<br />
Other than using a knight to tank TZ, nothing really special about him,  Melee's use range attacks, casters burn.  VZ need about 4 tanks ready to tank his splits, real one hits kinda hard, fakes are wusses.  Once TZ went down, VZ would be pulled, and killed.   TZ has some of the gheyest warping btw that I've ever encountered  (Tanked him myself one time and he disappeared, I had to sit down to make him come back, and when he did he spawned behind the raid and came running at me, so be careful not to push him into/up the wall).  <br />
Once VZ is down, RZ is pulled, and at 60/70% of RZ's health wizard mass TL's, Druid outside does MGB Flight of eagles (supposedly it's 3-5% faster than the adds, it solves a couple of issues, levitate, sow, and a last ditch run speed improvement when selos wears off), main raid force zones in except for 1-2 groups of Knights/bards.  Chanters get diaku's and druids get pigs, pets are snared, hasted, equipped.  Usually have 3-5 pets sometimes 6-7 depends on number of druids/chanters. <br />
One group of knights and a bard sit outside and wait for RZtW to be pulled.  Once RZtW is announced as INC this group(s) zones in and heads to the pit with selos on.  Group drops down and proceeds to kite adds ( we do this with knights because honestly lets face it we're not known for DPS (DT excluded) and we can take a couple of hits ).<br />
Once RZtW is dead, kite team runs to opposite far corner and dies, leaving the adds far far away from raid.<br />
Rogues are consented and drag corpses to the raid, everyone that died gets rezzed, invis'd ( PP can be hailed while invis, think it's the only one that can)  and run to the middle to get flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of other comments to add: <br />
<br />
To start have everyone bind outside the Tactics zonein in PoT. <br />
<br />
Run in get the left hand trigger mob for TZ/VZ and mezpark him back around the other side.  Kill the two of them (Lumpy and Bumpy as the guild sometimes calls them) at the same time.  Have your TZ tank all set to go as he'll pop just after the 2nd -umpy goes down.  <br />
<br />
The Tallon/Vallon fights are actually all about aggro control.  Nice and easy from range on Tallon with your uber-est knight tanking him, (if a wizard over nukes and gets summoned or even worse, brings Tallon into the raid... guildremove him) while your mellee types start clearing across the faux RZ room to clear a path to Vallon.  Pull Vallon as soon as feasible after Tallon.  Again, he casts an aggro debuffer, so folks need to take it easy.  Position your two Vallon split tanks between the raid force and Vallon one, as they always boot it for a cleric when they spawn.  Being there waiting is easier than chasing, IMO.  <br />
<br />
Check buffs/do a quick med whatnot as you move into the faux RZ room.  Finish any clearing of the far side hallway near the door.  <br />
<br />
Get a wizard to cast TL on everyone.  No one accepts, they just move the box off to one side on their screen.  <br />
<br />
Get RZ going in a corner, melles at max melle range to avoid AE rampage.  You will get adds thru the VZ side door (this is why you cleared any leftovers b4 pulling RZ) kite, mez, whatever.  Just have to get RZ down to... 60 or 50 and he poofs.  The second he does, everyone takes the teleport.  <br />
<br />
You now have 20 mins to get RZtW down.  Need lev and invis to get into the far left corner of the pit.  (guess thats... NW?  don't know if the corridor up to the pit is actually headed north or no...)  The key here is to delegate.  Get your head chanter and a puller set up before hand to deal with getting some pets.  Have a summoner with raid leadership ready to swap people in and out of groups to get anyone who died to the fake RZ room back and mostly looted (rez later).  Everyone should be responsible for their own lev and invis.  Tell them to get potions as you don't want to blow 5 minutes fucking around with getting that some slowzoning eejit mellee type leved and invised.  The first few times you try this, the period of time right after the faux RZ kill will be a clusterfuck and there's no way one person is able to get all the instructions out.  <br />
<br />
Others have mentioned actual fight tactics, but I agree: the key is DPS, DPS and more DPS.  So don't use anyone who has DPS as a kiter.  (i.e., extra warriors, knights are your kiters.  I think at one point on our successful try, one of our bards actually had all of them chasing him)  Kick his ass fast, seabass and your headaches diminish by at least an order of magnitude.  In the original PoP, this is one where you brought 72.  These days with levels and better gear, we did it with just under 50.  If it takes you longer than one defensive to do the 1.2 million points, you're probably fucked.  And quicker is better.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah... can do the TL thing again on real rallos.  You can also click out of the zone once he's dead.   The projection sees invis too.  The adds don't despawn immediately so someone will have to drag them off to a corner somewhere.  Can't remember if the adds see invis<br />
<br />
Be ready to try it several times.  If your guild kills RZtW first try with a force of people who havne't done it before... I'd say it'd be an EQ first.  <br />
<br />
I like the idea of the selo's group hanging outside btw.  (The friggen adds move at SoE speed.)  We're gonna use that one next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually had a mass TL on engage, then a 2nd mass TL at 60-65 % on fake RZ, he despawns at 50. Anyone who was in danger of dying took TLs or we TLed at despawn.  We also always MGB'd Flight of Eagles in Tranq after TLing out from fake RZ.  SKs and Necros summoned anyone who died, but we didn't rezz until after the event. Pallies kited the 1st wave of adds; warriors /disc fell or mighty on assist, then helped kite any subsequent waves.  I can't stress enough the value of charmed pets when you are first doing him; park the pets as close to the corner you're tanking him (we used near left corner).<br />
<br />
The PP does see invis (the only PP that does afaik), so you can invis out to hail. For us, this was an event we lost a whole lot of times before winning, then never lost again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We figured out the recent problem we had finally.  After VZ went down, there were some deaths so we were busy with that.  But we fought a trash mob that fluxed some people around and one got thrown into the fake RZ.  If you aggro fake RZ and then lose aggro, the timer is changed.  You've got 10 minutes at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-05-2005, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make sure you clear the trash up the halls a bit.  When RZ (Fake) summons his adds, they come from down the hall a little ways and will bring all the stationary trash along with them, or at least I'm pretty sure.  There never seems to be any definite amount of adds though.  I've been in raids where we've gotten swarmed and I've been in raids where we literally got like four total.  /shrug<br />
<br />
The encounter is really all about not letting people die in the process of the script, although sometimes this is inevitable.  As you gain access to molds, molds, and more molds from the elementals, the script really, really, really-really-really becomes a lot easier.  That's with any bottleneck progression script though, cause Uqua gets a shitton easier too after mass Qvic farming.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darthin-Emarr</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been reading over this thread...and found quite a few things i don't agree with...<br />
First, as far as i know the script is broken down into 5 seperate timed stages. You have 6 minutes from the death of the first named decorin to kill the other one. Once they are dead TZ spawns in the middle of the hallway....here's my next issue. TZ doesn't aggro debuf and we tend to warrior tank him as opposed to knights.  Vz does aggro debuff, and while that doesn't mean you need to knight tank him, if you have a tank to spare that isn't gonna be in the MA list for Fake RZ/RZtW, use him...worst wipes i have ever seen on fake RZ is after they used the same MA for VZ and RZ and he just couldn't hold aggro cause he still had the debuff on.<br />
<br />
Back to timers..Once the decorins die you have 20 minutes to kill TZ or the script resets. Once TZ is down you have 20 minutes to kill VZ. Then you have 20 minutes for Fake RZ (get him to depawn). And then once again 20 min for RZtW.<br />
<br />
Now...on Fake RZ fight, I've killed him both out in the hallway and up in his room, and to be perfectly honest, i think killing him in his room is the safest way to go. Now i tend not to be on add control at this stage, but sometimes when you kil him in the hallway the adds from the far side of RZ's room will not run straight through, and there have been times where they have pathed all the way around the decorin hallway brining pretty much everything with em. That gets ugly.<br />
<br />
Other than that the info everyone else posted is dead on...i seem to recall though some raid leaders using shamen to kite adds in the pit with AE slow though...give em selos before they zone in. plus...to help speed up your clearing a bit (i noticed someone said they stil clear all the way to berik). our monks just need the first hallway at the top of the stairs cleared and they can single pull Berik through the rest of the mobs. You can go the same with Grunhork if you've actually go someone racing you for the spawn.<br />

<br />
it works pretty well... since i wasnt MT i was usualy in the second wave so when the first group got out i could AE taunt ect ect.... insta click gate potions are awesome, i realy realy wish they werent lore.<br />
<br />
nother nice trick we used, rangers / dps classes can cling in the corner with DMF / levi. run to the corner you drop in at and run under the ledge to the corner. i was able to keep my necro there (apperently you can autorun backwards) and he was fine the whole fight. a few wizards did it and it worked til their agro-whoring asses got sumoned to RZ.<br />
<br />
we got RZ way before we should have because we had a large ranger force (8ish). <br />
<br />
trueshot + ele bow x 8 &gt; RZtW<br />
<br />
<br />
The encounter is really all about not letting people die in the process of the script <br />
 100% agree... stopping to rez / summon /rebuff people is the biggest handicap, especialy when u are on RZtW stage. if you can do RZ flawlessly that means you have more time to pull charm pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all the mobs in the script have big enough hit boxes to let you do normal mele on them on not get hit by AE / ramp... asuming you pay attention and arent an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hrm, my guild killed RZtWL on our first spawning of him.  I believed we wiped 2-3 times on Tallon and Vallon though, but once those two were put down, Rallos died.  I wasn't even an applicant then, I was in the application queue when we pulled it off on the first time I saw the encounter.<br />
<br />

<br />
trueshot + ele bow x 8 &gt; RZtW<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek was always the PITA of my guild.  Beat us down time and again.  Only twice did we get past that and fail.  Both times with VERY small raid forces.  26 and we failed against the fake Rallos, we should have engaged him, but were a little LoM and medded too long while discussing tactics.<br />
<br />
The time before that we lacked CC power and was again a smaller raid, perhaps 30ish.  Wiped to adds with Rallos at 11%, third wave of adds.<br />
<br />
Elemental bows hadn't proliferated when my guild killed Rallos, we were the 3rd guild on the server to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still amazes me people say to use a knight for TZ.<br />
<br />
The day they fixed the TZ &amp; VZ coming together bug we went in and proceeded to own the event 3 times in one week.  I tanked VZ/TZ/RZ/RZtW on all three wins and never died other then when training mobs away at end for others to get flag =P In other words you don't NEED a knight.  Wars with solid aggro will do fine, in my case it was BF/Spike Driver at the time. Both anger 3 aug'd, WA5, and aten gloves clicky.<br />
<br />
As for a strat...i like to keep it simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Everyone binds outside<br />
2) Zone in and move towards triggers (otw there stop by the top of the pit and have Raid leader show everyone the corner they will be dropping down into, this will reduc e any possible confusion later)<br />
3) Clear to first trigger on TZ side, snare it and have an enc bring it behind the raid as you get to the VZ side. Kill both triggers.<br />
4) VZ pops a bit behind the raid if your setup in the corner. Slaughter him and pull TZ slaughter him and rez /buff FAST.<br />
5) After 5 to 6 min, AE TL &amp; pull RZ to the corner there and let your tank have about 10 to 15 seconds of aggro then all out DPS burn burn burn, at 65% have 2 wizards ( one close to RZ, one down the hall a bit) AE TL.  Anyone who gets below 40% other then clerics and tanks must take the TL.<br />
6) Once all out AE FoEagles. Zone them ALL(including dead folks) in and get those who died rez'd(need to be done with this by about 3 to 4 min) &amp; buffed.<br />
7) Drop down into the corner of the pit as mentioned earlier and have enc's rdy with pets etc, let everyone get to FM, you should be pulling him to the corner and engaging with about 10 to 8 minutes left.<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
<br />
- Use SK's &amp; Pall'y as primary kiters since they aren't as much DPS and can take hits better.<br />
- Rangers *BURN TS EARLY*, they are the secondary kiters and if the fight last long enough for TS to drop you prolly lose.<br />
- Make sure bards are positioned well with wizards/mages/rangers/rogues etc.  Use druid healers for those groups if at all.<br />
- Once RZtW hits the dirt, RL makes a call &quot;Kill Adds&quot; / &quot;Zone Adds&quot;.  If you zone them get someone who has the flag to zone back in and round them all up and move them well away from the body and the flag mob. Good class for this is a ranja since mobs are fast you will wana get their attn with arrows not melee =P<br />
-Enjoy your loots, and if your lucky the phat loot gods will shower you with BoWars</div></div><hr />
