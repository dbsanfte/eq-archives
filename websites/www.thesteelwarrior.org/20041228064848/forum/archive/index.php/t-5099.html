<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goethia</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a 65 cleric. About lvl 50 I realized I needed a companion for him so I started a warrior. Now she is about 63.5 w/ Veteren Title. So my question is should I stop AA for now and just finish the grind to 65 or should I finish out ND3 then grind to 65. Currently she has about 6700hp buffed which has been more then adequate for BOT groups.  I figure if I go ND3 I'm pushing close to 7200hp buffed at 63 which IMHO isn't terrible. Any suggestions are welcomed.<br />
<br />
On a secondary note, last night someone asked me (on her of course) if I would be interested in being the MT of their small family guild.  Now my cleric has been in an out of guilds both good and bad.  Mainly I just left because they were either breaking up or I was sick of being told when and how to play. I realize that every tank at some point needs to learn how to MT on Boss mobs, am I correct in my thinking on this. Not to mention it would probably be a good way to upgrade some of her gear.<br />

<br />
Develop your character fully, learn to like him/her, make him/her something special.<br />

Have fun.  Any fool can grind to 65.  Do something different, stand apart from the pack.<br />
<br />
As for guilds, screw guilds.  They are no longer necessary.<br />
<br />
You can MT boss mobs in LDoN that are quite fun.  You will never spend endless boring hours waiting for a raid to get together, only to have it called because some key people decided not to show.<br />
<br />
You'll never have to tolerate or suck up to asswads to advance your equipment desires.  You'll never have to deal with screwhead elitists who think blindly following some cookie-cutter formula makes them uber.<br />
<br />
In far less time than it takes to put together an elite kit of no-drop gear in the planes, you will have near VT quality gear.....guaranteed.<br />

I don't see any problems doing it either way.<br />
<br />
Personally I would get level 65 first, since you do more damage and mitigate better at level 65. So you would get AA's faster by then, thus reducing the overall time it takes, thus making it less of a bore. <br />
<br />
<br />
That all said - Do what you want to. :)<br />

If you wanna guild, do so.<br />
If you wanna do the lone wolf thing, do so.<br />

Yes, being 65 has some advantages.. however staying 63 allows you to gain AA points at a faster rate, and a well rounded AA wise lvl63 warrior is worth a shitload more then you're average-15-in-a-dozen lvl65 AA-less warrior.  Now I'm going against 'common wisdom' here, and probably get yelled at by all the better knowers waving their GtoS at me, but I'm fairly immune to that :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I provided a great deal of insight and substance, particularly with regards to my opinion on why guilds are now unecessary.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would feel inadequate if it required research to determine if I had anything to say.<br />
<br />
I like everything I say to be worthy, so that the first time I am read, the reader knows a thing about the author.  First impressions, yada yada.<br />
<br />
You opened with a veiled insult, I responded in kind.  Such is the risk one takes.  If I wanted sneering disrespect, I would taunt the neighborhood teenagers, and not come to a discussion board purportedly devoted to *discussion*.<br />
<br />
However, I shall give you the benefit of the doubt, considering I haven't the slightest inclination to research anything you may have said in the past.<br />
<br />
So elaborate then, please, since this is a thread asking for opinions. <br />
<br />
Why do you think a measured progression with full character development, as opposed to a grind to level 65, ends up with people that stand out only by being dead?</div></div><hr />

This is inherently biased to YOUR in game goals. As such, it provides insight only into you and no one else. Defending such an lopsided opinion seems foolhardy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not defending any opinion.  Thus far, the only part of my opinion that has been challenged was a suggestion that a measured progression instead of grinding away to 65 would make one stand out from the crowd largely by being dead more often.<br />
<br />
But you are quite right, my playing style and therefore my opinions reflect my goals in the game.  My methods would not be appropriate for someone who's goal is to tank Vindi next Saturday and is currently at level 26.<br />
<br />
I was hoping to get the fellow who snottily dispensed with my post to explain himself, so I could illuminate the very point you make here.<br />
<br />
Which is, one's opinions on subjective matters depend on one's goals.  The author of the thread asks for subjective opinion, which I provided.  &quot;Any suggestions are welcome&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Should I grind AA, or should I grind Levels?  I just wanted to point out there's more to the game than grinding anything.<br />
<br />
But to some, if I don't grind and suggest that others don't either, I guess I'll just be dead a lot.  Was hoping to understand precisely how that mechanism works, as I haven't experienced it so far.<br />
<br />
And I strongly suspect it's just another subjective opinion based on personal goals, and has no objective basis in reality.  Which would then reveal the snot-nosed reply as merely an act of childish malice, with no depth or substance.<br />
<br />
Which, of course, ties in with my original respones.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
I hope I'm not going totally over yall's heads here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think you're a troll to be honest.  You show up with a dumbass name and state something like &quot;I'm gonna get 44 aa's in general before i get to 55&quot; and expect people to take you seriously?<br />
<br />
I'll make you a deal.  44 aa's is a lot more time than it takes to get from 51-65.  So you grind out them 44 aa's and then go find a level 65 with no title at all and /d him.  Get back to me and tell me how badly he crushes you into the ground.<br />
<br />
There is a reason why everyone goes level &gt; AA.   It's because IT'S TRUE.  When PoP came out, I argued with guys like Wandor about this for weeks.  I contended that you could get far more gain from spending your time doing Arch AA's at level 60 than simply getting to 65 with no AA's at all.  I was completely 100% wrong, and I see that now that I'm 65, and so does everyone else who's 65.  It became glaringly obvious in HoT.  I spend a good chunk of time there at level 60 farming up SS armor for my guild, I know exactly how fights went.  Monk came back to camp, dropped aggro on me, I took over and needed at least 1ch before I even got that mob slowed with the shaman, and I'd be at like half life again when that happened.  These things are pure assrape to a level 60...390 hitters do not make the game fun at that level.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to when I just leveled to 65...I didn't get any new defensive AA's after I started the grind.  It only took one trip back to HoT to see how fucking stupid I was for not going to 65 to begin with.  I went from needing 1 ch before I could even malo/slow to being able to duo any non gating mob in there with just me and my shaman.   As boring as grinding is, once you're done grinding levels, you are going to enjoy the game A LOT more.  The ONLY reason to stay a particular level for anything longer than getting run 3 is if you enjoy the spot you're hunting in but it goes green to 65.  I had a blast in chardok, so I stayed there and finished all my defensive AA's and got Marshall  while i was 60 because it was a fun place to play.  <br />
<br />
Making claims like &quot;Fully develop your character&quot; and &quot;don't grind&quot; just lead to people with their veteren title at 55, and those people could just as easily be 60 with 250 defense, who are about 5 times better at absorbing damage than your sorry ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, on to this little gem --<br />
<br />
The age of guilds is over, thankfully. If you do join a guild, make it based on purely social reasons. There is no longer any significant purpose for a guild anyway. <br />
<br />
I sincerly hope you do not post at any time anywhere on this board a rant concerning your pickup group deaths and wastes of time, because they will come.  Guilds are necessary still for e very vital reason...I know anyone wearing my tag is worth spending time with every nite and I don't have to waste time grouping with random fucktards who decided to get 45 AA's at level 51.  Social reasons?  Maybe. I like the people that don't waste my time, that's for sure, but there's much more to that.  Where do you want to spend your 12.95 a month?  I want to spend it killing things, not sitting at my bind point waiting for a rez.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I sincerely doubt you can go from Joe Nothing to VT gear in less time than a capable guild.  LDoN is designed as a MASSIVE time sink, far worse than Luclin ever was.  &quot;You can get l33t augments for your gear! Which don't work on your gear, so you have to grind to buy new gear first, and then you can augment it, but THEN you will have one piece of gear, in about 100 times the amount of commitment a Vindi kill would be.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry your experiences with guilds haven't taught you why they exist, but LDoN is just an alternative for people who neither have the time, will or the skill to do multi group encounters.  I personally have zero interest in LDoN, as does the vast majority of the uber guilds.  They've been bitching about this for awhile...even hard raids on LDoN don't yield items that are upgrades for them.  Why do you think you'd even hold a candle to people like that by spending time solely in LDoN?<br />
<br />
If you enjoy doing it, great, but that doesn't make it efficient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why wouldn't they take me seriously?  I mean, those AA are clearly designed to all be obtained by anyone beginning at level 51.<br />
<br />
 <br />
then go find a level 65 with no title at all and /d him.  Get back to me and tell me how badly he crushes you into the ground.<br />
<br />
It's hard to take you seriously when you say silly things like this.  But when I get to level 65, you come and duel me my friend.  And we'll see who's on the ground :)<br />
<br />
Making claims like &quot;Fully develop your character&quot; and &quot;don't grind&quot; just lead to people with their veteren title at 55, and those people could just as easily be 60 with 250 defense, who are about 5 times better at absorbing damage than your sorry ass. <br />
<br />
You miss the entire point.  A veteran of 55th level is better than any 55th level Warrior that is not a veteran.<br />
<br />
At any given level, I will be profoundly superior to any other warrior who cons white to me.  That will be true from now, while I'm at level 51, until a long time from now, when I'm level 65.<br />
<br />
My goal is not to be 65, and then catch up with everything else.  Yours obviously is.<br />
<br />
I die much less than any other 51 Warrior I know.   I'm in massive demand, with a superb and far reaching reputation among those +/- 7 levels of me.<br />
<br />
I'm rapidly climbing the LDoN Leaderboard on my server.  I shall soon be at the top.  I rarely die, I rarely fail in my task.<br />
<br />
Am I ready to MT in the Plane of Time?  Duh.<br />
<br />
But when I am, I won't be playing catch-up.  I'll be fully and completely maxxed out.  With a complete set of VT-quality LDoN armor, fully augmented.<br />
<br />
So the next time you find yourself tempted to make a casually dismissive insult, take a step back and remind yourself that people have different goals.<br />
<br />
You rant nicely, but you still haven't explained to me in any rational way why I should wish to level fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the original thread goes, get 65.<br />
<br />
As far as the guild vs no guild thing goes, a guild may not be necessary, but I don't see much reason to play this game without one.  I for one would have quit long long ago if not for the guilds I have been in.  Getting gear and killing named mobs are secondary reasons for joining a guild.  The real reason is to have a group of people to log in and talk to day after day and to make friends and accomplish goals as a team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you miss the point pal.  AAXP takes time.  You are not equivilent to a level 55 warrior when you have level 55 and 40 aa's.  You have spent as much time as a guy who is level 65 with 15 aa's.  And that guy not only can crush you in a duel, but he requires a fraction of the healing to keep him standing against any mob that would rip you up one side and down the other.<br />
<br />
That's the point you're missing.</div></div><hr />

No such thing has happened to me so far, in 80+ LDoN adventures.  My only recent loss was with a group of people from my guild.  The serious LDoN pickup folk are superb.<br />
<br />
I know anyone wearing my tag is worth spending time with every nite and I don't have to waste time grouping with random fucktards who decided to get 45 AA's at level 51<br />
<br />
Obviously you wouldn't be joining a guild for social reasons.....<br />
<br />
Uber guilds cater largely to those who are unemployed, children, or still live at home with mommy.<br />
<br />
LDoN has now made it possible for anyone to achieve the levels of gear obtainable by the life-deficient elitist screwheads who make up most uber guilds.<br />
<br />
Clearly you are angry about that, and I'm sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of efficiency, you don't know what you are talking about.  If you get your AAs as you level, and have 100 AAs when you ding 65, then go find a warrior who did 65 first and then ground out 100 AAs, he's gonna have about half your /played time.  AAs come a whole lot faster at 65 than they do in your 50s.  The thought of grinding AA at 51 is horrifying to me when you compare it to how fast you can get it at higher levels, even if you want to do it in LDoN.<br />
<br />
How much AA exp do you get in a normal LDoN adventure at 51?</div></div><hr />

It's not hasty and dismissive, it's direct and to the point.  You try to justify it by claiming your real job at the hotdog stand is all the reason you need to waste time in EQ.  If you can't see why your 51/44 warrior isn't as useful as the guy who spent THE EXACT same amount of time in game as you, but who is level 65, then you're a lost cause.

I see, &quot;Brutul Vilesilencer&quot; denotes a serious person.  &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, by Brutul Vilesilencer.  ;)<br />
<br />
I get one AA every five Adventures.  I complete an adventure in 30 minutes to an hour, rarely longer than that.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if we mean the same thing when we say &quot;grinding&quot;, but I never pay attention to anything like how fast anything progresses.<br />
<br />
All I know is, I made 51 last week.  I turned AA to 90%.  This week I'm halfway to 52 and have 5 AA points, 600+ adventure points, a friends list 30+ long, and several thousands of plat even after all the shrink and sow potions, arrows, Halas pies and Liquidised Meats.<br />
<br />
It's fun, never boring, often absolutely sterling.  I'm 78th Ranked on the LDoN leaderboard.<br />
<br />
I played for a year in Beta before commercial release,  I've been in guilds of all sorts on three different servers over the past five years.<br />
<br />
I've never been in a raiding style guild that didn't ultimately suck bad or fall apart from greed and politics.  Not a single one.<br />

Unless you've meticulously tracked the progress of multiple characters, you have no factual basis upon which to make a claim of efficiency one way or the other.<br />
<br />
I know 65 Warriors working hard to catch up with their AA points, when they're not trying to farm cash for new armor and weapons, or build up their lagging 2HB skills, or every other thing they've neglected on the way up the ladder.<br />
<br />
If that's the way you think it's done, more power too ya!  But don't crap on me just because I have a different opinion, and the temerity to share it.<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be a *discussion* board.  I didn't accuse the Pope of Satanism.<br />
<br />
I merely advocated a different idea, right?  What harm is there in it?<br />
<br />
The only objection I hear you people making is *time*.  Time is irrelevant, this is entertainment.  I want my entertainment experience to be long and full.</div></div><hr />

However, for the original poster's situation, I think that getting to 65 is probably the way to go, since he's grouping with a 65 cleric, and presumably others that are level 65, and if he decides to be MT for raids for a guild, getting to 65 will also be the best option there as well.  There's plenty of time to get AAs once you're 65.<br />

If you can't see why your 51/44 warrior isn't as useful as the guy who spent THE EXACT same amount of time in game as you, but who is level 65, then you're a lost cause. <br />
<br />
Useful to whom, and for what?  He's exceedingly useful to me and the people I  game with.<br />
<br />
Was there some other measure of usefulness that I'm paying my monthly fee for?<br />
<br />
I pay the bills, so it's gotta be useful to me.  I don't care bout nobody else, kapishe?<br />

I don't think you even have a point.  Define &quot;useful&quot;, and define &quot;to whom&quot;, then we shall see what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original poster wasn't asking anyone for quality of life advice.  They wanted to know what would be of most benefit to their level 63 warrior; presumably in being an effective tank.  Instead of answering that question, you used the opportunity to plop your philosophy of getting the most out of EQ on them.  I should also note that the original poster already HAS a level 65 character, btw. <br />
<br />
I can well understand someone deciding to stop and do some AA's before they hit 65 for a variety of reasons, and I would be the last to criticize them for it, but they typically wouldn't come here asking for anyone's approval for doing it.  <br />
<br />
As for the guilds comment;  sorry, but that was definitely troll-flavored.  I'm not in a guild myself, but it's only because I don't really enjoy talking to people online that much.  If I could find a guild such as Haass described (i.e. competent) where they wouldn't actually try to TALK to me all the time, I'd be first in line to sign up.  <br />
<br />
Seriously, though, guilds clearly have a number of valid purposes in game - claiming otherwise can only be viewed as ludicrous. <br />
<br />
Lastly - lemming-shaped cookies, lemmings armed with cookie cutters - a number of images keep floating through my mind a la poker playing dogs, and the phrase itself 'cookie cutter lemming' has a nice rythym to it.   Thanks for sharing that. <br />
<br />
(But, that's definitely not Haass)</div></div><hr />

Good point, and thanks for making it with thoughtfulness and specifics.<br />
<br />
I think you're right, if this person's goal is to be MT for a guild, then the guild will be relying on her to get to 65 quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would tell the guild to take a hike, join a nice social guild, and just have fun with no responsibility to show up for Raid A at 8:00, and Raid B at 11:30, etc.<br />

But different strokes for different folks :)</div></div><hr />

Me too, I didn't come up with my philosophy on EQ yesterday.  I speak from five years of playing experience.<br />
<br />
She wanted an opinion, I gave her one :)<br />
<br />
The problem as I see it is that Haas couldn't restrain his impulse to say something stupid and mildly derogatory.<br />

Had he left my post unchallanged, and simply posted *his opinion* without taking the opportunity to degrade mine, there would be no problem.<br />

You are 63.5. To get to 65, especially if you are in BoT anyway, is at most a week's worth of grinding. IMO, not that much time.  Most people I have run into find a great amount of relief to have the reg. exp grind to be over and done with, myself included. For rangers, as my wife and several of my friends are, it was behoving to stop at 62 and get their EQ and AM3 aa's out of the way for uping their damage capabilities. <br />
<br />
So, if I where you , and I was, I would just do the 65 walk and then switch back over to aa's. There are so many aa's to get to be effective against things on the next level, the week will quickly become a moot point in a month or 2.</div></div><hr />

I've always just accepted the conventional wisdom that levels &gt;&gt; AA, and it was certainly true for me that being 65 brought me much closer to my goals than an equivalent amount of AA would have.  But I'd like to thank Shaikyerbooty for offering an alternative perspective, and (if you'll all permit), to recast what he's saying in slightly different words in hopes of increasing overall understanding.<br />
<br />
*clears throat*<br />
<br />
If your goal is to be the MT for a high-level guild of full-time players, getting level 65 first is clearly superior.  You'll mitigate far more damage that way, you'll gain AA faster, you'll etc. etc. etc.  In general, if your goal is to have the most powerful character for the least time played, levels &gt;&gt; AA.<br />
<br />
But it's possible to have other goals than &quot;the most powerful character for the least time played&quot;.  And one such goal is the one Shaikyerbooty holds: to be the most effective character in an XP or LDoN group at each level.<br />
<br />
And for that goal, AA &gt;&gt; levels.  A level 55 with max archetype AAs is going to be wonderful to group with in level 55 experience groups, and utterly annihilate level-appropriate LDoN missions.  Sure, that person won't be as powerful a character as the person who (in the same /played time) dinged 65 and then got just ND3.  But for the mobs and missions and levels they're at, they're far more effective.<br />
<br />
Or, to put it another way: the only way in which the &quot;levels &gt;&gt; AA&quot; rule applies is to minimize time played per character power.  Now, that happens to be my goal in the game; I have limited playing time, and I enjoy being as powerful as possible.  But it's not everyone's goal; in specific, it's not Shaikyerbooty's goal.<br />
<br />
By the time Shaik gets to 65, he'll already have the 100 or 200 AA points I only wish I had.  He'll have his amazing LDoN armor.  He'll walk into Hard missions that I don't even dare attempt, and &quot;crush them like grape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mind you, it'll take him another year or two to get there.  And by the time he gets there, I'll have (in the same playing time) ground out 200 or 300 AA points.  But he will have accomplished *his* goal, which is to always be far more powerful than the things he is fighting.  Just like I will have accomplished *my* goal, which is to be as powerful as possible, as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
I think you're both right.  You just have different objectives, and thus of course your ideal methodologies differ.<br />

Never grind anything, ever. You'll just end up irritated as well as bored.<br />
Wow, what an opener.  When you are expecting popular opinion in this matter to be something along the line of grind your way to 65 opening with a contrary statement saying essentially don't do what everyone else is going to tell you to do, you wont like it is going to set alot of readers views against yours to start with.<br />
Develop your character fully, learn to like him/her, make him/her something special.<br />
<br />
Have fun. Any fool can grind to 65. Do something different, stand apart from the pack.<br />
Crikey! some more pearlers in here.  Now you have insinuated that people who grind to 65 are fools who arent having fun.  Also that grinding to 65 isn't a part of developing your character fully which seems a bit contradictory to me - surely character development in EQ is represented most fully by the character's level and therefore the most significant development you can make of your character is to level it to 65.<br />
As for guilds, screw guilds. They are no longer necessary.<br />
Way to insult everyone in a guild.  You are ofcourse wrong however, the top level of EQ at this stage is the plane of time.  Guilds are neccessary to get there.<br />
You can MT boss mobs in LDoN that are quite fun. You will never spend endless boring hours waiting for a raid to get together, only to have it called because some key people decided not to show.<br />
Because of course this post is directed at warriors and what warriors excell at and ofcourse enjoy the most is MTing mobs.  Way to go! You got to be MT for a group!  For someone who earlier was denouncing grinding you are proposing that players shouldn't join guilds and reduce their play to exclusively grinding.  Go you on contradicting yourself again.<br />
<br />
Also a bit of angsty whine there.  Only ever been in guilds that suck then?  Cry a river, build a bridge etc.<br />
You'll never have to tolerate or suck up to asswads to advance your equipment desires.<br />
Don't like merit guilds join a DKP one.  <br />
You'll never have to deal with screwhead elitists who think blindly following some cookie-cutter formula makes them uber.<br />
So whats the deal here? people who develop their character in such a way to get greatest benefit from the time put in are just &quot;blindly following some cookie cutter formula&quot;?  Surely if you are enquiring for opinions on a message board before taking any action where you follow the formula or not you arent doing it blindly, and supposing there is a *best way* to develop your character surely this would be the best way to become &quot;uber&quot;.   And ofcourse everyone who does develop their character this way is a screwhead elitist?<br />
In far less time than it takes to put together an elite kit of no-drop gear in the planes, you will have near VT quality gear.....guaranteed.<br />
But to do so will require hours of grinding in LDoN and you'll become bored and irritated...guaranteed.<br />
<br />
And heres a news flash!  Near VT Quality gear = Nearly as good as the best from 2 years ago.  Maybe some people want more than that, but then I guess if you have a chip on your shoulder cos you've only been in guilds that suck and you were such a whiney bitch that you never got any loot you wouldn't understand having aspirations beyond near VT quality loot.<br />
The age of guilds is over, thankfully. If you do join a guild, make it based on purely social reasons. There is no longer any significant purpose for a guild anyway.<br />
Or maybe you actually want to experience the part of EQ that isnt boring and irritating known as Raiding, and ofcourse the only way you will be able to regularly do so without spending endless boring hours waiting for a raid to get together, only to have it called because some key people decided not to show is to join a guild that doesnt suck.  Theres plenty on every server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Now, for the original poster.<br />
<br />
 You've already said you're going to grind out 65, and by now you probably have. But when you say 'small, family type guild', somehow I don't picture you MTing RZ. It seems more logical that you'll be tanking stuff that's &lt; 4 groups. If that's the case -<br />
<br />
 Then either way is fine. 63.5 is not a bad level to be when tanking anything under Tier 2 PoP, frankly. And, of course, the XP difference between killing stuff at 63.5 and killing stuff at 65 isn't that large, especially if you have 65 backup like you post.<br />
<br />
 Gront is right - yes, you'd be holding back your development now. Maybe. But on the other hand, the invested AA's come in very handy. I get nice comments all the time from people who see a non-65 with the Veteran title, and they remember and grab me for their groups when they see me up over the 65 with Run1. :D</div></div><hr />
