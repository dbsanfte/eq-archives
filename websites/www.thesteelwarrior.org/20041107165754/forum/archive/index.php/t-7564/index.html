For me I soloed for 99% percent of the life of my toons.  I don't know why I play a mmorpg when I don't socialize with the other players.</div></div><hr />

play with friends, have fun..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo a LOT, basically because I don't tolerate fools easily.  And most MMoRPGs are filled with an inordinate amount of fools.  However, I've been hanging out with Doggabone and his crew on Pinnacle recently and been having a good time.  They're fun peeps, kind of like EQ used to be back when it wasn't work work work all the time.<br />
<br />
I'll occassionally group with strangers, but it seems that even if they're all competent there will be at least one who gets on my nerves by being too bossy.  Seems lots of adolecents have this thing about needing to be in charge and giving orders where they 1) don't have any authority and 2) don't have any need.  But hell, that may just be me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can be very anti-social at times. It harkens back to EQ. I spent a lot of time (pre-monk nerf) as a soloing monk. I got a whole solo vibe going.<br />
<br />
But it gets boring. Very boring. <br />
<br />
I built all of my toons in CoH to be effective soloists, however, simply because of what happened to me in EQ. (Monk nerf, bye bye soloing).<br />
<br />
I love grouping with my friends and I will take any pickup group I'm offered, because I'm usually a friendly guy. But there are times where I just go off on my own to some quiet spot in a city zone and solo away with my mind controller. Or run my scrapper around beating up everything I see.<br />
<br />
And I enjoy having the freedom to choose again. The ability to do what I want. When I want. The ability to solo when I can't find a group or don't have a large amount of time to commit to a mission. I LOST that in EQ. It wasn't that I wanted to be a SOLOIST per se, it's that having the OPTION eased the game's pressure on me, as I didn't HAVE to beg for a group all the damn time. I won't let that happen in CoH. I build toons that can solo, as I won't get screwed over again, heh. I learned my lesson. If I have to use Confuse on packs of 15 villains just to be able to solo ONE OF THE VILLAINS, I will do it. No freakin way will this game take away my CHOICE.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">unless i find friends, i either solo or log off.<br />
yeah, it's part EQ produced; agreed with everyone else that grouping with Random_Idiot03+04+05+06+07 is just too much of a risk to getting pissed off and whatnot.<br />
It might change in time; but for now....unless I know the person I don't group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've soloed my way to 13 (yeah, I'm uber).  The only exception was one group in Perez Park.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I get the feeling I'm not a very good player in COH yet and its both annoying and embarassing because I'm REALLY good at EQ.  Anyway, I'm an AR/Dev blaster and I've never been a nuker in EQ so that might be why.<br />
<br />
I figured my job was to stand back, not take damage unless absolutely necessary, and DPS.  But my group wanted me to always land caltrops at the start of a fight.  Unfortunately, me running in first inevitably led to mega-aggro and almost death.  If I waited, though, mobs would spread out a bit more and trops wouldn't land on all of them - then I'd get the constant &quot;trops them Sally!&quot;  OMG, I did! And now 5 are outside trop and the goddamn thing has a refresh timer so STFU.   It was a bad bad experience, so I'm going back to soloing for a while.  Heh.  Figure maybe I'll group up when I have more AE powers to offer a party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my little controller made it to 6th level; so we can both be n00bler CoHers Sally :D<br />
god only knows what kinda mayhem would ensue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What server are you on Vigdis ... bah, I mean Sally? (Sorry, your username from here is what I know you best by)?<br />
<br />
I've found that caltrops works best with a little help from people who have slow spells. Mobs like to run away from AEs. Also, the geometry can be used to mess with the villains. Anyways, they take some getting used to. I'm not too skilled with them either, since I spend most of my time playing my mind controller or my scrapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm on Liberty.<br />
<br />
I work fine with caltrops solo, but I use them less as a dot or CC mechanism and SOLELY as a protection device (with a CC counterpart I suppose).  What this means is I will lay caltrops down in front of whereever I plan to fight and then bomb a mob in the center of the pack and proceed to back up until all the mobs have followed me into the caltrops.<br />
<br />
That works great solo or when I duo with my friends, but it does not seem to work in a group.  Instead, groups want to utilize caltrops solely for CC purposes, to keep the mobs bunched up, but they do not want to waste the time it takes for the mobs to run into the caltrops as I use them solo.  <br />
<br />
I think I may need superspeed or cloaking device for trops to work as some of my groups demand.  But that can't be right because they are low level people and must have grouped with devs my level.  Gr. So, anyway, I'm doing something wrong. heh.</div></div><hr />
