<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah young grasshopper, it sounds like you need Wandor's patented guild advice speech.<br />
<br />
I am just guessing, but your lack of a Magelo and flags would tend to indicate that you have never been in any type of a raid guild. I would highly recommend that you DO NOT jump straight in to a raid guild. While the phat lewtz are cool and stuff, you will miss out on a lot of fun content by going straight to the end game. Not only that, but being a good raid warrior is an aquired skill that you do not develop overnight. A raiding guild is going to expect you to know a lot of basic raiding skills and they will expect a certain level of gear. You can possibly ruin your chances of getting in to a top end guild by applying before you are ready.<br />
<br />
I would recommend finding a guild that is hitting Velious or Luclin content depending on the level of your gear. If you have under 4.5k unbuffed HP, then shoot for a Velious guild, if you have over 4.5 unbuffed, then shoot for Luclin/lower PoP. This will serve a dual purpose. First of all, it will insure that your gear is appropriate for the level of raiding you will do. For a warrior, moreso than any other class, your gear can make of break a raid. The entire effectiveness of the cheal rotation is based on your HP, AC, and AAs.<br />
<br />
Second, this will allow you to learn proper raid tactics in a setting where you are not necessarily expected to be able to position a mob perfectly and one where people do not expect 100% agro from the first attack. You will need to learn the difference between an MA (main assist) and an MT (main tank). You will also need to learn how to fill both of those rolls because they can be very different, and usually are at the higher levels. You need to learn proper positioning and how to achieve it. Knowing how to corner tank a mob properly is not something you want to experiment with against Time VZ, you should know how it works for your race by the time you get there. I am sure there are plenty of other skills you will need to learn such as when to pop discs, which discs to pop, and other skills I haven't thought of, but that is the purpose of joining a med level guild, learn the skills you need to raid effectively.<br />
<br />
Depending on how slow or fast the guild you join progresses, you may find the need to leave the guild to join a higher level raid guild. Some guilds are perma-mid level and never really progress much, others move on up at a pretty good pace. You can never really tell until you join, but the option for moving on up if the guild does not fit your play style is always there.<br />
<br />
After spending some time learning the basics, you should get to experience a lot of fun pre-PoP content. It should also increase your chance for getting in to a higher end raid guild. Not only will your skills and gear be up to par with what a raid guild would expect from an applicant, but you should have a lot more AA that will help your survivability. Choose wisely when you finally think you are ready for a top end guild. Many guilds only offer 1 chance, blow it and you are out. Blow it bad enough, and word does get around and you might find yourself not even getting a chance if you build a reputation as a bad raid warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Wandor.  But I also think that joining a higher lvl guild could bring benefits.  My first real raiding guild was run by a RL friend of mine.  I was clearly one of the lowest lvl people, and I went everywhere with them.  It was a lot of good experience, even though I wasnt even considered part of any kind of loot.<br />
<br />
I learned by watching other MT and MA's and also about healing rotation.  Once that guild broke up, I joined my last guild.  With the exp and knowledge that I had learned from my old guild (as well as all the posts here), I slid right into the MT slot with no problem.  My Guild Leader was actually impressed how well I did, and I picked up the rest of what you need to know as a Main Tank.  Things like switching sides, placement, aggro, /discs, all was learned tanking along these raids.<br />
<br />
The thing you have to decide on is if you want to join a high lvl raiding guild where you might be picking up the leftovers.  Or join a lower lvl guild where you might be MT and reap in the rewards on where you go.  Its sad but true that MT's either get priority over loot on raids, or they have better stuff.</div></div><hr />
