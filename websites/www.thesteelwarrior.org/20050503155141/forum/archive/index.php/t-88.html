So the AA you can get at lvl 51, let say im lvl 60 if i divert xp to aa points, does it grow at lvl 51 rate, or would it grow at the rate for my level...meaning no matter what lvl im at, it grows at the same rate or when im lvl 60 and i kill somethign i will gain them faster...does my question make sense?

Its more of a personal preference. I would say get Run3 then go full on reg exp til 60ish so you can get a group easier. The rate at which you gain AAs is dependant upon the mob level that you're killing, so its hard to say if the bar will go up faster at 51 as compared to 60. If you're asking whether the AA bar requires less exp for the General skills as compared to the others... no. An AA is an AA. You don't turn on AA01 or AA02, you turn on your AA bar and when you ding you can spend the points in one of the AAs. Press the 'v' in game and you can hopefully see what i mean :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 in General -&gt; Combat Fury 3 -&gt; Ambidex if you dual wield often -&gt; Flurry -&gt; then it's a tossup between Tactical Mastery/Raging Flurry/Fury of the Ages/Punishing Blade if you use 2h weapons often.<br />
<br />
Generally 2h is &gt; 1h for offense so you can probably skip Ambidex and grab Punishing Blade as long as your 2h weapon is solid.<br />
<br />
Also the rate at which you get TM/RF/PB/FotA are determined by what level you are. If you're already at 65 then you can just pick and choose but if you accrue AA as you march to 65 then you can grab 1 level of each, then grab the 2nd level of each...<br />
<br />
Rampage would be nice to get but not really essential unless you AE often.</div></div><hr />

They increase your mitigation / avoidance abilities (and yes, the 10 percent is in the equation somewhere, but only the Sony programmers know for sure how the numbers are used :P )<br />

Anyhoo, they reduce the damage you take in melee, just not quite how it's posted in this thread.</div></div><hr />

As far as a defensive track, I was suggested: Run 3, Regen 3, ND3, CA3, AET, CS3, PE, ID5, LR5, TM3 in approx that order :)</div></div><hr />

The value of a no fail taunt is immeasurable at times, better to have it and not use it then not have it and need it.</div></div><hr />

I think I'd go Run3, regen3, nd3, AT, CA1, CS1, PE, PD3, TM1, SE1, CA3, LR5, CS3, ID5, TM3, SE3 for the &quot;most bang fer yer buck&quot; route, however.. this also requires level 65 after PE unless you stagger some of the later POP AAs</div></div><hr />

<br />
After 65 get AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
AE Taunt is overhyped unless your doing a lot of raiding before 65 and your the MT or your doing post velious stuff that requires multiple tanks.  <br />
<br />
AE Taunt has a 15minute waiting period on it.  So if you need it all the time you wont have it most of the time, in groups.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of slowers out there that just diserve to die.<br />
<br />
Also I was comparing AA exp with a lvl 62 and im 65<br />
He went up 23% and I went up 20% with both 100% in aa.<br />
I get 87% of the exp he does.  Considering you can get groups 3x easyer at 65, its best to get 65.<br />
<br />
I should really do more comparisions though.</div></div><hr />

Regen AA does stack with natural racial regen, but is not effected by the racial multiplier for regen.   IE. Every person who gets AA regen gets 1 HP / tick per level of AA.  Originally trolls who picked up the regen AA were getting more than 1HP (I think I remember 2 or 3),  but that was changed a while back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my mind, if you are a MT then you want CS first. CS results in smoother damage, CA in spikey damage. Your healers want you taking smooth damage.<br />
<br />
Just to use a few numbers to illustrate what I mean, with exageration of the affects. Would you rather get hit for 1000,0,1000,0 or 500,500,500,500. <br />
<br />
Perhaps someone has done some parsing and shown that the effects of CA are greater than CS?<br />
<br />
Obviously having both is best, and I'm keeping both equal, but I always buy the CS rank before the CA rank.<br />
<br />
Puzzled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be wrong on this, but I'm pretty sure that CS isn't really any smoother than CA.  It increases the chance that you'll mitigate part of the damage - it doesn't just reduce the top hit by a set percentage.<br />
<br />
Edit: So as I understand it, your above CS example might be 1000, 250, 1000, 250, with the outright misses being replaced by mitigated hits, and obviously the misses are better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I understand that CS biases your damage taken towards the lower end of the mobs possible hits but still, if CA and CS have the same net effect on the total damage taken then CS is the better skill due to it being smoother. <br />
<br />
If someone can say with CA you absolutely take less damage then with CS then I'll start working LR to 5 before I work on ID at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with spikes in damage there are other things to considered.<br />
Less hits on rampage mobs makes the life of the rampage tank much easier.<br />
Its one of the reasons our MA and myself (depending who is assigened tank for the encounter) use evasive a lot more now.<br />
With CA3/LR5 i was able to tank just fine (i went past CS1 only after I finished LR) in Luclin and PoP although we havent done anything harder than Behemoth,TT, Carpin, Grummus, Aerin'Dar.<br />
Less hits also means less stuns, so you will have an easier time holding agro, especially in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Gnomb's reply makes a lot of sense, avoiding being stunned is a very good point indeed.<br />
<br />
Indeed if it were the case of purely not being hit some extra times and being hit for less on average then my own first postulate would stand and CS would be better than CA. Given that each has the same increase in avoidance or mitigation* the mitigation is preferable as it leads to smoother damage taken, easier CHeal chains, less MT deaths, less tank switches, less wipeouts.<br />

<br />
Anyone have any information - testing or rumor - about Fear Resistance (Archetype AA) and Warcry (Class AA)?<br />
<br />
How effect if FR? How often does it seem to affect your fear duration/resists? In particular, did you find it helping in fights against mobs that have stupid high pentalties to their fear resists (a la HoH trial dragon)?<br />
<br />
How long does Warcry last at each level? Does it function properly (allow total fear immunity to your group)? What is the range for it, when you &quot;click&quot; it, for your group members?<br />
<br />
Any information at all? It's 30 points to max out at Warcry 3, but it's an option I've been considering, in order to make a Dragon-slaying team...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CS doesn't work like defensive.  The average hit against you does go down but your min and max hits remain the same.  With defensive not only does your average go down but so does your max hit.  So with defensive a healer can reliably increase the time between CHs for the duration of the /disc because there is no chance that you will get a string of hits for the max damage or even close to max damage.<br />
<br />
The advantage that CA has over CS as others have mentioned is that you can't mitigate a proc.  So with CA you'll take 10% less damage due to misses and be affected by 10% less procs.  With CS you'll take 10% less damage due to mitigation but you'll still get hit with the full effect of all procs because you were still hit the same number of times.  Against a mob that doesn't proc anything the affect should be identical.</div></div><hr />

The chance of getting a 'bad' round with sufficient AC are low enough not worry about it.  If it happens, just suck it up and move on.  I had one round in Fire where one of the Phoenixes did 7.2k in 3 hits and killed me, and that round also happened to be more damage than his last 8 rounds put together.  Freak accidents like that happen and there's no use worrying about it.</div></div><hr />

If you tank major mobs for a guild you want both avoidance and mitigation maxed anyway.<br />
Progression through both CA/LR and CS/ID was noticable when you exp in the same spot (CoD entrance duo with my cleric).</div></div><hr />

CF level 3 is right about 5.43% at level 65 with all melee stats at 305 - thats based off a solid sample set of 15,000 hits, so any variance would be negligble.<br />
<br />
CA is a direct, measurable increase to the % of missed attacks from a mob, I did extensive testing with ST golems back when I got it - it does not affect special defences, ie block,dodge, etc, but does directly increase the miss% of a mob... Preliminary testing shows LR to be 1% per level, will post conclusive results once I build up a large enough sample set</div></div><hr />

Noone is talking about that, some people mention regen3. But what about the Innate STR/STA... Whats the catch with that? Just wondering since my lill warlady turned 61 now and I am planning on doing some AAs for a change.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not up to big adventures, havent seen much of the old zones since i am quite an eq newb. I am mostly grouping with guildies and RL friends, so i havent had any troubles yet with not finding a group as a low lvl war. And most of the time I have a healer around (RL partner=63 druid)<br />
<br />
So in this case, isnt getting additional stats (I am a bit low on STA) more valuable than a better regen rate?</div></div><hr />

Sorry but that's wrong, you cannot avoid a proc - they go off on a hit OR a miss.</div></div><hr />

LR 1 showed a boost of 1.1% misses compared to pre-LR1... LR 5, however, is only showing a boost of 2.6% over LR1, total of 3.7% additional misses..LR5 sample set only half the size of prior sets, still building it up, but shouldn't vary by more than 0.2-0.3% at this point, if that much.....not a fully scientific test, as this was numerous mobs over the course of exping, but should be reasonably accurate, since all soldiers of fire are 65, and had same buffs throughout the course of parsing</div></div><hr />

Parse results on FotA vs CF3<br />
<br />
CF3 - 14,965 hits, 812 crits - 5.43%<br />
FotA1 - 4067 hits, 296 crits - 7.27%<br />
FotA2 - 7176 hits, 543 crits - 7.57%<br />
FotA3 - 3435 hits, 289 crits - 8.41%  (was 13.85% of damage dealt) &lt;--still building up stat pool on this one for final comparison, went through first two levels a bit quick to get a really solid stat set<br />
<br />
So......FotA1 VERY worth it for the points you spend, 1.84% boost for first level, compared to 1.14% boost for the next two levels combined......so if you're working up your offensive AAs.....grab FotA1 quick, but save the second two levels until you're towards the end...</div></div><hr />

20,623 hits, 1714 crits, 8.31% crit rate for 13.26% of damage.. pretty much right on target with previous set... looks like right about 3% boost for FotA, with the majority of that coming from the first point...standard diminishing returns. =)</div></div><hr />
