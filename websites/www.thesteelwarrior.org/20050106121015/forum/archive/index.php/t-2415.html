<br />
It looks like they changed the spell effect recently <br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3129<br />
<br />
as it includes a stun part now.<br />
Not to mention that the resulting proc is improved via ingenuity AA.<br />
Dual EB weapons with a dd proc and stun are probably the best you can get for agro unless you get a BoW and even then it will be better if you dont tank PoP elemental or time bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aten gloves are clickable from inventory so when u upgrade to elemental or better you can still use them with out swapping them in...<br />

As i am saving for a BoW atm I dont consider it an option unless AHR drops her mask.<br />
I admit though that cast time is a tad too long considering the duration of the buff.<br />
<br />
I am in dilemma atm, as i have the highest dkp of our warriors right now, so would probably get the next BoW drop(if one drops).<br />
But AHR mask or BP (we had 0 bp drops off cursed, seru or AHR so far, no robe of emperor either) might make me consider putting BoW back in priority.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure (read 99.9%) that focus effects (including FB) don't work on procs or rightclicks unless you have the spell in your spellbook. Since we don't have spellbooks, they won't work. Try an ID focus on a DD proc, or a duration focus on with primal procs.<br />
<br />
These call_of additional procs are great for additional agro. Aten gloves come out on top by virtue of their 0.5sec cast time meaning you can recast during combat if you spam it a couple of times.</div></div><hr />
