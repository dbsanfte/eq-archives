<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally did it.  Ding 65!  Got my Run3 and Regen1 through flagging, and the only actual AAXP done was 3% when I turned it on one bad day in 61 when I wanted to see a blue line move. <br />
<br />
My gear is visible on the side.  I've got 31% haste, lots of FH gear, and Droga weapons + GSoT.  All seems fine for 65 by my guess.  <br />
<br />
On raids, I've played SA and ended up having to finish a Vindi fight when the MA went down.  I've done one night in BoT where I tanked Kriggers (ow) and mini's.  <br />
<br />
Now at 65, I thought things could only get better.  Until the wake up call last night in LDoN...<br />
<br />
Group of guildies/non-guildies that I've hunted with before in LDoN in a DPS role with my GSo4W with a good friend tanking (65, nice gear, great agro weapon w/ Anger III, tons of AA).  We're doing Guk, of which I've only done twice before (one at level 50, one at 64) and he asks if I want to tank while he DPS's and eats dinner.  Having just made 65, tanked HoH like its Paludal, and surviving Vindi and BoT just days before, I'm gung ho.  I decide to use my unaug'd CHoS/SoBS since I was getting a little better agro in HoH with that, then switch to GSoT if I was taking a bit too much damage.  I do my usual HP check, 6700 buffed, and for the first time in a long time I get &quot;ow&quot;, &quot;cringe&quot;, and a scary &quot;&gt;&lt;&quot; response from the cleric.  I'm used to pleasing clerics with my hp checks, so I'm worried now.  But more than confident in my group, we head on in.  It's my first all 65 LDoN, and I'm excited!<br />
<br />
First two mobs come in, chanter eyeballs, and debuff me halfway right off the bat.  Catches all but one of my shammy buffs (done with a bot before the dungeon).  Get through those, another one is pulled, catches my virtue - down to 4400hps and though the cleric tries hard, I'm dead.  Oh well, we have the other tank, they finish up the pull, and I'm back rezzed in.  Rebuff and now at 5800hp without my shammy buffs.  Already lookin bad.<br />
<br />
Pulls keep comin, and with my lower hp total I'm getting creamed with riposte damage, and the cleric and chanter is running lom (chanter having to slow everything, something not needed when the other warrior tanks).  I switch to GSoT, and agro gets wild and we get some ping-ponging now.  Grr...I'm really getting frustrated by this point.  Pulls have slowed, mana still isn't happy, and with some bad luck on drops we're running behind and actually might lose.  The other warrior starts to tank, and the difference right off the bad is huge.  He's tanking mobs (2 at a time at times for a while) with no slow, there's no ping-pong agro, chanter and cleric mana is looking better, and everything is just smoother.  We end up winning the LDoN with 15 minutes to spare (pretty bad for us) and head out.<br />
<br />
I really felt bad after this.  I thought by rushing to 65 I'd be just fine to tackle pretty much anything I came across in terms of xp'ing.  Now I'm not so sure.  My fear is now, when I'm picked up LFG, I'm not going to be able to handle tanking.  I have to admit, I'd be a little scared now if I was in a pick up group and got a 65 warrior without even a title.  <br />
<br />
Did I goof up?  Is the 65 &gt; all creating warriors who can't meet the demands of some of the content they may encounter?<br />
<br />
This may come across a little whiney, but I hate letting my group down, and there's no doubt I did last night.  If it was a pick up group, we would have likely lost, and I would have been probably put on a few &quot;Do Not Group&quot; lists.  <br />
<br />
I'm more than just a little concerned now - am I overreacting?  I need more AA - but I now seem like a sub-par tank for good AA spots.  I need more LDoN points for agro augs, but if they turn out like last night, I'm doubting my ability to do all 65 groups LDoN.<br />
<br />
Advice? Suggestions?  Looking back, I'm really wishing I slowed down, did more LDoN's for Anger augs, and a few AA's under my belt for at least ND3 and maybe some CA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you need equip, and HP aa's, asap.<br />
<br />
You can't operate with 6700 buffed for very long.<br />
<br />
I've got 8.6, and I get eaten alive.<br />
<br />
Trust me man, just work on aa's in BoT, byt the time you're at 100 or so if you're in a raiding guild, you should be ok gear wise.<br />
<br />
Go for ornates.<br />

<br />
And I agree that going right to 65 was best. Levels &gt; AA<br />
<br />
You can always find something you have access to that maybe you can't quite handle. Just keep working on the gear and AA's. BoT or HoH are good spots to grind them out if your not comfortable tanking in LDoN till you have them.<br />
<br />
And I also agree with Anger3 for the GSot4W, more DPS, less riposte dmg, and will solve that agro issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got about 8.3k buffed and I don't get eaten in LDoN, in fact I generally have no problem tanking as many as 3 unslowed mobs and the cleric can keep up fairly easily.......then again the cleric i group with is a RL friend who has almost as many AA's and FT15 not counting MC3.....Not sure if its a diff in AA's taken or whatnot...but you have more HP and seem to have a harder time....<br />
<br />
Anyways, grinding to 65 &gt; ALL!!<br />
<br />
AA's come faster at 65 for several reasons, the most important being that you will sit LFG at 64 much longer then at 65. And you gain ZERO xp while sitting LFG.<br />
<br />
My advice is to get the HP AA's as fast you can and never look back, then get some Mitigation and avoidance aa's and you will be fine in LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, levels are more important than AA's, but only if you can handle the content at that level.  If you're struggling doing normal run of the mill 65 things, then you have to step back and find an easier place to XP for awhile while you build up your gear and AA foundation for your character.  Too many people assume they're going to be gods just because they're 65 because of how people talk around here.  That's definitely not the case.  <br />
<br />
i've got no experience in LDoN, but from how people talk, a normal should have been no problem for you.  IF you're sure it was a normal, I'm not sure what to tell  ya about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can tank in BoT, I don't see how you'd be having problems with ldon normals.  Eh if anything it's cause the chanter wasn't slowing the mobs or wasn't locking the mobs down fast enough on pulls where you have 3 beating on you.  No reason the chanter shouldn't be slowing if the tank has lower hp and low aa's, blame the cleric and chanters FT heh.<br />
<br />
Really though, if you can tank BoT mobs, ldon is a joke, just work on getting nd3 eh, no where to go but up from where you are really now that you start working on aa's and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in Normal 65 LDoN are much weaker than valor/HoH/BoT yard trash.  I tend to agree with the other posters, unless you were doing hard you shouldn't have had a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDON normal should have been less intense by far than BoT tanking.  I would agree with the above sentiment, did they want you to tank on a hard?  If so, shrug, imo it should have come as no surprise.  With CA CS ND maxed and PE, you might be able to tank hard, but before that, you would have to be really ballsy to tank hard.</div></div><hr />

Normal LDoN is pretty easy.<br />
Hard LDoN is impossible.<br />
<br />
I suspect they hit you with a hard mission.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AA's make an unbelievable difference in tanking. You made the right decision getting to 65 first but know your limitations. (ie stay the hell outta guk :p)<br />
<br />
Time to grind away at the AA's. I recommend HoH and Valor for you. The AA exp there is still decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As people above have stated, if it was an LDoN normal, you shouldn't have had any trouble.<br />
<br />
I know 2500 hp unbuffed monks who can take the beatings in LDoN normals. Yes, even Guk.<br />
<br />
What I think was happening was the group you were with wasn't used to dealing with your level of hit points. And was far more used to dealing with the hit points of your friend with the much higher HPs.<br />
<br />
A cleric who spends most of his or her time raiding, and hanging out with exceptionally high HP warriors gets into a habit of when to cast the heals. And they tend to unwind and be a bit lazier in casual XP group SETTINGS.<br />
<br />
I'm not blaming the cleric, mind you. I'm just saying a reasonable explanation for why you had such trouble early on MIGHT be that your groupmates weren't able to adjust to your level.<br />
<br />
EDIT: A good anecdote ... I used to notice this a lot when PoP first debuted. Prior to PoP, many healers I grouped with would wait till the warrior went berserk to start a CH. It was like a little timing thing. Or they'd wait till some set number, and it was usually pretty low ... like 30 percent or 25 percent health.<br />
<br />
Those first few weeks of PoP I saw soooooooo many tanks die because people had to ADJUST and start casting CH and other heals much earlier than what they had been doing for almost their entire career.<br />
<br />
It sounds like your troubles here are similar to those I've seen before ... the adjustment takes some getting used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do decide to stick around the LDoN scene to AA/gear up, the way to make your job the easiest is this... make your own groups, and get a pally to tank. GSo4W isnt terrible for dps, and you can tank adds in a pinch if you need too. Get a cleric, chanter, pally/sk/warrior, and 2 more dps classes. I prefer pet classes, but rogues are decent too, as are monks/rangers with their various utilities. Personally I can't stand seeing tons of people all sitting in a ldon camp all LFG.<br />
<br />
Log on, /who all cleric lfg. /who all chanter lfg. /who all dps lfg. Tons quicker than waiting for an invite to another group, and you get to tailor the group to your own specs. I've had 1 ldon group i didnt make myself, and we barely won. I'm 29-1 in groups ive made, with the only failure being because of the fact that the Gameless server is ghetto.<br />
<br />
Make a group, get the gear/aa's, be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This may come across a little whiney, but I hate letting my group down, and there's no doubt I did last night.

<br />
Your not coming across whiney in the least. You sound like someone who wants to improve thier play. Sounds like someone I would be happy to XP with.<br />
<br />
<br />
In guk (even in easy's), you get dispelled like a bastard. Way more than anywhere else. The eye's are the devil. ALWAYS have at least 2 clickies up. As a puller I seriously use 4-5 for LDON. My gf (the warrior) will have skelly and a few others up. Think of dispell's as a 1-2k nuke you cant resist if you dont have clickies.<br />
<br />
I would not worry too much about your gear. Do a lot of LDON normal's if your the MT, and try and do some LDON hard's if you are not. A lot of very decent gear drops in hards. <br />
<br />
What will make the biggest diff IMHO will be all the key defensive AA's for living and the offensive AA's for helping get/maintain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be fine tanking for LDON normal adventures.  I'd recommend not using any discs though unless something goes wrong and just Incite every mob  you pull for maximum aggro control.  Stay away from hard missions until you have the gear and AAs to handle it.  Getting hit for 992s by more than 1 mob will take you down fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Out of curiosity, why do you want a pally to tank in this situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Work on gear now. You did the right thing by rushing to 65 but you need to upgrade that gear. I'd work on AC too. When I first started my warrior AC was the best thing a warrior could have but when the AC cap was easy to meet everyone went to HP. <br />
<br />
Now, the AC cap has ben raised so that getting to 2000AC is very beneficial. The warriors called upon to MT in my guild are the ones that have high AC. <br />
<br />
Nobody outside the warriors has ever compared AC among the tanks but the usual MT order seems to be more AC dependent than HP dependent (most of our warriors have 9K to 9700 HP) - but the guys that have higher HP but sit at 1500 AC seem to get called to tank emperor crush while the guys around 2k are called to tank the elemental bosses.<br />
<br />
So even with about 7k HP, your still going to get trashed if your AC is 1300. Ornates/LDON are your friend if you don't do the raiding guild route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, you must have done a high risk dungeon. Even with no AA you should have no problem tanking normal risk adventures, the mobs are a lot easier than HoH or BoT. Without AAs, anyone would have a hard time tanking high risk, particularly unslowed. Work on getting ND, CS/CA and PE. That should be plenty to give your groups some breathing room.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, why do you want a pally to tank in this situation?Agro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benlin</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guk, in my experience is just simply the hardest Theme in LDON.<br />
<br />
I have, at best 6.9k hps and AC of 1350, and with most of the other themes I do just fine.  <br />
<br />
Guk I always struggle with, and you will need the AA to be able to tank that adventure well.<br />
<br />
Levels are a huge factor for tanking, but with that said I stopped at 60 and did ND3 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I advised getting a pally to tank, rather than another war or SK, is that a) they tend to have more group-friendly abilities and spells. b) As mentioned, aggro lock. If I'm in a group with another war who's tanking, and I'm using GSo4W, I will steal aggro. This happens much less frequently with pallies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After looking over the original poster's Magelo, I have some questions/comments for him:<br />
<br />
Your current STA is 194. Are you maxing out STA to 280 with shammie buffs? If not (and frankly, even if you are), I'd recommend getting that STA up closer to the 250 mark; that alone will be worth about 340 more HP's to you if that situation (loss of shammie buffs) happens again.<br />
<br />
How fast did you get to 65? Did you have a chance to max out all your skills? Some of your numbers for ATK and AC seem a tad low for the gear you're wearing.<br />
<br />
I'd also definitely recommend giving your gear the once-over and to consider replacing some of it. At this point given how generally low your STA is, I'd consider losing 10 or 15 HP's on an item if I was getting 5-6 STA on it instead. Don't do this for all items, but some of your items (like your mask and neckpiece) I'd replace with other items. Take a peek at my Magelo for some ideas (I use Amulet of Mummy Wrappings and Kylong Darkmail Visor, both fairly inexpensive yet reasonable upgrades; you could even take a group to go camp the visor, it's a fairly good camp).<br />
<br />
Also, if you have the plat, replace those 6/65 rings with Valorium Rings of Gallantry; that change alone will give you another 100 or so HP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You only need 220 stamina to cap with shammy buffs (well, 200 I guess if you want to use Primal Essence, but most people don't want to go that route).  His skills are maxed and his AC/atk jive with those numbers for no vengeance and the general Fierce range of gear.  It's not really until NToV+ and a lot of Kizraks that warriors start getting over 1300/1400 ac unbuffed without giving up a lot of HP.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think you just got a shitty group to be honest.  What you have should be sufficient really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions, I will check them out for sure.  My stamina usually tops out with shammy buffs, and since I have a pocket shaman bot I never really worry about it - dispelling mobs were not expected by me, so preparing for that with more stat items is a great suggestion. <br />
<br />
Went for a little xp'ing in PoV tonight and I was right back in the groove, with zero tanking problems.  Confidence restored somewhat.<br />
<br />
Thought about it, and came to the conclusion that the group was simply used to a bigger, badder tank and we weren't expecting the large disparity between a 65 tank with no real AA's and one with some LDoN armor, a better agro weapon, and all defensive and HP AA's.  Looking back, it's simply surprising to see how different tanks at 65 can be.  And that's really my biggest concern. Tactics for one 65 warrior simply might not fit when another 65 warrior steps in.<br />
<br />
How will the group I join up with be able to really distinguish how I'm going to tank, especially if they're recruiting me for the job based solely on level?  The group last night was actually amazing (noting how quickly we recovered the adventure once the other tank took tanking duties) -  a testament to how a well balanced warrior can really tip the scales of a fight.  Well, a well balance warrior who doesn't get massively dispelled!  I can't help but think that the dungeon itself it more difficult than I'm used to as well, which contributed to me struggling.  <br />
<br />
Think I was just a little over my head, and stepping back a little in terms of difficulty kind of showed me that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find Tak to be harder than Guk if lacking on crowd control.  <br />
<br />
If you have slow and/or CC, then Guk is by far the hardest.<br />
<br />
One thing people overlook a lot with normal LDoN is that enchanters haste their friends 70%.  Put that on a 400ish hitting normal LDoN mob and now it's suddenly as if it's double for 680 which is high end PoP mobs.  Normal, unhasted mobs in LDoN do not promise a serious danger to people, but if you pull a few around a shaman or an enchanter be prepared for a good deal of pain, even on normal, if you cannot slow them.  I'm not sure what kind of haste NPC shamans use, but I'm guessing it's the 50% one, which is still a good chunk of extra damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good healers normally ask (or ascertain your hp's from the first few fights) and adjust their healing patterns to suit whats best.  I normally just give a HP xxxx AC xxxx before we zone if the healer does not ask.<br />
<br />
This is just about Normal setting in LDON.<br />
<br />
Really good LDON groups (more so the puller), quickly work out what pull rate works best for the group.  To succed in LDON its more the abilities of the players, than just the equipment the players have in LDON. (of course going in with all crafted is not going to cut it hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pal think of it as steps in a progression.  Getting 65 was the first necessary step.  Now you need to work on getting gear/AAs.  There is a world of difference between a level 65 with little AA and average gear, and a level 65 with 100+ AA and even moderately good Elemental gear.  The gear and AA will come, getting 65 was the first step, so you did the right thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well Its pretty much the same these days.  Level 65 is quickly becoming a halfway stop what with so many aa, keys, ldon points for armor or raid content to advance through.<br />
<br />
Just hang in there and slowly get upgrades when you can. Going for hp and def aa first is also a good idea.<br />
<br />
Its good imo you went 65 first, especially if you can tank in POP.  Because people never ask you how many aa you have before you join a group. After aa exping a while you will not be able to imagine how you sat through the grind of levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;dispelling mobs were not expected by me, so preparing for that with more stat items is a great suggestion. &quot;<br />
<br />
The best way to deal with a dispelling mob is to have an insta clicky item. Be it a bracer of the hidden, or a shrunken goblin skull earring, or whatever. That way the buffs you want to keep stay up. The buffs you don't care about and can replenish with the click of a button are the ones that get dispelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will the group I join up with be able to really distinguish how I'm going to tank, especially if they're recruiting me for the job based solely on level? &quot;<br />
<br />
As someone stated before, let the healer know how many hit points you're working with. Then it's their job to adjust. Not much you can do about it, heh.<br />
<br />
&quot; I can't help but think that the dungeon itself it more difficult than I'm used to as well, which contributed to me struggling. &quot;<br />
<br />
The hardest problem in Guk isn't the dispells. You'll encounter dispelling mobs in each and every dungeon of LDoN. Guk just has them closer to the entrances. Which means you encounter them earlier and depending on mob distribution/collection item distribution may have to deal with more of them during your adventure.<br />
<br />
(Case in point ... Mistmoore, everyone's favorite LDoN zone has a ton of casters in their dungeons, and some do indeed dispell. However, the casters are almost always packed in the back of the zones, and by the time you get to them you only need like 4 more kills or 2 more items or whatever).<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is that unless you were having to tank multiple monsters at the same time, or you were tanking high risk versions of the guk frogs, they're not that hard to tank completely unbuffed.<br />
<br />
I pull in LDoN a lot, and oftentimes I stand there, taking a bit of a beating until the &quot;add&quot; is mezzed.<br />
<br />
The above poster mentioned haste may have been an issue. Which is certainly possible since there are quite a few shamans in Guk.<br />
<br />
But, still, Guk ... don't be intimidated by it. You'll encounter the exact same situations with the same types of mobs in Tak, Rujark, Mistmoore and Miragul's. It just won't be spooky frogs and annoying beholders.<br />
<br />
And for the most part you can stand up to those mobs buffless, IF your healer and you are on the same page.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

It's really nice when the Cheal isnt going to land in time, or you've gotten more than 3 or 4 mobs in camp and your chanter needs time to get them under control.  It sounds to me like you're very similar in ac and hps to me,  (64 8AA, mostly helanic tundra armor, droga weapons, and GSoT), and I usually get complemented on how well I tank in PoV, BoT, tactics and the like.    LDoN is a little tougher aggro wise, but as long as everyone knows what they're doing, it shouldn't be that tough to deal with.  Just keep a cool head, and make sure you're supporting cast knows how many hps you have.  As has been stated previously, it sounds like your support classes got lazy because they were used to a beefier tank, and couldnt adjust to you.</div></div><hr />

I believe working on your equipment a touch will get you into more of a comfort zone then that 65 warrior thingy in front of your name.  What is the big difference between a 60 warrior with 100 aa and a 65 warrior with the same aa? Beyond hp (and now new discs) there isnt that much of a dilly between the two, at least in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=601235<br />
<br />
I am in the ldon tweener stage, I will get invites rather quickly from chars in the late 50's to low 60's, but rarely get invited into the 65 groups, which gets me the big addy puntos.  However, if you tank a couple of times for the same people, they will remember how ya did IF you were: really good, or really bad.  I am usually a really good tank, if i stay away from the tequila when eq'ing, hence I have been getting into the 65 groups more often, even tho i am not 65.  If you compare my magelo to yours, our gear is pretty close, it differs in two parts:  I am a stamina junkie, and even tho it means i do not get much out of a shammy sta buff, it also means it cannot be dispelled either.  I don't know what flags you have but getting your flags will make your charm pretty powerful. I think I am halfway through the pop progression and it helps a lot with aa and stats/hp.  I am done babbling.  There is no need to race to 65 in my eyes, unless you are doin serious raiding.  Then you will need 65 for resists, and it is quite noticeable (Ntov at 65 was almost a joke with how puny the ae's were.)  Myself, all I wanted was to get to 62 so I could mebbe get into some bot open raids so I have a better chance at some more ornate.  After I got 62 I do one ldon normal exp, then do the next all aa exp.  But then again, to each their own.<br />

Basically you were caught unaware is all. The dps of LDoN mobs are indeed much lower than PoP, but the speed and intensity of fighting seem quite a bit higher. The tempo of LDoN is speed, Speed, SPEED! They got used to playing with the other tank and did not adjust properly to you. You were not prepped for the debuff mobs that Guk is so full of.<br />
<br />
I have a routine for junk buffs for LDoN that has become second nature:<br />
Slot 1 = Ornate Gauntlet Haste<br />
Slot 2 = Dmg Shield from Ragefire Arms ( lasts 8 minutes or so )<br />
Slot 3 = Wood Elf Illusion<br />
<br />
Gaunts recast in about 4 sec or so, can cast those mid fight if I time it. DMG shield is over written by druid/ranger/mage etc if there is one in group, or normally a heal over time takes up that spot. Wood Elf crown is 7 sec or so clicky so it is np to refresh. All of the above are useful but can be rebuffed easily by me, so easily expendable to debuffs. <br />
<br />
Your hp are fine for LDoN, it only takes a bit of preparation and some adaption by your group members. Before they or you know it, your hp will be jumping up 400+ from ND3, another 150 or so from PE, plus STA augs won and various loot aquired. Your defensive AA will really start to shine and you will know the difference. Don't worry, just advance normally and consistently and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When LDoN first came out, I was around lvl 60 or so. No one knew what they were doing, and it was HARD. Guk was easily the worst. I racked up the failures and quickly came to hate LDoN! I hated the &quot;You're a FAILURE MUAHAHA&quot; messages, I hated dying in dungeons, and I hated most of the people that I was grouping with.<br />
<br />
Cut scene to several months later: I'm 65, just started my def/hp AAs (have ND2, working on 3 atm), I'm smithing in PoK with LFG on or something, and someone asks me if I want to do an LDoN group. I do /who all that_person01 and it's a 65 ranger I met while working on CoV faction in Kael. Part of me says &quot;Hit your '/r No thanks, I'm kinda sick of LDoN, sorry =-/,' hotkey, but for some reason I give in =-o (BTW she's in sro &gt;.&lt;) To make a longer story short, it was EASY. LDoN normal is a joke. I have only mediocre equipment - right around 4khp and 1200ac - and like 11AAs i think, but there really was no contest. At one point, the ranger had a few adds and decided to just suicide away from the group so as not to train us. It was a nice good samaratin thing to do, but it was kinda funny when the chanter said, &quot;Bah you shoulda just brought em, even I can tank this crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
We ended up doing 2 guk adventures with pretty much the same core group, both successful in 30-40 minutes. I even won a 12hp aug $$. I think my attitude towards LDoN has changed. It's way easier to tank than say BoT, which even with my non-uber gear is pretty trivial besides the occasional slow-resistant-kriger (&lt;3 furious). I like to think that it's rewarding, but I've yet to rack up enough points for even one anger aug or royal attendant piece. The only thing that still really irks me is the fact that there are a lot of people that suck at EQ doing LDoN.<br />
<br />
paladiin: I didn't mean to go off on a tangent here, but with your equipment I think you must have unwittingly been tanking a hard. (Is there an echo in here?) Just keep up the good work man. Get some AAs, keep upgrading your armor as you can, and you'll be soloing light blues in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because people never ask you how many aa you have before you join a group <br />
<br />
 Actually, people noticing that I'm a Veteran at 63 run about 50/50, and the notices are always positive. Racing's fine and valid, but AA's first can sometimes be a good thing as well - especially if you have bad starting stats which you can correct, or if you have gear that you can't easily replace with better. In those cases, the boost from AA are good, and the effort to get them fairly minimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A) Guk is the debbil.  Chanter, Shaman, Necro and SK mobs around every corner, bad social agro, bad geometry.  I pull for most of the LDoNs I do, hards preferred, and Guk is my least favorite, with Tak a close second.  Sounds like you were probably pushing the limits a little and the pells made it 4x worse.  Did haste get pelled?  That would have totally destroyed your hate generation.<br />
<br />
B) Gear.  I've always said that tanks are half gear, half skill, but if you don't have one the other won't do you much good.  Slap an Ang 3 on your GSoTFW.  It's a great weapon and aug'd up will last you a long time.  Or, alternately try Ang 2 on each of your 1hers.  Other folks here probably know these weapons better than I (been spoiled too long) and can probably give you better aug advice on them, but get your hate generation taken care of first.  All the armor in the world don't mean dick if you can't piss off the mob and make it hit you.  Right now I'd advise against blowing a lot of plat on Ornate molds, etc.  New expansion coming out in less than a month.  There will be lots of new stuff, and historically, new expansion = better deals on older gear.  New expansion stuff will take top spots on lists of hot items, and people will be trying to unload mules and banks to get plat to buy all the new shinies.<br />
<br />
C) AA.  Do whatever you have to to get the core War AA: ND, CA, CS, AET, PE.  It will make a significant difference and should let you move into the areas where you can find upgrades - LDoN, etc.  PD, LR, ID, etc. you'll be fine working on doing LDoNs or whatever new xp zones show up in GoD, etc.<br />

Rushing to 65 means you did the smart move.<br />
<br />
Those who rush to 65 always say it was the smart move.  Just as all the lemmings in a herd think they're doing the right thing....even as they all go over the cliff together with the smug look of superiority on their faces.<br />
<br />
Basically, everyone who plays daily will eventually get to 65 and eventually have a lot of AA.<br />
<br />
The two extremes of strategy are to rush to 65, generally outrunning your gear and many of your skills, and then make up for it on the backside.<br />
<br />
The other extreme is to go hard into AA at 51, giving you much more time to acquire gear and build up all of your skills, while filling in your AA to your heart's content.<br />
<br />
The bad thing about strategy one is usually when you arrive at 65 you're just a noobie again, until you get your AA and gear caught up with your level.<br />
<br />
The bad thing about strategy two is.....hmmm....well.....hmmm.  I dunno, I guess you get to play the game longer before you get bored.  And you don't get to feel what it's like to be a level 65 noobie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmm.  In my case, Shaik, there was a much more specific upside to getting level 65.  Several more specific upsides, in fact.<br />
<br />
1) I could tank in LDoN for my level 65 friends (a bard and an enchanter).  Before I hit 65, we had to be very careful to keep the average level below 63.  While I could have tanked level-65 missions at level 60 if I'd had maxed defensive AA's, it's honestly a lot quicker to go from 60 to 65 than it is to get the 80 or 90 AA's needed for that.<br />
<br />
2) I could be a better tank for my guild.  When I hit 65, my guild's average level was probably around 60 on most raids.  Having a high-level MT did more good for my guild than having a lower-level MT with more AA, in terms of which mobs it was reasonable to tackle.<br />
<br />
3) being 65, with the (small, but measurable) increase in XP rate that that brings, makes it easier for me to sort of semi kind of keep up with my uberguild friends.  If I were level 60, I'd be falling behind even faster than I am, as I'd only be getting perhaps half or 2/3 of an AA per week, instead of one AA per week.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
Indeed, your way of doing things works better if your friends are advancing slowly, if you would rather play the game at each level in full rather than tank the toughest mobs you possibly can, and if your advancement over time is not so important to you.  And all of these are valid ways to play.<br />
<br />
They simply aren't mine.<br />

Anyone who does pure AA at level 51 is making a huge mistake. And for the record, I got 20 AA or so at level 61 and I regret it. I should have gone straight to 65.</div></div><hr />

This is a matter of taste, not opinion.  I like white chocolate, my girlfriend likes dark chocolate.  She regrets the time she bought white chocolate, thinking it looked good.<br />
<br />
How can it be a mistake if there's no downside?  How can rushing to 65 be the smart move?<br />
<br />
There has to be a context within which to make judgements such as these.  There can be no right or wrong way, there are simply choices each with pros and cons.<br />
<br />
Personally, I can see no reason to arrive at 65 before I have obtained both the gear and the essential skill and AA commensurate with that level.<br />
<br />
Having taken this approach, I am free to accumulate wealth and skills and Adventure points.  I am spared the mindless exp grinds, and the stupid group lists of the &quot;best&quot; exp camps.<br />
<br />
Why do you believe rushing to 65 is the way?  I have still heard no explanation for it based on anything objective.</div></div><hr />

Because other than getting Runspeed, there is nothing AA-wise at level 51 or level 60 which equates to the value added to your character by being Level 65.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple. A level 65 with 0 AA &gt; Level 60 with 300 AA.</div></div><hr />

This is a specious argument.  Better for what, and to whom?<br />
<br />
You are not making a rational comparison, in that you have not stated the definition of &quot;better&quot;, or &quot;value&quot;.<br />
<br />
A Camaro is better than a VW for drag racing.  A VW is better than a Camaro for getting into parking spaces in Manhattan, or going long distances for little money.<br />
<br />
Which is better, a VW or a Camaro?<br />
<br />
There is no answer to that question when the question is asked out of context.  There is no meaning to your claim, when you claim it out of context.<br />
<br />
What is the context when you say better?  But the reality is, your context will still be a matter of taste.<br />
<br />
Therefore it cannot be said that any one strategy is better than any other, for this is a game intended for personal entertainment.  If you are enjoying the game, then your strategy is the best.</div></div><hr />

But as said before, getting to 65 before grinding out aa's ( well besides rs3 ) will help out your lfg circumstance, help out your guild in tanking opportunities if your part of one, and it will be faster. Getting an aa at 65 is a shit load faster than getting it at 51 or even 60. But like people have said, play the game how you want to, but the cookie cutter aa path is the more efficient path.</div></div><hr />

I am going to go out on a limb here and guess you are not 65. I say that because you are not grasping the concept of how fast AA flies at level 65. <br />
<br />
In normal exp group settings, what would you estimate the length of time it woud take someone to go from 0 percent into 51 to level 52? 4 hours? 5?<br />
<br />
If they do AA at level 51, it will still take them the SAME time to complete an AA. <br />
<br />
At level 65 it takes me just over one hour to get an AA. For elemental flagged toons, it takes them 30 to 45 mins to get an AA done (all in normal exp group settings).<br />
<br />
If you do AA at level 51 you are WASTING your time. Also, as you may be aware, there are no good AA's to do at level 51 other than run3 (and metab 3 if you want to save plat on stat food).</div></div><hr />

I didn't say a 65 warrior was a better tank than a 63 one with 30 aa. But then again perception does not always follow reason. EQ players are generally lazy, they are not going to sift through all the details of a tank when they are looking for one. Two tanks lfg, one 63 one 65, I know which one will have a much better chance of getting picked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't outrun your skills, unless you're powerlevelled. I've yet to meet a 65 warrior who doesn't have their weapon skills, offense and defense maxxed.<br />
<br />
There's nothing to make up for on the backside.<br />
<br />
I guess you probably didn't mean to use the word skill.<br />
<br />
But I can assure you a level 65 warrior with ZERO AA, and ZERO flags, NOT in a raiding guild can tank ANYTHING they come across with a smattering of gear that is standard for warriors of that level-situation.<br />
<br />
LDoNs? Freakin 2500 hp MONKS can tank those. There's no doubt in my mind a non-AA'd level 65 warrior with sub-par gear can tank an LDoN. I've been grouped with them before in LDoNs and WON.<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder? You don't need much to tank in there. Just a good healer.<br />
<br />
Halls of Honor? The gravy train. Again, it's less about the skills/aa's of the tank and far more about the healer support the group has.<br />
<br />
Look at this way ...<br />
<br />
IF your ultimate goal is to raid and get that level of gear and participate in that level of the game, then you HAVE to get to level 65 first. That's just how it is.<br />
<br />
IF your ultimate goal is to NOT raid, there is no good reason to AA either. The advantage you gain from turning red cons into dark blue cons is substantial during your actual ENCOUNTERS with these monsters. And only a few very expensive AAs, which are also restricted to level 61+ can make up that difference ANYWAYS.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying racing to 65 is for everyone. You play your way. Others play their way.<br />
<br />
Just realize that for the most part, the biggest advantage you gain in everquest is by turning monsters into dark blue cons. It has a HUGE affect on the combat engine on your side of things.<br />
<br />
So AAs are all nice and good. And you should play at your own pace and have fun and do whatever the heck you feel like doing.<br />
<br />
But 65 is more of a power boost than any AA you can obtain at level 51, and still a much more palpable boost in power and effectiveness than any AA you can obtain at level 55.<br />
<br />
Sub-par gear, well that's your own damn problem. We all have gear issues.<br />
<br />

God, are you STILL spouting this shit?  Every time you make a post like this you lose more and more credibility.  <br />
<br />
At level 51, you have 200 in your skills, 1hb, 1hs, 2hs, 2hb, piercing, and 210 in defense and offense.  By wasting time dicking around with AA's at level 51, you STAY there.  You gain minimal stat gains and your skill gains go nowhere.  Gaining 40 offense/defense and 50 in your weapon skills is leaps and bounds over any AA's you can get at level 51, and at level 55 or 59 for that matter.  Your aggro range is decreased as you level up, you get more HP, more AC, a better chance to hit, and last but not least YOU GET DISCIPLINES.  Trust me, you at level 51, with your general skills maxed would still be a worse choice for a tank than a level 52 with no AA's because he has Evasive, and nothing you have would ever touch that.<br />

<br />
Run 3 - Useful whenever you can dedicate the time to getting it!<br />
Regen 3 - Helps when farming greenies. Plus you need to spend 6 points in General.<br />
ND3 - Makes up for weak gear by giving you 10% more base HPs (IE. Level/Gear HPs, NOT buff HPs). This is the BEST 12 AA points I've spent sofar :) plus More HP = Less getting your ass handed to you by mobs.<br />
<br />
Everything else can wait unless you want to put some things into other shit like 1 point into Ingenuity to show off with your weapon procs n stuff.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see a single parse showing significant advantages in tanking due to levels.  Yet, I have parses showing no difference at all as I leveled from 60 to 65.

I am going to go out on a limb here and guess you are not 65. I say that because you are not grasping the concept of how fast AA flies at level 65.<br />
<br />
That sound you hear is a limb cracking.  I have two 65 level characters on Xegony, which I've abandoned.<br />
<br />
I have a 63 Shaman and my warrior on Torv.  Yes, I'm aware that if I wanted to I could spend all my time at boring, mindless, pathetic XP camps grinding to 65.<br />
<br />
Then turn around and spend all my time at boring, mindless, pathetic XP camps grinding AA.<br />
<br />
Yes, AA can go faster at mindless, boring, pathetic XP camps when you're level 65.<br />
<br />
If you do AA at level 51 you are WASTING your time. <br />
<br />
And yet somehow all the fun I have with all my friends in LDoN doesn't seem at all like a waste!<br />
<br />
Maybe what we have here is a difference in, oh I dunno, hmmm.....goals???  Or maybe our....well....*tastes* in what constitutes fun differ?<br />
<br />
Do I hear an echo?  Oh no, it's just you repeating the same worn and irelevant argument.<br />
<br />
If you refuse to make any attempt whatsoever to comprehend my clearly stated and well written explanations, than you will seem like a broken record.<br />
<br />
If your goal is to get to 65 as fast as possible, than anything that slows that process will seem a waste of time to you.<br />
<br />
If you see your role in the game as being a tool for others, or a pawn for some guild, and that is worthy to you, than you will think your failure to get to 65 as fast as possible somehow harms others.<br />
<br />
When you are mature enough to realize that this isn't the pixelated NFL, but rather a form of personal entertainment (you know, Sony Online *Entertainment*), than you may begin to realize that your personal goals do not encompass the entirety of meaning for this game.</div></div><hr />

Your smug babbling with a total lack of real information is getting old fast.  Now people who think leveling to 65 before doing AA are compared to slave owners?  For the love of God man what in the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
If you want to stay 51 until you have 500 aas then feel free, and if that's what you like to do then good for you, but these posts are just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
And I have to point out.  You can do LDoN at any level, and it's just as &quot;fun&quot; at 65 as it is at 51.  I fail to see how it is so much more &quot;fun&quot; to get 1 aa every 5 adventures at 51 than it is to get one every 2 adventures at 65.</div></div><hr />

You play this game with other people, not just yourself. And if the majority of them feel safer with a max level tank taking the hits, it does not matter how effective you think you are if you cannot get as many groups. If you group with friends 100% of the time or solo velks spiders disregard what I said.<br />

I thought of this too, back when POP came out Brodda.  To be perfectly honest, I wouldn't mind doing this test the next time I get the urge to drive another toon to 60, then to 65.  I stayed at 60 with Haass and grabbed all of the tanking AA's and Marshall because I enjoyed Chardok XP.  I was all set to go ahead and do those parses of tanking effectiveness because I debated with people endlessly that level would only add 5 points at best in the very same equation you stated.  I think I put down the argument after a Furor comment actually.  <br />
<br />
Later, when I did hit 65 and I went back to HoT to tank the same bastard wurms who could easily kill me before slow landed, the difference was very apparant.  I'd definitely love to do some parses on the matter, but when you're doing the same content at 65 as at 60 and your survivability rate goes up, I'm not sure how the difference can be inconclusive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The HP gained for just going from 60 to 65 also outweights any AAs.<br />
<br />
The only exception is Run 3.  With so much traveling you do in this game, I do believe the time you saved from just running around from place A to place B will pay off the 3 AAs.  This isn't even counting being able to escape death.  <br />
<br />
The way I see it people who don't go to level 65 are just leeching the xp bonus for fighting higher cons.  I won't kick such people out but I'll remember not to group with them next time.  I think we can all agree that you do more damage at level 65.  Thus grouping with a non level 65 character (who could have been one) means you're losing potential DPS and thus XP, and where does that XP go?  To the low level 60s who's getting the white con+ xp bonus.  I think people would rather have a level 65 character with 0 AA over say a level 62 character with 300 AAs especially since no one bothers asking you how many AAs you have before grouping.</div></div><hr />

[B]Now people who think leveling to 65 before doing AA are compared to slave owners?  For the love of God man what in the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
What I'm talking about is the attitude that because &quot;everyone&quot; says so, and &quot;look at all the magelos&quot; so everyone believes it, doesn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
I could care less if people rush to 65, more power to them.  I simply don't personally believe it's the concrete formula to success, regardless how many people advocate it.<br />
<br />
Ergo, my examples of things that &quot;everyone&quot; believed, which turned out to be bullshit.  I'm sorry that you confused that (pretty clear) example as meaning that level-rushers are such.<br />
<br />
You can do LDoN at any level, and it's just as &quot;fun&quot; at 65 as it is at 51.<br />
<br />
Exactly, you can do all manner of things at 51 that are just as fun as what you end up doing at 65.  That's precisely my point.  So in the final analysis there is no greater wisdom in rushing to 65 than not, which is what I have been attempting to point out.<br />
<br />
And I believe that by focusing on the camps that make it possible to &quot;efficiently&quot; grind your way to 65, you miss a great deal of some of the best content in the game.<br />
<br />
How much time have you spent inside Mistmoore Castle?  I'm here to tell you, it's one of the funkiest most beautiful zones in the game.<br />
<br />
But folks who do what &quot;everyone&quot; thinks is the best, don't spend much time there.  It's not a big exp camp, so it's not &quot;efficient&quot;.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how it is so much more &quot;fun&quot; to get 1 aa every 5 adventures at 51 than it is to get one every 2 adventures at 65.<br />
<br />
I don't measure fun in AA points per minute.  You do.  There's a distinction there that would be good to consider before anyone espouses &quot;rushing to 65&quot; as the smart way to play.</div></div><hr />

Umm, yeah sure you could speculate that.  But what you're saying means that at 65 people only group with 65.<br />
<br />
Of course, no 65 groups with a 51, so I'm not sure I get your point.<br />
<br />
At 51 I group with people between 46 and 56 for the most part.  When I'm 51 with 50AA I'll be grouping with people who are.....46 to 56 for the most part.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just don't see any relevance in anything you've just said.  I reckon you're saying that everyone who rushed to 65 wishes everyone else did too, so they'd have more level 65's to group with. <br />

<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Have you followed the thread?  You are a board moderator are you not, and therefore actually read what you moderate?<br />
<br />
Let me summarize, in small words.<br />
<br />
A thread (this thread actually), began with a person relating how arriving rapidly at 65 didn't deliver the mustard like he thought.<br />
<br />
I stated words to the effect that levelling to 65 might not be all it's cracked up to be.<br />
<br />
Someone else said, which I quoted and responded to, that levelling fast to 65 is the &quot;smart&quot; thing to do.<br />
<br />
I've been attempting since to make the point that there is no &quot;smart&quot; thing to do, but that you should do what you have fun doing.<br />
<br />
It appears, however, that rushing to 65 has become a religious creed with fanatical devotees incapable of tolerating other opinions on the matter.<br />
<br />
If you wish to opine on the virtues of power levelling to 65, go right ahead.  I will offer an opinion on the virtues of taking your time.<br />
<br />
I will render unto you, or others, the same courtesy that they render unto me on the matter.  Should they say that their way is the &quot;smart&quot; way, thereby implying that all other ways are &quot;not smart&quot;, I shall point out the organic flaws in that way of thinking.<br />
<br />
AA points are able to be obtained at level 51, and therefore the option exists for those so inclined to do so.  Diffrentiating themselves from other of their level, by personalizing their character.<br />
<br />
Should you dislike that approach, I wish you well.  I like my approach, and it is an opinion worthy of espousing to those who desire opinions.<br />
<br />
Having heard both sides, they can decide.  I think that's pretty fair, don't you?</div></div><hr />

Fine, let's agree to disagree here. You like exping in dungeons with blue cons to a level 51 toon, thats fine. I hope you get 300 AA at level 51 and one day you solo Naggy.<br />

I did not compare myself or my thoughts to anything.  I allowed that many on this board seem to embrace the &quot;rush to 65&quot; thing with the fervor of religious zealots.<br />

Them = Zealots was the comparison.<br />
<br />

Everyone = Not always right.  Which wasn't a comparison at all but a proposition with evidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
looks like you are trying to argue that your preference is more right than someone elses preference?  Its not 1+1=2 and there isnt a right or a wrong way with regard to what is more fun in this instance.<br />
<br />
I agree that LDoN runs are more fun than outdoor XP grinding, and I agree that an LDoN at level 51 can be as fun as an LDoN at level 65.  The reasons that many peoples opinions here differ however is that EQ is more than just LDoN.<br />
<br />
At level 65 a warrior can get a group in Bastion of Thunder and camp some ornate, or can join a pickup raid in the same zone for tower bosses - not an option to the level 51 warrior, wheres he going to take his group to kill mobs that might drop gear upgrades? Chardok? Sebilis? well a 65 warrior can go there too and will tank much better.<br />
<br />
The other part of EQ beyond grouping is raiding, and at level 51 your raiding options are pretty limited.  Sure LDoN might be all you need to keep you happy in EQ until you've done 600 adventures to get your almost VT quality gear and keep your steady AA progression, but for alot of players we want more than that.  <br />
<br />
MTing a boss in LDoN isnt a challenge and isnt what makes me enjoy being a warrior, on normal I usually engage with furious and if the mob isnt dead when that wears off I'll pop mighty strike and see a nice run of crits until it does die.  If im lucky I might become berserk and see some crips before the end too. wuwu~  Hard named are the same deal but last a little longer, if Im dubious about my healer I'll have my mouse hovering over a defensive disc just incase but its still not a big challenge.<br />
<br />
I play EQ to raid and kill big shit.  The kind of mobs who wipe the floor with you the first time and you sit there with your guild mates thinking how the hell are we going to keep a tank up through that.  The raiding game just isnt there for the level 50 crowd anymore unless you maybe have a guild sitting at level 52 to kill naggy or something.  Being the best level 51-55 warrior on the server means you may be the best LDoN tank in your level range, but thats all.  Want to kill something outside of LDoN? stand aside junior.<br />
<br />
So you'll come back and tell us your way is still better cause LDoN is all you want to do and guilds are obsolete and whatever, that might work for you, but I imagine the majority of warriors want more than that, most of them probably dont have 2 lvl65 toons on another server and a run of bad experiences that put them off raiding.  They want to be a good LDoN tank, a good XP tank and a good raid tank and they come to TSW and ask what the best way to get all that is.<br />
<br />
For time invested, if you have to rely on pickup groups, the best way towards being the best LDoN/XP/Raid tank you can be is to level to 65 first, perhaps getting run 3 on the way, and then working on HP AAs, then Defensive AAs, then offensive AAs, and working on your gear the whole time.  Some of this is debateable, there are differing opinions on the best AA path etc, but most people will tell you to level first, and they are right.</div></div><hr />

There's two sides of the combat engine we're looking at here.<br />
<br />
1- The defensive side.<br />
<br />
2- The offensive side.<br />
<br />
The difference between 60 and 65 is the amount of monsters that con dark blue increases.<br />
<br />
The tanking thing Haas notices most likely has a lot to do with the level difference.<br />
<br />
As a monk I notice there's a higher hit percentage on dark blue cons than there are on yellow cons.<br />
<br />
You're the mad parser. Anything you've ever done support that? Do you hit a dark blue more often than you hit a yellow?<br />
<br />
Educate me please. Cause that'd be great to learn about.<br />
<br />
In any event ... one thing is for certain ...<br />
<br />
Your DUAL WIELD PERCENTAGE went up between 60 and 65.<br />
<br />
That's already been proven.<br />
<br />
So your DPS did indeed go up. A smidge. At least.<br />

No.  I don't have anything to support that when mobs are over lvl 60.  This is when the weapon skills stop increasing.  Same hit % for me if a Valorian GUard or a Hraqui Hunter or Time Vallon Zek is hitting me.  As far as I can tell, after lvl 60 all mobs have the same chance to land attacks.  <br />
<br />
But then I don't have extensive parses of every mob in the game.  (Though I try.  =P)<br />
<br />
Yes, dps did go up due to a SMALL damage table increase.  Basically increasing max hit by two from lvl 60 to 65.  And two points of minimum damage.  Of course that applies to one handers.  And that was pretty much shown in my parses.  But other than that?  No, I can't say I have anything to support anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all.  I'm arguing that it's all a preference and neither way is &quot;right&quot;.  I've been arguing all along that there is no &quot;right&quot; way.<br />
<br />
That fact seems self-evident to me.  And yet there are still people who will continue to believe that their preference is somehow based upon some unspecified facts and speak as if it were truth.<br />
<br />
Simply check out Haassenfeffer's post a bit higher up for an example of that.<br />
<br />
I champion my way as the most fun and rewarding, because having played the uber XP grinder my first three years I have a bit of perspective.<br />
<br />
So when it comes down to a contest of ideas, naturally I'm going to root for my tastes.  Just like a Bass drinker might against someone drinking Sam Adams.<br />
<br />
What gets me is when that Sam Adams drinker behaves as if Sam Adams is *the* only beer worth drinking, that drinking it is the *smart* thing to do, and anyone who doesn't has no credibility.<br />
<br />
At that point I'm inclined to escalate the discussion into areas that hopefully reveal the clear breakdown of rational thought that must necessarily precede such a claim.<br />
<br />
For time invested, if you have to rely on pickup groups, the best way towards being the best LDoN/XP/Raid tank you can be is to level to 65 first, perhaps getting run 3 on the way, and then working on HP AAs, then Defensive AAs, then offensive AAs, and working on your gear the whole time.<br />
 <br />
And here you break down, intellectually and rationaly.  <br />
<br />
I can be the best level 35 LDoN/XP/Raid tank I can be, tanking things that raids of level 35's can raid, with not a single AA and without being 65.<br />
<br />
Did you ever raid Splitpaw?  I have, way back when Splitpaw was one of the damndest dungeons around.  When there was no &quot;Raid&quot; manager.<br />
<br />
For twenty-some level 20 to 25, it was tougher than HoT at level 55.  And none of us had a single AA (no such thing existed), and you couldn't even get to 65 because the highest level in the game was 50.<br />
<br />
The part where your argument breaks down is &quot;for the time invested&quot;.  Sure, if your goal is to play this game as if it were a single-player RPG with a score, then efficiency over time matters.<br />
<br />
If you are happy to be playing at whatever level, with others of that level, killing mobs or raiding things appropriate to that level, then the &quot;time invested&quot; balance of efficiency has no relevance.<br />
<br />
Happy go lucky is a viable option.  Not having to be constantly on the ready to rush some rare ubermob before &quot;Buggary of Crimson Wrath Annointed&quot; gets there can be very relaxing.<br />
<br />
Some of this is debateable, there are differing opinions on the best AA path etc, but most people will tell you to level first, and they are right.<br />
<br />
Most people will tell you...and they are right.  Piffle.  Snort.  Back to that old saw again.<br />
<br />
By definition, if you've any acquaintance with statistics, most people are quite average.  Average is the very definition of most, considering almost 80% of any group is one standard deviation either way from Average.<br />
<br />
I don't live in Average territory I'm afraid.  There is no aspect of me or my life that is average.<br />
<br />
I like it out here in hardy individualist country, thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

As for comparing it to everyone thinking the world was flat, I have a better comparison.  It is as if you are claiming (in the modern world) that the world is flat.  Guess what, the common held belief is that it is round right now, does that mean it's wrong too?  Jesus, there is preference, and then there is stupidity.  Do what you want, but giving your &quot;advice&quot; is nothing more than self centered bullshit, that will make things worse for anyone who follows them, other than you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and comparing this to slavery.  You are nothing more than a troll.</div></div><hr />

Shaik, you're a hypocrit, stop now.<br />
<br />
That would be &quot;hypocrite&quot;, and obviously you haven't the slightest clue as to the definition of the word.<br />
<br />
If you wish for me to stop, than don't speak to me.  Same goes for anyone else.<br />
<br />
But unless the thread is locked you are not likely to have the last word, for I rarely give quarter.<br />

I am a Warrior, after all.</div></div><hr />

And yes, I know the meaning of hypocrite, do you know the meaning of troll?<br />

<br />
Is where hypocrite comes from.  It's where you claimed that the way you play is the &quot;real&quot; game and not anyone elses, and said people who cared only about raiding were wrong, but your way is right.  Thats a hypocrite.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to continue in this thread, as it does have some merit for the poster, and I do not wish it outhoused.  But you are nothing more than a troll, I'd rather see you banned before Sam, as he's actually given more to this board intelligence wise.  And you are no warrior, else you are trying to insult us all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hardly see how characterizing uberguilds as inbred could be stretched into some definition of hypocrisy with regards to tastes over rapid exp'ing or not.<br />
<br />
You'd have to take that remark in isolation, willfully dispensing with everything that went before, to even begin to approach something resembling hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
In order for me to be a proper hypocrite, I'd have to secretly be in the game power-exping my arse off, while here in this thread arguing as I do.  Kapiche??<br />
<br />
As I said, the educational system in this country rots.<br />
<br />
But you are nothing more than a troll<br />
<br />
You have offered nothing in this thread but personal attacks toward me that have no bearing on the point at hand.<br />
<br />
You jump in at the end of the fifth page of discussion, and your first sentence is a bald personal insult.<br />
<br />
From that point on you make no substantive commentary regarding any of the lengthy discussions about the pros and cons of levelling to 65 fast.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know the definition of Troll.  It is Hussar.</div></div><hr />

As for why I came late, I hadn't even read this thread yet as I have been busy.  I read it and saw you compare your disagreement to slavery.  After reading that, I felt I had deal with your idiocy first, before writing up my opinion.  I'm in EQ right now, so I'm not having much time to type it.<br />
<br />
How I got hypocrite.  You insulted them, and told them they are wrong because they only cared about raiding, and then you proceeded to care only about your part of the game.  Do I need to explain it slower?<br />
<br />
As I said, the educational system in this country rots <br />
<br />
You are a perfect example.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know the definition of Troll. It is Hussar <br />
<br />
I've contributed quite a bit to this board, you just don't deserve anything like it.<br />
<br />
Now on to the main part I was working on:<br />
The simple fact is, a 52 warrior with zero aas will be a much better tank than a 51 warrior with 300 aas.  A 53 warrior with zero aas will be a much better tank than a 52 warrior with 300aas.  Do I need to continue?<br />
<br />
Going straight for 65 makes you a better tank a lot faster.  Haass has proved that simply by stating his actual experiences.  Not only that, but the decrease of aggro radius, and assist radius from being higher level is very noticable.</div></div><hr />

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this forum is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.<br />

This sentence should read, &quot;The same goes for anyone else.&quot;<br />
But unless the thread is locked you are not likely to have the last word, for I rarely give quarter.<br />
To start a sentence with the word &quot;but&quot; is bad form.<br />
<br />
Hooray! Let's pick out spelling mistakes and grammatical errors to gain control of the conversation! Calling into question your adversary's understanding of the definitions of words works very well also. You can even use a similar strategy on the telephone: Placing people on hold for a moment is a sure way to exercise your superiority over anyone in any situation! Using these techniques will gain you a noticeable advantage when you most need one!<br />
<br />
I don't live in Average territory I'm afraid. There is no aspect of me or my life that is average.<br />
<br />
Here though, you are absolutely correct! You are clearly more intelligent than ANYONE here - that has been established already. Each one of your sentences is formed as if it were a work of art. Such careful attention to detail can not be found in the writings of any ORDINARY man. I'm curious if I may be granted your permission to read your posts aloud at my next poetry recital.<br />
<br />
...Is that what you want to hear? I only want to appease you, your highness. If there is more that you wish, please, PLEASE inform me. <br />
<br />
Oh, there is one more favor I would ask of you. Kindly shut the fuck up, sir. There is no question that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. That's old news; it's cliche. You're talking yourself in circles here. You have no argument on which to &quot;give quarter.&quot; I can only imagine that the reason your opinions were called into question for in the first place is that your situation - and therefore the basis of your opinion - is completely irrelevant to the context the original poster here was asking a question in. He raids mobs like Vindi, he tanks Halls of Honor and similar zones, he tanks in LDoN zones and he wondered if leveling up to 65 was a mistake. For the content that he is interested in the answer, quite simply, is NO. Being a 51 Warrior and working on AA while doing LDoN and old low-level content has nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
Your heaven-sent regurgitations have done nothing to further anyone's knowledge of anything except for one fact: You are an arrogant elitist prick.</div></div><hr />

Shaik: I don't like to censor people here, which is why you can still post. Try not to provoke such pedantic, off-topic arguments. Use PMs if you must launch into diatribes on the Human Condition.<br />
<br />
Everyone else: ignore him or PM him. It's like we have another Deathwalker on our hands; furthering his threadjacks ain't cool</div></div><hr />
