<br />
How do you like your overtime? All in one go--or a hour or 2 every day?<br />
<br />
No particular reason I am asking, other than I am posting this from work at midnight...when the day was over at 5 pm. 7 hours of OT today...and counting.<br />
<br />
Miller Time...soon.<br />
<br />
I hope.<br />
<br />
Of course I won't be drinking Miller either...but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AM.<br />
<br />
But that is 15 extra hours on the pay check. Of course OT for this pay period was due...today... so have to wait 2 weeks to see my $$.<br />

Still will help to off set the new vid card I had to buy. My Radion 9600 Pro was nto playing nicely with my NForce motherboard. So I now have a Nvidia 5900 FX OC (only 128 MB though). Nothin sucks more than emergency computer repairs.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
i don't.<br />
<br />
but i don't dislike it enough to find a new job.<br />
<br />
yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He was serious and I found it somewhat difficult to keep from bursting out laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh i miss my 80 hour weeks with only a 40 hour paycheck :D  :eek:  :confused: ..sucked ass but to be the boss of a small company hanging on by it's teeth does it to ya<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm doing it all wrong. I work two full time jobs. mon-fri 8-5 and wed-sun nights 6pm-7am with 12-5 sleep time on the job (At least thats paid sleep time) at the hotel. I don't get overtime I just work endlessly. Been doing it for a couple years now and don't see an end in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No no no no...it wasn't a 10 hour day. It was 10 hours of overtime yesterday/today. Plus the regular 8 hour day.<br />
<br />
Fortunatly the place I work at needs OT rarely, but when they do, they need it job lots. <br />
<br />
I sorta feel that I grew up 2nd to my Dad's job--so I have no burning desire to put in lots or regular OT. Not that I have much of a life... All of that have to have my sympathies...<br />
<br />
<br />
And 2 full time jobs??!! OUCH! Dude that sucks. I hope you are wrong and the end comes far sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">batbrain</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least most of you get paid for OT! Military people do not. We are salary workers. We get paid the same if we do a 1 hour day or a 16 hour day. I kept a record of how many hours of OT I worked during a couple of months (until I got bored) and came to the conclusion I was working 1.5 additional jobs on top of my current one (based on a 40 hour work week). That's a 14 hour day from the time I get to work till I leave work. And I still get paid the same as the guy next door who comes in at 9 and leaves at 5 with the 2 hour lunch break!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only do I get paid overtime for hours 10 thru 14, but I also get Double time from 14 on.<br />
<br />
And since it's not a rare thing for me to work 45 hours in 3 days, it is highly profitable for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd rather have my time off than OT. Taxes eat me up too bad to make it worth doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just need a kid.<br />
<br />
I claim 3 exepmtions, I bring home 84% of my taxable gross.  In April, it's basically a wash..I get a couple hundred bucks back from Fed + state and that's about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm salaried, so I put in the extra hours without seeing a nickel of financial compensation. On the up side, I've got stock options in my company and we have a bonus plan that's paid out every year I've been here.<br />
<br />
Honestly, though, I'd rather be at home with my wife and daughters. So, for me, time is more valuable than money.</div></div><hr />
