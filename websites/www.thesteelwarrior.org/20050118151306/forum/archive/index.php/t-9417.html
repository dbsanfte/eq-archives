<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I consider myself to be a casual warrior.  I usually buff up to around 8800-9200 with around 1600 AC, and that has worked fine for WoS and RCoD for the most part with one exception.... the elites.<br />
<br />
For those of you who have grouped in the northern part of WoS, and pretty much and part of RCoD and MPG you know what I'm talking about.  Any mob named &quot;An Elite Noc........ An Elite Kyv........ and An Elite Ukun.........&quot; hits for around 150-750 max, which isn't bad by itself, but when you add the fact that they mitigate slow and proc a 650-750 DD almost every round, it makes fighting them a real bitch.<br />
<br />
I guess besides a rant I'm wondering, am I the only warrior to get my ass kicked by these gems?  One full quadded round with some full-hits and semifull-hits, add in a couple procs, can take me down 30-40% of my life.  I find myself burning evasive every time it pops when these guys are pulled just to try and let the cleric breathe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for those who are in the same boat, are you doing something that I'm not?  Maybe I'm missing some key concept to tanking these that others aren't.  Let me know if they are a bitch for you all too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The spell vie line works pretty well against them if your wiz/enc doesn't mind the peridot cost.  Spellshield (the mod) works great too but I doubt you've access to those.</div></div><hr />

I went from 30 percent to 0 in one round.  my cleric had no idea what happened.  They dont hit that hard, but damn...when they land 4 straight procs on you for 700 or so...it um, hurts...=p<br />

Ran with a 65war(me), 65cleric, 65 druid, 70mage, 70necro, 70 shaman and it was easy.  The backup heals of shaman just makes it trivial.<br />

We were doing Ruined City of Dranik and pulled many elite.</div></div><hr />

I may be imagining it but when I have agro and switch to 2HS the amount of procs drops dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fight in MPG and the elites there are the same.  They proc constantly for 700ish and it puts a strain on healers.  A good patch healer is almost essential for these mobs in my opinion and I usually buff to 10500-11000 now with conviction in a group.  When tanking in MPG I usually use my 2 hander now.  It isn't that great of a weapon but I seem to notice less hits coming in when I wield it and it is adequate for aggro usually.  Whether it is the lower swing/riposte rate or the fact it generally puts me over 1900 AC buffed I am not sure, but I do notice a difference to the eye (not parsed).<br />
<br />
You are by no means alone in this.  I would strive to work on AC as much as hps though as I typically run 1800-1900 AC now and have noticed a huge difference in the amount of max or near max hits I take.  It doesnt do anything for the procs, but lessening the 700 hit to 250 from melee does help offset the proc damage.  My resists suck and I never seem to be grouped with a bard on these so not sure how resistable they are.  I cannot remember resisting the proc from one of these yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rowf</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They certainly proc a lot. I havent seen any parses but i feel that crippling them seems to help reduce the dps.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe im just kidding myself 8)<br />
<br />
Shaman slows are partially mitigated so I like to try everything i can to debuff them. <br />
<br />
Cant land a darn spell without malo though, so its 30 secs into the fight before I get around to crippling.<br />

Nasty critters, not as bad as vxed though 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the same boat, despite usually buffing to around 10k/1700 ac (depending on group makeup) the elites in MPG have the annoying tendency to drop me down to 30/40% on the first round of attacks. I've almost always used either defensive or evasive on these (providing its up, if it is not my finger is almost always hovering over the furious button), simply because one bad round of attacks turns me into smoked barbarian (or cooking barbarian, i.e. berserk) from full hp. I have taken to using my BoC/aegis of the earth almost exclusively on them for the huge ac boost (not to mention the ac cap raiser) and for the hopefully lower amount of ripostes. Granted I may loose aggro with the shield taking up a weapon slot, but in &quot;normal&quot; situations I do not need AE taunt to retake aggro so I do not have to worry so much about losing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, the Elites are fun. Cripple does seem to help with the proc rate.<br />
<br />
When I pull them, I go out with a heal over time and start a CH as soon as I get back into range. It is just safer that way even though it is rare they do 40% of my HP that first round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember, slow isn't the only debuff.  Get the slower to swap in a Cripple to drop dex (and proc rate... it has to be a proc).  Not sure if the chanter asphyxiate or druid Ro debuffs would help with the proc directly, but would help with mob dps/Ac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fjalarr</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any dex lowering debuff will lower the proc rate. Cripple is a great proc rate slower. Using a 2HS weapon will lower the riposte, therefore less damage you take and you mights try using a rune on you to ease the initial shock until the cleric gets his mantra and the debuffs have landed. I know runes cost pp but there is a reason they are in the game. The spell absorption buff with take 10% of the proc damage. The vie melee buff can take 10% of melee damage and a good furious disc will save you a few initial hits. A spell shield item would be ideal, one reason the OOW exp. is supposed to be a challenge for the POP kids. Sometimes stopping your melee attacks will land you a few seconds of time when you hit 20% health and get low hitpoint aggro, since you won't get riposte damage. Slippery Attacks is an OOW aa you should get a good look at if you plan to dual wield here. I recommend 2hs for it's survivability on the tougher mobs. :eek:</div></div><hr />

Thanks for thall the suggestions all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bushinda</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW enchanter line that helps with procs/nukes is the alendar line.  Wall/Circle of alendar reduces proc/nuke damage by 20% until 2k has been absorbed.  A peridot is used when casting this spell.  <br />
<br />
On a different topic, can someone explain the mechanics of chromatic resists?  I have heard several explanations.  Does the mob get a check against every resist?  Does it check against the lowest only?  The average of all your resists?<br />

the fisrt two propositions are the same, and correct; the last, and all other possibilities, are wrong.</div></div><hr />
