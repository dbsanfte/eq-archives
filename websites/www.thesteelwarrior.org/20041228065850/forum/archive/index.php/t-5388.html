<br />
your proc rate is &quot;procs per minute&quot; if you hit someone 10 times per minute and proc 1 time per minute your chance to proc is 10%<br />
<br />
if you hit someone with same weapon/dex 5 times per minute (becuase your slowed) you will still proc 1 time per minute, but your chance to proc is 20% ....<br />
<br />
you wont proc more, but your chance to proc on a SINGLE hit is higher<br />
<br />
** 3) anyone made exp with earthshaker and rampage? **<br />
<br />
I heared a few warriors (not solo) were killing in PoP with that, imo its mainly nice to farm stuff (tradeskills), I doupt its worth for exp, but I never tried it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, it is way too much trouble to get experience with it.  It is actually very hard to pull enough dark blue mobs, get them all to camp without getting stunned, and get them all in a tight enough cluster in a corner to avoid taking lots of deaths.  To kill a bunch of dark blue mobs, you need something like 60+ mobs (the more the better) but with every mob you pull, the risk of being stunned or otherwise killed goes way up and I really doubt you could consistently gain more experience than you lose to pulling deaths.</div></div><hr />

Because when you use rampage, you only get 1 swing per mob, so say you get 50 mobs.  For each of those 50 swings you want to maximize the proc chance.<br />
<br />
Yes, if you get slowed, or torpored, your proc rate PER SWING will co up, because you will be swinging less per minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarean</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had Rampage and an Earthshaker for quite a while now. I can tell you there is no way to get exp with it for yourself unless you go to the extreams those three warriors took in PoFire. At best I average about 2-4k damage per mob with a good 50+ mob train, sometimes less. Thats enough to kill a bunch of gimpy 900 hp hollowshade mobs, but not enough to exp off of. *perhaps* if you threw in a furious with a really heavy 2her, you could take out a bunch of light blues. <br />
<br />
I have found that you can power level twinks (sorta) with this. Get your random twink to 43, then group with them. Rampershaker a zone like dulak's harbor or the great divide. Can get them good exp up till 50. Even here its a bit hard because of the mix of mobs you get, some you'll kill out right while others will flee. So it takes more work than you may think. <br />
<br />
At least furious/rampage+earthshaker gives us some sort of AoE presence. <br />
<br />
When GoD comes out, the weapon affinity aa's are the first im going to get. I plan on parsing my rampershaking after I max it (damage per mob, not procs per min - in the end thats what matters). Should be interesting.</div></div><hr />
