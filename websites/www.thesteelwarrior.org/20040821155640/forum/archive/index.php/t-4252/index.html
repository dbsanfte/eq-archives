<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking at some of the numbers we are getting--and looking at some of the postings in the later in the day Povar pic, we need to start thinking about where else we can go so as we do not crash or cause disruption in PoK. <br />
<br />
The first place I would suggest is scattered though out the Tranqulity (as there are no good spots in PoK that don't already have lag issuse). A pair at the zone in book (which does not have a lot of room) a pair at the BoT (and lining the bridge), and one by each stone by PoV. <br />
<br />
THen I would look at the adventure camps (though they are more dangerous due to the possiblitly of training). I would say hang out along the walls in the EC tunnel would be a good overflow spot.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear some other suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well , could form two lines from each side of the door leaving the house you enter in PoTranq so that people have to run by us no matter what , serves same purpose at PoT stone imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think Pok is just fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry have to disagree, on Povar at least, things are begining to get laggy. We will have disruption problems by the time the 18th rolls around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, was very laggy on Povar today, and I imagine it will only get worse come the 18th.  The PoT stone was quite surrounded and there were already complaints about being able to access the stone, however I think most of them were from idiots unhappy about the standdown to get us in trouble.  I can't however imagine how we decide at what point there's &quot;too many&quot; warriors in PoT.  I guess the only reliable way is to see the zone crash :)  Of course everyone in the same zone generates the most interest and shows the most solidarity.  Has anyone gone as far as to nominate server leaders to be in charge of this kind of thing?  Such as when enough is enough is one spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's my take on it though ... especially on Povar ...<br />
<br />
The zone is designed for heavy traffic.<br />
<br />
The zone on Povar is filled with annoying spam (it's the first zone I EVER turned all /oocs and the like OFF in, oh so long ago).<br />
<br />
It's a touch more laggy than usual, BUT, you know, we're doing SOE a service here.<br />
<br />
We're showing them that their high traffic, teleportation zone may need some tuning for its lag, because it has trouble handling large amounts of ... you guessed it ... TRAFFIC.<br />
<br />
The funniest thing I've encountered the whole time was, two people who absolutely refused to zone in until people moved out of their way.<br />
<br />
It was hilarious because the path to the stone was not blocked or obstructed. They could easily get past the sitting dwarf (Kandaur, /wave, I saw you!) or just go around back.<br />
<br />
Instead they had to raise a fuss.<br />
<br />
It cracked me up.<br />
<br />
Anyways ... as long as you're not spamming GMs, I don't see how it's hurting anyone's gameplay to stand around in a zone afk.<br />
<br />
I've stood around in PoK and Tranquility SO MUCH during PoP's lifespan LFG that I'd have some very choice words for ANY GM who told me that NOW I was causing a problem by doing the same thing I've been doing for so damn long.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look at the ground, reduce your clipping plane to zero.   This is the point of it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe around the banks and the nexus stone also in POK would be good. Seems there are always high traffic in those areas. Inside PoT and at the PoT bank also wouldn't be to bad. Other than that next guess would be nexus if we want to avoid trains from the annoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wyndaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The location is fine.  The zone is fine.  Simply leave lots of access to the stone by not sitting near the stairs or platform itself and there is no cause for complaint.  There can hardly be a problem of allowing people to be 'IN' a particular zone.  <br />
<br />
PoK it is... near the tranq stone...  the 18th is gonna suck for lag there, but think of it this way.... every other zone will be empty :).<br />
<br />
Adventure well,</div></div><hr />
