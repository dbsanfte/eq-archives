<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't been able to get access to it for a couple of days now. Anyone know if they're just updating the thing or maitenancing the site or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know their site has been down for at least a week, but my magelo update program still seems to work properly, and you can still ping magelo.com... I don't know what conclusions can be drawn, but it sure is frustrating =- | I wuv magelo dammit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magelo the worse site ever.  They need to scrape it and redo the thing from the floor up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I do believe there are plans for redoing the whole HTML engine of Magelo fairly soon. Something about making sure that his database was running smoothly first though.<br />
<br />
Even with the difficulty of service, Magelo is pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm surprised a site with half a million users ran smoothly for as long as it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Last I read they were working on moving everything to a new set of servers to fix the lag problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Magelo is a pretty cool idea. <br />
<br />
If SoE were smart they would either buy or license the setup, and put up some magelo-servers that can handle the load. <br />
<br />
Judging by the sheer amount of profiles entered pr server, there is ALOT of people that find it fun to toy around with their gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as I understood it, Jelan mentioned  the server he moved to resently to be running at 50% idle power.<br />
<br />
It's something about the way he does his HTML that many browsers won't accept, especially Internet Explorer should be good at foolin' itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My magelo update couldn't connect last night and attempts to go to the URL come back invalid. Seems DNS is messed up or there is no MAgelo Server up whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I heard the same thing too about moving to new machines to reduce lag, so hopefully that is all it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's currently moving hosts / server to hopefully fix some of the lag problems. It's also getting a rebuild from the ground up supposedly, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What sucks is paying for premium and getting this kinda service.  That's really not cool right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As much as I use Magelo and as cheap as premium membership is, I have no beefs at all with the level of service.  Now, if it is down for a week while moving, then I'll get cranky... but I'm willing to spot 'em a couple days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doh, just remembered that my premium acct expires tomorrow. Hope that doesnt mean I lose my profiles and have to redo them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think the profiles are lost at all, they are just no longer auto updated, but still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This has been a hellish deal at Magelo<br />
<br />
Im seriously pissed too Haas because I have been paying for it. Either give the premium users a seperate server from the non payers or just give us a refund for the last month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gwarf... you are that bent out of shape over a buck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Basically it's just a &quot;thanks Magelo, here's some money to cover a tiny fraction of the overall hosting costs from everyone using your service for however long&quot;. You are getting &quot;premium&quot; service when you use your account, autoupdate and adv search aren't available to normal users. Is a buck a month worth autoupdate etc? You have to answer that one.<br />
<br />
In regards to hosting, shit happens. If you can't deal with downtime then I'm sorry but the internet is full of it. Changing hosts isn't as simple as flicking a switch in a closet, especially when it's not your fulltime job and just really a side hobby that's grown gigantic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1 dollar, 10 dollars, 100 dollars, 10000 dollars...it doesn't matter what it costs, it's the fucking principle.  if I'm paying for something, I expect more.  However, I'm glad I don't pay for mangelo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think that the level of service should be proportional to how much I pay for it.  One buck a month is DIRT cheap for the advanced search capabilities and the ability to automatically update my profiles.<br />
<br />
And one dollar a month certainly isn't enough that I would expect 100% uptime/availability.<br />
<br />
Magelo premium is a bargain for the utility it provides... even when you consider the downtime.<br />
<br />
At work, I'm responsible for the web-based help desk for my company.  If that system goes down and isn't back online within minutes, I scream bloody murder.  What's the difference?  I pay more than a buck a month for the corporate site.  A lot more.  So I expect more.  A lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Update: Yeah, my Magelo update program doesn't connect anymore either, and pings now time out. <br />
<br />
I do feel obligated to say though,  that even with this downtime, the mere pittance that I pay for Magelo's premium service is waaay worth it. I remember this one time I was talking to a friend on the phone and told him to look up some item on Magelo because I couldn't remember the stats or something, and he couldn't... I had forgotten how cool the premium features are. One of the more &quot;novel&quot; things I like is the auto-update in bazaar feature. I can be at work and see what my trader has sold and think about all my lovely platz lmao =-D<br />
Ok I'll stop being an advertisement now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Magelo is back up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">=-o woot! Profiles are working, but it seems the front page of the site isn't loading correctly...</div></div><hr />
