<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont think it makes any difference but I am not 100percent sure. Someone else can answer more authatative. Weapon Proc is time based at about 2 per minute in general so main or off hand should not make a difference, I thinks.<br />
<br />
If you put the A3 on the BoC you losing a lot of value as you have to remove the A3 to sell it. Lot better to A3 the GBoS so that you can sell the BoC when you upgrade...... <br />
<br />
Well I guess though with 2 procs the BoC would be yur Keeper if you up grade but the other has a bit better dps.. <br />
<br />
Well I guess its better to have 2 procs on the BoC and junk the GBoS when you move up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure on which hand if it matters much, but I'd stick it on the weapon you'll most likely keep if you get an upgrade (non-2hander), so you get more out of your points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Put the Anger on your mainhand weapon. Procs are not based on &quot;2 per minute&quot; like Sam said. That is just what it usually will average out to. More swings with main hand will mean more procs.<br />
<br />
And who cares if you have to remove the augment from the BoC to sell it. <br />
<br />
Augment the BoC with Anger 3.<br />
<br />
When you get another 1152 points, put another one on your offhand weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mainhand always procs more than offhand. Put A3 on mainhand first, then get another one for offhand.<br />
<br />
EB+2x A3+stun = bad ass agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Put it in BoC, when you get somehting better than a BoC, swap BoC in offhand and bag your GBoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would put anger 3 on the GBoS and mainhand it and put the BoC in your offhand. You'll get a bit more DPS that way and you can still sell or trade your BoC back in to your guild when you upgrade. Either way you'll have superb agro.<br />
<br />
Or you could buy the cheap Ykesha proc and put that on the GBoS and save anger 3 till you get a great weapon like BoWar. <br />
<br />
I would not listen to Samlancer about procs though :rolleyes:. Your mainhand weapons ALWAYS proc more unless it doesn't have a proc :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Master_race(tm)</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I put anger 3 proc on my GboS and offhanded the BoC. My DPS went up and my aggro is much better. I def recomend that you aug the GboS and mainhand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya these guys is right mainhand probably procs 2X or so what the offhand does, and the offhand does a lot less dps (probably 40percent of mainhand).<br />
<br />
Ok based on that then BoC wiht A3 mainhand is yur max proc set up.<br />
<br />
GBoS with A3 is more DPS in main hand but yur procs would be about .75 of what they would be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yur overally DPS will probably go up like 10percnet or so with GBoS with A3 mainhand whereas you will lose 25percent of yur procs. <br />
<br />
All these is super rough estimates .... <br />
<br />
Me, I take the DPS, but everyone else on the forum would take the procs so......<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

DeathWalker Sez: &quot;But DPS is a agro proc!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Volumes said in a single sentence, *clap*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aug the gbos and mainhand it, dont aug the boc unless you have *a lot* of points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Master_race(tm)</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anger 3 aug is 1150 points. That is alot of points to use on an aug you might have to destroy once you upgrade the BoC. Aug the GboS, mainhand it and see how aggro is. If it's anything like what I am experienceing you won't have any aggro problems. If you decide you don't like your aggro, can always get another aug and throw it on the BoC and switch them up in your hands. No reason *not* to augment a no drop gbos unless you plan on upgrading really soon. So might as well do it first and see if that will be adequate for your needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I personally would put pure agro on GBoS because it has a dd/stun proc, and would stick a dd/stun on the BoC because it has a pure agro proc... would rather distribute it that put all my eggs in one basket by making BoC proc two pure agro spells.  Dunno, maybe I'm just silly like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>chidder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i recommend that if you are anywere near gettiing a bloodfrenzy or a blade of war to wait before auging. Boc or blade of storms will not be a longterm weapon most likely and points dont exactly flow like water</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">BTW guys those weaps that allready got a proc, and then u aug em with another proc stuff like anger III...<br />
<br />
Does em proc twice? or does em do a first proc check and then if failed a second proc check?. As a result of this they proc the same times or more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They check individually, but both can proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">it was found after much parses that proc rate is not dependant on weapon delay ... u will proc about once every 45 seconds, the proc chance for each hit being calculated based on your current weapon real delay (delay with haste component taken into account). <br />
Now there is the problem of off hand : u don't swing 100% of teh time with off hand. so u proc less with off hand. For example if u have a 50% chance to DW, then u will have an average of 1 proc every 1:30 mins<br />
result : biggest aggro in 1st hand is better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nirebauu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">thank you for replying. :) <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
It first checks to see if the main proc goes off.  If the main proc doesn't go off, then it checks the augment proc.  So both procs never go off simultaneously on the same swing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even so, because the chance to proc on any given swing is so low, your augment proc will go off only very slightly less than your main proc (a percent or two maybe).  For practical purposes, the two procs will go off about the same number of times per minute.</div></div><hr />
