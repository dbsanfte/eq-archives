<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkmoose</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiyas, I usually adventure with the following group in LDoNs. Two boxed (34 cleric &amp; 35 shammy) Two boxed (35 Shadowknight &amp; 35 chanter), and me a 40 war. I will be two boxing a rogue along with my warrior once I catch him up. I'm still having fun going through LDoNs, but could probably use a break. So, I thought it might be nice to set out on a mission to kill some mobs and get lewt / upgrades for the others in the party. My warrior is set for equipment for a long while courtesy of my now nearly broke enchanter, heh. The others in group have average equipment for their levels. So, are there any one group raid type targets that we might be able to do in any other zones to get my friends some upgrades? <br />

You wont be able to find anything. I dont think you will be able to find anything at this low of a level to be an upgrade to good bazaar bought gear. So if you want upgrades, xp in zones that net you cash that you can later spend in bazarr. I'd sugest sebelis or hole once you hit 45ish. Nice cash flow in both.<br />
<br />
If you think about it game was not designed so lvl 40 characters were in equiped in cultural armor and had tormax drops. Which are not even considered that great anymore. Thats why there is nothing avilable anymore for ppl who started with bazaar gear as an upgrade from xp zones till they get closer to 60.</div></div><hr />
