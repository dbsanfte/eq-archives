<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magumas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone knows if you can change your Deity? I heard they are suppposed to make some quest in the game to enable you to change your deity.. Has anyone else heard this? or is this just a rumor?....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a rumor atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sam3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no idea, but would be nice :b :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, I wish! I follow Tunare...*smacks herself on the forehead*...would be nice if I could change that to RZ...I'd gladly do it and fork out the cash for RZ armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i believe it was mentioned at the last fan faire that it was something that they were looking into.<br />
<br />
no news since then though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">oh god id love to have one(vah shir) be nice to be able to use firce heraldric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know Rallos Zek is the god of war and stuff, but it seems awfully silly how a lot of the RZ culteral armor is better than Skyshrine/Kael quested armor.  I worship Brell and I'm glad I worship Brell, but sometimes I see this RZ culteral armor and kick myself in the arse cause it's pretty fookin' awesome.  :)<br />
<br />
I think if I could, I'd probably switch to Rallos.  I'd gain a couple of hundred HP by switching to RZ armor.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">RZ owns =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah.  Why the pouting?  I picked Tunare (shaddup or beat ya senseless with a branch!) as a deity and don't feel slighted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Velyssa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd love the opportunity to change.  I was agnostic and &quot;magically&quot; became mith mar one day.  I'd never pick mith mar.....*grrr* Has anyone else had this happen to them? <br />
<br />
It really toasts me because luminant armor has half the hp's of fierce heraldic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okay, assuming they do make diety changes possible...  Should I go RZ or Tribunal.  Helanic Tundra and Fierce Heraldic seem pretty even to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solarris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if they let us change deity i'm goin over to veeshan, just for the roleplaying aspect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*IF* such a change were allowed, you'd have to bear in mind that Helanic is Bar, Helf, Hum wearable.  RZ is everything but Iksar and Vah Shir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even tho I love my fierce heraldic... if you are able to wear helanic I am pretty sure IIRC that helanic has same hp's but more STA than fierce heraldic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The day dieties can be changed will be the day SOE realize that cultural armor needs to be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well kiya, they would have to redo the armor system of course, they only reason it isnt vah shir is it isnt a possible god, yet.<br />
(it isnt ikky eather because if you follow game lore, ikkys arnt allowd to where plate, but a few pieces have made it past QA team)<br />
<br />
it seems to work on medium to large, and a vah shir can where anything in that size range as long as some god hasnt gayed it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I worship the Tribunal, and from what I've seen, it's better than RZ but also alot harder to get.  Mainly because until the last round of cultural smithing updates when all the RZ/Helanic/etc was implemented, Barbarian cultural smithing was a joke, so there aren't as many Barbarian GM smiths.  Just dont see Helanic armor very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">is there a version that is vah shir usable? im thinking i can find a master smith if i check the tradeskill listing for my sever</div></div><hr />
