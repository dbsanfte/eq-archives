<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just started my epic because I need better hate weapons. My guild is small so I dont expect to ever manage an EB weapon (not to mention I'm an alt so I would defer to any primaries anyway), but we are quite capable of doing epics with 1 or 2 groups. My question is; would the red epic be about the best aggro weapon for me other than EB weapons? I already own a sword of the bloodsworn and a great staff of thunder, but I still struggle to hold aggro in some situations - and I imagine it'll only get worse as I approach the 60+ arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Red epic won't save you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For XP groups, your GSoT should be more than enough aggro. If you are strugglign than you may want to look at the people around you. The SotBS/Red Epic Combo should do you well on raids if your guildies know how to manage agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't recommend doing the epic unless it's more then just a weapon to you like it is to some warriors. GSoT is fine, Droga weapons are fine. IMO put a ykesha augment in your GSoT and you're set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On raids I have used my red and blue epic its great agro being that I only have the Red epic going off 2 or 3 times on a mob and on my BoT groups I allways use Red and Blue to keep agro when im the tank for the group. <br />
<br />
I allso have a GSoT but I put it away becouse i was loseing agro other then gainging it really, I have tooken agro from a SK was asked to put them away /shrug so i used the GSoT and bam! no more agro taken from it. So I say go for the epic and slap a SOtB on off if you wish to have 2 Procing wepons.. anyways thats my thoughts. <br />
<br />
Luck with the epic and at 64 allmost 65 I do fine and I have crappy gear and ok agro not the best like EB but it gets me by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a copper hammer to go with your sword of the bloodsworn, no sense in wasting the time to downgrade your weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Amen what the gnome said :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">RED EPIC 4evar~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">is the epic hate resisted as much in ldon like it is in someplaces in pop? <br />
i would have thought that if not, it would be better aggro than the sword of the bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Red epic resists still generate aggro.<br />
<br />
Sword of the bloodsworn resists still generate aggro.<br />
<br />
So the point is sort of moot wouldn't you say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i know you still get aggro if a proc is resisted. the point i was trying to question was which proc generated more aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You could also try for a Marble Sphere of Ire which has Anger III (300 hate); can be bought for 1150 adv points in EF camp (Miragul's Menagerie).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not a single person has mentioned the most important thing probably going on here.<br />
<br />
When you are &lt; level 60, your taunt does NOT work on mobs yellow or red to you.<br />
<br />
When you become level 60, you can taunt any mob successfully.<br />
<br />
So get to level 60 and your agro issues will most likely melt away, in &quot;certain&quot; situations as you mentioned.<br />
<br />
P.S. Get your next x number of levels until 60 or 65 in GuK LDON and put a Ykesha 510 pt proc on your SotB and a Ykesha 510 pt proc your CHoS when you get one and I guarantee you will not have any problems with agro.<br />
<br />
Feel free to KILL anyone in your guild who takes agro at that point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>icsdave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont think you get much aggro off a resisted proc from the red you get some but not much.  I think its just the dd resist that you see.   I lost faith in the red in Akheva fighting the big worms down the right hall.  I would get 3 resisted procs in a row and still not pull aggro.  Any mob with fire resist you might as well bag the red its just dont wrok.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I perfer to take off all my armor and just sit in the corner during LDoN adventures.  That way &quot;IF&quot; I get hit because i have agro from sitting atleast the cleric can feel good about healing me.<br />
<br />
I gave up on LDoN adventures with my warrior trying to take agro.  I now play my enchanter and use charmed mobs (the ONE per adventure, dont get me starte don this BULL SHIT) but my warrior is now naked and on autofollow.<br />
<br />
In a non sarcastic response to this thread... the red epic is resisted for me every time it procs, which is seldom anyways.  Its a slow weapon with an awful proc rate and resist rate.  But I cant even hold agro anymore with my naked bosom shaking on the back side of a mob.<br />
<br />
Im just going to carry my warrior on autofollow with my enchanter untill she can buy some anger or ykesha augs then try to get agro again...<br />
<br />
I have little faith in SOE at this moment, I barely even play anymore, it makes me sick to my stomache when I loose agro off a mob with 20% life to a resisted nuke.<br />
<br />
Red epic worked very well for me when Luclin came out, its been bagged ever since PoP release.<br />

The reason no one mentioned this is because they FIXED it ages ago.<br />
<br />
Many MANY MANY patches ago (around the same time /shield went live), they fixed that entire issue with taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup.  Have seen a level 52 SK get a successful taunt on a level 60 mob.  The level 60 thing is no longer true.<br />
<br />
For the original question, what Wandor posted is all the answer you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are you referring to the fix that went in around the CT revamp because agro was screwed up?<br />
<br />
I dont remember anything about level 52's being able to taunt level 60+ mobs.<br />
<br />
I know I said yellow and red mobs, but my understanding was that a la HoT, when a mob is higher than 60 and you were below 60, that taunt would not work on those mobs.<br />
<br />
Guess I will take your word for it. All I know is that it wouldn't work for me back when I was 58 :)<br />
<br />
a long time ago, I guess :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yea, it was changed some time after PoP came out.  Did it lots of times while my Test Server warrior was leveling up.  I have a screenshot of me taunting a level 60 bug in FG at 57 (and getting the &quot;interfere&quot; message) when it conned red to me.  The same bugs were what the 52 SK was able to taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luczifer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Red epic's proc isn't so bad. I use them requently now at lvl 65.<br />
And when my DEX maxed two red epics (Ya, i use Blade of Strategy in main and off-hand) proc very frequently.<br />
It's 500 pts hate rise is quit nice.<br />
But mostly I like cuz they are so cool lightsabres :)<br />
So when Ya get ya own, don't run to change them to new versions before Ya get Mage's summoned Sword of Rune and make another pair of 1HS. So Ya can end with total 5 epics:<br />
two new 1HS, two old 1HS and new 2HS version.</div></div><hr />
