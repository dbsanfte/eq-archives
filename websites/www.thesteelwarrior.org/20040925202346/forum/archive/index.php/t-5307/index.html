<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yebhx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yah she was wearing a pastie over her nipple, obviously it was planned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That wasn't a pasty, it's an elaborate piercing. She has a conventional bar nipple piercing, she was wearing a solar symbol beneath it. It looks planned to me. You can see some good pics of it at -<br />

<br />
and a close up of the piercing at -<br />

<br />
In the close up you can see the snaps that held the boob cover on to the rest of her top. That must have been planned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All this &quot;planned&quot; talk is so you guys can look at some boobie at work or under the wife's eye. Don't even deny it!</div></div><hr />
