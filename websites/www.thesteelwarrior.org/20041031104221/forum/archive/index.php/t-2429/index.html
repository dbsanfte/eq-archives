<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RevlinXevlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are these two terms even considered seperate anymore ? <br />
<br />
The way I learned it the MA was the person you assisted cause they were pulling and the MT was the main tank who held agro for the duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
Is this still the case or have things changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are separate in certain strategies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MA is who you assist<br />
<br />
MT is who you heal<br />
<br />
Sometimes they are the same person, other times (like when you have to kill adds) they aren't</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The people I've played with term it SA or secondary assist. The MA is the person to main assist aka MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MA is who you assist<br />
<br />
MT is who you heal<br />
<br />
Sometimes they are the same person, other times (like when you have to kill adds) they aren'tExactly. These are 2 different jobs. There has to be a person to assist in case something other than what the MT is tanking needs to be killed. This is also the person that picks the targets nad calls switching targets in cases when there are multiple mobs to kill and some are mezzable and some are not.<br />
<br />
The MTs job is to tank the big dog. He has to focus on keeping agro and can't be off switching targets. This is the guy the cheal rotation is healing.<br />
<br />
Often the MT and MA will be on the same target, but some times they are not, which is why there are 2 jobs.<br />
<br />
There are also SA and ST, which would be secondary assist and secondary tank. The SA is the guy you assist when the MA dies, the ST is the guy who takes over boss tanking when the MT dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I personally think the best MA is a smart wizard, who can keep an eye on the mobs and make decisions. MTs are usually MAs, but that's not always the best thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are separate jobs, but that doesn’t mean some people cannot do both at the same time.<br />
<br />
Some people are just, well... simple, and get confused into calling them the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pretty much any class could play the role of MA, the main thing is the person behind the keyboard. The MA has to be intelligent and hyper-knowledgeable about the game -- including the zone you're in, the design of the encounter, etc. They also have to be extremely reactive without losing track of the big picture.<br />
<br />
Personally I find it extremely challenging to do both the MT and MA roles, but of course that's part of the fun of the game for me. There are plenty of situations where as MT I can't MA at all, more as time goes on (once you get any distance into PoP you're going to be splitting those roles up simply because the encounter requires it. I've also heard Vex Thal requires this, although I haven't been there.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Daramin, VT doesnt need the split role, its mostly monotonous clearings of mobs with too many HP.  and CH rotations arnt needed on anything but the named, and even thats debatable for some of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agnarr fight is a good example where MTank and Massist are not the same person. MT stays on Agnarr while MA calls out the adds.<br />
Maybe even more so in the 2 arenas before Agnarr where MT is on the named and everyone else is on the adds till they die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guild usues a *gasp* pally as MA most of the time, their gay stun get em high aggro in 1 cast. But no other than that (being MA) pally DO suck and so DO sk's. They only &quot;tank&quot; trash adds like the ones you get on your way to Agnarr, they never ever tank named tho, no way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MA is there to focus the dps of your raid imo. The MT is usually seperate or should be. If you are MT (the one with agro) it is hard to fast target for a raid. A person who can peel off at low life and have next target called for the MT to assist speeds things up tons. Especially in large crowds of people who are not shrank (don't get me started on that) and lots of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We have used wizzies as assist since we first entered Vex Thal (about 16 months ago? hard to remember back that far heh).<br />
<br />
What happens when your Main tank gets smoked.  Who do you assist?  A raid can go on without a MT, zerging mobs down and assist healing.  A raid is much less likely cannot go on without an assist, as mezzed mobs get woken up, damage gets spread, and generally people act like tards.<br />
<br />
Also a wizzie can stand in front of the next target he/she plans to assist and as soon as the last one dies, target the next mob, so 0 time is lost finding next assist mob.  Also a wizzie can take the time that the last mob is dieing to make the best decision for what to attack next, and doesnt have to worry about holding aggro or tanking like a warrior would.<br />
<br />
For a raid, MA != MT works best for a multitude of reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guild usues a *gasp* pally as MA most of the time, their gay stun get em high aggro in 1 cast. <br />
<br />
This is the kind of thinking that makes people believe they are the same thing.  Technically, the MA does not need to get aggro or tank anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RevlinXevlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That was basically my point. In every guild I've been in since I was able to raid fairly important stuff there has been no line between who and what class is the MA and who is the MT. Personally in a raid situation I want someone MA who can stop, drop, and roll if need be. But whatever gets the kill I guess works. I just like things to be clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dun forget teh RT!!<br />
<br />
Rampage Tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>RevlinXevlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have never heard of a Rampage tank hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rampage tanks are for mobs that do a lot of damage with their rampage (rampage is melee damage that goes to a person other then the player the mob is hitting). Some mobs can kill clerics and other casters with their rampage in one or two rounds, if it's not set properly to go to a rampage tank with dedicated healers it's going to eat up your raidforce one by one at a sometimes amazing rate.<br />
Figuring out how to deal with boss mobs that rampage is an important step in a guild's progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I often MA and MT trash. Yes, I feel your pain on large crowds of unshrunk people. What's worse though is root from the Stormriders in PoA. Fortuantely we have a good bunch of tanks and clerics. Someone else will tank it if I can't get to it. I just gotta call it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks Wolveren :)<br />
<br />
Yes that is what an RT is ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">MA = Main assist<br />
MT = Main Tank</div></div><hr />
