<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sargasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In an attempt to NOT beat a dead horse, I wanted to take a few minutes to examine what I feel are the severely overlooked issues with regards to the “casual” versus “uber” playerbases.<br />
<br />
From reading posts in prior message strings I gather there are two main issues that the more casual player has with the current makeup of Everquest.  Please correct me if I am wrong about these two generalities.<br />
<br />
1) casuals want access to gear that more closely approximates what the uber raiders have access to<br />
1) casuals are unhappy that content is essentially cut off from them to progress to without being in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Let me tackle the first issue first by asking a question. <br />
WHY, do those that for the purposes of this discussion, want access to gear and augments better than they can currently get from LDON’s and single group content?<br />
I think this is an important question to ask.  I am asking this from the perspective of someone that has been both a casual player and am now currently in an Time/Uqua guild.<br />
In the most basic and non biased view…Gear is and should be all about NEED.  Stop and think for a minute….why do the Ubers have access to the best gear.  Because the NEED it.  They need it for survival.  The massive HPs and resists available on high end gear along with the effects are all NEEDED to survive progressively harder RAIDS.  The gear is designed specifically with this in mind.  You simply cannot survive the incredible melee DPS and the nasty AE’s the high end mobs produce without this gear…and that is NOT the case in almost ALL single group content…and in my mind THIS is the difference.<br />
So I go back to the WHY do the casuals want the same (or close to it) gear that the ubers have?  <br />
<br />
Gear availability should be appropriate to the content you are tackling…what is it that you NEED to progress through the content YOU are doing.  I think if those of you that are in the “casual” status among us were to really stop and think about it objectively, you might realize that you don’t NEED the same type gear that the hardcore raider does.  You might WANT it, but that doesn’t mean its appropriate the you should be able to get it.<br />
Let me use GoD as an example since it is the newest expansion.  Is GoD tough?  Damn straight it is.  Can you manage to progress through GoD without being elemental and time geared….of course you can….you just can’t do the RAIDS.  GoD has a lot of really nice content and this is where point #2 above comes into play, but folks there is so much you can do in GoD with the best Ldon gear available…and LDON gear is available to ANYONE.  Yes you must put in your time in LDON to get the best gear, BUT its doable in short chunks of time for everyone.  Gear yourself in LDON gear and augments, buy a couple of other drops in bazaar and you are ready to move to the lower end GoD zones.<br />
<br />
Now there is this train of thought that says “GoD is strictly for the ubers,”  yet this is utter hogwash.  Look at this post.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214<br />
Ciae did a heck of a nice job showing us all just where to hunt and what to kill to have a shot at some VERY nice gear, some of which is close to being on par with elemental gear.  Yes it may take a while to gear up to move further this way, but casual folks say they don’t mind putting in the time to get what they want or need, they just can’t do it in 6 hour chunks.  If that is the case then this is perfect for you.  While this is NOT the same gear that drops in Time plus zones, its still upgrades over LDON gear.  Its still gear that you NEED to progress further in single groupable content.  Farm this stuff then start doing Tipt/Vxxed for better gear and augments.  Tipt/Vxxed drops elemental quality loot and its all single groupable.  Once you have beaten Tipt/Vxxed and farmed it for gear, move to Kod’taz and do the same thing.  Gear up with the gear and augs that drop in KT and then try your hand at the single groupable Ikky events.  Are they hard?  YES…but they are single groupable and if you have spent the time gearing up in the prior GoD zones they are NOT impossible.  Move into Yxxta from KT and farm the drops there…that drop off trash mobs.<br />
Now..most likely this is where your progress in GoD stops as a casual…but c’mon that’s a LOT of content for you to play with and since you will be farming it for gear as a single group, it will take you longer to do that raiders thus giving you plenty of content until Omens comes out.  Omens is supposed to introduce a TASK system that will give you even more to do…and I’m sure there will be exp zones there as well.<br />
<br />
Now you may say “this is all well and good” but that doesn’t change the fact that my progress stops far short of where an uber raider’s progress stops.<br />
This is true…but you have to understand that EQ has two player types to cater to…casual players and hardcore raiders…thus they have to create content for BOTH.  The problem is that the casual player cuts HIMSELF off from half the content by choosing to be casual.  This is not an indictment of the casual player in any way..its just logistics.  The raider has all the content available to him because he either chooses to raid OR has the time to do so, thus he can both raid and single group.  It is your CHOICE to remain casual, forced or not by circumstances.<br />
<br />
If you are a casual player, ask yourself this question….what would you do if suddenly all zones were open to all players?  Lets say Sony opened up Elementals for starters.  What would you do?  Do the casuals realize that the elemental planes offer very limited single group content and are designed MOSTLY for raiding?  The single groupable content is designed there for those that have been raiding and have the gear to handle it.  Should Sony dumb down the zones so that the casual player can go there for EXP?  Do you realize that even if you had access to Elementals you would get almost no gear there without raiding as there isn’t much that drops off non raid mobs (yeah a few things but not much)?  Aren’t the hardcore raiders allowed to have content designed for them TOO?<br />
<br />
In my opinion Sony has actually done a pretty nice job of designing expansions for both casuals and ubers.  There is so much to do its ridiculous.  As a matter of fact, prior to the release of Gates, the last two expansions were designed with casuals in mind (LoY and LDON) and those that were finishing PoP had nothing to look forward to if they were hardcore.  Gates was definitely another raiding expansion, BUT there is a TON of content to do if you are casual, and much of it is very fun..you just have to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
For all of us, I hope we will in the future ask ourselves this question when we complain about gear, augments, spells, etc and the access we have to them….ask yourself  “DO I NEED THIS OR DO I JUST WANT IT.”<br />
Its kind of like the difference between being a HAM amateur radio operator and a FM station operator…what type of equipment do I NEED to do the task at hand.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />

For not wanting to beat a dead horse you sure do a god job of kicking the shit out of it.  We already have over 100 pages of this in 3 other threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) casuals want access to gear that more closely approximates what the uber raiders have access to<br />
<br />
I don't think that's exactly correct.  I believe it would be closer to the truth to say that casuals want access to gear that allows them to progress reasonably against the content.  Progress reasonably as they define it.  If the gear was still substantially below the gear available to raiders, but casuals (non-raiders as well) felt they were capable of dealing with the content provided comfortably, that would probably be sufficient.  It isn't so much about raiders versus casuals/non-raiders, but content designed for raiders versus casuals/non-raiders.<br />
<br />
1) casuals are unhappy that content is essentially cut off from them to progress to without being in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Not some content, but rather most content.  I think people are probably okay with a small percentage of an expansion being beyond their foreseeable capabilities unless they join a raiding guild.  It's the fact that such a large portion of several expansions have been that way.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh and by the way, your perspective isn't particularly different from numerous other posters.  You're certainly entitled to your opinion, but just because you see things your way doesn't mean everyone else is going to or that you have a snowball's chance in hell of changing their minds on the topic.  Your time might be better spent elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice post Glatius,<br />
<br />
Having SoE review the progression path for casual players and insuring the game provides one is IMO needed. SoE should then IMO fix this path if and where it needs fixing. SoE can lead a horse to water, but it can't make it drink.<br />
<br />
On my server at least there are dozens (prehaps more) of guilds doing content and trying to progress.<br />
<br />
I'm not convinced that beyond insuring there is a progression path that SoE should create 99% of the content with casual players in mind. I think there are large numbers of not so strictly casual players that log on several times a week, progress through content, and move on to the next part - there always needs to be a next part. Someone who logs on only ocassionally and isn't motivated to progress, isn't at least to my mind someone who needs the bulk of the game designed to meet their needs.<br />

<br />
<br />
Zones that casual/non-raiders were not able to see in previous expansions:<br />
<br />
Old world: none<br />
<br />
Kunark: none (vp key was easy, just tedious and the only raid bit was tradeable)<br />
<br />
Velious: Sleeper's Tomb. One talisman was tradeable, however.<br />
<br />
Luclin: Vex Thal, inner acrylia and two other boss encounters which were easily (albeit tediously) unlockable. Inner Acrylia was changed, no longer locked. (not that anyone cared)<br />
<br />
Planes of Power: when first released, much of it needed to be unlocked. Currently, only the elemental planes, Plane of Time, Plane of Tactics, Tower of Solusel Ro and HoHB are locked. Tactics has an alternate entry quest, one groupable.<br />
<br />
LoY: none<br />
<br />
LDoN: none. But being unlocked and being doable are two different things when it comes to the raids.<br />
<br />
GoD: Kod'Taz and up is locked. It is possible for a casual/non raider to break into Kod'Taz.<br />
<br />
<br />
That seems like TWO expansions with a large number of locked zones. Hardly several.  And of these zones, only three are considered useable for regular exp or really, doing anything without a raid. PoEarth, PoFire, Kod'Taz. You can do some things in PoWater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WHY, do those that for the purposes of this discussion, want access to gear and augments better than they can currently get from LDON’s and single group content?<br />
to be able to progress futher in the single group content that are hidden behind raid content. I mean, top casual can do hard LDoN and sewer but can't do inkiz that is a one group content. <br />
before casual where able to hunt in the same zones has raiders but they were using different quarters (trash for casual, boss for raiders). now there is two different playing field.<br />
<br />
 Now..most likely this is where your progress in GoD stops as a casual…but c’mon that’s a LOT of content for you to play with and since you will be farming it for gear as a single group, it will take you longer to do that raiders thus giving you plenty of content until Omens comes out.<br />
<br />
is it just me or this part looks like a bone that a lord would throw at his dog. If I wasn't cool now, I would pick up my firelauncher and burn you out.<br />
<br />
Omens is supposed to introduce a TASK system that will give you even more to do…and I’m sure there will be exp zones there as well.<br />
<br />
task sytem is for lvl 1 to 50 dumbass. do you really think that casuall are below lvl 50.<br />
<br />
bla bla bla <br />
<br />
well the rest of your post goes even futher in the insult mode so I will stop here, there is enougth other player that will torn you appart.<br />
<br />
NOTE : you didn't answered to your second 'first' issues :<br />
<br />
 1) casuals are unhappy that content is essentially cut off from them to progress to without being in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
you should have tried to, you would have gain a peice of brain. it would have been lonly between your aers but at least you would have had some.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : your title was &quot; A Different Perspective on the &quot;CASUAL&quot; issue  &quot;, personnalyy I don't see any difference from your point of view and the dumb one in the previous thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, prior to the big summit the impression was clearly out there that OoW was going to be following the PoP/GoD model.  Perhaps that has changed, they've certainly claimed it has, time will tell.  But lets also consider LDoN.  Casuals/Non-raiders are going to have a very hard time in a LDoN hard without having spent considerable time, more time than many people would consider reasonable, gearing up in LDoN easy.  LDoN also offers raid events which non-raiders/casuals won't in all likelihood attempt/succeed at.  So since we want to quibble, it appears that 2/3 of LDoN is difficult enough to be on the cusp of locking non-raiders/casuals out of it.<br />
<br />
Interesting point on the elemental planes.  So raiders go and get their experience in PoWater and BoT?  Doubtful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This was my main point!!!  The gear available to casuals IS sufficient to allow them to progress.  Ldons, Veksar, Chardok B, etc are all places you can go to gear up....LDON augments....once you have all that stuff you CAN move to lower end GoD stuff and start farming it.<br />
Will it be hard?  YES!!!<br />
IT SHOULD BE...RAIDING content is HARD.  Should there be risk of death?  YES if you want the rewards offered, the risk should be there.  The point is there are ways to gear up in EQ as it is currently designed for the single group casual player to tackle most of the single group content (which there is plenty of).  SOME will always be reserved for higher end folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes Sargasso, we understand your opinion.  At least a portion of the player base doesn't agree with it.  And your point is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok then my question is what part do you disagree with?  Is it that you don't believe that the gear available is enough to allow progression for single groups?  Did you check the link I put  near the top of the first post...shows all the drops and mobs in the easier of the GoD zones?  I'm just wondering what I'm missing...do people want the gear available to make the content trivial?  I'm not criticizing, I'm trying to understand this from an objective viewpoint.  I mean I don't think that as you arrive at new content is should be trivial already should it?<br />
I suppose if thats the thought process people are using then we do have a fundamentally different way of looking at things.  Even if you are raiding, content when it is first encountered is far from Trivial and takes time and gear ups to beat...so i guess I just think that single group content should be similar.<br />
I think thats reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you have the wrong idee, the question is does LDoN gears allow to get tipt/Vxed loot and does tipt/Vxed loot allow to get KT/Inkiz loot.<br />
you are showing a profile with tipt/Vxed loot and lower, and you pretent it enouth to beat the top casual content which is tipt/Vxed. <br />
don't you think something is wrong in this loop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sargasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">look at this, do you really think than a casual can buff to this point ? and still low GoD is on the edge. so if they have to face it undergeared to get the loot ...<br />
<br />
The context of that discussion was in the mountain passes...which are TIPT/VXXED...which are a little further up the progression chart in GoD.   No...a person geared LDON only will never pass that...which was the reason I mentioned doing the Riwwi, Natimbi, Qinimi, Sewers, etc stuff first to gear up some.  Again didn't say any of it would be easy , but raiding isn't easy either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No Sargasso, I didn't check out the link.  I've seen dozens of links.  I've heard numerous people claim that gear progression is now a piece of cake in GoD and that their great grandmother can easily tank the mobs there in gear from Kunark.  I've seen the exaggerated claims, I've seen the non-raiders held up as shinning examples of what a non-raider can do, and I'm still not buying it.<br />
<br />
You like the progress?  You think the game is set up just fine for raiders/non-raiders/casuals?   You think everything is dandy?  Great, here's a cookie.  Not everyone agrees.  And I personally don't want to get into another long drawn out verbose arguement over it.  Enjoy your opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope you are misreading what I said...I NEVER said LDON gear would allow you to compete in TIPT/VXXED...I said Ldon gear, augs, and also should include AAs in this, would allow you to START GoD progression in Riwwi, Qinimi, Barindu, Natimbi, sewers.  Gear up in those areas THEN move to try Tipt/Vxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My toes are so sore I can barely walk.<br />
/em makes note to himself: buy steeltoed next time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The word Casual gets lost heavily in the content.  Look at this from a different perspective.  Let's take the original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; yeah the ol' 8 bit gold colored Nintendo game.<br />
<br />
So here you are the &quot;Casual&quot; player that hops on and gets some stuff done for 1-2 hours.  Save you character, then turn off the machine.  Now, you can progress all the way to the very end of the game.  The &quot;Casual&quot; player.  It may take hours, days, weeks, month's...yet you can make it there.<br />
<br />
So if the persay &quot;Casual&quot; player logs onto EQ, they want a chance to get to some of these things.  Its like throwing a road block say on Level 6 of Zelda saying, Oh I'm sorry you can't go there unless you have an uber raid force.<br />
<br />
Viably understandable that those who pained, suffered, toiled there way to the top.  Yet they had to be in a Raiding Guild.  Where the &quot;Casual&quot; person who logs on, will never get a chance to see it.<br />
<br />
Thus ending the point on, if the content is only for those who heavily raid, have more time than god knows what to do with, that should be slapped as a Sticker on the side of the EQ box stating:<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you plan to play this game mindlessly for hours on end, Don't even bother purchasing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
However that would be something logical and rational...and SoE doesn't have the time or inclination to do so.  Too busy counting the money that is being pumped into their wallets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sargasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So if the persay &quot;Casual&quot; player logs onto EQ, they want a chance to get to some of these things.

<br />
I'm not sure thats a great analogy simply because EQ is now designed around BOTH raiding and single group content.<br />
I ask again...lets say a casual player would be able to access the END game of PoP through a series of difficult but doable one group quests.  What then?  There is nothing to DO in Time except fight raid style encounters. <br />
<br />
I think the mindset needs to change to be honest with you.  The game just has two different ending points.  There is an ending point for single group content (lets call it that instead of casual) and there is an ending point for Raid content.  Since EQ isn't a single player game this is just a natural evolution of the game.  Thats why I asked what do the &quot;single group&quot; folks expect to see if they aren't limited in their access?  There isn't much TO see in the upper zones as they are designed for raids.  The fact that the zones are separated instead of in the same zones (like Kael..u can exp there or raid there) is really the only difference and thats really semantics.  Doing it in separate zones allows raiders to raid without worrying about accidentally training a single group and it allows single groups to not have to deal with getting overrun by a raid...remember those fun days?<br />
<br />
I guess if your point is that there isn't enough content for single groups, then you may then have a point, although I honestly can't see it....seems to be plenty of stuff for one group to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What do we casuals want?<br />
My wish list<br />
1. Not being percieved as inadequate by similarly geared/progressed classes. Maybe it goes with the territory but i doubt many classes outside of tanks need to give their stats before being allowed into open content such as hard ldons.<br />
2. Make the bazaar trader upgrade path less attractive - LDON grind + buy low sell high is a sad upgrade path i would say. Some good NoDrop loot in old zones would be nice<br />
2. Some of the new amazing game design that makes the raiders lyrical. <br />
Heres a quote! (from the why do you raid thread)<br />
&quot;...The EP/PoTime raids are very very good. They are so unlike Trak and AoW that it's like an entirely different game. The GoD raids are much better. They are harder in many dimentions. I've completed Uqua - it's unbelieveable. I'm working on Inkta'Tu - atm, I hate it like poison. It's VERY hard to get traction on some of these raids. You puzzle it out, take a crack at it, fail, fail, succeed at a little piece of it, push on a bit, etc. It puts the whole guild - all of it through their paces.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I didn't read it exactly the way you intended it.  All the same, setting up numerous zones per expansion as &quot;raid&quot; only zones and locking them away is a dumbass concept.  It does me no good as a customer for SoE to market an expansion as being &quot;a full 20 zones!!!&quot; when of the 20 zones, 2 are &quot;city&quot; zones with no mobs/loot/experience, 6 are raid only zones, 10 are keyed zones requiring drops off raid caliber boss mobs, leaving perhaps 4 or 6 zones where non-raiders/casuals can access, adventure, and acquire a smidgen of loot and experience.  Granted we can actually &quot;enter&quot; the city zones too, but they're essentially useless as far as &quot;playing&quot; the game is concerned.</div></div><hr />

I agree, that's a good way to measure the viability of the progression.<br />
<br />
I think the progression is doable with extra steps in there.  But it takes a lot of baby steps, and requires a time investment in GOD that is not too far off from the time investment of LDON.  I don't pretend that it will be satisfying to those for whom there are no alternatives.<br />

LDON + Riwwi/Sewers + Ferubi/Barindu/hardLDON + Vxed + Tipt + Kodtaz loot gives one a fighting chance in Yxxta/Ikkinz.<br />

Ideally, by the time one reaches Ikkinz, OOW is out and further/alternate paths of advancement are available.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I just remembered Sol Ro and was coming back to correct myself. You beat me! ;)<br />

Glatius, would you prefer those locked up raid zones were unlocked, then you could get in there and die instead? Either way you still can't use it. I can see what you're saying, they shouldn't have so many zones that are raid only. I have heard that OoW will only have one locked zone(I'm not a reliable info source on this however), which will hopefully help alleviate this problem.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I consider it essentially the same thing.  However, there are non-raiders/casuals who want to have their shot at the content, even if they realistically can't succeed.  I can't think of any reason I would consider valid for not letting them take a stab at it, if that's what they want to do.  Trying and failing is certainly more attractive than not being allowed to try at all.</div></div><hr />

My sentiments exactly.  Aren't you guys bored with this yet?</div></div><hr />
