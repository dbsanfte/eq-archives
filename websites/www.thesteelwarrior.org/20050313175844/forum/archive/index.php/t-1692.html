for a total of 130 AC 420 hps in your primary and secondary slots?<br />
<br />
I'm not that uber but it sure seems to me that they got it right with these two items, and of course they drop off of our buddy Rallos.  Two thumbs up from me for whoever itemized this guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this combo of items you will have more aggro than a BoW plus an upgrade of 80 AC and 245 hitpoints.  If you pair it with a top-end offhand you will outdamage any warrior in the game and still have more ac/hps than a warrior with a BoW.  I know it's not cool to react positively to anything done in EQ but if you're calling that nothing more than a nice toy, you're on crack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For what it is worth I agree with Brutul .... if you have a bow and then have the chance to take the above combo but don't because you have a bow and it is good enough. Then I want some of what you are somkin. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It IS a nice sword, I agree, but as Ainmer put it i don't understand while everybody reacts like it's the second coming of Christ.<br />
<br />
To me, and to most other people, while agreeing that it is a decent step up from Bow, it didn't have the Awe factor that BF had, or BoW had when the first one dropped.<br />
<br />
But I'm jaded i guess :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wont complain, its &quot;the real upgrade&quot; everyone wanted to see.<br />
<br />
This is the BoW killer. Its &quot;THE WEAPON&quot;<br />
<br />
Now agreed, wont get us out of the &quot;Dumb Meatshield&quot; role.<br />
But i dont reasonably expect to see any improvement.<br />
<br />
I'd like some special lovin :<br />
- Min/Max hit reduction<br />
- Mods that Work<br />
- More Versatility<br />
<br />
But i dont expect to get any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's my point.  Look at it as a weapon.  I think Ainmer is reacting to him as if SoE said &quot;here, this item is a fix for all of warriors problems.  It's just a damn weapon, and as a weapon it blows away anything out there.  Compare it to a bloodfrenzy which is up until now the best warrior 1-hander and I don't see how you could say this isn't a &quot;wow&quot; upgrade.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with saying <br />
<br />
I'd like some special lovin :<br />
- Min/Max hit reduction<br />
- Mods that Work<br />
- More Versatility <br />
<br />
but that is a class revamp, not a mainhand weapon.  If somebody had asked me what I would want as an upgrade to a bloodfrenzy, this is all I would have asked for and more.<br />
<br />
Finally, THIS IS A WEAPON, NOT THE WARRIOR CLASS-BALANCING PACKAGE.  As a weapon it is very &quot;wow&quot; if you ask me.  It has more hitpoints on it than the bard or rogue elemental breastplates for cryin out loud.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh, I'm not talking about generic class balance, I am talking about some modicum of balance between what drops for some classes in time and elementals, and what drops for others.  This item should have an equivalent &quot;Wow&quot; factor that the shaman/ench items do.  It doesn't.<br />
<br />
BTW, I think the wiz/mage items suck as well.  The bard sword is awesome, tho.  The Pal/SK weapons are ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you pair it with a top-end offhand you will outdamage any warrior in the game<br />
<br />
 I'm not even positive this would outdamage Edge of Eternity from Saryrn, much less every other weapon there is(BoW/SEWS/Vanazir).<br />
<br />
 It is very nice, and is the top weapon for us now. But looking at it just didn't give me that tingly-in-the-pants feeling it should. Ratio is odd, but probably a good thing to keep ripostes down.</div></div><hr />

Mainhand damage bonus doesn't mean what it did when we were choosing between 9/18 and 12/24 though.</div></div><hr />

But the owner posted &quot;So far after 1 fight vs Bertox, i only proceed 1 time on a 5 min fight (w/o avatar)&quot; which is a far cry from the 2-3 procs a minute you get with BoW, BF respectively.<br />

Lets hope that was an unlucky 5 mins :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, 1 fight. I've gone 3-4 fights without a BoW proc many times, so it could have simply been unlucky.<br />
<br />
If its proc rate really is that low, it'll have to be retuned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They probably gave it a proc rate similar to other 1 handers we use but since the delay is about 50% higher on it that would cut the procs/unit of time by about 1/3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A rough estimate of dps comparing to an ornate greatblade (weapon that I use often still) can give something like this :<br />
<br />
A 35/31 14 bonus dmg 2-hander would be exactly 74% of a 35/23.  A 34/31 13 bonus dmg will be lower, let's say 70%.  You have to remove punishing blade.  Let's say it's something like 65%.<br />
<br />
Depending on buffs, with an ornate greatblade I see myself doing between 110dps up to 130 dps.  That usually exclude avatar and it's around 175 vengeance.<br />
<br />
65% of this is between 71.5 to 84.5 dps.  This generally fit with my excel damage calculator.  Proc will amount for at best another 3 dps (2 proc per minute), probably less.<br />
<br />
Is between 70 dps and 85 dps good for a 1-hander in this case scenario?  It's pretty good, probably just below the monk xegony 1-hander ratio not counting proc at 20/19.<br />
<br />
In this case to get the ornate greatblade dmg, you need an off-hander able to put out 38.5 to 45.5 dps or so.  The only off-hander I see able to do this would be itself as the best off-hander theorically, but it cannot go in that hand.  I doubt even the xeg monk 1-hander can go that high in my example.<br />
<br />
So to me just looking at the theory, I don't see how this weapon can do greater dps then an ornate greatblade (assuming an also good off-hander that war can use).  Ornate greatblade is less dps then the really high end 2-hander like bow/stone etched/the 60/38 from time, etc.  Even if you give this calculation a very high margin of error (which is unlikely), this weapon will never do 10% higher then a Bow.  But usual disclaimer, I could be mistaken and a few good parses would be nice!<br />
<br />
Not saying it's not good, but that's dps only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A ranger in guild parsed this:<br />
<br />
Stone Etched Mallet (26/28) and Bonechiller (14/17 +120 cold DD)<br />
<br />
Number of fights: 32<br />
Average fight time: 1:02 minutes<br />
Total Time: 32.24<br />
Attack: 1881-1951<br />
<br />
Melee Damage<br />
Total Crush DPS (SEM) = 81.85<br />
Total Slash DPS (BC) = 61.43<br />
Total Kick DPS = 2.89<br />
<br />
<br />
If i'm reading it correctly that would be 61.43 offhand dps from a 14/17, so from some of the other offhands available I wouldnt doubt 45+ dps.</div></div><hr />

Anger<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(0.00 sec/65) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 100 <br />
3:  Increase Hate by 650 <br />
  <br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean if the stun is resisted, the 650 hate part of the effect will not transfer through?<br />
<br />
We'll be killing the mob that drops this very soon, and before I loot this item, I'd like to know if this is the case.<br />
<br />
I remember certain spells with multiple effects (Barb of Tallon's snare/slow, for example) having their &quot;slots&quot; swapped around on Lucy, so that the whole effect would take place even if you &quot;blocked&quot; part of the effect.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have no idea how Lucy works, etc.<br />
<br />
If anyone could answer this, it'd be great!</div></div><hr />

Thats just resisting the stun cos the mob is immune, while resisting the proc itself would make sure that none of the 3 effects go thru, since they just got resisted.</div></div><hr />

Does the BP help out dramatically with aggro?<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to Weapon Affinity. If they'd just raise the success rate with the Taunt button or do something to end 2, 3, 4, .... failures in a row....<br />

<br />
I don't have a BP yet.  But I do have a SoPM and Boots of Despair.  The Boots 'do' help some, but it's not massively noticable, you still fail taunts plenty.  But I've been seeing more strings of failures around 2-3 fails, rather than 3-5... which is nice.  SoPM is great, I wouldn't want another range.  I don't think it adds more aggro than a DBotW, but it is nice.<br />
<br />
Now for my complaints... I just got Anger III on my DBotW a few days ago.  And so far I cannot notice ANY difference in the aggro that I generate.  I thought it would be great.  But I can still loose aggro just as easilly to Paladins or Overnuking/snaring wizards :(  Even had a cleric get summoned and killed on Bertox last night :(<br />
<br />
The proc from anger III is 50 less aggro, plus no stun or DD, and for me, it is dramatically less aggro than the DBotW's Anger proc.  I think I should have just saved myself the time and effort and stuck Force of Ykesha on it... I guess that's what I'll put on my EoE.<br />
<br />
Maybe the BP will help a ton, I've heard it's very nice.... specially since we have no SKs that raid anymore, so VoT is not an option.<br />
<br />
For sure the most annoying thing (other than using the mouse to swap weapons) is failing taunt 2-5 times in a row, specially on raids or LDoN hard adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I frequently group with another Warrior that has a BP. Our set ups are almost the same, Blade of War augmented with Ykesha. Sine he has gotten the BP I have noticed it's a struggle to pull agro off him with just procs alone. Before he had the BP we both could attack without the mob flip floppin, one would have to toss in a taunt to lock agro. Now I would need to taunt constantly just to hold ago. If you have problems holding agro, I'm pretty sure the BP will help lock it down. &lt;=== that's a DUHH statement.<br />

I'm still debating the DBotW though. I'm sure I will give in if we get lucky on drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought there was supposed to be a hard cap on taunt for us at 230?  If so then a 10% boost should have zero effect.  Has anyone parsed taunt success with the boots to see if it's greater than 60%?  If it's not then the taunt mod is useless to a warrior.</div></div><hr />
