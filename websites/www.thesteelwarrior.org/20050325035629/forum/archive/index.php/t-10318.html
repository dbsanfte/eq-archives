BiC corpse exploit ?<br />
<br />
Thats gotta be some sick agro &amp; stats....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to have both epic 1.5 and 2.0. but I don't see why someone able to have the epic 2.0 wouldn't have a better weapon than 1.5. <br />
Moreover both the effect and the clikies of the 2.0 and 1.5 don't stack, so it would be only for stats  purpuse (and fame maybe). moreover it must be damn long to get 4 A3 aug to get viable weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not at all.  Plenty of warriors were augmenting multiple weapons with Anger 3 before the augments could be removed.  When you upgrade to a better weapon, do you immediately destroy the old one?  Not usually... it gets banked.<br />
<br />
Hence why several warriors in my guild had several Anger augments lying around (one had at least six) the day that augment removal went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i never got a Darkblade (2 drops in 40 kills, passed them for other warriors).<br />
Tacvi was considerer too hard &amp; not good enough when i came back to EQ with OOW coming out.<br />
And i doubt i will ever see CoA,  despite having the flag, WoW/EQ2 killed my server.<br />
<br />
So doing the quest 2 times is really interesting :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably but look at it the other way around, i'll never have DBlade / BBoB / Fleshbiter / 2.0<br />
<br />
30ac 285hp VS 45ac 235hp 3% shielding.<br />
<br />
So dual wielding 1.5's should be nice when you want a bit more stats than the MSC.<br />
And dont absolutely need a shield (got screwed on that one too).<br />
<br />
Not to mention 1.5bis is gonna be free. <br />
<br />
<br />
We're gonna do time for the fun &amp; to quickly gear up some gimp apps.<br />
And i was talking with another warrior w/o DBlade, he asked me if i wanted DBlade.<br />
Surprisingly i said no, unless it decays .....<br />
MSC for everything.   Epic/JoS for 30 seconds,  Epic/Shield after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hum hum, but 1.5 is lore so if you can't have the 2.0 you won't have a second 1.5 too.<br />
<br />
EDIT : I forgot you you may refer 1.5bis as the raging sword of ... (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=60329) and not a second 1.5. sorry to be retarded once again. but I don't what power is required for the 1.8 (my calling for the raging...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">turn in the CoA orb and process by the quest , you will get raging (but 1.5 has to be turned in at the same step)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stacey3607</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">orb turn in has been bugged <br />
so korbuk has been eating warrior's orb, rage, and 1.5<br />
gm hands those items back to warrior AND give him the flag for the turn in....<br />
war kills korbuk in NC an gets 2.0 while still having his 1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-23-2005, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oki, so that's explain why someone has both epic 1.5 and 2.0. So it doesn't answer the question &quot;can you redo the epic quest after being flagged as epic wielder?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, I've got both - due to the turnin bug mentioned above. Got BBoB in primary already though, so grats bank. I can't see anyone getting epic2.0 yet having a need to wield epic1.5. No doubt they'll fix the hail order bug and leave the 'extra' Epic1.5s in existance as a 'trophy' for the dozen or so wars serverwide that went through the quest first.</div></div><hr />
