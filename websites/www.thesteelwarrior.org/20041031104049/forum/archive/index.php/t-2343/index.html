<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its clicked, 3 second cast time.</div></div><hr />

Its actually pretty nice for the no ench no shaman exp groups (read: bardcentric). <br />
<br />
No... the effect is pretty crappy unless you don't have shaman, enchanter, or bard in group. <br />
<br />
Glove click effect (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3710) <br />
<br />
Notice the duration and cast time.  O well, they made the BP effect nice *cough* NOT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>juraveil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The gloves are great to have for the click effect alone for the times your grouping and have no access to haste by enchanter, shaman ect..  Its a decent upgrade from eyepatch of plunder, and it last ALOT longer than the eyepatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vixyyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I have a set, and since the buff stacks with any other haste ( not the haste iteself just the buff) it is handy when no chanty/shammy avail, and also to keep some extra haste going, when your caster is busy and you loose it in the middle of a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No... the effect is pretty crappy unless you don't have shaman, enchanter, or bard in group. First of all, click effect stacks with bard haste. Second, not everyone has a pocket chanter. This is a great effect for those time that there are no shammys/chanters around. 6 seconds is not a long cast time. You can refresh haste while puller is bringing the next mob. Like someone else mentioned, this is also a nice click for the times haste drops in battle or you get rezzed back in to a fight. Can't always have haste on demand, unless you have these or eye patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">click effect stacks with bard haste <br />
<br />
Stacks? you mean the icon sits there and has no effect, yes, true.<br />
<br />
 nice click for the times haste drops in battle  <br />
<br />
Not at a 6 second cast :/<br />
<br />
And no, its simply my opinion, that's fine.  My opinion, sell the mold in bazaar, keep the myrmidion.  Not worth the 500pp for the furnace and emblem.  Again, my opinion.  6 second cast time and a 12 minute buff sounds nice at first.  Yes, its nice when you duo with a cleric / druid, agreed.  It gets old clicking somethign for 6 seconds every 12 minutes... would have been nice if instant or lasted longer, that was my implied response.  Should have lasted longer or been insta.<br />
<br />
just my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, though the entry for the spell in Lucy shows a cast time of 6.0, the gaunts themselves show a cast time of 3.0.<br />
<br />
But yes, I think people are falling into the old &quot;Bard haste stacks with spell haste&quot; fallacy. The only bard haste songs that stack with regular spell haste are the Ervaj line and the various overhaste songs like the VahShir line and Rizlona's. Standard bard haste does NOT &quot;stack&quot; with other hastes in the that you get additive effect of both hastes. Both icons are there, and you get the stats of both effects, but only the higher haste takes effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Check that duration again...it is 1hour and 12 minutes, not 12 minutes.  The gauntlets are not that bad, and are great when you have no haster in the group.  A self buffed 60%+ haste can be a beautiful thing in certain situations.  Did wonders the other day in Droga without and hasting or slowing classes in the group.  I went ahead and picked them up since I can't win a roll on SS armor....I must be roughly 0 for 200 on rolls in that place.  I just picked up ornate for every slot but bp and legs and will live with it for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">...it is 1hour and 12 minutes <br />
<br />
Ahh buggers.<br />
<br />
Well crap, I hope I made someone happy with the gauntlet molds I sold in the bazaar :/<br />
<br />
/walks away laughing, tongue in cheek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stacks? you mean the icon sits there and has no effect, yes, true. <br />
Standard bard haste does NOT &quot;stack&quot; with other hastes in the that you get additive effect of both hastes.No, by stacks I mean adds additional haste to your item haste+Miraculous visions, who said anything about &quot;standard&quot; bard haste?<br />
<br />
Warsong of the Vah Shir (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2610&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Rizlona's Call of Flame (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3362&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Stacking the above songs with Miraculous Visions would be preferable than straight bard haste in many cases. If your bard is under lvl 62, you get more haste with MV+Warsong of the Vah Shir. Also, MV also buffs STA, which you would not have without a shaman.<br />
<br />
It also makes a bard's twist easier. Since we are talking about no shammy/enchanter situations, the bard is also going to be on slow duty so they will be twisting Slow+Mana+one other. You would benefit more from adding Rizlona's to slow+mana since your casters would get the damage focus and you would still get the same net haste as if you where playing Warsong of Zek (60%). I know it's possible to twist more than 3 songs at a time, but the idea is to have fun, not to burn your bard out in 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry folks but:<br />
<br />
1. I am not a Lucy guru (thank you though showing me the stack tab...thats hella cool stuff)<br />
<br />
2. I based my observation of &quot;stacking&quot; from the bards I've grouped with...it seems to make a difference but to be honest I have had my &quot;bard songs&quot; window off for awhile so I dont know exactly what i was interacting with.   Agro was better with the gauntlet click effect on than w/o so I assumed a beneficial effect.<br />
<br />
All that aside (eq librarianism) my point was the gauntlets have some utility contrary to some of the opinions expressed.  I still hold to that.  The duration and cast time work just fine for me to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I definately want a pair of these asap, but no luck on the drop and I spent what cash I had on the arms (upgrade from FH). I have a 65 Druid on my other account to duo with and for those slack times, farming tradeskill stuffs etc they would be great. <br />
<br />
And people keep saying, for when there's no shaman/chanter/bard. Don't forget Beastlords can haste too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The effect on gaunts is just 30% haste, there is no stamina buff involved with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The duration  is nice and its always nice to have &quot;junk&quot; buffs up in exp groups.  I put my eyepatch in the &quot;why I hate this f-ing game bag&quot; in my bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I haven't had much of a chance to test the effect out yet, but one time in a bard group, I did try it out.  It seemed to me that miraculous visions was negating the bard haste (was loosing aggro like crazy to a monk).  The monk even said he thought I was swinging slow.  I clicked it off and didn't have any problems the rest of the day.  I was going to test this before starting a roumer, but maybe someone else has had a simliar experience?  I'm sure I'm wrong, and it was probably just bad luck.  Still a very useful effect though regardless.</div></div><hr />

40% spell haste 5 sec casting time.  Duration 18 minutes.  10 charges and rechargable with a class 5 mana battery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Beastlords get a 40% haste at level 60...nothing until then. =(<br />
<br />
Considering the 72min duration with 30% haste, this effect is pretty damn nice IMO.  Would be better with some stat boost or hate mod, but very good as it is.<br />
<br />
Even the highest enchanter hastes don't last 72 minutes.  Speed of Vallon, or even enchanter epic effect, only last 42 minutes.  Those 40-60% hastes last about 16 minutes.  If you don't have a haster in group it's good.  If you have a bard, it's still good because then the bard can twist the Haste v3 songs (I've found those cap-breaking hastes, Haste v3, actually slow you down instead of speeding you up if there's not a haste spell/song on you already).  If the haster is a bit behind on the haste, or is busy or just died, just click and you have haste.<br />
<br />
Wonderful effect all around, and it's only 500pp! (unless you buy the mold, then it can get expensive)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">highest enchanter hastes don't last 72 minutes.<br />
<br />
SCRM + 8th shawl = 71.4 minute SoV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">still  not 72 minutes.. I'll take kizraks over eyeplatch anyday but i'd still keep the patch for the stats. if i had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The effect on gaunts is just 30% haste, there is no stamina buff involved with it. You are correct sir. Yet another victim of trust Lucy blindly. Still a great effect to have if you don't have a pocket chanter. I am seriously considering selling my Velium Encrusted when I score a gaunt mold. Seems like 2ac 15hp is a good trade for always having at least 30% haste and it would give me some plats to work with to upgrade something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You were probably looking at &quot;Marvelous Visions&quot; which is 30% haste + STA. The gloves have &quot;Miraculous Visions&quot; as the effect, which is only the haste. Evidently the gloves did have Marvelous Visions as the effect at some point, but it was changed *sigh* pointless nerf.</div></div><hr />

They changed it so it would stack with Kizrak's pants effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, since Marvelous Visions gave more stamina than the click from the legs, that doesn't seem like much of a comfort. Ok, maybe having a 50 sta buff on the gloves in addition to the haste was a bit TOO nice :)</div></div><hr />
