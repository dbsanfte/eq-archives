I am an extremely casual player and have lots of alts.  After PoP came out, when groups wanted warriors, everyone wanted Ogre warriors for the high stamina and unable to stun in the front.<br />
<br />
Today I was reading a post that one of the best warriors to make now is a RZ gnome warrior with points in charisma.  Can someone please explain what has changed?<br />
<br />
How does Charisma help a warrior?<br />
<br />
Why a gnome other than can use tinkered armor?  Does intelligence play a larger part now in tanking?<br />
<br />
I realize that I don't play the end game and probably never will but I don't like being in the dark with how to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for being a gnome, its easier to corner mobs the smaller you are, so that is presumably why. <br />
<br />
and worshipping rallos zek is a no brainer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fafnir</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For any warrior that wants to tank in difficult boss fights, gnome RZ with points in CHA is best.<br />
<br />
Gnome =&gt; can corner without shrink<br />
RZ =&gt; cheap and excellent cultural armor<br />
CHA =&gt; divine intervention goes off regularly<br />
<br />
When tanking a boss mob, MT needs to stay up - divine intervention gives a partial/complete heal when you get close to death... i.e. you can protect against the spikes that might normally kill you.<br />
<br />
Here are some stats on CHA and DI:<br />
<br />
50 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 20 <br />
Partial - 23 <br />
Fail - 57 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 43% <br />
<br />
<br />
125 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 38 <br />
Partial - 17 <br />
Fail - 45 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 55% <br />
<br />
<br />
200 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 33 <br />
Partial - 15 <br />
Fail - 23 <br />
Success/Partial (could not tell difference) - 29 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 77% <br />
<br />
<br />
280 cha: <br />
<br />
Success - 46 <br />
Partial - 12 <br />
Fail - 3 <br />
Success/Partial - 39 <br />
<br />
Success/Partial rate - 97%<br />
<br />
Since CHA is hard to raise and generally starts low for big races, it is the best choice to put your starting stats into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're looking at a non-raiding warrior, your best bet is a fatty race with your points in dex.  You won't be having DI cast on you, you won't have the amazing high-stat PoP armor, and the fatty races have useful innate advantages besides the high stats (regen for trolls, no frontal stun for ogres).  Especially for XP groups, not being subject to stun from the front is a really handy advantage.  Oh, and worshipping RZ is critically important; it's extremely difficult to find armor for the non-visible armor slots that matches or betters FH armor.<br />
<br />
If you're looking at a raiding warrior, your starting stats are truly irrelevant, and regen is not a significant factor (not when you're getting a CHeal every two seconds).  So Trolls become uninteresting, and Ogres remain interesting only because of the no frontal stun.  On the other hand, on a raid you should have no problem getting a few shrinks and an illusion, so being a gnome is less useful for cornering than it would otherwise be.  But what god you worship is almost irrelevant; it's trivial to raid for better equipment than FH armor, so the period where FH is a big advantage is really brief.<br />
<br />
Which means that it really comes down to no frontal stun (Ogre, great for tanking hard-hitting mobs where it can be hard to hold aggro if perma-stunned), higher AC (Iksar, +50 AC or so at the highest levels), or higher CHA (half elf or wood elf, 75 charisma vs. a gnome's 60 charisma).<br />
<br />
Honestly, the 23 CHA that an ogre gives up even to a gnome is a significant factor in DI, and the 38 CHA advantage of one of the elven race is just huge.  On the other hand, I suspect that at the highest levels of the raiding game, getting CHA up to 280 (or even 305) should be relatively straightforward, between high-stat gear, augments, enchanter buffs, and bard songs.  But I don't play at that level, and so I wouldn't know.<br />
<br />
My choice?  For a non-raiding warrior, an Ogre worshipping Rallos Zek seems obvious.  For a raiding warrior, either an Ogre worshipping Rallos Zek (might as well), or a half elf worshipping, eh, RZ if they can, otherwise it doesn't much matter.  And since charisma can be compensated for, but 100% immune to frontal stun cannot, I'd probably go with the ogre.  But the half elf would be a solid choice, and I may well be wrong to prefer the ogre for a raiding warrior.<br />

<br />
My base is 57, with cha from shammy plus bard song, i break 250 charisma easily, and it is damn useful for DI to go off.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation, any race/warr combo will work, just seems big races are more popular.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barbs are fun because we get few of the benefits of being a large race with the same base vision as a human!<br />
<br />
But seriously, it doesn't matter much in the end on class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People make such a big deal out of frontal stuns. I have no issues holding agro even while stunned. If you get stunned you can still hit taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomes get an exp bonus. Therefore they get to 65 faster. Fatties get a penalty, and so do iksar. I know I'm still working on AAs, and if that's affected by the exp penalty then gnome really has a significant advantage until yer capped.<br />
<br />
  Side note: You never realize how wonderful no frontal stun is when you're an ogre, and you pretend it's not so bad as everyone else. I've been stunned by melee hits &lt; 50 times in my entire career as a warrior. It really is significant until everyone else gets SE.</div></div><hr />

Halflings are also small enough that they can corner well. Ogres, Trolls and Iksar get an exp penalty (I'm not sure if barbarians do anymore as well, but they used to have a small one).<br />
<br />
The problem with shrunk big races, like ogres, trolls and barbies, is that even shrunk there are a few places where for some reason their &quot;wide&quot; geometry still gets in the way, even shrunk. That's why sometimes you'll see the big races being changed to &quot;thinner&quot; races -- like elves -- before they're shrunk, and why there is a demand by large tanking classes for the Crown of Deceit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=11277).<br />
<br />
My warrior is a barbarian, and he's very good in exp groups, but if I had to do it all again with the intent of making a raiding warrior, I'd go halfling or gnome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;On the other hand, on a raid you should have no problem getting a few shrinks and an illusion, so being a gnome is less useful for cornering than it would otherwise be.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think that's wrong.<br />
<br />
A shrunk ogre is still an ogre.  In other words, you're still wider side to side and front to back than a gnome, and you have an inherent geometry disadvantage for corner tanking.  I know ogre warriors that won't take a shrink, they want illusion wood elf or illusion gnome when they are corner tanking, they say it's easier to corner tank as a gnome than a shrunk ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read more carefully, please, QuirtEvans.  I said, &quot;on a raid you should have no problem getting a few shrinks and an illusion&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice the &quot;and an illusion&quot; there?  Yes, shrink on an ogre != being a gnome.  But illusion gnome on an ogre == being a gnome.<br />
<br />
In the high-end game, any disadvantage that can be fully compensated for (low starting stats, wrong geometry) is no disadvantage on a raid.  Thus, you should go for advantages that have no full compensation (no frontal stun, iksar AC bonus).  IMHO.<br />
<br />
