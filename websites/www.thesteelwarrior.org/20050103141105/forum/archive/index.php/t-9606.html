<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know if there will be any server listing released before the servers go live? Would be nice to know, ya know, to get friends gathered up before the release date. <br />
<br />
Or will we only find out when the servers go live? (which is the 8th, correct? or could it be later?)</div></div><hr />

We then all reply when we get our character names and into the owrld so we can meet up. We will then all meet up on the isle, we will choose whoevers instance is the most empty and coordinate from there.<br />
<br />
A little planning ought to make things go smoother while we all get aquainted to the new controls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just checked my email, looks like they sent it out on the 4rth. I preordered at gamestop. My gf preordered hers at bestbuy a bit later, but their information was a bit borked. Grrrrrr @ bestbuy &gt;&lt; But anyway, she called and they said it's being shipped around that time also. So...that means the game should arrive before the servers go live, or on that date. Unless you have really slow shipping :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ2 is being released November 16th now.  Was gonna be on the 9th, but the explanation i got from the guy at gamestop was that he thought that SOE thought that not many people would want to go out and buy it and have to wait in the huge lines that will accompany Halo 2 on the 9th...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bullix</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that guy is a Moron then becouse Everquest 2 main home pages has the  times still counting down to Nov 9th and a guild mate of mine  working @ comp USA and they are releasing it the  9th also  she told me today  she also told me know cool the art on the box is and she wanted to  hide it under her shirt but didn't<br />

I read a moorgard response that server lists will not be announced until game day, more or less. The boards are closed and wiped, as is the player site, so just where'd you get the info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was up on the official Sony site for all of 15 minutes before they caught it and removed it. Several sources have seen the info there and then copied and pasted it prior to its removal.<br />
<br />
My guess is that this is just a partial list of the servers. In beta they were doing some server testing of at least 30 servers so that is where my guess comes from. I am still taking a wait and see attitude with this list.</div></div><hr />
