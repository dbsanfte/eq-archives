<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CherryCoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 34 Warrior and my main is a 65 Wizard. I love playing the warrior class but now in my heart I'm not going to be able to take him to 65 with work, school, and family. I decided that I'm going to make my warrior my permanent Naggy / Vox tank. I've always had fun going on pickup Naggy / Vox raids and decided that I'm going to use him for that sole purpose.<br />
<br />
My challenge or question for the masses that are probably more experienced than me is the following <br />
<br />
What would be the ultimate or the best set of gear for a 52 warrior that will probably never go further than 52. Optimized generally in AC, HP, and Stats. I'm not asking for the most HP's or the highest AC. I'm asking for some ideas for the best overall warrior profile. Does any of this make sense? heh. <br />
<br />
Lets say for instance that money will allow for one big purchase.<br />
and set that as a criteria. I have a RGB currently but the rest of the gear is fairly common (Champions gear, SCWB x2, Clattering Bone Necklace, Velium Fire Rings, etc) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, I cant wait to see whats cooked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">first off if you warrior doesn't worship RZ or the Tribunal, re roll him now.<br />
<br />
Second, CoF is great, get a copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn for aggro, get two valorium rings, and two misquito leg earrings and a full suit of cultural gear and as far as tanking for vox/nagafen you'll be godly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">RZ or Tribunal is definitely a huge advantage (for Fierce Heraldric or Helanic Tundra armor)<br />
Put that in all armor slots.<br />
<br />
That leaves:<br />
Finger (2): Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Ear (2): Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
Neck: Black Plated Collar<br />
Face: Captain Nalot's Eyepatch (quest) or Grimling Contraption (tradeable)<br />
Back: Cloak of Flames<br />
Waist: Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
Shoulder: Draconic Pauldrons (quest) or Bonespur Mantle (tradeable)<br />
Range: Idol of the Wavecrasher<br />
<br />
note: the neck and range wont be quite full stats but still very good<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the BEST you can do.<br />
<br />
On a budget, get as much cultural as you can, then fill in with the above when you can afford. Until then, use: fingers-6ac 65hp rings, ears-35hp 25mana earrings, neck-clattering bone necklace, waist-putrid belt of rotten hide, range-runed bone fork, shoulder-elemental blanket(MAG summon).<br />
<br />
For your major purchase I suggest either:<br />
<br />
CoF + Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide<br />
or<br />
Cultural Cloak + Soulscream Belt (&lt;- cheaper)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should have posted this in the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well basically what the others said. If your not RZ reroll, and the upgrades they mentioned are the best non-quest/no drop you can get. Should give you a nice advantage over the other tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CherryCoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are the stats on the Val ring worth it at 52?<br />
<br />
I know its required 46 and recommended 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go for Helanic tundra bracers, boots, legs, belt.... helm?  Prolly every piece you can get,  it's all good stuff,  for the rest of your gear just fill in ... let's see ears? mosquito leg..... face? hmm,  amygdalan's chain mask = nice.  Horn spiked shoulder plates.... lemme actually just whipe up a magelo lol.  Typed all that out,  now I'm gonna leave it there to remind myself how stupid I am for not just making u up a magelo to begin with..... lol<br />

Technically This (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21390)  is more hp's, but I've never seen one for sale,  and if I ever do, it would prolly be like.... tons and tons of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My monk twink was getting more HPs from Valorium rings than from Velium Fire in the high 40's so the stats are worth it, unless ofcourse you cap stamina with buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">um, if this is your naggy vox only tank max your cold/fire resist then worry about oher stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CherryCoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you a ton for your responses. Its been very VERY helpful.<br />
<br />
I'm going to see what I can check out, what I can afford and what I can farm.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll check in if anyone cares. <br />
<br />
Your help has been most appreciated, unlike other boards where everyone has a stick up their butt! hehe<br />
