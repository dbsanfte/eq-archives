Is this going to mean if you use defensive or stonewall they are going to go after other targets?  Is this verants way of making knights more useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, there MIGHT be some fixes for mobs in walls, a bunch of fluff from the guild summit and one of my favourite quiet grind zones is about to get more crowded with people who were too stupid or lazy to find a wizard.  <br />

<br />
Cant wait to test that out. Been having some problems with mouselook panning too slow(it seems to ignore /mousespeed setting once right click button is held down, at least with my current mouse).</div></div><hr />

You know well there's going to be a group who goes without a porter that has melee's/hybrid's with em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Yeah, I don't remember anyone mentioning that... Okie dokie, I guess. Some of those are pretty nice fixes. Huzzah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As I think was being alluded to before, they made it so that everyone can now get into Hate without a wizard, but did they make it so that they can get back out?  I guess that it would be pretty easy to get a porter up there to get you out, but what a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">my guess is they're talking about furious/weaponshield type disciplines on the  ikkinz / tipt bosses.. which did make it trivial.. ranger+war and an enc pet could kill jhiru without taking 1 point of damage</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like the dirt on sk.org is that this is a nerf to defensive on these mobs by not allowing aggro while defensive is in use or making the mob do more dps if defensive is used.<br />
<br />
Not sure though I have seen no real confirmation</div></div><hr />

All English speaking EQ servers are coming down for a brief maintenance. Estimated time for maintenance completion is less that 1 hour. We apologize for any inconvenience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lordbracus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wonder how crowded Hate is going to be now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Good question about Hate. <br />
<br />
My guess is that this is designed to make it easier for people to complete Epic v 1.0.<br />
<br />
Except for those folks, I predict Hate won't be considerably more populated than it ever is. On Stromm it's so empty that you can hear Innoruk scratching himself all the way from the zone line. With the exception of epic items and the marsinger quests, the loot there is far surpassed by all the gear from later expansions.<br />
<br />
So, unless you need something specific, I doubt there will be that much more traffic there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">/em nods at Flair.<br />
I'm always a little surprised at the number of melee folks who do not routinely carry gate potions with them.<br />
I'll be interested to see how the changes work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/cheer SoE for fixing it</div></div><hr />
