<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greatdark</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK dark elf 55 warrior very well equipped maybe lacking in a couple of slots  im around 3500hp/1200ac just have 3 aa in regen.  My questions are these.<br />
<br />
1:  Should I just make it to level 65 before getting anymore AA or go straight for a certain number of AA at this level then get to 65?<br />
<br />
2:  Where do I need to go for some no drop gear, whats steps should I be taking now to get to this decent no drop gear?  I am flagged through the first part of PoD and flagged to gain entry to the factory in PoI.  I have not tryed any of GoD yet but am very curious to go.<br />
<br />
3:  As far as LDoN's are concerned What items should I be looking for I have about 250 points in each bbm and nro?  <br />
<br />
4:  At lower levels LDoN's were fun to gain exp and sometimes items.  I have noticed that the exp has really slowed down or moved to different LDoN camps.  Should I continue to try and get exp this way?<br />
<br />
Any help you folks could provide I would appreicate it.<br />
I play on the nameless server as Greatdark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things:<br />
1) Can you post a magelo? Folks are awesome here about providing some specific help if they have your set-up to work from.<br />
<br />
2) Have you read around in the threads for answers to your general questions (especially the one about levelling vs AA grinding)? Most of your questions are answered there. <br />
<br />
Not trying to be a jerk. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greatdark</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I dont think your being a jerk.  As far as the magelo I have to update it tonight( after work which is where I am now ).  I will read the AA vs. Leveling right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greatdark</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any recomendations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greatdark, your gear looks great for your level. Hell, you've got some slots that look great for MY level! LOL<br />
<br />
The only recommendation I'm tempted to make is that you should put a weapon in your offhand that has an inherent proc in it. If you're holding aggro fine with the augmented CHoS, though, feel free to blow this off for the time being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get another valorium ring.  Replace arms, bracelet of fortitude, and  gauntlets with FH pieces, ornate, or LDoN armor (EF, Tak, and some dropped pieces)  At some point you'll want to do the same with your helm and boots. Replace the blackened acrylia blade with an sotb, chsd, boc or gbos and anger aug it.  Alot of this depends on what kind of funds or raid force you'll have available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jakazzx</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your holding aggro fine for now, first thing u wanna do is sell that blood earring of rage and get another mosquito earring for half the price, then use the money you made to buy another valorium ring.  look for hp/ac items for your shoulder slot, i dunno what ur raiding or what kinda money you have.  your haste belt is good for now, and everything else looks fine for ur level, as far as ldons go, get two anger 3 augs, that should keep your work cut out for ya ; )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear looks pretty good.  Maybe check out an Architect Bejeweled Breastplate.  They totally make all velious armor farming obsolete.  On Xev the go for 5-10k.  I know recommended level is 60, so look at a link of one in the bazaar.  That purchase may prove to be the way to go if you free up a bit of cash as Jakazzx points out.  <br />
<br />
And gratz on 55.  Welcome to the beginning of real tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yethuy</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear looks great for your level and others have made some  good suggestions on gear <br />
<br />
 As far as leveling up or AA part of your question <br />
<br />
many people stop playing there warriors from levels 52 to 59 (there a demoralizing level for warriors) but at 60 you notice a great step and 61 is a good boost as well. <br />
 I would advise slamming your way to 60/61 asap and then setting your sights on tons of AA  max out ND CS and CA area taunt can be a life saver too either get all of those or most of them before heading to 65 I think you will be more happy with those then heading to 65 and grinding the other AA's and only get offensive AA's if you notice a lack of agro control or want to solo more (as much as we can solo) <br />
<br />
 I am 65 with 270aa and am very glad I stopped and got 90 aa at 61 PoV at 61 was great exp at the golems I started tanking golems at 59 but was a bit over my head and agro was touchy but at 61 with same weapons it wasnt a agro problem  <br />
<br />
as far as exp at 55 I dont have a clue in the world now for great exp hehe it seems so long ago  PoN and PoD at castle walls would be great exp I would assume and what ever zones the &quot;Hot Spots&quot; are but hot spots zones would be horrible with trains and such I would imagine<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. If you do sell the Blood earring, I'm not sure I'd use the money to replace the flesheaters with a valorium. If you need cash and decide to sell the earring, I'd carefully look at all your slots for replacement ideas.<br />
Switching blood earring for another mos. earring nets you 2 AC, 7STA, 15 Hps, and 7sv disease, but costs you 15 DEX, 15 STR, 15 AGI and 5 fire. Of the costs, only the DEX is potentially a bother; losing 15 DEX by itself isn't a big deal, but obviously as you work on maxxing your proc aggro you kinda want your upgrades to increase, rather than decrease, your DEX.<br />
Switching out the Flesheater's for another valorium at your level nets you 5 each on fire, magic and cold saves, and 60 hitpoints and uh, 37 END. It costs you 7 AC. You might find you can get a cheaper 60 hitpoints in another armor upgrade that would not cost you AC.</div></div><hr />
