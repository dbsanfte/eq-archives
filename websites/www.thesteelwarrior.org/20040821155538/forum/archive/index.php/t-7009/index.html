<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have an idea that would be neat if it was implimented, but doing so could be difficult. I dont know, im not a game developer nor do i know if it would be difficult or not?<br />
<br />
Its sort of like LDoN is, my idea is based on updating items/gear. Instead of adding augs though.<br />
<br />
Here it is.....<br />
<br />
Have specific &quot;slot&quot; quests that enable you to upgrade anything in a specific slot. There would be a NPC per slot, the NPC would have a list of quests that you could do depending on what you wanted to do with that item in that particular slot. <br />
<br />
For instance...<br />
<br />
Say you wanted to lower the delay on a weapon by 2, the NPC for weapons quests would hand you a quest and maybe even a container to combine all the ingredients in and the weapon to give you the weapon back just as it was but with a lowered delay by 2.<br />
<br />
Say you wanted that back item to have more saves, the NPC for back items would give you a quest to do that alowed you to increase the saves on that item. The amount of saves you wanted to add would be reflected on how difficult of a quest you chose. Maybe have &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;difficult&quot;, and &quot;hard&quot; settings on chosing the quests?<br />
<br />
Make all quest pieces nodrop, and once the quest is completed, make the final item nodrop as well (if it wasnt already). This would eleminate items being used by twinks or sold in the bazaar for outlandish prices.<br />
<br />
You kinda get what im trying to get at here? Im just trying to use my imagination a little bit and think of the &quot;posibilities&quot;. If you can think of anything to add, feel free  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It sounds good on paper, but then it could (potentially) trivialize the need to go out and hunt for a new piece of equipment, whether you need a single group or an entire raid force to get it. Why bother when you can do some questing to upgrade your current piece?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My idea would not make going out and needing to hunt upgrades trivialized. If i were to impliment something like this there would be maximum allowables that any piece could be upgraded. It wouldn't be my idea to make it so a rusty short sword could be turned into a bad ass weapon  :p</div></div><hr />
