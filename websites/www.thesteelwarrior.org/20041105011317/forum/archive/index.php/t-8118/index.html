<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks, <br />
<br />
I won an OSOW last night (yay me!) and moved an Anger2 augmentation I had onto it.   Normally when I get a new weapon, I slaughter some green cons to test it out.  :p <br />
<br />
So I ran to Unrest.  While fighting, I never dropped below 99% life. Yet I got a LOT of crippling blows, and nice ones too.  Why?  I had dropped my raid 30 minutes before, I was ungrouped, I had no buffs except Virtue.  I don't have any AAs that make Crippling blows happen.<br />
<br />
I've been playing my necro lately, so has something new happened?  Or did I see a bug that went my way? Or maybe it is a side effect of the OSOW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not sure if this is related but I've been getting the &quot;Berserker frenzy&quot; message while at full health and running through everfrost peaks on my way to Halas. I haven't tried to hit anything to get a crip though, just thought it was a bug giving me the message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got that message too, last night.<br />
<br />
Today, after having camped all the way out of EQ, I am not seeing anything usual.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it is a zone-level thing?  I did my first testing in Unrest and saw weirdness, did my 2nd testing today in GD and Velks and everything was normal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes i found the same in EF zone. HP drops to like 19 percent. Interesting thing is Cleric CHed me 3 times to get to me Full HP. So HP deducted is actually way more than the total HP and yet i was alive and running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chalk it up to the hard work of Sony's QA team!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caerberus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our whole group was bugged like that in Everfrost last night. We were all seeing each other as low HP when we in fact were 100% health. The server must have been seeing us the same way because I was shooting arrows at green mammoths and scoring Crip after Crip. Taking them down with 2 or 3 arrow shots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HP's have been bugged before.  My main is a Cleric, after one of the big patches for DX9 I had a terrible time healing my group.  They would show full hps in my window (default GUI) but would be taking damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had a similar issue pre-patch(es) as well here.  After an evac, one of the group members who was actually quite dead was stuck at 60% health for both me and the group cleric.  It was really quit strange and didn't rectify until after the cleric camped out.  As the Rogue I couldn't see the body, nor could I target it with the usual /tar Pname' that I typically use.  This was in a Takish HIgh-risk, so I don't know about the zone-specific possibilities but it was somewhat interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I to experienced this against the Shade Dragon trying to get my VP key. Landed a Crippling Blow for over 1000+ damage. Stopped and double checked to make sure I hadn't turned into a ranger with a bow. I had to take a screenshot b/c I am sure I won't even be able to do that again after they find the cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Noticed the same in EF...was on 99% health and went Berzerk...so ran around on 99% and kept crippling blowing Ice Giants for 700+ hp...tried to use fellstrike, but never got another crippling blow before it ran out :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Speaking of Everfrost, it turned me and a guildmate into Humans today, for no apparent reason. I'm a halfling and he's a wood elf. But both were (naked male) humans. Tried to use other illusions, but they just turned us into varying sizes of naked male humans. I wasn't lagging like crazy as I normally do in EF, though. Yay, I think?</div></div><hr />
