<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm finally starting to get satisfied with  my unbuffed hp of around 6.5k. I'm starting to  see how important getting my AC numbers up is in the most recent few expansions, and i'm focusing now on 1500ac+ unbuffed.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on farming up some OoW teir1 bits to help my hps/ac out but are there any easy to get/farm AC augs  out there? i have no AC augments at all.<br />
<br />
Also, this is a newbie question, but since i never finished my defensive AA's before leaving EQ, i've been planning on finishing them after hitting 70 (back to the grind, for joy :mad:  ). are any of the defensive aa's beneficial to my AC rating? or do they simply produce more raw avoidance/mitigation? suppose i could test it in magelo bleh too busy at work to do this right now.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appriciated, thanks in advance guys.</div></div><hr />

Gear wise, pretty much all your equipment could get at least some AC boost from 1 groupable or bazaar gear, but the standout item would have to be the djarn's amethyst ring, 80 hp or not you need to get a ring with some actual AC on it.  For droppable augments, the two 15 AC augs from ferubi and the 20 AC Girplan Eye from MPG off of Blindhunter are probably your best bets.  <br />
<br />
Also, AAs don't raise your actual AC number, just added mitigation/avoidance.</div></div><hr />

The other bits will be a real option for me, thanks a lot for the reply.</div></div><hr />
