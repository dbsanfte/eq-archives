<br />
Been back in EQ for about 3 months after over a year off.  When I left, my stuff was pretty good for my level (lvl 54) but alot has changed.  There's alot of new stuff out there, as I'm sure you all know, and I'm scrambling to keep up.  I just got done with 64 and am now an Overlord, however very little of my gear has been upgraded since I've been back.<br />
<br />
These forums suggested a SotBS and CHoS, which I now have.  I have also upgraded my rings and an earring, shoulders, back etc. but I'm still not happy with my tanking ability for my level.  Buffed, I barely break 6.5khp.<br />
<br />
Being guildless (still shopping for a good one) I'm more or less alone in the equipment area.  With OoW out now, there's tons of stuff I'd like to have but I'm not even sure I can make an effective tank out there.<br />
<br />
I'm currently holding at 65 to work on some AAs to bring my status up, but I was wondering if you guys had suggestions as to where I can group in order to aquire some decent drops to replace some of my gear or sell in order to purchase a replacement.  Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
My magelo is current and I'm always greatful for suggestions.  <br />

Upgradeable with<br />
- Fierce Heraldic 24AC, 50HP<br />

- Ornate 34AC, 60HP, 6STA<br />
<br />
Shoulders<br />
Yours: Slimed Ykeshan Troll Spaulders, 8AC, 0HP<br />
Upgradeable with<br />
- Crystallized Acid Pauldrons, 25AC, 50HP, 2STA<br />
- Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates, 31AC, 65HP<br />
<br />
<br />
I think these 3 are your weakest spots, you should upgrade them first.<br />
I listed only the most important stats on the suggested gear.<br />
Look at my magelo for more ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can obtain 10AC, 40HP, or 20HP/20Mana/20End augments for a number of slots in LDoN. In total you would add roughly 40AC and 200HP's.<br />
<br />
Working on your AA abilities would also add significantly to your HP pool and resiliance. I suggest trying to obtain CS3, CA3, ND3, PE, AT, PP5, PD3, LR5, ID5 and Sturdyness 5.<br />
<br />
There are two or three better back slot items in the bazaar that are modestly priced.<br />
<br />
In many slots, Magnetic armor while currently IMO overpriced is a good upgrade.<br />
<br />
Since you ask, &quot;where I can group in order to aquire some decent drops&quot;, I'll try to answer - Bastion of Thunder for Kizrak's armor, LDoN for AP earned augments and possibly a BP,  a few of the earlier GoD zones - Frodlin provides an overview in a few posts here, and eventually Wall of Slaughter in OoW.<br />

This man has some wonderful ideas, and I've got one more, which may in fact work out better for you depending on where you were when you got out.<br />
<br />
If you have Skyshrine faction (ally), start asking around in your bazaar channel.  There should be a fair number of people who still have some SS quest plate in their bank (Plate drops like rain, and gauntlets drop like they're going out of style or something).  <br />
<br />
Because they're very difficult to get rid of these days, you might be able to pick up a MQ pair of 27ac 90hp gauntlets for absolute, rock bottom, dirt cheap, I'm talking like 1k or less + 3 crushed topaz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get more than the first couple of levels of Sturdiness before working on 65+.<br />
Levels are almost always &gt;&gt; AA, so get the base defensive ones that give huge returns, then go for 65 or 70.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Since Haass has brought it up ..... what is best way to build Skyshrine Faction<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You just gotta kill giants.  There's nothing special about it unfortunately...you just spend A LOT of time in Kael.<br />
<br />
It sucks, but ToV is cheap, drops lots of plate, and is a helluva lotta fun with small numbers.  If you can scrounge 1 group, and are sitting at 4k-4500hp, there's a good chance a lot of it will be upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />
