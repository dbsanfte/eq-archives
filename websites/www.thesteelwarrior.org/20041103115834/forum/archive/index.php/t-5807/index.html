<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My magelo for Kiya is at left and in the sig.  What I'm most unhappy about is my unbuffed AC.  My guild does not raid beyond velious at this point in time.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, I'm not sure what items to shoot for to fix my AC, so suggestions would be very welcomed.  I'm not adverse to camping the items or farming plat for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unless you leave velious; umm, i think you're kinda status quo on AC until you get more AA's to max whatever AC you have now.<br />
<br />
Worse case scenario; buying ornate plate is teh answer. unless you got hundreds of thousands of plat i doubt the velious high end gear ( ToVN, helmet of rallos zek, etc ) would be in the affordability depending on how much ornate sells for on your server.<br />
<br />
your long term goal may be your best answer; keep saving the points for that LDoN plate and go from  there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also you can get the 10 ac aug from the BB ldon camp . it is a nice cheap aug for the overall ac increase .  it goes in neck , face, shoulder and waist slots .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tribute AC- 8 ac per tier, 5 tiers total.  I'd recommend just doing the first two tiers for 16ac for 3 points per 10mins because it starts to scale up poorly after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Loyalist Shield of Honor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21640) <br />
<br />
Worth the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As Hussar suggests, Loyalist Shield of Honor will give you a massive AC boost over a heiro cloak.<br />
<br />
Other slots, all of these are tradable so farming pp for them is an option.<br />
<br />
Face - Thulian Visage of Horror is 30AC 100hp droppable mask, from an event in CT.<br />
Rings - Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience if you can farm up the PP, although the cost is high for the level of benefit you will get.<br />
Bracer - Mana Threaded Bone Bracelet will give you a good AC boost. Drops in hard LDoN or you can buy it.<br />
Range - Anything with AC, an elemental bow is the ideal since you dont have to swap a lot but even a Goranga Idol would give you +13AC or so.<br />
Shoulder - Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates will net you about +20AC<br />
Head - Ideally a Helmet of Rallos Zek, but ornate would be a noticable improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are wearing primarily velious gear and raiding velious content so your AC shouldnt bother you too much.<br />
<br />
Back when Velious and SoL were the end game it was pretty well accepted that AC was capped and AC beyond 1300 was just for making your magelo look pretty.  You have 1188 at the moment, so you should be hitting close to 1300 with Bot9 / WoG / CotR.  Unless you are wanting to get your guild into raiding some PoP content - BoT towers and such, its not something that needs to be worried about too much at this stage.<br />
<br />
For some upgrade actual advice:<br />
<br />
Bracers - Full Mithril bracers would give you an AC upgrade at the trade of some stamina.  2 bracers would be +16AC -16sta.  Raw HPs would be the same with an improvement to saves.<br />
<br />
Range - you could take a group to Maidens Eye and try camping for a Transient Idol (15AC, 50hps, some stats)<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Crystallized Acid Pauldrons or Horn Spiked Shoulderpads are both a nice upgrade and both Bazaar buyable, but also both in the same price bracket as some ornate upgrades</div></div><hr />
