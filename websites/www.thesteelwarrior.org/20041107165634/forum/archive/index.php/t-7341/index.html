I never want to see it again. My first alt to 22 should get 23 for free since I have already done it twice on Hot Pepper!<br />

Ugh! Almost as bad as EQ was for me in Unrest at 14 15 14 15 14 15....16 15 16 15.....about 31 dings between 15 and 16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, sounds like someone has been dying a lot recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, well I have also been following the advice of the board....and had some really bad luck. (Like sometimes when pushing group limits past 5 interesting thigns happen... like 26th combat masters (bosses) in a 21 mission...that is up over the XP limit of the game. Or a CoT Boss exploding and hitting me for the first time in 10 levels for 420ish HP which would have left me at 49 had I been full. Or the group no realizing that me calling for help is a sky raider ambush, and my dying...and then them rezzing me, still not knowning what is going on, so I die again (no place I could run). <br />
<br />
Been a freaking horrorshow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, but has it been challenging?  *grin*</div></div><hr />

22 for me was like I had finally stepped out of the dark ages - single origin damage enhancers - oh my what a diff.<br />
<br />
BTW, I am sorry to hear about your misfortune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Upto gruop members of 5, I stand by my tanker/blaster assertion :-p.<br />
<br />
Not sure adding scrappers to a group should really count. Particularly ones who keep on exploring ahead and geting me (though more often themselves) dead.<br />
<br />
With 6+ I think it just becomes physically difficult for one person to maintain/control that agro. And at the time we had more than 6 the invul tanker did not have root stance. And we were fighting the previously mentioned combat masters.<br />
<br />
Fun game but I can't see more than 2-3 months in I, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point with the content existing I understand.<br />
<br />
We will see what the updates/expansions bring.  If they can have a hefty interesting update/expansion BEFORE August (WoW and EQ2 release dates) I would guess they will retain the happy to somewhat happy people in coh.<br />
<br />
I read the latest articles in PC Gamer on EQ2 and WoW.  All the stuff I don't like about EQ is still there.  Unless the coh expansions are totally lacking I aint going back to loot-centric crap combat anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I do 5-8 person indoors from time-to-time.  They require extreme planning and a good mix of AT's.  EVERY member of the group has to pull their weight or generally bad things happen.  I die more in them that any other encounter type - maybe that is a good thing too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, at one time I didn't mind the loot-centric concept too awfully much.  Yeah, there were degrees of gear, but the differences between a mediocre geared character and a uber geared character weren't huge.  Yes, the uber geared character could take a bit more damage, could deal a bit more damage, and was generally a bit more efficient.  But the mediocre geared character was still at least functional in 90% of the content they were ever likely to see.  While it was an advantage to be uber geared, it wasn't a huge draw back to not be.  But not anymore.  Each and every expansion SoE has made gear that is more uber than the last expansion.  While the mediocre geared character has basically stood still for at least 3 expansions.  There are huge chunks of content that even if the mediocre geared character managed to gain access to they wouldn't be able to function in  acceptably.  This is most particularly true for tanks.<br />
<br />
Now why does SoE seem to think it's okay to essentially dead end the gear availability of an entire segment of the player base while feeding another segment of the player base better and better gear each and every expansion?  And why do they think that the player base won't realize that this is happening?  And why do they think that the section of the player base unwilling or unable to be their raid slaves will be happy with paying for expansions where huge chunks of content are either unavailable to them because of flag restrictions or because of gear/AA requirements?<br />
<br />
It's completely unrealistic on their part.  Almost to the point of absurdity.  Yet there we are.  And I don't think SoE is going to realize the error of their ways until or unless the game collapses around their ears.  I really don't.  Remember how in PoP there was such a big deal made when they went through and removed a lot of the flag requirements for a large number of zones?  About how the uber geared whined and cried about how &quot;their&quot; zones would now be over run by the idiot lowbies and the undergeared who shouldn't be there?  It seems as though they felt that by their being willing to be SoE's raid slaves they were entitled to exclusive content that should not be shared.  It wasn't only that they should have gear that made them superior in all ways, but in addition that they'd earned the right to have exclusive access to a large chunk of the expansion, even though everyone, uber and mediocre alike, were charged the same price for it.  Yet SoE seems to have taken this concept to heart and designed the last 3 out of 5 expansions (assuming OoW follows the same path as GoD) specifically with the concept of continuing to overly reward the raid slave uber players while denying the mediocre players progress except at becoming their group slaves in LDoN.<br />
<br />
It isn't so much loot that has ruined EQ, it is specifically SoE's approach to loot and the willingness to overly reward raid slave ubers while under rewarding or effectively NOT rewarding the run of the mill player.  It's gotten to the point that if you aren't a raid slave, there's no point in playing because there's no path of progression that doesn't tie you to literally hundreds of missions in LDoN.</div></div><hr />
