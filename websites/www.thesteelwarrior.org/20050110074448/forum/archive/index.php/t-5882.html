I generally see a lot of content for Time guilds, but what encounters are tailored for VT and Elemental level guilds?<br />
<br />
Any non-Time guilds have much success raiding in GoD so far?  Any suggestions on what an early-Elemental, fully VT equipped guild could handle as raid targets in GoD?</div></div><hr />

There are a couple of events in Qinimi, but I can't really comment on those since I have not done them. I would image those are geared for VT+ people. Trials 1-6 can be done by VT level people, good loot and exp to be had there. Kod'Taz trials are too much for VT/early elem, but you can get there at least.<br />

How about if they are fully equiped with LDoN gear? Since when has an expansion, following another, not had the gear from the previous, allowed them to participate?Jackle nailed it. If you have FULL LDoN, then you should be able to progress up to Kod'Taz, but you won't be able to get through the trials there.</div></div><hr />

Pull him + 2 pets, kill pets then kill Zunmuraam. Pull him to the corner of the stage and put casters around the wall. Once adds dead kill him. He has EP quality loot<br />
<br />
Weaponsmith in Ferubi<br />
Hand in the 4 pieces from the Pxxt nameds, spawns ghost and named Weaponsmith and 4 or 6 adds, mezz half, Tank mezz and kill other ones then DPS smith.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both events doable by lower numbers of VT geared or early elemental. Good for a few hours of raids and seem to be up on my server a lot.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you know that Time gear &gt; LDoN gear. LDoN time raid content has some very nice stuff, but noone does the content really. If you are asking if LDoN will allow to advance through all of GoD, its possible but a very slow path to take. After all, LDoN is mainly 1 group content, and very easy content at that.</div></div><hr />

Well, it'd help to kill him to loot the Weapon Master I guess.<br />
<br />
The Weapon Master is extremely easy for what she could drop.</div></div><hr />

Is the information above still valid?  I am currently looking for mobs that range from ssra-sol ro.  It is quit a mess to find mobs up on my server these days with over 7 VT enabled guilds , and 12 in/approaching elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you're talking small numbers for both weaponmaster and zun`muraam in Ferubi, what are you looking at, roughly?  12?  24?  71?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on the gear and skill level of your guild. A Time+ guild would likely be able to do then with 3-4 groups, not sure though, every time we've done it we have about a million twinks getting flagged so its overkill. An elem guild would probably need a decent raid force, maybe 42ish. Keep in mind that those are the bosses of the zone, the other named can be done with a lot less (single group for high end).</div></div><hr />
