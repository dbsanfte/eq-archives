<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought the first level today by accident (was quite pissed).<br />
<br />
Later, i didnt think so poorly of my blunder as it seemed like the bastard went off left and right.  I actually am rather happy with it ... so here is my question:<br />
<br />
I'm starting to work on my offensive aa's atm and want to know a good path.<br />
<br />
I wanted to go CF3 then carry on to flurry (all the way to the end).  I know that would be a lot of aa's, but it would also knock off my Marshall title (which i've wanted to get for a while now).<br />
<br />
Tactial Mastery seems nice, so i was wondering if it would be worth training up to 3 before i start on my quest for flurry ( hell ... i just want to flurry shit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Logically, to me at least, Ferocity (any weapon), Ambidex (dual wield), and Pun Blade (2h weapons) might be considered getting first as they are intended to give you more/better swings (basically) with the weapons types listed in ( ).<br />
<br />
As TM lets you 'bypass' a mobs defenses, and thus land more hits, rotating thru these on your individual needs seems the best path.<br />
<br />
Flurry, i'm thinking, would be coming after these, or near the end. Of course, I haven't gone thru all these yet so i can't give that 20/20 hindsight vision.<br />
<br />
*cackle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Flurry definately rocks, but if you're gonna get it, finish it. I would recommend getting ambidex or punishing blade, depending on whether you use 1h or 2h primarily,  before you start working towards flurry, but I believe flurry is better than TM. Once you get it capped, flurry goes off quite often. Not &quot;reliably&quot; often, but definately often enough to notice a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only problem with TM is the spam.  Having level one myself, its starting to get nasty he he.  So far as offensive AAs, I've found ferocity to the one of the best AAs I've gotten.  Punishing Blade is really nice too, I can't wait to get PB3 (though saving the 12 AA for strudy3 sucks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I almost forgot, ferocity definately rocks too... either get it before or right after flurry. It will help flurry go off more often, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ferocity and TM are two of the best DPS/AA for your value that you can get.  I'd definately recommend it.  Its only 2, 3, 4 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get TM man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TM is the best value for offensive AA's.<br />
<br />
Ferocity, contrary to popular belief, is not that great.  It's the same dps increase as ambidex, which is a modest one at best.  If you're expecting a night and day difference from Ferocity, you're going to be dissapointed unless you're like a lot of other people around here and keep telling yourself that it kicks ass to the point that you believe it.<br />
<br />
Flurry is really low on the DPS list, it's a ridiculous amount of points for a very small DPS increase.  CF is pretty weak too, but has the added bonus of increasing your DPS without increasing your riposte damage, so it's definitely something to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">too expect a difference from any single AA, will get you disappoined. it's what they add up to, is where it makes you smile.. <br />
<br />
choose your path though, dual wield or 2h depending on your best weapons.<br />
TM is good for both<br />
Flurry is better for 2H<br />
some AA are pure one or the other</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I understand that the flurry line is one of the most inefficient DPS lines out there ... but like i said it kills 3 Birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
I want my marshall Title<br />
I want to increase my dps<br />
I just plain wanna go flurry-postal on some shit  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
It's a wishlist rather than an efficiency.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where i'm going with my weapons atm, so i dont want to bother with ambi or punising blade.  After crits on my ranger, the first offensive aa i worked at (other than bow aa's) was ferocity as it works with all.  I'm thinking that a BoWar may be inc my way soon (not sure).  If this is the case Flurry will be absolutely amazing ... but i'd probably put it on hold for punishing blade.<br />
<br />
So far i'm loving Tactical Mastery ... If the 2nd and 3rd levels are as good for increaseing the rate of fire as the first level was, though, then it will be one of the first offensive aa's i buy.  Who knows, it might also help me interrupt casters trying to gate?  /shrug<br />
<br />
Right now, though, i'm buying ingenuity 3 for my shakerpaging (what i was trying to buy yesterday when i goofed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe, if you want to &quot;go flurry-postal&quot;, then I think you're going to be disappointed by the rate of your flurries at CF3+RF3. :)  But it is the route I took to get my Marshall title too.  The most disappointing thing about flurries is that you don't generate FLURRY messages for other people to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The reason I personally suggest AAs that add attacks over AAs that add DPS without more attacks is that one adds aggro and DPS, the other doesn't. More swings via AA *may* also increase your proc rate to some extent. That is my own personal rationale for going ferocity first; more DPS and more aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah I see what you mean Fite.  I have Ferocity and PB as I use 2 handers mostly so those work for me.  TM has just been awesome too. I'll probably max WA (just need the last level), then maybe go for the last few levels of sturdiness or maybe start the flurry line.  I have most of my &quot;needed&quot; AAs at this point at least as I see it.  Ferocity and TM aren't really huge AA investments, I'd say get both, with the way you can get AAs these days they wouldn't take too long to max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you think TM1 and no flurry is spam...wait until TM3 and RF3...  you'll be half tempted to put 'other' into a spam window (which sucks, btw, because that's where NPC chat goes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">with just tm 2 i allready made a spam window.</div></div><hr />
