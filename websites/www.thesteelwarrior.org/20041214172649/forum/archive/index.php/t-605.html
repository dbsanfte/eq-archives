<br />
note: my spelling and gramar sucks and will be checked before its send, so no need to nitpick on that.<br />
<br />
just edited the message to add changes to the agressive, defensive and evasive disc's as well as changing the timer grouping for all the disciplines.<br />
<br />
Cartolis<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi guys and gals,<br />
 First let me say that I have played on and off for 2 years and my overall experience has been a good one.<br />
<br />
On to my specific reason for dropping you this line. On the topic of warriors there is much discussion in terms of balance. currently there are alot of players that see warriors as second rate tanks due to our inability to hold agro if someone else &quot;wants&quot; it. Now you may be wondering why I put wants in quotes. I did that because anyone with a mana bar can yank agro off a warrior almost at will. <br />
 <br />
 The reason that i see this as a design flaw and not a player interaction issue is that warriors have no way to counter it on a regular basis. with the current setup without blowing a disc, a proc going off or having the aa's for the area effect taunt(which is also on a timer).  As I am sure you already know there are alot of people out there that do not understand how to play their class in a way that allows for agro management.  This puts a warrior in a possition where we cannot do the job that our class was designed unless the people we are playing with are top notch. Sadly that is rarely the case as people have gotten spoiled by Pallys and Shadowknights nearly unshakable agro management spells. There are several changes that would allow the warriors to once again become the meatsheilds that we were ment to be.<br />
<br />
My first suggestion would be to add a second disciplne to the level 30 tier. this discipline should increase the hate generated by each swing. you could have it work like a stunless enraging blow proc that would add hate that scaled up as the warrior leveled.  for instance say the ability had a 15 min timer with a 14 min reuse clock and at level 30 increased hate by 10 for every swing and increase by 5 points per level to 65. that would put the discipline well under some of the uber eb weapons allowing them to remain popular while still allowing some of the more casual warriors that either dont have a guild or the time to raid the ability to play a warrior and still be effective. In addition to this please seperate this discipline from the normal disciplines so that you could use it and still have the ability to use the others as well.<br />
<br />
Another thing would be to change the disciplines evasive, aggressive and defensive to styles instead of disciplines. that would allow them to be used anytime. after all a warrior should be able to fight on the defensive or even aggressively more than every 18 minuits.<br />
<br />
<br />
 To my mind the role of a warrior is to take damage, keep the mob focused on one person and do some damage in the process. We are not suppose to be the damage dealers that monks or rangers arre, nor are we suppose to have spells like a paladin or shadownight. For the warrior it all comes down to skill and gear. The skill aspect is determined for you to a large extent by the game and aside from practcing the skills to get them up there is little else involved. <br />
<br />
Gear is a whole diffrent animal. The change I would like to see here is a series of quests that a warrior can do every 5-10 levels to get some medium quality armor and weapons. If implemented correctly these quests could be added for all the classes allowing all of the players of this game (specifically the more casual players) to feel a better sense of immersion. Make the armor better than random dropped stuff but less powerfull than boss mob loot doing the same for the weapons. My only other point would be to balance the quests so that they can be done with no more than 3 people. that way thoes of us that have a hard time getting a group can still do the quests.<br />
<br />
Thats about it for now. I hope that you will take My suggestions into concideration. Thank you for your time, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue I see here is that your suggestion, while interesting, does not go to the heart of the problem, which is that war aggro holding ability is completely RNG-dependent (taunt, proc), whereas pally/sk aggro holding ability is reliable and spell based. Adding another disc (with reuse time that makes it useless for half or more of all encounters much like AE taunt) is not going to put war aggro on par with the spell-based aggro pallies and SKs get. <br />
<br />
Let's look at it from the perspective of the group seeking tank in a tier 2 or better xps group. If your disc is now available, the group knows that you will be able to generate more hate for, say, 15 minutes then you did before, but does that mean you can grab the mob almost immediately when it makes a run for the chanter when their slow is resisted, like a pally can? Or are you suggesting that the war generate enough hate with the new disc that a chanter's tash/slow would not be rise to the level of making the mob hate them more? And once that disc goes down, we are as useless as we are now. Pallies and SKs, on the other hand, still consistently hold aggro throughout all encounters. Ergo, pallies/SKs still remain the far preferred tank - and for good reason.<br />
<br />
Another thing it does not address - the problem of war aggro can be mitigated by a group that holds off on aggro generating spells for a period to allow the war to build aggro. In the case of your disc, this practice would still need to be observed - only casters would not need to wait quite as long. But the basic issue is that with pallies/SKs, casters don't need to wait at all since hybrids can grab back aggro with reliable spells instead of praying to the almighty RNG, and this disc does nothing to change that dynamic.<br />
<br />
I applaud your efforts Cart, and am glad to see the effort to brainstorm, but in this case even if SOE implements your suggested disc, I just don't see how that will change anything in high end xp groups, which is where the problem is most evident.</div></div><hr />

jaxxym, <br />
While I agree that having it on a timer like the current ones would limit its usefullness, I might not have been clear on what I meant. the way I had described it the disc it would be active for 15 min a shot. the reuse timer would be only 14 min long allowing for the warrior to have it up when needed, and off when not needed.  on the topic of burst agro from trigger happy casters there really isint much they can do there. if they gave us the ability to hold agro no matter what it would trivialise so much of the content that actually requires planning. <br />
<br />
I agree that it would not fix the issue of people jumping the gun, but the only thing that will fix that is knowledge. all the gear and disciplines in the world wont make some idiot who cant keep from nukeing early better.<br />
<br />
I know that this wont fix it all, but I think that it would really help us keep agro alot better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. Alot<br />
<br />
I have been in groups where we had a nuker and a slower and noone but me ever got agro.<br />
<br />
same group make up 2 days later and both the casters died several times due to jumping the gun.<br />
<br />
we build agro by hitting and by taunting. If we are not given the time for that to happen then people wearing paper armor get turned into small greasy spots.<br />
<br />
my suggestion would help us to build more hate faster keeping this from happening.</div></div><hr />

I do not know how a good warrior does it, but I can always slow right away and get very little agro, while for some warrior I can wait till the mob is at 50 percent and get eaten alive.<br />
<br />
I have always perfered to grp with a good warrior over a hybrid class, they do a better job at keeping the grp alive then a hybrid, but for every good warrior there are many bad ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Friss I know of very few warriors over lvl 30 who &quot;do not kick and taunt, who expect to hit A and hold agro no matter what happens&quot;. If that is the case, I suggest immediate use of the disband button - but I suggest you first confirm that it is in fact the case, and not jump to conclusions. I think you may not understand the actual situation. <br />
<br />
I find it difficult to imagine that any warrior who has made it as far as tactics does not use the taunt button. There have been lots of times when I have hit taunt every time it pops in an attempt to peel the mob off of one of my casters, but to no avail - and of course I hear 'don't you know how to TAUNT!!' from the likely-now-dead caster.<br />
<br />
You may not realize this but taunt does NOT work every time it is used - it has to pass a randomized skill check - it is not unusual for a war with max taunt skill to fail 2, 3 even 4 times in a row. You may wish to create a warrior and play through a few levels so you have a better understanding of the capabilities and the limitations of the class?<br />
<br />
My point here is that the very best, most skilled, most well-equipped warrior - the one who throws everything at the aggro problem up to and including the kitchen sink - cannot compare with a dumbass e-bay pally for *consistent* aggro holding. EB is a proc - it goes off as decided by the RNG. Taunt succeeds as decided by the RNG. A pally stun spell is not RNG-dependent - it is reliable and spell based. Therein is the essential issue.<br />
<br />
All that said, there are differences between various warriors - some hold taunt better than others. Gear is a big part of that. Understanding and effectively utilizing the capabilities of the class is another part. If you get a lousy warrior in your group who does not utilize the tools s/he has for holding aggro, that is an easy problem to solve: boot 'em, make a note of the name, do not group with them again. But first be sure that you are not blaming that individual tank for the shortcomings imposed by the RNG.<br />
<br />
Those warriors you love who 'hold aggro' may have just gotten lucky - taunt succeeeded a lot that day. Those 'tell hell warriors' you don't love may have just been unlucky - their taunts were rejected by the almighty RNG.<br />
<br />
But your statement that &quot;The trouble is not holding taunt&quot; is exactly wrong - that is the essential problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt before, but I gotta call bullshit on this one, Friss. If you truly believe what you wrote above, you really do not understand the most fundamental thing about tanks. You have it exactly backwards. Please read my last post for a full explanation.<br />
<br />
There are thousands of posts on this board - by WARRIORS - bemoaning the fact that hybrids do a much better job of keeping casters in a group alive than we do thx to their superior aggro control. Since they were 'fixed', hybrids have NEAR-GUARANTEED aggro control - we war's are totally RNG dependent. That is the whole reason why warriors are broken.<br />
<br />
How did you ever manage to get to tactics without understanding this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its usually a 2 part job.<br />
When i see the 'A_mob_01 is slowed/yawns....' message from the spell (not the hotkeyed message the slower might or might not have) and hit my taunt hotkey, chances are rather good it wont look at a_slower_01 regardless what weapons i use(it is still the RNG though).<br />
The moment eb weapons proc i wont even need to hit taunt to make sure (sitting agro is a completely different matter though).<br />
What i cannot see is what kind of spell used when casted and i will not see resists (unless mob turns toward caster after resist, so its obvious).<br />
Problems only start when your debuffer/slower casts from halfway across the zone and the mob runs out of taunt range faster than you hit taunt or after you successfully get agro back after the slow, another caster lands a crit nuke (assumed its at the start of the fight).<br />
Chance is high you will loose one attempt to taunt then right at the start (you are too far away....) and have to wait 6 seconds for another attempt that might succeed or not and loose dps to generate agro while dots/nukes keep piling in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Cart:<br />
<br />
So the idea would be for the disc to be always available? Interesting - basically, you could be in hyper-aggro mode at all times, and the price you would pay would be that you would not be able to use any other disc while this was in play? At least, not for 14 minutes in your example. Well, I guess this is better than what I had thought before, but it still leaves the problem as you note, of burst aggro. As you stated:<br />
<br />
if they gave us the ability to hold agro no matter what it would trivialise so much of the content that actually requires planning.  <br />
<br />
But don't you see that this is exactly what pallies and SKs have and what makes them superior to us in terms of aggro holding? And I agree that it does trivialize it - and that is a bad thing. <br />
<br />
Put it this way:<br />
<br />
The question is not: 'how good is war aggro holding ability?'. If this were the question, your suggestion would be on target.<br />
<br />
The question really is: 'how good is war aggro holding ability compared to pally/SK aggro holding ability ?'<br />
<br />
So it is not an absolute question - it is a relative question. This is key.<br />
<br />
In other words, the problem with warriors not being able to hold aggro reliably is not that this is such a bad thing - it is that other classes can - so those others classes consistently get picked over war's in planar groups, leading to serious class imbalance.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way: if you were a caster looking for a tank for your group in a tier 2 or higher plane, and you knew that with a (newly disc'd) warrior you would have to use your tashes/slows/nukes/dots cautiously, and you knew that with a pally or SK, you could throw whatever you wanted whenever you wanted and suffer no death as a result - which would you pick? This is the basic problem, and even the implementation of the new disc would not address it, though it would help to alleviate it somewhat. I guess my view would be the suggested disc is a partial workaround, but not a solution.</div></div><hr />

 I know exactlywhat you mean. unfortuneatly there realls isint much in the way of game mechanics that can be done to prevent stupid people from doing this.<br />
<br />
a good slower knows that running only gets you tired and dead.<br />
thoes that dont either figure it out or bitch inssesantly about &quot;bad tanks&quot;<br />
<br />
the underlying cause of all this is the hybrid agro generation abilities. as jaxxym mentioned earlier we are wholy random number dependant, while pallys and sk's are not. this has lead to a crop of spoiled people that refuse to wait a few seconds before engaging.<br />
<br />
we currently cannot do our jobs as well as several other classes that are suppose to be &quot;half&quot; the tank we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could not agree more Cart/Gnomb...<br />
<br />
Here's a post I made in another thread that goes directly to this issue. There are negative aspects to it - of that I am well aware, but overall, does it make sense as a starting point, d'ya think?<br />
<br />
OK, no question that I'll be blacklisted by the knights and SKs for this suggestions, but it seems to me that to bring their aggro-holding ability in line with that of warriors, their aggro-generation simply needs to be made to be as dependent on the RNG as a warrior's is. Make a resisted stun non-aggro generating - make the terror spell line succeed only randomly (&quot;you're not terrorizing anyone&quot;), at a frequency comparable to a proc, something like that. Just make all tank aggro *primarily* RNG-dependent. I know these 'workarounds' are half-assed, but at least they would begin to address the issue. I would not even mind if pallies and SKs had somewhat better overall ability in this area than warriors - but I would like to see it as a range with some overlap - so that a highly skilled warrior who has put a significant amount of effort into learning this critical aspect of his/her trade would be able to hold aggro better than some e-bay pally who barely grasps the concept. <br />
<br />
I know this is a nerf, and I'm sorry SOE saw fit to do something so stupid as to give 2 classes near-guaranteed aggro control in the first place, but frankly in my view, the casters should *not* be free to slow, snare, dot, stun and nuke away to their hearts content in full confidence that there will be no consequences, and this is what that control permits. <br />
<br />
Because it seems to me that there *should* be a significant element of risk to casting aggro-generating spells like these that should cause their users to have to use them wisely - and would cause groups to look for casters who have proven they know their business. <br />
<br />
As it stands, tanks are near interchangable, as long as that tank is a pally or SK, and casters are too. This means that putting arduous effort into learning to play your class effectively brings little in the way of reward. What I am suggesting would make the whole damned thing more dependent on individual player competence and less dependent on the overpowering class abilities that let incompetent players off the hook.<br />
<br />
This would make the xping process a bit more challenging, but I don't see anything wrong with that. In fact, I prefer things to be challenging - it forces us tanks (and everybody else) to develop our abilities to the max, to devise and use every trick in the book to keep mobs off of our casters and I think that makes one a better player. <br />
<br />
Put it this way: when I put my LFG tag up and ooc, I want every group looking for a tank to race each other in getting a tell to me, not because I happen to play a certain class that they know can hold aggro no matter how lame the brain behind the keyboard, but because I've established a reputation for working my ass off to do whatever it takes to protect my casters and keep the group alive and xping. As it stands now, I can be the best goddamn warrior there ever was, and yet groups will choose some dumbass e-bay pally over me for high end xps groups based solely on the fact that all he needs to do is to throw a low level spell on the mob once in a while to keep them alive and raking in the xp. <br />
<br />
Flame away....</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is exactly the issue. the real problem here is that we have hybrids that can do our job better than we can in most cases, raid being the exception.(even there there are problems)<br />
<br />
with the proper testing and tweaking this disc could even it out, and with the changes aggressive, defensive and evasive that i mentioned (making them styles not disciplines so they could be activated at will, and stack with a currently active discipline) it might be enough to balance things out.<br />
<br />
there would still be a small period in which people would need to wait for agro building. the diffrence would be that instead of having to wait for 2 bubbles of life to be gone you could go sooner AND tanks would be less dependant on the random number generator for agro.  Basically instead of having to pray for a proc or taunt sticking every successful swing would generate an agro increase.<br />
<br />
this would all be dependant on them testing it against the hybrids agro generation abilities though and a bad miss streak would still cause problems. The point is that without taking anything away from the other classes(nerfs are bad) and without adding some sort of &quot;spell agro&quot; to us(which i think would be silly, I dont want mana)  we are at the mercy of the RNG, gear and far too many people that cant catch a clue.<br />
<br />
this would atleast close that gap a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm much to think about.<br />
<br />
A problem as I see it is if you tune UP warriors' taunt ability further or you give them combat-styles or change more than a teeny bit about our Disciplines you make a huge impact on raiding. Potentially a massively unbalancing impact.<br />
<br />
How, on the other hand, can you tune DOWN Paladin/SK aggro from their spells? Well one suggestion would be to massively reduce the aggro generated by low level stuns. I find that  to be the major problem, Paladins using low level stuns for aggro. Make it so that they are forced to use their high level stuns and chew through their mana fast. This would make taking a Paladin as MT for your exp group a fair trade off. Potentially better aggro management for increased downtime while he or she meditates. <br />
<br />
Shadowknights I'm not so sure about. I don't find them so difficult or overly aggroing to be honest. If an SK goes all out for aggro they really do run out of mana fast, and even if they do its not anywhere near as hard to taunt back off them as it is with a Paladin.<br />
<br />
The thought crossed my mind to make the aggro generation of resisted spells next to nil, again with respect to SK/Paladins using low level spells that are resisted to make themselves so hated for little mana. Anyway I decided that was a terrible idea. There's many many good warrior weapons who's procs can and often are resisted and we wouldn't want to remove the aggro they generate. Hehe that's particularly important to me. My Norge`Tal's stun component is resisted in almost every PoP zone but it still generates me a whole busload of hate.<br />
<br />
Another thing that occurred to me is that Enchanters get Spell Casting Subtlety. If an enchanter in my group is tashing and slowing and crippling it can be quite tricky to get the mob off them fast but that AA helps. I have just checked and all INT casters get this as an Arch AA. I think we warriors need to go out and encourage our casters to get it. In the same way as they expect us to have AE Taunt, we should have the right to expect them to get that! More importantly though, what other class regularly debuffs? Shaman. Now most shaman are tough buggers and can take a few hits but I think that shaman should get this AA too. The only issue with them of course is that their heal spells would be affected but they could have a modified AA that only affected detrimental spells.</div></div><hr />

Make WARRIOR melee damage generate more hate than it does for now and more than it does for any other class.  Well, this probably not viable cause they would have to replace too much code.<br />
<br />
Suggestion2<br />
<br />
Make a skill which increases hate and has a reuse delay equivalent to SK &amp; pally spells which generate hate.  But wait, that sounds like taunt.  So, how about increase the aggro warriors get from using the taunt button by 500 percent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Idealy that would be the way to fix it, Moglar. Problem there is that taunt is very dependant on the random number generator and does not always fire. it dosnet matter is the ting generates a million points of hate if it wont go off due to a bad string of checks from the RNG.<br />
<br />
as for replacing too much code, fixing this wont be easy. either way they do it there will be code tweaking and I for one would rather see them up uss instead of downing others. nerfs are evil and should only be a last resort. of course if they would test stuff longer they wouldnt be necessary...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...some interesting suggestions. <br />
<br />
As a general rule, and from a software engineering perspective, I think it likely that the developers want to avoid adding complexity to a system that is already massively complex and, in all likelihood, poorly understood in its current entirety. This is bad practice because, first, it results in a higher probability of instability due to unanticipated code interaction, and second, it makes the system as a whole much more difficult to test, which again leads to instability and other problems. After all, if the developers attempt to add highly nuanced skills/discs, then the law of unintended consequences comes into play, and we could see class imbalance occur in an entirely different area, such as Sarelin alluded to. <br />
<br />
From that standpoint, backing code out is a lot more attractive - which I think is why we see so many nerfs and so few really innovative (i.e. code-complex) additions. Easy to code a new high level heal spell that works the same as the others only heals more HPs - not so easy to introduce an entirely new mechanism for a new *type* of heal spell, for example.<br />
<br />
So if you are a developer who actually wanted to 'fix' the problem, I think it highly likely that you would choose the path that leads to less complexity - not more.<br />
<br />
Also, though nerfs suck for the classes that get nailed with them for sure, I would not agree that nerf = bad. I would say that class and game balance is what you want to strive for - nerfing is in general a less complex and problematic way to achieve this in a lot of cases, which is why we see so much of it. <br />
<br />
But hell, you could easily argue that by adding an overpowering, class imbalancing ability to pallies, you have implicitly nerfed the warriors without doing anything at all to the class. So now do you compound the problem by adding more complexity to offset the lousy idea you implemented that started the entire imbalance chain in the first place? <br />
<br />
To put it simplistically, if pallies used to score a '5' and war's a '10' on aggro, and you 'fixed' that by making the pallies score what you thought would be a '10' but turned out to be a '15' - now do you want to increase war's to '15', but in so doing risk boosting them to '20' at which point the pallies start screaming again? Or would you be better off backing ths pallies back down to the '10' where you intended them to be?<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Sarelin that tuning UP war's skills is very dangerous - it would mean we might benefit as much then as pallies do now - and the goal is not to make warriors rule &gt;&gt; all, but to even the playing field between us and the hybrids.<br />
<br />
I think also that Sarelin is on to something in regard to pally low level stuns - virtually mana-free (I'll get arguments on that one I know) aggro generation is a major part of the problem. That way, downtime is incurred whether you choose a war or a pally - IF you do not choose to practice aggro management as a caster (which is another hugely important thing to ancourage in my view), and this would have an impact on what class groups would be willing to go with for MT and on how soon and how often the casters chose to use their aggro generators. You would also be more selective in adding casters - instead of going with just any lvl 65 wizzy or chanter, you'd want one who played their class competently in the context of the game mechanics - this is nothing but good, in my view. Keeps the e-bayers at...well, at bay.<br />
<br />
The pally could still have a near guaranteed aggro holding ability, but there would be a significant and explicit cost associated with it for all to see. So the pallies would still have something of an edge in that sense, but war AC/HP advantage is itself a slight edge, along with AE taunt, and so would tend to offset to some degree and bring the classes into much closer balance.<br />
<br />
And from the coding perspective, tuning down the low level stun aggro should be a very simple way to go about things - you are simply changing the hate number they use when doing the calculation, I would imagine. <br />
<br />
In my view, this idea appears to resolve two of the major issues we are seeing - not just pallyaggro-beats-waraggro-handsdown, but also the follow on problem of enabling casters to indiscriminately cast whatever they want whenever they feel like it - it's a winner.</div></div><hr />

This idea of reducing agro from their LOW LEVEL spells is probably a needed change.  Anyway I have a good story here.<br />
<br />
I was grouping in BoT and I rarely have trouble keeping agro unless the mob is just slowed.  Anyway, I was grouped and we were doing upper sands when a group member had to leave.  So we got this SK to join the group.  On the first pull I do, she snares the mob and the mob paths away(the mob was not in camp yet).  So I go urm....  <br />
<br />
The next pull got better!  I had the mob in camp(unsnared at this point) and the sk starts to chain cast spells.  I figure, np, I can taunt after every cast and gank aggro back.  I did not mind till the rogue started to complain that he could not BS.  Hrm, well that pissed me off. =)  Anyway, We went through the same routine on the next mob until I was unsure of the ch landing in time, so I turned auto attack off and ... stopped taunting.  The sk and I were so high on aggro that she &quot;almost&quot; died.  Well she went purple before the ch landed.  Anyway, There is an issue with war/pal/sk aggros not being blanced.  It does need to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually I don't have any problems holding aggros in raid (with macro to call for assist), and little problems in XP groups. However, sometimes aggro got fubar I don't know why, on 2/10 pulls, where things happen in the same order. It's one of the aggro problems we have.<br />
<br />
In fact we only have 2 problems with aggro :<br />
<br />
1 - Randomness of taunt : Before AE Taunt, Before EB Procs (so it concern a lot of warriors), we do not have any way to get aggro with 100% result. Of course, sometimes taunt works very well, but you can NEVER be sure at 100% it will work when you press it. And when it's not, you can mash your keyboard, it will do nothing, you need to pray for a proc...<br />
Also, at a start of a XP group like fight, everyone aggro is very low... if the other people in the group act like they do with a pally tanking, no matter what you do (unless you got a early RANDOM proc) the mob will always turn on the slower / snarer.<br />
<br />
2 - The way Taunt works : It put you on top of aggro list with a small amount of aggro added (not always 1 point, it seems). This is a BIG issue : When you taunt the mob of the ranger, it turn on you, then it turn again imediatly on the ranger. Of course it does ! The ranger is optimised for DPS and we are optimised on random procs ! Sometimes everytime you taunt, the 2nd on the list out-taunt you no matter what you do, and have the mob turn on me every 6 seconds to not hit and continue hitting at the monk is very frustrating...<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the 2 issues that need to be corrected. for 1, give us a Reliable way to increase aggro.  I don't what, but we need something 100% reliable, where we may not have to say the cleric &quot;I will get aggro of you maybe &quot;. For 2, find a way to make the amount of taunt added on top of the list more important, or variable (with some formula based on the aggro generation of the 2nd and the 3rd on the list).</div></div><hr />

 I agree that changing the code is difficult and can be problematic.<br />
<br />
And if you and I were running this out of a garage then that would certinaly be a valid concern :P However sony has the resoruces to throw at a problem like this and make sure that it comes out the other side working like it should.<br />
<br />
the reason for not wanting to nerf other classes to fix this and any other problem is that it fosters an attitude with the people in charge that they can make changes willy-nilly with no thought to the result because they can roll it back later.<br />
<br />
that is irresponcible programming and just bad buisness policy.<br />
<br />
I do agree that not all nerfs are bad, and that one could call the changes to pallys and sk's a &quot;nerf&quot; to warriors but that is just semantics. In truth what they did was make a change that ended up being unbalancing to the warrior class because they either did not test it enough or they just didnt think it through.<br />
<br />
either way it needs to be changed and its not fair to gank a class or two because a coder at sony didnt do his homework.<br />
<br />
in any case as long as it is fixed I really dont care if they turn pallys and sk's in to 90 pound weaklings with rubber swords and paper for armor. I want warriors to work again.<br />
<br />
Note: I wish pallys and sk's no ill will and do think that nerfs are not needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
one more thing. dont know what it would take from a coding perspective but it would seem to me that the easiest way to change the stuns would be to make them level dependant. say a level 9 stun would only work(ie cast on) a certian level range of mob. that way there is no mucking with resist agro and fixes the &quot;no mana insta argo&quot; of the pallys. might work for sk's too, but Not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would do 2 things to fix the agro problem.<br />
<br />
1. Change the way stun spells work. Make it so that low level spells do not cause agro and result in an mmune message. If pallies are forced to use higher level, more mana costing stun spells, they at least they can't chain stun without running out of mana. Like it was mentioned before, the trade off would be great agro for increased downtime. The same can be done for SKs, increase the mana cost of keeping great agro so downtime becomes a concern.<br />
<br />
2. Increase the reliability of taunt and base it on mob level and taunt skill level. Something like this at max taunt skill -<br />
Green/Lt blue - 98% success<br />
Dk. blue - 90% success<br />
even con - 85% success<br />
Yellow - 80% success<br />
Red - 75% success<br />
<br />
This would make taunt MUCH more reliable while not making it 100% effective. Warriors would still be subject to the RNG, but not nearly as bad as the current abysmal taunt success rate.</div></div><hr />

That not a bad idea. not a bad idea at all :)<br />
only thing I would add to that is that taunt would need to add more than 1 point of agro. the reason that I suggested the disc that builds agro over time is to stop the pingpong effect we get with rangers and monks.<br />
<br />
against the high dps crown and the hybrids with the spell agro we often see a mob turn with taunt only to go right back. in thoes situations we are at the mercy of the other player to loose agro. rangers have jolt which is nice, but getting them to use it can be an issue. as an alternitave they could simply give every class but us jolt and call it a day :P<br />

<br />
but we need something 100% reliable <br />
<br />
Here, you and I disagree fundamentally. I believe that there should be a risk associated with casters using aggro generating spells. If there is no risk with casting an aggro heal, a tash, a slow, a snare, a nuke, a dot, then every xp encounter is trivialized, and the game becomes a bore instead of a challenge.<br />
<br />
The problem is not that war's do not have this ability, it is that pallies (especially) do. Adding the same type of ability to war's would make the game much less fun, reducing every encounter to a grind encounter. Oh, we could xp like mad, and the loot too would flow much more freely, but the intrinsic value of the xp and loot you gained thereby would be dramatically diminished - at least for me. In fact, that's why I no longer play PC games - after a short time of learning the mechanics, they are boring as hell for me.<br />
<br />
Cart - you state that:<br />
<br />
However sony has the resources to throw at a problem like this and make sure that it comes out the other side working like it should. <br />
<br />
My first job in the high tech world after getting out of college was as a software QA guy, and I have been a professional engineer working exclusively for software companies for almost a decade, and I can tell you unequivocally, from my professional experience, that the quote above is 100% misguided. I'm not disparaging you here - just earnestly telling you the actual truth as I have experienced it in RL. <br />
<br />
When you increase the complexity of code linearly, the complexity of testing it goes up exponentially. It is an insoluble problem to test to 100% virtually any piece of real SW on the market today. In this case, the SW we are talking about is stunningly complex, and, worse, as a client server application interacts across multiple networks over which SOE has zero control, and there just is absolutely no way to know with even a satisfactory level of confidence what impact introducing code changes will have, especially highly nuanced changes such as have been suggested here. There simply is no magic wand, as much as I wish there were. This is precisely why we see so many nerfs and so few innovative (complex) positive changes to EQ. <br />
<br />
And, BTW, in SW companies, the amount of resources available to the overall organization has virtually no impact on the amount of resources thrown at the testing process - in fact, the testers are generally the first to feel the bite of a layoff and the last to get new req's to fill when things look up. Why is this so? Because as a SW tester, the impact of doing your job 100% right is: nothing happens. SW runs as it should, etc. But when you fall down and the SW breaks you are the one everybody blames! Man, talk about no respect! And BTW, that is exactly why I moved into other areas and never again went near SW QA testing. ;-)<br />
<br />
And so, strangely, what you characterize as irresponsible programming is in fact precisely the opposite. Nerfing is a way to achieve class balance for all at the expense of a few with minimal impact on the stability of the game as a whole. Sorry about that, but that's the way the real world dictates things must be.<br />
<br />
one could call the changes to pallys and sk's a &quot;nerf&quot; to warriors but that is just semantics <br />
<br />
Actually, it's not - semantics by definition deals with the relationships between various symbols/signs (here, words), and typically is used to apply to a situation where the practical consequences do not change based on the changing semantics.<br />
<br />
What I am talking about is *precisely* the practical consequences of the change to pallies. And as warriors, we see and feel the very real impact of these practical consequences every day, as I am sure you agree.<br />
<br />
So in this case, at least in my view, the basic problem is NOT that war's have poor aggro holding ability - it is that war's aggro holding ability is poor in comparison to that of a knight. It's the differential between the two that is the problem. <br />
<br />
Which leads directly to the second problem: the problem with ANY class having 100% reliable aggro is what I described in the first part of this message - casters become interchangable - casting whatever spells they want to at whatever intervals they wish. Who cares if it's this 65 wizzy or that (e-bay) 65 wizzy? It doesn't matter! <br />
<br />
This too seems to me to be dreadfully boring. If I played a caster (in fact, I play a 60 shammy), I would be bored to tears sitting there mashing the same button again and again with no thought as to risk of doing so - no matter if that quadrupled my xp rate. All of the challenge is gone if your only challenge is to get a knight to MT instead of a war! But to have your xp penalized for choosing the war is something no caster - competent or not - is going to suffer gladly! <br />
<br />
I can only think of 3 ways to solve the problem, and each has impact as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Tune UP war abilities to match pallies and SKs (to a lesser extent as Sarelin pointed out)<br />
- impact: game becomes less challenging, less fun overall, easier to 'beat' - to get xp and loot, but more boring <br />
- SW dev piece: difficult to get right, more complex code to introduce/nuance skills/discs/etc<br />
<br />
2. Tune down pally/SK abilities to close the gap with warriors<br />
- impact: game is more challenging, more fun, harder to 'beat', but xp and loot gain is more difficult<br />
- SW dev piece: relatively straightforward, not adding/nuancing skills/discs at least<br />
<br />
3. Some combination of these<br />
- impact: game less challenging/fun but not as bad as #1 above, etc - shares both upside and downside of<br />
- SW dev piece: most complex of the three: complexity of #1 + complexity of #2 <br />
<br />
BTW, as you may have noted, this issue is much more than a class imbalance issue - it is an overall game balance issue, especially when considering the appropriate solution. In fact, it may be that the reason why the dev's have NOT yet addressed it is they would prefer one class to be out of balance than the whole game. But then, the game is already out of balance due to pally/SK aggro advantage (thanks to the dev's) if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">friss</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look if a grp is only pulling singles all night, and the slower wants to watch TV then sure a hybrid is better then a warrior. But if you are in a zone where you will be getting adds  like in tactics, then AOE taunt and def disc is the best way to give the ench the TIME he needs to mez the adds.<br />
<br />
Going into a new zone  I always perfer a warrior over a hybrid, because  my ench can handle any one  mob, but the warrior lets me handle 3 plus mobs thanks to aoe taunt and disc.  Sure it means, I have to be a little more careful slowing when we are pulling singles, but I rather pay that price then die to over pulls once in a while.<br />
<br />
I do not know why or how it is done, but for a good warrior I can start casting slow before the mob is in the camp, with a poor warrior I have to wait till he has agro, and weapons is not what makes a good or bad warrior the person behind the key board is.<br />
<br />
Sure no matter what weapons the warrior has if I get 3 or 4 resists to slow, I will take a beating.  But I can live with that if the warrior gives me the 30 sec I need to mez a small train, and no pal or sk can do that for me as well as a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it takes a ton of skill to press that taunt button when you lose aggro and of course it actually works for the &quot;skilled&quot; warriors.  This is a load of crap.  From the perspective of aggro control, &quot;good warriors&quot; are the ones that happen to have good aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that there's skill involved for mob positioning, pulling, /shielding people when taunt isn't working, aggro kiting when you're about to die and the healer is OOM, or anything else that actually requires any thought fine but aggro control is 100% dependent on gear and the random number generator.  There is absolutely zero skill involved unless you're a moron who's replaced his taunt button with /shout TRAIN TO ZONE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm...funny I've heard a lot of paladins say the same thing. You *do* mainly play a warrior not a pally, I assume?<br />
<br />
No matter - since the basic problem is one of the differential between war's and pallies as opposed to an absolute one, your fruity metaphor is not apt. <br />
<br />
Friss - both AE taunt and def /disc have 15 minute reuse times, and are normally reserved for emergencies, not as a consistent strategy for an xp group. I agree that having these avail for the occasional add party is useful. But another approach might be to have an SK FD pull to try to ensure singles in the first place. And a Pally's LoH and group heal is also useful in this situation (and aggro generating to boot). The question here is not one of - how best to handle occasional corner cases, but which tank class is preferred for a high end xps group? I am happy to hear that there is still at least one player out there who prefers warriors, believe me, I just don't want you to be under any illusions here - but then, that's your call.<br />
<br />
weapons is not what makes a good or bad warrior the person behind the key board is <br />
<br />
Well, I would say this is oversimplifying. The skill and knowledge and experience of the person behind the keyboard is absolutely key, in my view. But weapons are not to be so easily dismissed when it comes to aggro. It is in fact a combination. Look at the asymptotes:<br />
<br />
A highly skilled and experienced warrior with a fine steel weapon will not be able to come close to the aggro of an e-bay warrior with an EB weapon in most cases. As you move the data point for the weapon up for the 'good' war and down for the e-bayer, yes, these lines will converge and cross.<br />
<br />
But what I am saying to you is that your estimation of a 'good' war vs a 'bad' war might be more about the RNG than skill in some cases. Consider your example:<br />
<br />
for a good warrior I can start casting slow before the mob is in the camp, with a poor warrior I have to wait till he has agro <br />
<br />
1. You cast slow before mob gets to camp - resulting in YOU being number 1 on hate list<br />
2. Mob gets to camp, war engages<br />
3a. war hits taunt - taunt fails - mob goes for you - war is 'bad'<br />
3b. war hits taunt - taunt succeeds - mob sticks on war - war is 'good'<br />
<br />
Same war - same situation - only diff is the RNG went one way for one and another way for another. You must see that in the above scenario, no matter how good or experiences the war's are or are not, it doesn't matter at that opening second of melee - all that matters is the RNG. And that's the point I've been making which you still do not appear to grasp.<br />
<br />
Now, as the fight progresses, the more experienced war should be better at holding aggro - he watches the text box to see when aggro casts hit, he uses proximity aggro to his advantage, he doesn't mash the taunt button so that it's avail when needed, he has a shield hotkey hardcoded for you if things go bad, he even demands that the cleric NOT sit after a big aggro heal, shit like that. So hell yes, there is a diff between me and some clueless e-bay warrior. But in that first moment, when it counts the most, he is at the complete mercy of the RNG.<br />
<br />
As for the larger question of how this compares to hybrids, well I think this excerpt from a parody avail on these forums says it all...<br />

<br />
The problem, as I see Jaxxym points out, is the difference between warrior and knight agro.  I also think the problem is that 100 % agro on demand that knights have is bad for the game itself.  It is a game, and should require some skill(this is not a slam of knights, who do need to know what spells to cast, and when, but more of casters who cannot be bothered to learn to manage their agro)<br />
<br />
I cannot see increasing warrior agro to being close to knight agro as a good thing, it would take some of the remaining challenge out of exp groups.  Also, I take pride in doing everything I can to hold agro, and get it back as fast as possible when I loose it.  If warriors where made easier to play, I would loose part of my pride in being one.<br />
<br />
This leaves somehow nerfing knights as the other option.  I like the idea of making them be able to keep agro better than a warrior, but at a higher mana cost.  They should have better agro generation, or we go back to the days of knights not able to get groups.<br />
<br />
I know that Sk's and enchanters get spells that modify agro(voice line for SK's, haunting visage for enchanters).  This suggests to me that it is fairly easy to code that type of change.  Could SoE then simply modify knight agro, making them have to do more to generate that supperior agro controll?  I am not sure if that would work, but was just an idea I had reading all this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the current situation of near-cost-free near-guaranteed aggro holding by knights is a game imbalancing ability - the disadvantage to the warriors is just a reflection of this, as is the 'disadvantage' to the casters since it disables the demand for skilled game play on their part.</div></div><hr />

 I had this really nice well thought out responce ready and lost it :(<br />
<br />
anyway work is calling so i must be brief.<br />
<br />
i agree that there are potential problems with changing code and that after 5 expansions its probally help together with spit and bailing wire.<br />
<br />
that does not change the fact that its bad programing if you cant add features. Monumental task? maybe require alot of testing? absloutely. but to say that their in house qa cant do it is a non issue. there are plenty of players that would gladly test the change on test for free. hell we'd be paying to do it.<br />
<br />
thats what the test server is for, and In my case at least if sone told me heres the fix, but it wont go live till we get it tested, I'd be on the test server in a second.<br />
<br />
anyway Id rather they not change pallys or sk's to fix us cause their not broken. we simply need to be brought up to that levl of agro management and then have encounters that have become too easy tweaked.<br />
<br />
another point is tat its not often that you see a group with a pally, sk and warrior. genneraly people want &quot;damage dealers&quot; once they have a mt<br />

<br />
I disagree with not touching paladin/SK agro. I know you don't make warrior taunt better by nerfing knight taunt - that's why I said there are 2 things needed. There should never be a near 100% reliable way to hold taunt without either a enough long reuse so it is only used as a last ditch effort (AE taunt) or it should have enough cost associated with it so it can't be used constantly (increased mana cost).<br />
<br />
Knight agro in its current state it too good. I have parses of my wizard pulling down 230DPS over an extended period of time without so much as a mob looking at me funny when I had a knight tanking. Chain nuking at will - while a lot of fun and good for the exp bar - is not the way agro was intended. If warrior agro was increased based on level and taunt skill as I have suggested, and knight agro was downgraded slightly so it is only 90-95% effective due to mana cost then at least all 3 classes would be on equal ground when tanking for an exp group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what i ment was that aside from the stuns not taking enough mana they were fine.<br />
<br />
I agree that they need to adjust the ammount of mana that they use per stun, but that is another story. things like kei being readly avaliable make tweaking any mana usage issues difficult. reason being that the class is balanced right now the way it is afaik<br />
<br />
add kei and other mana regen buffs into the mix and several classes become too powerful.<br />

Right on about those scenarios... I am sick of knight classes having agro gaining abilities so far out-weighing warriors. <br />
Here's a thought.... give warriors the same spells, but limit them to the mana they have on their equipment only, and disable flowing thought for us... so we can't get C3-4-5 and be able to chain stun/agro... allows us to be able to get agro when needed, but forces us to be careful with it.... will NEVER happen, but it's a nice thought. <br />
<br />
     Think about it though.... you have maybe 1k mana on your items if you have decent high end gear.... (I think Furor has 1710, but he's a freak) and let's say pally_stun_spell_01 costs 100 mana.... that gives you 10 chances to pull agro off of over zelous casters, and slowers. Or better yet... if stuns would be too powerful, how about an EB spell that costs 75 mana... make us regen mana at a really slow pace, where even bard songs don't work, nor necro twitching, no flowing thought, just 2 mana a tick, and no mana from wis/int, just items. make the cast time 1.0-2.0 secs with a 15 sec recast time, and be done with it. War only spell, 700 hate, 75-100 mana... think about it.... might make for some interesting balance.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that it gives those warriors that don't have access to the EB procing weapons a chance to have EB and make themselves better tanks.<br />
<br />
I am sure I will see flames on this shortly after... so be gentle. :o)<br />

i discoverd most of my agro problems come from casters who stand way the hell up the hill, and those who /stand /cast /sit<br />
<br />
i hate bear form for this reason you cant tell if the shaman is siting after casting slow.<br />
<br />
when i have problems i face the group and watch the casters and yep 90% plop on their ass after casting even after you repetedly say off the dang hill dont sit after casting. heck yea you get agro after stacking the 4th dot. yes you get agro if you crit for 5k on the pull. if you root it and stand next to it you will get hit. stop running in circles i just wasted shield and 2 taunts because you keep going out of range and i cant hit it either. these dont run wtf are you snareing for. i just saw moonfire flas across my screen 3 times did you think the mob would say ohh nm keep doing that i like it. fd is not just for pulling. first you turn off attack then you hit the hide button. what do you mean your pet has to get in the fight it's a animation if you want a pet charm something. um yea sure casting devine light on me 3 imes is way better then 1 cheal. you feel the healing wave of prexus 4 times chain casted, and i didnt need a heal i'm sorry i will taunt more. hey you said you wanted the sk to tank i was just waiting for the assist call sorry you all died. hey i'm dieing here is the chanter awake /furious 1 repost alot of stuff mezed (grrr). hey look at the funny bard prancing around (bard lags goes splat from swarm) where the hell all this loading please wait. a mob is ensnared, a mob is ensnared, a mob is ensnared, a mob is ensnared, dude cant you taunt at all. a mob is a glowing tribute to stun particle effects pally says &quot;i thought you were mt gues i will have to be since you cant hold agro&quot;. me &quot;ok&quot; ( switches to weighted ax ). /ooc 59 war lfg can't mt don't know what taunt is and prefer to sit on my arse and med during the fight. i sould only have to hit taunt once but with you guys i just pushed a whole through my keyboard from hitting it so hard and often. now taking donation for a new kb.<br />
<br />
got off topic but ohh well.<br />
<br />
the leter is good, but knowing sony any action they would take would be to nerf knights rather then improve us. the penalty knight took for being ablre to cast spells originly was no dual weild and lower mitigation rangers took dual weild and accepted chain armors. now no dual wield is not a penalty and their mitigation was &quot;fixed&quot; in a class balancing patch. so know they are warriors with spells and wepon procs. i rember when if a pally sk over agroed it ment a near death experance.</div></div><hr />

Look at every caster : they KNOW when they fizzle, they know when it's resisted, they calculated how much this spell is resisted, they got facts. We don't have any.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, we proc and we hold aggro : random generator.<br />
Sometimes, taunt works fine : random factor.<br />
Sometimes, the damage we deal is enough to keep aggro : random factor.<br />
But sometimes, everything fails, and you cannot hold aggro no matter what you do. <br />
I don't speak about AE taunt, an AA, that not every warrior have, especially now that you must level to 65 if you want to find groups easilly... I speak about facts.<br />
<br />
At least a &quot;You try to taunt %t, but he doesn't seem affected&quot; when you fail could be great and help us react.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that when i have aggro and lose it, its *usually* easy to get back, its the beginning of the fight thats a bitch.  While parsing in PoTact/Torment/PoV/PoS i noticed most fights last around a minute, sometimes less, sometimes more.  <br />
<br />
This was mentioned on the old board and i really liked the idea<br />
<br />
What about a skill with a 30 second to 1 minute reuse time that gave burst aggro, meaning a set amount of aggro like 200-500.  It wouldn't be enough or often enough to trivialize aggro management, but enough to give us a head start at the beginning of the fight when we really need it.  And would be up often enough that it could be used every fight.  <br />
<br />
If you don't want to make it applicable to raids thats easy, make it only work on L67 and under mobs for a L65.  Meaning it will only work on mobs that con you yellow or less.  Most raid mobs are red unless your just clearing trash, and most xp groups don't take on red con mobs.  I would suggest this as a L60 ability, or less and make it get better as you level.  You could also make it only affect yellow con or lower mobs regardless of your level.<br />
<br />
In the long run i don't have issues keeping aggro, given time i usually beat anyone else out, its the beginning of the fight i feel warriors lack, and thats where i would like to see the focus of any changes.</div></div><hr />

This new taunt would, instead of just placing you at the top of the hate list, add more aggro (Not a HUGE number, but a decent number) and not put you at the top. Each taunt could override the other (ie like kick overrides bash) so you couldn't just keep mashing both - it'd take at least some good idea when to use it and when not to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with downgrading SK agro is we've got lines directly intended for agro.<br />
<br />
Voice line - Gives a % hate increase modifier (12% at 65).<br />
Terror line - unresistable raw hate (600 at 63) to the SK<br />
FD line - Lose agro instantly if success, but can't attack or cast while FD<br />
<br />
SKs are the masters of hate, both gaining it and losing it.  4 different lines of DoTs, including darkness, which gives hate easily.  <br />
A long time ago SKs used a spell called Disease Cloud.  It's a level 9 spell, very little mana (10 mana actually), and gave SKs &quot;snap agro&quot;...we could save pretty much any slower by casting it.  SKs didn't have any role at all until they realized they had good agro control (that was better than ANY other class at the time, I believe).  Then SOE changed how disease counters gave agro, and that made Disease Cloud lose it's effectiveness.  When SKs complained, they responded that &quot;we shouldn't have been using a level 9 spell to hold agro anyways.  We have higher level spells that have similar effectiveness, even if they use more mana&quot;.<br />
<br />
Biggest complaint you could hear after that was that pallies use low level stuns to do the same thing.  I really don't know if their stance on agro is the same as it was back then, but I agree with the idea that for incredibly good agro control, you need to have a downside.  For knights, it SHOULD be the amount of mana you spend to maintain it.<br />
<br />
Lets look at something else:<br />
<br />
Paladin stun.  The spell Stun (which is a level 5 spell for clerics) is a level 30 spell for Pallys.  It costs 35 mana and has a recast time of 12 seconds.  This means with KEI (14 mana/tick) you'd have regened almost ALL the mana used for the spell by the time it could be used again (a 64 pally with his self buff and KEI will regen completely by the time it could be used again...and it gets even better with PotG and Beastlord mana regen).  Where's the downside here?<br />
<br />
Only solution I can find here is to remove the agro generated by stuns to which &quot;mobs are immune&quot; (I've stated this before, I believe).  This forces Paladins to use their more mana expensive stuns (costing between 90 and 200mana, more or less), creating a natural downside to having a paladin that doesn't lower their effectiveness.  If a mob is immune to the stun a paladin is using, why would he care if he was using it?<br />
<br />
You can't do anything about group heals...that would require nerfing healing agro (while healers would like it, it would create problems).  These group heals suck mana tho, so there's downtime there in exchange.<br />
<br />
SKs....well, I play a SK, so anything I can say on balancing them against warriors is bound to be biased.  I know I expend a LOT of mana tho to hold agro and do dmg unless I'm using special weapons.  Personally, I actually prefer to let someone else tank, because it allows me to do a lot more dmg with DDs and DoTs and FD away the agro.<br />
<br />
Sorry, can't help as much on SKs...I'm naturally biased to leave them the way they are.  So I'm not gonna make arguments other than what I've said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an idea based on that burst agro.  Obviously warriors want a way to gain agro decently fast in comparison to knights.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of a skill that changes after you get higher than 200?  Bind Wound.<br />
<br />
Hear me out.  When you get bind wound over 200, you suddenly can bind up to 70%, right?  Why don't they do this with taunt?<br />
<br />
Once a taunter has raised taunt skill over 200, it gets better.<br />
<br />
1. Refresh goes from 6 seconds to 4 seconds or so. (This might be reserved for when warrior skill reaches higher than knight skill, actually)<br />
2. When taunt is pressed, in addition to having a chance to be raised to the top of the agro list, a second chance is added.  This second chance has a similar success rate as the first, but instead of moving you to the top of the agro list, it merely adds a certain amount of hate.  This can increase as the skill gets higher.  the two chances aren't connected, one can fail while the other succeeds, and both can fail or succeed.<br />
<br />
In addition to this change that would affect EVERY taunter that can get skill over 200 (would be a larger increase for warriors than knights), they should also add an AA that gives an additional chance for taunt to succeed (say, adding a third chance that would do the same as the first).<br />
<br />
Comments?<br />
<br />
*EDIT - Correction, these additions/adjustments to the taunt skill should definitely be warrior only.  Thought I'd put that in here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lotta fermentation of ideas here - I like to see it. As for specific suggestions, I would stipulate as follows:<br />
<br />
The problem as I see it is not that warrior aggro is broken. The problem is that knight aggro is broken in a way that unbalances the game, even as it 'advantages' groups MT'd by knights in terms of faster xp, etc. By this I mean that casters can chain nuke with no consequences, tashes/slows can be cast immediately, dots can be stacked with no risk, etc, etc. It is strictly a secondary impact of this that warriors are less desirable as MTs in tier 2+ xps groups. In other words, the broken warrior is a mere by product - not the central issue.<br />
<br />
This is a really crucial way to understand the big picture here, I think, because it means that any action taken that ONLY improves warrior aggro to close the gap with knights does not address the problem outlined above - in fact, it exacerbates it. If warriors are 'fixed' to be able to hold aggro anywhere near where knights can, then we would have 2 classes (3 counting the SKs) that unbalance the game - make it less challenging than it should be, etc.<br />
<br />
So I guess I am still stuck back where I was - the only way I can see to bring balance back to the higher end xp game - and have the side effect of making warriors once more attractive as MTs for tier 2+ xps groups is to somehow make knights less attractive. And I think you do that by either reducing their ability to hold aggro so well, or by making that ability so expensive that it incurs a downtime cost. <br />
<br />
Kaesorn's suggestion is right on target, I believe. Not bad for an SK. ;-)<br />
<br />
There are also other suggestions people have made here that I like, but many of these share a common and deadly fault: they are new skills or discs or whatever, and I swear to you I know what I am talking about here when it comes to SW companies - to introduce a new skill/disc (especially one that is as nuanced as this would need to be to avoid yet another unintended game imbalance) (and especially one that solves only the 'by product' warrior issue but does nothing to solve the current game imbalance issue) has about 1/100th the chance of getting approved by the system guys as a simpler modification, or a nerf that accomplishes the same end, even at the expense of an entire class. Great ideas are only ideas until someone implements them - and sometimes great ideas turn out to be not so great if the implementation is a nightmare. We can debate all we like about whether or not is SHOULD be that way, but that's the reality we're stuck with and wishing it were otherwise does nothing to solve the problem at hand.<br />
<br />
Kaesorn - as for SKs - I agree with Sarelin that SKs are much less of a problem than knights in the context of this issue. SKs fulfill a lot of other roles very well and so are attractive in a number of ways to a group, and while SKs remain superior to warriors in appeal as MTs to a lot of groups, they are not anywhere near as powerful as knights, specifically because the mana cost to them for that great aggro is so high - just as we are suggesting it should be made for pallies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agreed<br />
I think it should be warrior only as well, now that I think about it.<br />
<br />
After checking my SK and realizing that Knight taunt maxes at 220, and knowing that Warrior taunt maxes at 230 (right?), should this change only work 221+?  Or should we also ask to move knight taunt skill to max at 200?  ^_^<br />
<br />
I know this doesn't change the fact that taunt will still work on RNG...I really don't think warriors will gain anything spell-like, really.  But this gives multiple chances for taunt to actually do something, but still keep people from just mashing it (the hate doesn't work everytime).<br />
<br />
I myself think that with a change to taunt similar to this, unhooking the single timer for all disciplines (normal reuse time for that same disc, but 2-3min before a different disc can be used), and POSSIBLY turning defensive/evasive/aggressive/precision into toggles (styles/stances) with similar reuse constraints when turning it off, would give warriors (the disc one would affect all pure melee) a very nice boost without completely overpowering them.</div></div><hr />

(Wandor we DONT want warriors to have easy agro on higher lvl mobs)<br />
<br />
Green/Lt blue - 95% success<br />
Dk. blue - 85% success<br />
Even  - 75% success<br />
Yellow - Keep the Current Rate<br />
Red - Keep the Current RAte<br />
<br />
And add a &quot;Hate&quot; effect on taunt. A value random from 20 to 75 hate points.<br />
<br />
That way :<br />
* Taunt will work as a micro EB for all wars without EB<br />
* Taunt will not be successfull on high lvl mobs (no trivialising agro)<br />
* Taunt will work VERY well on xp mobs (where warriors hurt)<br />
*Taunt will be dangerous :<br />
Taunt now for 20-70 hate ? or Wait In case someone agroes ?<br />
<br />
Under its current form taunt is useless and situtational<br />
(only when you loose agro).<br />
<br />
I mean lets face it...<br />
If i insult a mob every 20 seconds (chain hit taunt) its gotta add up right ? Well it doesnt. <br />
1000 taunts after 1 hour on the same mob = 1 taunt.<br />
<br />
The Mini EB will correct that, AND keep the random factor of Taunt.</div></div><hr />

And the person behind the keyboard does matter, because when a warrior using epics is holding taunt better then a warrior with 2 EB, something is going on.

C - still have issue with pally guaranteed aggro/casters cast at will, additionally, now warriors begin to be part of the problem<br />
<br />
I would stipulate that anything requiring large amount of coding/testing would be a non-starter. Based on the guesstimates above, IIb appears to me to be the best bet. <br />
<br />
However, look at C - the game balance issue remains in every case, because none of these suggestions addresses the central problem, which is knight's near-guaranteed aggro control and the resulting ability of casters to cast at will.<br />
<br />
I honestly would be absolutely fine with warriors remaining just as we are if only SOE would find a way, like that suggested by Kaesorn and others, to remove this fundamentally game imbalancing abillity. Here is my suggestion:<br />
<br />
V. Modify knights so that low level stuns have zero effect on mobs over lvl 50 (or some lvl that works out to make sense) so that cost of pally's great aggro is substantial (mana for high level stuns) in terms of downtime - just like SKs.<br />
A - pally advantage mitigated dramatically, warriors perceived to be much more attractive, though still not equivalent<br />
B - very small amount of coding/testing involved<br />
C - basically resolves issue with pally guaranteed aggro/casters cast at will<br />
<br />
I think this last one makes the most sense, from an overall game perspective as well as from the SOE development team perspective and in fact from the warrior perspective</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have said before there should be a drop similar to the &quot;Orb of the sky&quot; in Vex Thal that has a hate imbue proc of somesort on it. This Orb imbues your weapon for 10 minutes with a ranger &quot;Call of sky&quot; proc (35 point dd)<br />
<br />
However, placing an item like that in the game will only result in the same warriors who now have EB having it while the majority of warriors may never see an EB weapon or that item if it dropped on Uber_Mob_X.<br />
<br />
So how about a quest that scaled up as you leveled. Say starting at lvl 30 you could do a quest for &quot;Orb of Aggression, 100 hate imbue proc for 4 minutes&quot; that item could then be turned in to start part 2 of the quest which cannot be accessed till lvl 40 making an &quot;Obr of Fury 200 hate imbue proc for 6 minutes&quot; then part 3 of the quest accessable at lvl 50 which results in &quot;Orb of Raging Fury, 300 hate imbue proc for 8 minutes&quot; part 5 at lvl 60 resulting in &quot;Orb of Furious Agression 500 hate 10 minute imbue proc&quot; and finally at 65 required level &quot;Orb of Rage&quot; imbue proc 700 hate, 12 minutes.<br />
<br />
Make this quest epic like or similar to Shawl/Ring quests but an item or items like this would address the concerns of every warrior from 30-65 as far as giving everyone an equal shot at holding agro better. Keep in mind it does not give you a for sure way to hold agro without fail but gives a leg up on it and provides a goal to work towards as you level.  Making a disc or something like that would cheese it up too much imo because it would just be there with no effort other than to level. Today its not hard to get lvl65 for anyone so making those who care to do their job well work for something is better. Obviously those with eb weapons would still generate more hate overall but to that warrior that wants to xp with his friends and will never join a raiding guild he can at least do his job in group which is to keep the npc hitting him. This quest shouldn't be all uber fight encounters but a mix of tradeskills/camping drops and a few boss fights for specific items only related to this quest so other classes would have no reason to farm these bosses.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I have an eb weapon and even before had little issue holding taunt because I make an effort to do so. Sometimes warriors that can't get agro can be blamed on RNG but many times that person is either not paying close attention or doesn't care. Most warriors I know when they are trying to hold agro can do so with little issue, despite Pal/Sks unless those hybrids are just outright trying to take your agro.</div></div><hr />

They use the real stuns anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but at the highest level of the game, warriors have BoWs or dual EB weapons and a ton of AAs to crank out DPS agro. I can basically cast at will when I group in PoF because I know that the tank is going to have solid agro regardless of what class they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of time has been focused on Pally stuns, but they have an even deadlier little trick in their arsenal - Flash of Light.  Level 9, like 12 mana to cast.  Yeah it can be dangerous to use, but if they are smart enough to stay next to the mob, it doesn't run.<br />
<br />
I was in PoV a few days ago in an xp group with a 65 pally friend.  We had no enchanter, so if we got adds, I off tanked (he was MT).  So a bunch of times, I'd tank a mob down to about 80-85% hit points, using a Greatstaff of Thunder.  The rest of the group would finish off their mob, the pally would walk up, begin casting, Mob_01 has been blinded by a flash of light...bye bye aggro.  I just knocked off a bunch of a mob's hit points, dropped a few stuns on it from the GoT, he walks up, smacks it once and then blinds it and gets aggro.  Once in 3+ hours did it require that he cast FoL twice to get aggro off me.  That just ain't right.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the answer is, I've heard a ton of suggestions, but hopefully something comes along.  Being ST in an xp group in favor of a higher level knight, I'm ok with that.  Being told by the pushy and impatient enchanter that the lower level SK has to tank because they don't want to wait to tash gets old fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinador</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly one other option:<br />
<br />
-Taunt (upon success) puts you at the top of the hate list, but also keeps you at the top for 4-6 seconds.<br />
<br />
-In addition, a message is diplayed after a successful taunt<br />
     <br />
     &quot;Kinador has landed a hit below the belt!&quot;<br />
<br />
This now signals slowers/nukers it's open season for a short period of time, but forces them to be awake enough to pay attention to the fight, and time their casting. This alone may not be the fix, but combined with a slight change in the aggro generation, or mana cost of stun may result in the needed balance. It's still RNG based, but makes taunt a little more effective. This would be a trait of taunt skills over say 220.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I agree our aggro issues need some tuning, I am concerned with what we bring to a raid when we are not MT'ing. I seriously cannot stand when people say &quot;warriors are just to get hit and shouldnt do any dps&quot;, fuck off. I have a sword and I want to kick some ass. There is no reason that a warrior, someone trained in the arts of battle, should not just be able to take hits, but also should be a punishing force of offense. <br />
<br />
We have NO OTHER SKILLS aside from autoattack, kick, and shield. It would be perfectly balanced to allow warriors an increased dps, which is why I agree with the 'fighting style' ideas. We dont have a plethora of spells, we cant pretend to die, or heal ourselves, or snare, or stand way out of range of combat and do uber dps, or run around a zone without aggroing anything, or escape, or any other utility aside from doing damage, or taking damage.<br />
<br />
Monks are offensive and by giving up defensive capabilities, they gain a variety of useful skills.<br />
<br />
Rogues skew in power for offensive power along with nifty abilities, especially once they kick in some AA's.<br />
<br />
Warriors SHOULD be adept at both defensive and offensive situations due to our tradeoff of having NO other utility or skills or spells.<br />
<br />
Of course, I also think ALL melee classes still need to be tuned in relation to our caster friends at the high level of play.<br />
<br />
So all that, plus an aa warboar to ride.</div></div><hr />
