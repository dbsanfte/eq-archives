<br />
Just wondering if it or my trusty old war marshalls (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19054) would be best when off tanking?<br />

'Twere me, I'd keep the special freebie and sell the droppable for upgrades.  From here, without parses, I can't see much of a diff damage wise.<br />
<br />
If this script (http://groening.educationvictim.com/weapon_eff.html)  is accurate,  they're pretty much identical.</div></div><hr />

Just curious if I should even bother. I use a Bloodsworn and CHoS right now and Sword of the Crypt Creeper and Truncheon of Doom for my 2Handers right now. I already have a Cloak of Flames so haste is good for now.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm according to that script the weapon efficiency of the warrior 2h epic (2.78) is better than CHoS + SotBS (2.73).<br />
<br />
With the 175dd + 500 hate proc would that be better to use? I'm all confused now :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a CHoS (Anger II) and SotB, then after so much time I got my epics thanks to all my friends :D<br />
<br />
For the type of family guild we are all in, I dont see myself upgrading it anytime soon, so I augmented it with Anger II and it works great on LDoN advs, both procs fire enough to keep agro just fine and the epic proc doesnt get resisted a lot, maybe a few times, but it does land pretty much always. For raids and such, I still use the CHoS +  Red epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level 48 is was hitting for about a max of regular hits for 280 and crit wise highest so far is 452.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Three questions:<br />
Although it has good damage, does anyone have suggestion for augments? Second, does anyone know what the haste percent is when it procs? Third, it has mana on it as one of its stats, do zerkers (or warriors for that matter) use mana for something?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
 - If you want to use it for MT'ing i'd suggest either Anger or Ykesha aug, if it gona be for when your DPS/Add Tank then I'd say DD or Tap aug<br />
<br />
<br />
 Second, does anyone know what the haste percent is when it procs? <br />
<br />
- 31% lasting for 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Third, it has mana on it as one of its stats, do zerkers (or warriors for that matter) use mana for something?<br />
<br />
- *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's actually 50% haste because it overwrites celerity. If you look it up on lucy you'll see that it works its way up to 50% by level 49.<br />
<br />
At level 65 with max str and fellstrike I do some massive damage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Biggest problem with this weapon is actually the Haste proc.  It overwrites any normal haste buff.  Unless you are hasteless or using Vallons, I'd suggest packing it up.  Wish they would switch it to Bard Haste instead, expecially considering the short duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It won't overwrite SLW or WR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alacrity must be just low enough for the proc to overwrite.  I would assume anything over 50% haste will not be overwritten.</div></div><hr />

<br />
36% according to lucys new owner.  Heres the link...Im thinking there is a bug in what it overwrites.  Because Allakhazams uses the games raw data to figure out haste percentage.  Liars can figure but...figures never lie.  The raw data isnt gonna lie to Alla's.<br />
<br />
EXE AXE Link on Allas. (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27215) <br />
<br />
Axe now has a reco lvl of 55 on it now as well. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemhistory.html?id=68261)<br />
<br />
BTW...Not calling anyone a liar...thats just how the old saying goes.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, sounds like a bug to me, too.<br />
<br />
BTW - I was critting for 671 and normal hits for 476 yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lauthar</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for the love of god, I spent a while getting my exe axe and i have it for 20 mins and they go and put a stupid rec level on it, which means that for my 48 war its gonna be too slow for the dmg stat to be worth while till he gets into the 50's<br />
<br />
I AM UPSET</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well considering my guild is hitting upper Ssra bosses and Tier 2 bosses and I have yet to see as good a weapon for Warriors drop in 4 years of playing mine I was pretty disappointed that the best 2-hander I've seen to date was available to level 1 twinks, I'm not in the least.  Never should have gone out without a level req on it.  At least you have it, because believe me, you won't see it's equal anytime soon and it will not be dropping much longer.<br />
<br />
Besides, with the XP today you can hit 60 in a couple weeks, even with minimal play time (assuming you can find a group, that is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugnok</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even at 48 its still gonna be a 55+/50 weapon.  Just think if you were 27 hehe.  Then it would only be a 31/50 that procs haste...wait...thats still not bad for that level.</div></div><hr />
