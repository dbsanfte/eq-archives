I mean, it is great that you can do Burrower with 2 groups, but do you NEED to do it?  Gee, thanks for killing AoW to twink yet another alt while other guilds who need his drops for their mains are denied yet again.<br />
<br />
If you are Elemental capable, stay there, and let the rest of us enjoy the content that you have previously monopolized.  If you can't help being greedy, go farm elemental tradeskill components or ornate molds in SRT.<br />
<br />
Please, is it that hard to have some compassion and respect for others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being in an elemental guild that sometimes does luclin and the occasional AoW, we do not do it to keep other guilds down, we do it because of the simple fact that as people drop out of the game, you need to recruit.  What is a better way to get some decent gear for your recruits than some easy to tip mobs?  I guess you could look at it as greed from your standpont however it is a vialble and easy way to gear up recruits so they can handle the elementals better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decaillin</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Dinekus said, most guilds do it to equip recruits/new members/members that dont play much. In most guilds, recruits have no chance of getting top-rank equipment over members, so they go back to older content to get them geared up. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, it is just out of pure boredom. Believe it or not, there isnt always something up in the elementals to raid, especially if you are on a server with many elemental guilds, so if a Luclin/Velious mob is spotted up, it gets killed.<br />
<br />
Another reason is just for fun, and memories. For example, a guild might clear NToV with 2 groups, or do Dain with 1 group and laugh about how hard it used to be for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/nod All the reasons a guild will go back and do old content are perfectly reasonable.  Which is why I don't have much heartburn with LDoN restricting raid content to 36 players or less.  This way, given that the encounters will supposedly be instanced, smaller guilds who can't really get the older content because it is routinely being whacked by the uber guilds fairly frequently will have a shot at some new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is just shy of EPs, and 2-3 of our warriors don't have EB at all. We kill AoW, XTC and Cursed every chance we get for the shot at getting hate proc weapons. &lt;shrugs&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no EB weapon drops in elementals, and some drops off AoW will last through or at least well into them.<br />
Monk legs, ring and mask off AoW will last a long time.<br />
With the drop rate of EB weapons we have seen a now in PoTime guild whack cursed less than 4 weeks ago.<br />
It is highly unlikely guilds will kill mobs with 3+ groups for twinks alone.<br />
With AoW i know some guilds have just killed him to stock up dot/coffin fund by selling the droppable loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but mine does AoW soley to keep the lower guilds at bay! Oh yeah, there's also the fact that we need BoC's for the warriors without eb weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're just missing RZ before we get into the elemental planes.  We don't do Ssra anymore.  AoW is not a priority.  Nothing in PoP drops EB weapons until you kill RZ.  <br />
<br />
Last night we had 2 warriors on with no EB weapons and AoW was still up after we cleared VT.  So we went and smacked down AoW and got one of our warriors a BoC.  Another warrior got a helm upgrade.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple really.  If you don't put superior loot on content in newer expansions then people are going to go hit the stuff in previous expansions and get the low hanging fruit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, let’s see. For most boss mob encounters in the planes it takes a full raid force. Once the night has ended and the majority logs off due to time zones, this guild should stop everything they are doing because they have access to the Elemental Planes? Most older content does not take a full Elemental raid force to kill, hence why some go out after hours and take down mobs with late night crews. <br />
<br />
If an EP guild would want to keep other guilds down, I don't think they would go back to Luclin or Velious to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real culprit is SOE here by making such things as EB yet making them available off of 4 mobs in EQ, and rare from most of them at that.    <br />
<br />
We are an elemental guild, we SHOULD be past the content.    Currently we have killed RZ many times, without a BoW dropping.   We have a grand total of *one* warrior who dual wields EB, the rest have a BoC and some other gimp ass marginal aggro weapon, we have one who has NO EB.    We have  a spotter at Statue site, and when the opportunity arises, will kill AoW to get the last warrior a BoC.   If cursed is up, then we'll kill him, if XTC is up, we'll kill him.    If RZ is up, we'll kill him if we have the #'s.   <br />
<br />
The real problem is that there's not enough damn EB weapons to go around.   Do we WANT to kill those mobs?  Hell no we don't, we'd MUCH rather leave them up for people who will benefit from most of the drops that will rot.    There SHOULD be more of a selection of suitable replacements throughout PoP, so that guilds aren't forced to go back to mobs they DONT want to kill, that isn't even a challenge,  just to collect the gimp solution known as EB.</div></div><hr />
