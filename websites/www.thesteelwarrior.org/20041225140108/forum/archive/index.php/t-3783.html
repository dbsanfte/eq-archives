<br />
I've gone down the defensive route, and have:<br />
<br />
ND3, CA3, CS3, PE.<br />
<br />
PP5, PD3<br />
<br />
ID5, LR5<br />
<br />
I'll get AEtaunt next.<br />
<br />
What's the most bang for my buck in terms of paths through the offensive AAs?<br />
<br />
I thought there'd be a sticky here to give the most often suggested path or something, apologies if I missed it, and thanks for the advice :)<br />

Im about to finish ID5,I have all my HP/STA AAs,and every other defensive AA + RS3 + AETaunt<br />

Im sitting at 101 Total AAs (100 Spent ,ID4 Currently,working on ID5)<br />
Next Im going to go ahead and finish my offensive AAs that are listed under class for the Marshall tag.After that, Im going for Tactical Mastery (must have, avoiding ripostes is both offensive AND defensive),and as a Half Elf,going for Stalwart Endurence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm often (99% of the time) the MT on events, and have found that stuns are never a problem, other than the magical kind (leather BoT boss etc.)<br />
<br />
Also, with Tactical Mastery, I could see the reason it would be considered a defensive AA too.<br />
<br />
E.g. I'm tanking a mob, I don't have TM3, and I get 20 ripostes during that fight.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
I'm tanking a mob with TM3, and I get 10 ripostes during that fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Surely over time, that means I take less damage, hence adding to my defensive capabilities?<br />
<br />
<br />
Going to avoid STA aa for now.  I'm at 274 at the moment unbuffed, and have clicky ornate legs for when I'm duoing with a cleric, but raid buffed, I'm always at 305sta.  To be honest, I want to lower my STA (but keep the same HP) so that I get more of a benefit from raid buffs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tubthumpa, definitely get AE taunt next; it's one of our best aa's and I would rate it higher than getting max defensive first..<br />
<br />
The reason TM isnt considerred a defensive AA is because parses seem to indicate that it does not negate riposte by the mobs; i.e. with TM while you can strike a mob on a swing by you that would otherwise be only riposted by the mob, the mob's riposte still lands on you.  In otherwords, your swing may land through a mob's riposte, but the mobs ripose still lands on you.<br />
<br />
It's still a good offensive aa though; it helps nicely with establishing initial agro that might otherwise be avoided by the mob's defenses.  Btw, TM does nothing to help avoid being stunned; you want stalwart endurance for that.  Whether an ogre need's s.e. depends on if he's getting shape changing illusions like NDT, or using a woodelf crown or guise of the deceivers etc for shrink/corner tanking I suppose, but I&quot;m not positive whether you lose your innate frontal stun immunity in those illusions as an ogre since I'm a barbarian.<br />
<br />
The top offensive aa's so far to me were ferocity, tm, and flurry; if you use 2h you might want to get pb3 before getting flurry due to flurry's high point cost, if you dual wield you may want to get ambidexterity first for the same reason.  While fury of the ages3 is fun, Raging flurry 3 is definitely better to get first dps and agro wise imho.  Since I primarily dual wield, I'm waiting on PB3 till after I finish planar power.. I'm a bit disappointed in PB tbh a feeling shared by someone else in another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id like to see those parses.Im getting information from two sides then heh heh<br />
Still good though obviously if you look at the amount of times a mobs avoidence skills causes you to miss as opposed to the simple &quot;you miss&quot; messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krugg</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My offensive AA plan so far is;<br />
<br />
Ferocity<br />
CF<br />
Flurry<br />
Raging Flurry <br />
FoA<br />
<br />
Hopefully by that time, I'll have scored a decent 2 hander so I won't feel like I'm wasting points on PB since I have to use my 1 handers right now.  Otherwise, I'll probably take Ambidexterity after all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mongoz</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if this will help at all but here goes. I currently have around 250aa's.<br />
<br />
After Defensive I'd consider the following:<br />
<br />
AE Taunt - Every tank must have.<br />
<br />
If you use 2hs, PB is a must have as well as Flurry + Raging Flurry<br />
(With PoWaters 75dmg weap that looks like BoW I can average 150-200dps with those aa's)<br />
<br />
To tell you the truth I didn't notice any difference with the Combat Fury and FoA so I'd wait on those.<br />
<br />
Ferocity is a must have for either 1hs or 2hs as it helps with double attacks and the more successfull double attact you have the more your flurries will happen.<br />
<br />
Ambidext- If you use 1hs over 2hs this is a must have as it increased mt dps 10%.<br />
<br />
I personally noticed a huge difference with Tactical Mastery. As someone posted above it is good for offence and defence. The offence is you can bypass mobs ripostes, blocks etc.. and do more dmg. You can attack through enrages but I don't recommend it that much as you do not bypass every single swing. The defence part is you avoid ripostes from mobs and take less dmg. Let's face it swinging a BoC and Great Blade of Storms you swing ALOT when hasted hence have more chances of Riposte's.<br />
:edit Just noticed the post stating that the riposte's still land. Even thou it's been parced I noticed a huge difference when taking dmg from mobs in normal grind groups in PoV as well as BoT and higher PoP zones. I believe I got TM3 bbefore ID's or LR's and went from 2 ch's per mob to 1 ch per mob.<br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance is a great AA to get as well if your in the top 3 of your MT ranks. If not it's not that important to get before the above mentioned aa's. Although it helps alot with BoT grinds or grinds where mobs stunn alot.<br />
<br />
Ingenuity is just a fun aa to get if you have proc weaps other than EB proc. It's fun watching my GBoS proc for 358 crit spell and watch the noobies go wtf wars can crit spell proc?!? Yes there are still some. It's also fun as I have augmentations on both weaps(yes I got bored) on the BoC I have 50hp lifetap that crits for 100hp heals, and on the GBoS I have 50 fire dd 100crit which enables up to 4 procs off my 2 weaps. I can usually hold complete aggro off the 3 wars in the guild that use Blade of Wars.<br />
<br />
I guess the main question is what weapons are your preference 1hs or 2hs, then choose from the descriptions above for your next aa choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After doing the defensive set you outlined I'd get Stalwart Endurance...the amount of being stuns avoided has 2 nice factors<br />
<br />
1. You will be swinging instead of stunned<br />
2. Your agro control will be better (instead of being stunned you will be in control)<br />
<br />
Not strictly a defensive AA but more of a &quot;staying in control&quot; AA.  I have level 1 and even at that low a lvl I still have found the usefulness amazing. <br />
<br />
What's the most bang for my buck in terms of paths through the offensive AAs? <br />
<br />
Specifically I'd say Ferocity is.  Its an AA that does not scale in cost as you progress (i.e. it costs 3 pts for each lvl).  Punishing Blade while nice scales 2, 4, 6 as does Flurry.  I'd think that you would see offensive output increase sooner per pt spent with Ferocity (nope no parses to back this...I just pointing out you'd have Ferocity 3 for the period in which you are still compiling the other 3 AA for PB etc).  The fact that Ferocity also applies globally to weapons (as does Flurry but not PB) is also another ++.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how I did the offensive aas.<br />
<br />
TM3 -&gt; Fero3 -&gt; PB3 -&gt; Crits3 -&gt; Flurry -&gt; Next I guess ambidex or maybe flurry6<br />
<br />
I think that the biggest bang for the buck aa's are definately TM / Fero and if you use 2h PB.  Crits is pretty weak really I think for 12 aa points in crits I upped my crit percentage like 2-3%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a tank (fighting PoP mobs), i think the best value offensive AA progression would be:  tacticalmastery, ferocity, PB-or-Ambidex, stalwartendurance, combatfury, flurry, ragingflurry, furyofages, doubleriposte, flashofsteel.<br />
<br />
The value of ingenuity scales with the size of your proc.  I did it before double riposte myself.<br />
<br />
Tactical mastery seems to be offensive only, although I agree it would be nice if it did reduce riposte damage (and it should imho).<br />
<br />
Stalwart endurance is an offensive ability most of the time, not defensive.  The only time it could be considered a defensive ability is when you are being chased by mobs.</div></div><hr />

Shrug... if you have never needed AE Taunt, you need to share your enchanter with the rest of us :)  <br />
<br />
You really should reconsider and get Ferocity before FoTa.. the only reason to get combat fury is to unlock flurry... fota should be one of the last aa's you get imho.</div></div><hr />

 If you don't get AET as soon as you can you are doing yourself and your guild/groupmates a disservice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE Taunt is excellent AA.  Get it before you buy anything else if you didn't get it yet.  Its real nice for saving overenthusiastic slowers in experience groups.  Also, if you get a multiple pull and your healer has to heal you, everything you haven't hit yet goes straight for the healer after the first heal.  AE Taunt saves healers a lot.  AE Taunt is also unresistable on most mobs, it almost never fails unless someone has low health agro and in that case just wave goodbye or pray your cleric is on the ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felwin</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;otherwise your next move should be ferocity if you use 1hers, punishing blade if you use 2h.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ferocity is good period, 1h or 2h.  And like others have said, you don't think you need AE Taunt because you don't have it.</div></div><hr />

99 AAs and no AETaunt? I think that must be a new record for stubborness. :)<br />
<br />
AETaunt is without a doubt one of the best AAs you can get as a warrior. It's not just an opinion!</div></div><hr />

I must say the 12 AAs I payed for CF3 were the biggest waste ever.However the 9 I put into Flurry2 so far have been quite worth it.<br />
So basically you wind up paying 30 AAs for Flurry 3,then however many beyond that.Its nice but ties up a lot of freaking AAs.Possibly some PoP advancements that may be a better path at the beginning I dont know.My AA progression is clearly shown on Magelo for any who like to study others.Currently wrapping up Planar Power and then going on to SE and TM</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being an Ogre , i can tell you that i keep stun immunity even with an illusion on me (even the badest , the gnomish one :p ).<br />
<br />
Tubthumpa, as others said i suggest you get aeTaunt before anything else , really the best AA we have i think.<br />
After that , i suggest Fero before Flurrys just cause Flurry cost a lot before being good , but if you gain AAs fast , should not be a pb :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Depending on my gear upgrades during this process, I'll be getting Planar Power to accomidate - I don't max 280 sta with my current gear and don't really want to &quot;waste&quot; points in Innate Stamina that may be maxed later on)<br />
<br />
Ferocity 3<br />
Stalwart Endurance 3<br />
Tactical Mastery 3<br />
Hastened Instigation 3<br />
Combat Fury 3<br />
Flurry 3<br />
Raging Flurry 3<br />
(Punishing Blade 3 or Ambidexterity if I have any defining weapons at this point)<br />
Double Riposite 3<br />
Flash of Steel 3<br />
Fury of the Ages 3<br />
Ingenuity 3<br />
<br />
Of course I'm sure all my plans are for naught when the expansion comes out with all those sweet sweet AA's...  Wow, we're getting +100 HP with 5 levels = 500 HP?  I heard rumors it's going to cost an insane amount heh...  Anyways...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since this dead thread has been revived(and it was a good thread), and since since it was going I have gotten almost all of the Flurry aa's done(2 1/2 points timm RF 3), I just want to add that I cannot agreee with the above statement more.  Flurry just keeps going and going and it seems like it will never end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got it as soon as I could and I never regretted the decision.  I don't use it every night (generally only to save a wipe), but for those times when I need it, it usually saves the day.  Even when I'm in a guild group or on a guild raid and I know I can count on the people to exercise good agro control, things still happen occasionally and it's good to be able to play the &quot;avoid wipe&quot; card.  <br />
<br />
On raids it's especially nice if I'm SA and the MA goes down...one click and I have agro (and hopefully some healers :p )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have TM2, and will plow enrage in LDON on named healers if I want to ensure the mob drops.  Each swing i hit with gets a reposte still, but it still lands.<br />
<br />
Its purely offensive, unless a weapon swing that is dodged, parried, or reposted doesnt cause agro (and there is no reason to think that they wouldnt, since a missed swing gives agro).</div></div><hr />

One AA I cannot live without is Stalwart Endurance3! It works 90%, if not more, of the time! I get irritated when I play a twink and get stunned, now that I got so use to not getting it! :D</div></div><hr />
