<br />
Last Night I came upon a BoW(2years later but still $$).<br />
 <br />
Question is, which Should I use..<br />
BoW(125 Ykesha) or<br />
EoE(125Ykesha) and GBoS(100Ykesha)<br />
<br />
Before you ask why Ykesha, its because A3 and Ykesha are pretty much equal, and I prefer The extra 5dps, lol. I have anger augs unlocked though.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be nice~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answer? EoE and 1.5!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say BoW over the EoE/GBoS would probably perform better than those, but thats just from using a muramite bladebreaker (smaller BoW, see magelo) and being able to hold aggro on anything I've tanked with it, except for a few times when there was someone determined to take it from me.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm a big pure hate fan, so that always gets a plus for having the innate proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a bard draws aggro from you meleeing. You are doing something wrong  :(  <br />
<br />
EoE / Gbos i would use over a BoW imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye BoWar should be less dps, less stats, and less aggro ... not to mention w/ the EoE you are 1 weapon away from a killer combo ... albeit a JoS, a DBoWL, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More than bards used those weapons with me and i saw the same results hehe.The BOW was the best aggro I saw through Time excepting only the DBOTW.EOE and BF maindhand combos worked well too.I preferred the BOW tho.I MT'd with it from tactics thru Time. <br />
<br />
I had lots of time to watch aggro with all differant combos beside me /shrug.EOE ,epic, bf  etc whatever.Most of those combos can work well and have differant advantages.I found the BOW to be as good or better raid tank aggro as any of them.I ended up as gl/rl when we broke into time and after our first Quarm kill have been stepping back a bit and rotating tanks as a matter of practice.I watch aggro every raid on all our tanks and BOWs still do well.As well as anything we have short of DBOTW.<br />
<br />
Like I said tho measurng that kinda aggro quality differance is hard to do and gets silly.I can say that if I was already wielding an EOE mainhand I prolly woulda passed on a BOW(don't know your circumstance tho..not a judgement)and waited for a DBOTW,FB etc.I do know I've seen both combos work and the BOW is very competitive.The next step up imo is DBOTW,FB,BBB etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only problem with that is, my guild no longer does Time, or Ikkinz for that matter, and we arn't in Tacvi.. Pretty much only 2 Weapons i can get to mainhand over EoE is Demerix or CBS, and neither of those are coming to me any time soon.<br />
<br />
EoE is a superior weapon. Picking up a BoW was a bad idea ... you should have let another warrior get it.<br />
<br />
Actually, it was an open raid lol. I joined for shits and giggles, and got lucky. A lot of people said they were happy I got it and not some level 65 in bazaar gear.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I a3 it, and it is working for me, havn't even switched back to EoE or GBoS.. Also, i parse more DPS with BoWar, Have equal amount of agro, and 30ac&gt;90hp lol.</div></div><hr />

Congratz on looting something you don't need ... i'm glad there are unselfish people like you in the world.  At best it was a lateral side-ways equivalent choice of weaponry ... in all actuality it was a downgrade and will most likely be something that rots in your bag within a few weeks.  Next time just do your fellow man a favor and think of others as well ... though arguably a *possible* lateral upgrade for you ... it was someone else's wet dream.<br />
<br />
Bling bling!<br />
<br />
*edit- removed the picture ... bit over the top and altogether not warranted.</div></div><hr />

Then when a Darkblade drops you're all set.</div></div><hr />
