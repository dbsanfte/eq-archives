<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently upgraded from Ornate Helm to Helm of Rallos Zek, but I'm so used to not having a helm graphic, that having one now seems so odd.  I vaguely remember hearing about some NPC you could talk to who would make helms (any maybe other armor) not have graphics.  Anyone have info on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There was a dwarf on the big boat in GoD during beta that talked about doing that.  Sorry I don't know if he's still there, but I haven't heard of anyone making an invisible helmet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The gnome in Abysmal Sea will un-customize any helm from Velious you have customized. From the text he says I don't think it will take the graphic away from helms that are not customizable in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh..  Kk, thanks!  I guess I'm just back to the horn-spiked helmet look then =)</div></div><hr />

I want my graphic back.  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would love to make my Helmet of RZ invisible.  Half elves are meant to show off thier pony tails.  The only helm graphics i like are the wood elf and dark elf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GAG!  I went from champion crown to myrmidon crown purely to dump the graphic!!  Female wood elf plate helm makes me think the artist got their inspiration from a WWI German army hat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Before I got my Raex's I had the Helmet of Shadow from VT- which had a graphic. However, if you have an illusion at your disposal (Amulet of Necropotence for instance- though any illusion will work), you can work around the graphics.<br />
<br />
1) Take helm off.<br />
2) Click illusion.<br />
3) Put helm on.<br />
4) Click off illusion.<br />
5) Observe the fact that your helm graphic has disappeared and rejoice.<br />
<br />
Note: you need to do this each time you zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank god I've spent most of my time in game with graphicless hats and/or headbands.<br />
<br />
I don't really mind the helmet look on my warrior though. Halflings on Luclin models get ok little helmets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Reamer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless its changed Sofar the gnome was only able to take the graphic off helets from Gates, But in the text said he was  working on previous Era helms I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I recently got a Helmet of Rallos Zek as a hand me down from my guild.  I look like I have wings on top of my head.  Damn me for being a hooman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I miss the old school barbarian plate helm graphic, the one with the horns that were easily a yard wide.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, those barb helms were great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As an ogre I hate my HoRZ... but as a Wood Elf I love it.  Ah well, I usually a wood elf anyway.<br />
<br />
I think what you may have heard of was about velius helms being customized perhaps?  Unfortunately that doesn't work with all helms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">personally i wish there was an NPC who could put the customized Helm grahpics on any helm u gave them =p &lt;3 Barb RZ helm (yellow spiked helm)</div></div><hr />
