I recently was going to sell 1.4 million for 900 dollars RL cash...the guy put the money in the paypal account, and I handed him the pp. Only problem is, a few days later the money was gone out of the account and they said I had been the recipient of fraudulent funds. Ive sold the rest of my pp, but this really sucks balls. 1.4 million plat is a TON of plat, and now everytime I see an item that I like I can't afford it and it sucks major. (only have about 50k now...) I want to still play, but it just sucks knowing that now I'll have to play hundreds of hours and raid for uber gear. Buying it is fun because its instant, but now I cant do that anymore, plus with OoW the economy is so fucked up I cant make it back again and I don't feel like wasting the time doing so...anyone have any thoughts on what they would do if they were in my situation?</div></div><hr />

Seriously, I would never sell shit from online to a person.<br />
If I did however, I would do it with someone *someone* i already knew, and they would have to send me the money first.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line:<br />
Don't sell, it's them and SoE out for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriously; i'd sit back and realise that buying/selling krap in a game for RL funds is silly...and probabally think really hard if the game has you hook, line, and sinker.<br />
than i'd just log off for a week and check out that big ball of fire in the sky.</div></div><hr />
