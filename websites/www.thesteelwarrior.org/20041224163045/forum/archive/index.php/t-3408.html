Best I can come up with is, go forth before the MoB and eat the rampage so that the casters don't bite it.  My guild is an up and coming guild, just starting to think about MoB's like Vindi and such who rampage.  I know how to do it, but mostly from trial and error and getting yelled at by the uber guild peeps I was with at the time.  I never had anybody actually tell me how to do it, and that's kind of a limiting factor when I'm trying to teach the other tanks in my guild how to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when I was not MT but ST of my guild, I played the role of rampage tank only once, with Vindi.<br />
We did like this, MT pulled Vindi after clearing all the giants up to him, we pulled him down the ramps of arena to corner him, I was down there and right when I saw him comming, and poked him with an arrow, voila, now Im the rampage tank :)<br />
MT was tanking him while I was whacking Vindi's back till assist was called, remember always to assign a healer to the rampage tank outside CH chain.... or your rampage tank might die *whistle* hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showMessage?topicID=1013.topic&amp;index=25<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Rampage only hits ONE person. You will see a lot of folks claiming a Rampaging mob can attack more than one player at a time. They are dead wrong. All rampage that exists today in Luclin and all previous expansions attacks only ONE player, period. This is the second most common misconception about rampage.<br />
<br />
2. Rampage IS a proc. Rampage procs off of the normal attacks made by the mob you are fighting. If that mob isn't hitting anyone, you won't see any rampage messages. Also, because Rampage is a proc, DEX debuffs and other spells that decrease proc rate can indeed lower the rampage rate. Slows also reduce rampage rate because they reduce the rate of the normal attacks that proc rampage in the first place.<br />
<br />
3. Rampage NEVER hits the person who is currenlty being attacked by the mob. Your main tank will never be taking rampage damage while he has aggro on the rampaging mob.<br />
<br />
4. Rampage is a SINGLE attack. The person who is being hit by rampage will be hit by one of the mob's normal hits. This attack can be blocked, dodged, parried, and riposted normally.<br />
<br />
5. Rampage DOES have a range, and that range IS different from the mob's normal melee range. This range differs from mob to mob. Some mobs can hit you with their rampage attacks literally no matter where you are in the zone; they have unlimited rampage range. Other mobs have rampage range that is barely larger than their normal attack range. Rampage range usually is larger than melee range.<br />
<br />
6. Rampage does NOT follow line of sight rules. For normal attacks, if the mob can't see you, it can't hit you. Rampage works differently, and it will hit you even if you are hiding behind objects. If you are in range, you will be hit.<br />
<br />
 7. Rampage DOES NOT key off the main hate list. This is the most common misconception about how Rampage works. Any mob that can rampage has TWO hate lists, not one. The mob itself keys off of the main hate list just as every other mob in the game always has. The second hate list is for Rampage, and it works VERY differently from the normal hate list. Understanding how this second hate list works is the key to managing rampaging mobs.<br />
<br />
Here are the rules for how the rampage hate list works. These rules determine where the rampage damage goes.<br />
<br />
1. The order of the rampage list is based upon the order in which players gain aggro. As soon as you attack the mob, heal someone who is being attacked by the mob, or do anything else that causes the mob to aggro, you will be placed in the next spot on the rampage list.<br />
<br />
2. NOTHING will get you off of the Rampage list except for Memwipe. Period. Feign death MAY get you off the rampage list IF you are lucky enough to score a memwipe when you feign, and we all know that's a crapshoot at best. Even death does NOT ALWAYS remove you from the rampage list; many rampaging mobs will start beating on someone who died to rampage the instant they are resurrected. Rumblecrush is notorious for this particular behaviour, so plan your battle rezzing with care and make sure you rez the dead outside rampage range.<br />
<br />
3. Nothing you do will move you up or down the rampage list. Taunt, evade, jolt, and other methods of controlling aggro such as chain snaring, stunning, hate giving and hate taking spells, as well as all weapons with hate generating procs all have NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER on your position in the rampage list. Chain healing and chain nuking also have absolutely no effect on positions in the rampage list, although they will get you to the top of the main hate list fairly fast.<br />
<br />
The list forms in the order the mob aggros people, and it stays in that form, never changing EXCEPT to remove those who have scored memwipes with Feign Death. You CAN clear the list by repeatedly casting memblur and memwipe on the mob you are fighting, BUT remember that this will also clear the main hate list and that can cause all kinds of problems.<br />
<br />
Now, things to remember...<br />
<br />
Remember, rampage DOES have a range. If you are taking rampage damange and move out of a mob's rampage range, it will start attacking the next person on the rampage list until you move back in range, then it will start beating on you again.<br />
<br />
The rampage list is SET IN STONE. This means if you know the order the mob aggroed people, you know exactly the order the rampage attacks will follow. This means you can control it.<br />
<br />
If you have Feign Death, and use it, you will NOT take any rampage damage while feigned. When you stand, you will immediately start taking rampage damage again UNLESS you scored a memwipe with Feign Death, in which case you are now at the very bottom of the rampage list. This is, of course, subject to the usual feign death bug... if the mob doesn't buy the feign for whatever reason, you will continue to take rampage damage while Feigned.<br />
<br />
Monks usually pull Rampage tank duty, especially if they have Combat Agility 3. The reason for this is that they will get hit by precious few of the rampage attacks due to their unmatched combat avoidance.<br />
The usual strategy...<br />
<br />
First, everyone needs to make a hotkey to the effect of &quot;TAKING RAMPAGE DAMAGE NOW&quot; and spam it the instant they start taking rampage damage. Healers need to be ON THE BALL and tracking that message so they can keep whoever it is alive. As long as the person taking rampage damage is alive, in rampage range, and doesn't Feign Death, you have locked rampage attacks down to that single person.<br />
<br />
When you engage a rampaging mob, have your main tank get aggro first. Immediately send in all of your Monks and have them attack ONCE only to make sure they get the mob's attention. Note, you MUST make sure your monks attack BEFORE the first heal lands on the tank, or else that healer is going to be the first to take rampage damage and die very quickly. With rooted mobs this is trivially easy to do... just have your main tank hit the mob with an arrow, and then each monk follows suit in exactly the order you want them to take rampage.<br />
<br />
Once that is done, engage normally. The monks will spam their enrage hotkeys as they take rampage damage. As long as you have healers keeping up with it, you've got it locked down.<br />
<br />
Yes, Clerics, this means you have two main tanks to keep alive. Cope. <br />

You can lose a MA in pop and swap to a SA or even TA pretty easy but you lose that rampage tank and odds are your clerics are going to be dead to rampage. if its not your cleircs going to lose 3/4 your raid before your rampage healers can target and actually heal before they die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4. Rampage is a SINGLE attack. The person who is being hit by rampage will be hit by one of the mob's normal hits. This attack can be blocked, dodged, parried, and riposted normally.<br />
I agree with all above, except that you can't riposte a RAMPAGE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just throw something on the mob as it's incoming, disc evasive and go afk.  It works 100% of the time unless your pullers don't know what they're doing.  Well, your puller will have rampage before you no matter what, but if it's a monk, they can just feign until it's off them.<br />
<br />
For PoP, rampage is less of an issue because things hit so hard sometimes it doesn't even matter anyway.  It's easier to just avoid rampage via distance.  Magmaton, Warchiefs in Earth B, and Krizzik the Mighty are the only mobs I have think of in PoP where RT is meaningful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive really never understood rampage much, it seems to jump around so randomly. im the SA of my guild so on mobs like IV, vindi, CT, paffa, klandicar ect i always engage right after the MA with arrows or just meleeing it and it still always seems to jump around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rampage pre-EP is very simple and it should never jump around if you are doing it right.  Basically, you follow rules in the quoted post above and you WILL set rampage correctly.<br />
<br />
Most likely one of the casters is engaging the mob before you hit it with arrows, or they are casting on the MA which has already engaged.  IMO, YOU should ALWAYS engage before the MA to stop exactly that kind of messup from happening. <br />
<br />
You can usually tell who will be rampage by assisting the mob before engaging (assuming half the raid dind't fuck up and get on the list).  If the mob is targeting himself it means you are free and open to tag him for rampage.  <br />
<br />
You can also often memwhipe for mobs like AL to reclear and retag.<br />
<br />
Basically, someone is fucking up on your raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Concept 1) When you die you are taken OFF the rampage list.<br />
Concept 2) There can be blank spaces on the rampage list.<br />
Concept 3) Once you are in a rampage slot you are on that slot till something actively changes your slot.<br />
<br />
Example: King Tormax, non-kos to kael and tormax monk puller.<br />
<br />
Tormax INC!, monk in rampage slot 1.<br />
MT fires arrow, MT in Rampage slot 2.<br />
ST fires arrow, ST in Rampage slot 3.<br />
Monk lands Tormax at camp, MT engages.<br />
Monk feigns successfully, he is wiped off the rampage list.<br />
<br />
Rampage list currently:<br />
Slot 1 = Nobody<br />
Slot 2 = MT<br />
Slot 3 = ST - RTing<br />
<br />
Heal hits MT, cleric goes in rampage slot 1.<br />
Cleric dies from rampage.<br />
<br />
Rampage list back to:<br />
Slot 1 = nobody<br />
Slot 2 = MT<br />
Slot 3 = ST - RTing<br />
<br />
Bard song gets him on the rampage list.<br />
Bard gets hit, activates fading memories, rampage list resets to the above.<br />
<br />
Another heal hits MT, Clr #2 on rampage.<br />
Cleric 2 dies, rampage list resets to the above.<br />
<br />
Ranger shoots an arrow, gets in slot 1.<br />
Ranger zones because he doesnt want to die.<br />
Rampage list resets to the above.<br />
<br />
Another cleric dies.<br />
<br />
Raid leader calls for everyone to attack so someone can take the rampage instead of the CLRs.<br />
<br />
Rampage list changes to this:<br />
Slot 1: Monk1<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3: ST - RTing<br />
Slot 4: Monk2<br />
Slot 5: Monk 3<br />
Slot 6: SK<br />
Slot 7: Bard<br />
Slot 8: Rogue<br />
Slot 9: Monk4<br />
Slot 10+: Everyone else<br />
<br />
Rampage healers just happen to be the suck here and dont catch monk 1 before he goes down.<br />
Slot 1 now has nobody in it.<br />
ST finally begins taking rampage.  Still nobody in slot 1, slot 3 is actively being rampaged.<br />
<br />
Too bad rampage healers lost another one =/ they werent expecting him to ever get on rampage or something.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: nobody<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3: nobody<br />
Slot 4: Monk 2 - RTing<br />
Slot 5: Monk 3<br />
Slot 6: SK<br />
Slot 7: Bard<br />
Slot 8: rogue<br />
Slot 9: monk 4<br />
slot 10+: everyone else<br />
<br />
Monk 2 in slot 4 begins rampage tanking, he says *oh no, like 7 people already dropped from rampage tanking screw this*<br />
Monk 2 feigns successfully, off the rampage list, he lays there waiting for someone else to pick up rampage because he doesnt know if his feign worked or something.<br />
<br />
Monk 3 in slot 5 begins RTing, ST is rezzed back in and picks up awareness aggro.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: ST<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
slot 3: nobody<br />
Slot 4: nobody<br />
Slot 5: monk 3 - RTing<br />
Slot 6: SK<br />
Slot 7: Bard<br />
Slot 8: rogue<br />
Slot 9: monk4<br />
Slot 10+ everyone else<br />
<br />
Poor just rezzed and unbuffed ST at 40% life, dies in one rampage round. Slot 1 again cleared.<br />
Monk 2 notices monk 3's *PLEASE GOD RT HEAL ME* call in channel, says *ok cool back in I go*, stands up and engages.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: Monk 2 - RTing<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3: Nobody<br />
Slot 4: nobody<br />
Slot 5: monk 3 - no longer RTing<br />
slot 6: SK<br />
Slot 7: bard<br />
Slot 8: rogue<br />
Slot 9: monk 4<br />
<br />
Notice how monk 2's successful feign brought him HIGHER on the rampage list? oooooo<br />
<br />
RT CH chain heals still hitting monk 3 in slot 5 instead of monk 2 in slot 1, in the confusion of who is Rting both monk 2 and 3 go down.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: Nobody<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3: nobody<br />
Slot 4: nobody<br />
Slot 5: nobody<br />
Slot 6: SK - RTing<br />
Slot 7: bard<br />
Slot 8: rogue<br />
Slot 9: monk 4<br />
Slot 10+ everyone else<br />
<br />
Monk 1 gets clicked back in, he isnt KOS, he does not go to any slot on Tormax rampage list, he loots his stuff while the rest of the raid is wiping.<br />
<br />
Sk's gear sucks, he drops before the second CH even hits him.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: nobody<br />
slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3-6: nobody<br />
Slot 7: bard<br />
Slot 8: rogue<br />
Slot 9: monk 4<br />
Slot 10+ everyone else<br />
<br />
Bard starts RTing, he activates fading memories, tormax sees invis so when the tick hits and tormax aggro radius is checked bard gets stuck in slot 1 in the rampage list.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: bard - RTing<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3-7: nobody<br />
Slot 8: rogue<br />
Slot 9: monk 4<br />
Slot 10+ everyone else<br />
<br />
Bard uses deftdance and tanks a few rampages for 10 seconds with autododge disk, his gear sucks too, once his disk is over he dies with all the heals the poor rampage healers try and throw on him.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: nobody<br />
slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3-7: nobody<br />
Slot 8: Rogue - RTing<br />
Slot 9: monk 4<br />
Slot 10+ everyone else<br />
<br />
rogue and monk 4 dont use their abilities to get off rampage, sadly, the RT healers are OOM now.  Both go down.<br />
<br />
Slot 1: nobody<br />
Slot 2: MT<br />
Slot 3-9: nobody<br />
slot 10+ everyone else.<br />
<br />
Everyone else dies, one healer after another, MT dies everyone dies.<br />
<br />
EXCEPT for monk 1, who never attacked tormax again and who is unkos, and who gets to watch King Tormax walk his ass back to spawn point wondering why he isnt dead.<br />

My opinion is that, when, due to a successful feign, the monk puller is removed from the rampage list it simply shifts up one.<br />
<br />
Here is the big question though for the above scenario.<br />
<br />
Why in the world would you have your cheal clerics healing from Tormax melee range????!!!!!<br />
<br />
If person on rampage is outside mob melee range he will rampage on the next highest who is close enough...<br />

<br />
Thats a hell of a proof ...<br />
<br />
I personally beleive that the rampage list hole theory is as good as any other to explain an actual recorded effect.<br />
<br />
I and many others here have seen many times where someone logs on and joins a fight midway and suddenly gets rampage over others who where there from the start.<br />
<br />
It also explains how someone can die from rampage, get rezzed back in, and still be rampage (they fill their own hole).<br />
<br />
If you have some reasoning that the hole-theory cant work feel free to post it here. Its a great subject for discussion/debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know for a fact that a monk FD w/ mem-wipe does NOT leave a &quot;hole&quot; in the rampage list.<br />
<br />
I also know for a fact that many people will take repost damage or pull agro briefly, and then swear to hell and back that they &quot;had rampage&quot; when in fact, they did not.<br />
<br />
We routinely pull rampaging mobs to the vicinity of our raid using a monk, then have our rampage tank (usually an SK) tag and pull the target the last little bit to the MA.  The monk FD's off rampage, and rampage stays locked on our SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Range issues are the biggest problem with rampage &quot;jumping around&quot;, in my experience.  Make sure your rampage tank stays very near the mob.  Even if the mob's total rampage range is huge, he may choose to hit someone closer due to proximity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a hell of a proof ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not a matter of proof its a matter of fact.  The shit don't work that way.  You want me to post a log of a monk pulling, me tagging, the monk FDing, and me being RT?  Like the poster above my guilds have rampage locked down solid and we pull with FDers who later get up and attack the mobs too.  Rampage messes up because the mob is aggroed without setting it, or a healer casts elixer on the main tank before rampage is set, or a monk feign doesn't wipe him from the list or a bard is AEing a song that hits the mob before an arrow does ... or any other number of reasons.  But the mechanics of the list really aren't that complicated.  It has never ever worked any other way for me and I was almost always the guild's designated rampage tank.</div></div><hr />

When is the hate list copied to become the rampage list?<br />
<br />
I've seen behavior from the High Priest in SSRA that leaves me to believe it's copied at the time of first rampage. Let me explain why I think that.<br />
<br />
The entire raid is camped at the Jail. No one has HP agro, as determined by an SoS Rogue assisting the mob. An SK pulls the room, dies on the pull, but we tag all the mobs around the Jail door and get them in successfully, and no one healed the SK. RT tags HP at that point, I tag after him. Alternate scenario: RT pulls the room, and before they get a heal I make sure I tag HP. We've done it both ways, and had the same problem many times either way.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, no one else has even left Jail at this point. There is no way I have a heal, song, or anything hitting me, nor is there any way the RT had any heals or anything on them.<br />
<br />
The raid moves into position, we rush HP, and invariably a cleric ends up on Rampage. The RT is in range, does not have agro, and I am holding agro the whole time, so it's not normal melee.<br />
<br />
WTF is happening here? The only thing I've come up with is that it depends on your position on the agro list when Rampage first goes off.<br />
<br />
It's starting to matter a lot because we just lost a Rydda fight with the dragon at 17%. We lost way too many of the wrong people to rampage, and I am personally pretty befuddled about how to set rampage correctly on a mob that pops like that. Obviously the bards don't sing, your first heal is LoH, the RT and the MT attack immediately, everyone is backed away as far as they can at first - - but we did all that and it didn't help. So something is missing that I don't get, and I think it might be that the list doesn't start growing immediately, like a hate list, but is copied at some specific point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">daramin's suggestion would help explain alot of the oddities i see in rampage as well and makes more sense to what ive seen happen with clerics and GRC casters getting eaten by ramps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rampage list starts the minute the mob is aggroed, regardless of whether the mob is rampaging that moment or not.  When I've tagged or pulled AL, Brynbr, various POS shit, various VT stuff, the mobs often aren't rampaging immediately when tagged (well, except the AL) but if I tag I have always been rampage.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to account for your experiences, Dara.  I've been RT on HP a few different times.  The first time we all entered the room and I orb'd him across the room from the clerics to begin rampage.  The second time we all entered the room and some crap mob spawned before I tagged, a MAGE PET engaged the mob first, and voi la the mage was rampage.  The third time I pulled the room to the jail, getting rampage in the process, to ensure that the mage (or any other caster) would not be rampage again.  Aside from the second time our rampage has always worked.<br />
<br />
On pop mobs you just have to be prepared to have any and all tank-classes tag upon pop (to ensure that at least ONE actually does).  Same thing with Emp, who's rampage isn't really that bad but who can screw up your raid if he gets on the CC team.  I spam f8...</div></div><hr />

We've considered trying to do Rydda that way, but we want the Rangers to have trueshot... [edit: and I doubt our Rangers could be the RT on Rydda]</div></div><hr />

Oh and the clerics dont usually stand inside tormax melee range, every kill Ive ever seen/been in he has been pulled to either the corner next to WL zone line or once in the tiny corner of the right wall before it makes the 90% turn towards zone out.  I tried to draw it but I previewed and it didnt keep the spaces so I cant illustrate it.<br />
<br />
Tormax has a good deal larger of a rampage range than his melee range and being a giant his melee range is quite far, usually clerics arent in it but if they get too close they can be.  Not that most Tormax runs occur in the way of my original post I just created an example quickly to illustrate my points.  If it always occurred that way nobody would ever win, haha well zerg guilds would.<br />

<br />
I am 'if i do say' one our best Rampage Tanks, If a mob is Rampage, I am always the one called to do it. Its not hard to do, but people dont seem to understand the concept.<br />
<br />
Here is what we do,<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Eample Mob 1.... Magmatron<br />
<br />
We have a suicidal enchanter who does 90% of our boss mob pulling. He will Tash, and try to slow, then run back to camp area...<br />
<br />
We set up just past Castle 1, and on the hillside against the zone wall.<br />
<br />
Chanter will pull mob to OTHER end of castle wall.<br />
<br />
When Chanter calls Tash, The MT and RT CH chains Start THEN..<br />
<br />
By the time Mob gets to area CH's are going off.<br />
<br />
When mob is in sight I target mob with a Bow.<br />
<br />
I use a Warbow and the longest range arrows I can Buy.<br />
<br />
Chanter stops and waits for Magmatron to Smash him.<br />
<br />
Chanter Dies.<br />
<br />
Magmatron has NO AGGRO LIST so starts back to his normal location.<br />
<br />
At this POINT I tag Magmatron....<br />
<br />
I go Defensive, MT goes Defensive...<br />
<br />
Magmatron Runs at me, MT Engages and does AOE Taunt if needed to lock in aggro.<br />
<br />
I stand behind the MT and attack, For RT I use 1hs and shield, more hps and AC. Since RT CH order uses primarilly druid healers. This also limits my ripostes and less chance of gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
I will take Rampage every time until I die.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Example Mob 2.  High Priest<br />
<br />
monk pulls all mobs to jail.<br />
<br />
monk fd..fd..fd.. to clear aggro<br />
<br />
SoS rogue verifies aggro clear<br />
<br />
As RT While the mobs are all being CC'd - Mez'd or Mez Tanked... and people are refreshing buffs, med, etc.. It is my job to gain aggro.<br />
<br />
I will go ALONE, no bard song, and I will Open the HP door, and Tag with Arrows. This will get me on Aggro List, I then back up and wait for Call to charge. Note: When HP does his 'Stun AOE' ANYONE affected by that will go into the next numerical spots on the rampage list.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Example 3. Arch Lich<br />
<br />
Well this is an old tactic, that we dont use anymore because AL rampage is most inconsequential anymore.<br />
<br />
We Clear the  room, as normal. <br />
<br />
Then Raid Enters room.<br />
<br />
Entire Raid, except for RT team camps out. Note: stay away from walls, its bad, m'kay.<br />
<br />
While the entire raid is camped out, RT team all fires arrows at AL.<br />
<br />
Raid returns, reforms groups, engage, and Rampage will stay on one of the RT team.<br />
<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
On a mob that Rampages, remember one key point, unless the mob is trivial for your force.<br />
<br />
It is MORE IMPORTANT at ALL TIMES to keep the Rampage Tank Alive.<br />
<br />
The Main Tank, is the most Trivial position to switch on any raid encounter. <br />
<br />
-- New Main Tank calls for heals<br />
-- New main tank goes defensive and attacks<br />
-- AFTER HEALS start landing, AFTER is important, New MT HUGS the mob, then goes AOE-Taunt, and then a NORMAL Taunt. This is 99.99999% guaranteed to swap the Mob onto the MT.<br />
<br />
There is NO SUCH easy fix for the Rampage Tank.<br />
<br />
In all likelyhood, your healers will start eating rampage. And if its Magmatron where the mob can Quad for 2500+ well, I guess thats a dead healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, please stop with the three mile long examples.  We get the point.  :D  It's not rocket science.<br />
<br />
We just know you are wrong.  The best way I can try to rationally explain the problem with each and every one of your examples is that most guilds will assign TWO rampage tanks to the harder hitting RT/SRT.   The reason we are able to do this is because the rampage list is set in stone and never changes.  If a hole could happen (like for instance the RT dying and leaving a hole) then the SRT would never work (because someone else would come along and fill that hole, replacing the RT position).  It just doesn't work that way.  Typing up lots and lots and slot examples won't change it. =/<br />
<br />
Oh, and Lan, your AL scenario is unnecessarily complicated.  There is never any reason to camp out the raid because AL is mem wipable.  So you just have the raid hide behind the two pillars, have a chanter cast mem wipe until he isn't aggroed on anyone, and then go to town on rampage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we dont even bother doing it with AL anymore as he is trivial. I am talking oh, over a year ago before Emp was ever killed. I know chanter memblur him, but at the time I believe there were dificulties with it working all the time. Not just I dont wiggle fingers for a living...<br />

<br />
As the best equipped player in my guild and pickup raid leader in a lot of cases in the past for relatively weak rampage mobs I have had to know this.  I must be my own RT, If I am not my initial RT then I am my own SRT.<br />
<br />
If the RT goes down then I FORCE myself out of rampage list (it changes) and back into rampage list in the hole the former RT left on my next attack swing (I become RT here).<br />

I wait 3 seconds then I attack, waiting for first Rampage to set in. First rampage hits me, I call attack, it continues rampage onto me for aprox 2 minutes. <br />
<br />
At this point suddenly with both I and the MT alive and attacking XTC, suddenly stops rampaging me. This by your definition is IMPOSSIBLE. <br />
<br />
It happened I was there, I started with rampage I did not stay on rampage. It annoyed the *(&amp;(&amp; out of me as it was a wasted defensive, as I could not regain rampage the entire remainer of fight. I felt bad for the 2 non tanks that had to deal with his rampage(oh btw did I mention that he changed rampage again off of one of them during the fight????)</div></div><hr />

Did you make sure the mobs target was itself before the fight by /assisting it?<br />

Are you 100% sure you dont have newbs casting something like memblur on it?  Or anything the might have memblurring effects?<br />

1) Rampage tank dies.  Tank_05 starts eatting ramps and gets healed.  Rampage tank gets rez. Rampage tank gets rampaged and killed while looting corpse.<br />
<br />
2)  Rampage tank dies.  Tank_05 starts eatting ramps and gets healed. Player_07 joins the fight late due to LD. Player_07 starts eatting rampages and dies.<br />
<br />
I have personally witnessed those 2 scenarios tons of times, and I know rampage well.  I have usually been my guilds rampage tank from Ssra to Time.  I know rampage list is set by order of aggro from a fully unaggro mob (and not at the time of first rampage).  I know that the list doesnt change ones the mob is aggrod.  I also know that the above scenarios have happened, and the holes theory is the best way to describe what I have actually witnessed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every single time I've had a raid member claim &quot;rampage switched&quot; when the logs were parsed, it turns out to have been player error.  Either the player was getting reposted, and mistook that for rampage, or they got agro, and mistook that for rampage.<br />
<br />
Also, remember, /assist won't show a player who is out of agro range.<br />
<br />
I have personally witnessed cases where we &quot;carefully&quot; setup pampage, only to move into the MOBs room and have one of our healers get whacked off the bat, because they had healed a monk earlier during a pull, transfered agro to the boss, and then been out of agro range when we /assisted the mob to check targets.  Due to range they may have moved off the agro list, but they stayed in their spot on the rampage list!</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do I know?<br />
<br />
Well I have a seperate chat box with filters set such that it shows:<br />
And all of these are pretty and color coded..<br />
<br />
 Mobs Hitting me == RED<br />
 Mobs Missing Me == GREEN<br />
 Mobs Rampage == PURPLE (link color)<br />
 Me Hitting == White<br />
 Me missing == Yellow<br />
<br />
These are set to show all. Its amazing how much usefull information you can tell just by glancing at the window. You can verify aggro, and rampage. Some mobs will miss alot, even on rampages so its not always easy to tell if you still in proper position on the list. If mobs are avoiding/riposte, or if you are doing the same.<br />
<br />
I have seen UI's that remove all the text and just give you numbers. Personally I prefer the information.<br />

Thats not what happened.  Rampage mesage + a full round of attacks does not = low HP aggro.<br />

<br />
Hi.  Read the goddamn rampage rules posted in response to the original questions.  Since we are debating THOSE rules it would help if we were all on the same page here. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. NOTHING will get you off of the Rampage list except for Memwipe. Period. Feign death MAY get you off the rampage list IF you are lucky enough to score a memwipe when you feign, and we all know that's a crapshoot at best. Even death does NOT ALWAYS remove you from the rampage list; many rampaging mobs will start beating on someone who died to rampage the instant they are resurrected. Rumblecrush is notorious for this particular behaviour, so plan your battle rezzing with care and make sure you rez the dead outside rampage range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. No need to get testy about it.  Here is a small FYI for you ... I wrote up the list that is general quoted today as how rampage works back on the ezboard steelwarrior over a year ago.<br />
<br />
The holes theory is every bit as legitimate as any other theory. Nothing is &quot;known&quot; unless you have the code to look at so its all speculation.  Try not to get so worked up that you have to curse to get your point across, it generally leads people to completely disregard anything further you have to say, kinda like Im disregarding everything you say from this point forward.<br />

<br />
As you said, its all speculation without the code.  But as I already posted, many guilds use two tanks for rampage and the hole theory is just plain IMPOSSIBLE in that scenario (because, uh, when 2 rampage tanks are necessary usually bards aren't assigned and thus cannot &quot;force&quot; themselves off the list like Raiddenn apparently does with, I presume, FM). <br />
<br />
If folks have seen strange behavior I, like Bum, suspect someone has fucked up somewhere along the line. <br />
<br />
P.S.  If &quot;goddamn&quot; is a curse word for you I recommend staying away from prime time television. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
 But as I already posted, many guilds use two tanks for rampage and the hole theory is just plain IMPOSSIBLE in that scenario (because, uh, when 2 rampage tanks are necessary usually bards aren't assigned and thus cannot &quot;force&quot; themselves off the list like Raiddenn apparently does with, I presume, FM). <br />
<br />
I dont know where you get impossible from.<br />
<br />
ramp_warrior_01 tags mob<br />
ramp_warrior_02 tags mob<br />
Main tank engages mob.<br />
Rest of guild, engages, heals, debufs or whatnot.<br />
<br />
At this point rampage looks like this<br />
1) ramp_warrior_01 tags mob<br />
2) ramp_warrior_02 tags mob<br />
3) Main tank engages mob.<br />
4) rest of guild going from slot 4 to slot 175 (assuming a zerg guild)<br />
<br />
ramp_warrior_01 dies. Ramp-warrior-02 starts tanking.  If you have holes, then you have <br />
1) hole<br />
2) ramp_warrior_02 tags mob<br />
3) Main tank engages mob.<br />
4) rest of guild going from slot 4 to slot 175 (assuming a zerg guild)<br />
<br />
As long as nobody not already on the aggro list, doesnt enter the list and get in melee range, ramp_tank_02 will eat rampages until mob is dead.  But at this point, with 2 ramp tanks, I have seen people enter a fight, get rampage and die who were LD when the fight started.<br />
<br />
Dunno how thats impossible, but it certainly happened. Seen it on XTC.  pull room adds and kill them. blur XTC until /assist returns no target, have all bards buffers etc turn off songs. Warrior 1 shoots arrow, warrior 2 shoots arrow, neither which will be Main tanking.  You start the fight, ramp tank 1 dies, ramp tank 2 eats ramps, someone comes back from a LD and starts taking rampage.  How exactly do you explain that?<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, set right, rampage is rock solid as long as the first person on the ramp list stays alive, it will never change.  But the holes theory is the only way I have ever heard of explaining the above occurence.<br />
<br />
Goddamn doesnt offend me in the slightest, my point was when you resort to cursing, typically it means you have run out of arguments :)</div></div><hr />

I think Solinar and the bard are wrong. Period.  I think if he is the original poster of the rampage rules then he was once right.  Period again.

The fact that someone disagrees with me doesn't bother me.  But it will get a response of, uh, you. are. wrong.  I'm not the only one calling BS on a few of the theories on this thread.  There are several threads in fact on rampage and many posters agree with my view of rampage (or Solinar's old view of rampage, take your pic) and others have several different theories on that and everything else.  This is the first I've heard of the &quot;hole&quot; theory, but in my experience the shit don't work that way.  Same experiences as others have.  Is it POSSIBLE that I've been rampage tank for my guild forever and never had these experiences?  Maybe.  It ain't probable, though, and I don't think we ought to be teaching the young rampage tanks strange theories that in practice haven't panned out. <br />

I dont remember ever posting a message about holes in the rampage list to this board:<br />
<br />
www.eqdiva.com - Bards of Everquest<br />
<br />
Nor do I ever remember reading a holes in the rampage list theory on the above board before my old guild (Europa / Legends / in plane of time soon) had the discussion between our own selves.<br />
<br />
There is a discussion on eqdiva atm in which the tables are turned and the large majority believe in the *holes in rampage list* theory and the naysayers are the ones who use the rampage list theory that originally began this thread.<br />
<br />
Try reading up on it.<br />
<br />
I had no part in the discussion so you can be sure they arent following me around like lemmings or anything.<br />
<br />
My first post date to this thread is a few days before my first read date on that thread if you care too.<br />
<br />
If you are going to post to eqdiva please do so in the manner I do without direct flames but with an explaination of your theory and supporting evidence, one old thread is here(notice we have linked to other poards and suggested reading steelwarrior.org for rampage information):<br />

I really don't care if you have the entire rampage theory wrong.  I know how it works. /shrug  <br />
<br />
You are welcome to safeguard holes on rampage.  I'm just pointing out there are holes in your logic. <br />
<br />
And thanks for the posts.  That was at least useful.  Unlike the snide sideways insults. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are holes and problems hard to explain in both of our logic, and I do believe that my theory (the one I believe in)and everyone who agrees with my theory is closer to the actual truth than you and your current theory are, and I also believe that nothing I can say will change your mind about it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, unless someone else wants to support or defend either side this is really a dead thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not believe in the Holes theory.  It appears that the reason this theory was developed was to explain why someone new to the combat (due to LD etc) could wind up rampage.  <br />
<br />
So, give it a test...<br />
<br />
Pull a trivial rampaging mob (Vindi or such) and set two rampage tanks.  Have a rog or other melee sit out of combat completely and do nothing.  Don't heal RT1 and let him die and make sure the Rampage transfers to RT2.  Once RT2 has rampage send in the variable (ie the rog who has had no part in combat).  By your logic, this new rogue will find himself on rampage after the next ramp as there is a &quot;hole&quot; which he will fill as he has not been on the rampage list and just joined combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, for my opinion (and even a way to test it).  As soon as a mob is aggroed the list begins.  First to aggro, highest on ramp list (we all agree here).  When the mob first rampages (click, a pic is taken of the rampage list and it is now written in stone, mob will rampage on the highest person on the list inside melee range).  I believe that people are removed from the list ONLY, if the mob rampages again while they are dead or feigned, i.e. when a new pic is taken of the list on the next rampage, they are not in zone or are feigned.  I have seen a RT get rezzed and be right back on rampage (meaning there was no ramp between the time he died and him getting rezzed) and seen him rezzed and not go back on rampage (meaning the mob rampaged and made a new ramp list pic while he was not in zone).  Here is an easy way to test it.<br />
<br />
Monk pull.  RT and MT tag.  The rampage list should be be 1) monk, 2) MT, 3) RT.  I will be willing to bet that if the monk stays feigned until the mob rampages the first time he will be off rampage list EVERY time.  If he gets back up immediately (before the first mob ramp) and gets in the fight he will be on rampage.  I don't think it is a lucky memwipe here, but him being feigned at the time of the first rampage.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it<br />

On some encounters, rampage have been tossed around on up to 10 diffrent chars, without no apparent reason. Everytime this happens, someone comes up with a new theory on what happend or how RMP works in raidchat.  When the RMP tank dies and gets ressed though, its my experience that he just rarely get his rmp spot back.  When a mnk FDs after a pull he's also very rarely kept on RMP.  This is just how i've experienced it, and not based on logs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JagdDoga</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually read this thread hours before going to the Kael arena with my guild....before all the strangeness ensued that is.  I didn't think I would be using the info any time soon, but I'm glad now that I had it.  As to which theory is correct or close, I have no say on the matter.  I didn't get to do extensive testing.  And no, Kael isn't XTC or Ryda'Dar or uber_mob_01 but they ARE ramp mobs and in the reach of my guild.  Just thought I'd share some observations with the gallery.<br />
<br />
Started the night as MT and ended up as offtank/RT/general purpose bad@$$.  I was pretty steamed at being outdone by a guild paladin, even if he is a buddy.  Being embarrased in a pickup group is one thing.....in front my my guild is another story completely.  Anyhow....I started seeing rampage fly across my window while trying to coordinate things, so I decided to hammer down on getting people to actually attack when I told them to (whyyyyyy is this so frickin hard???) and tried out the RT thing.<br />
<br />
Monk pulled, paladin stunned, I stuck my arrows in those giant knees i kept staring at all night.  /smack monk that was slow on the assist call concept....took 3 rezzes to get everyone in line on that.  I digress.  Once we got down our pull system (we don't raid much...two groups was a big thing for us) it seemed that only myself and the monk ever took ramp damage.  I won't swear to that as I wasn't always paying attention to it, but that's what I was able to pick out of my window.  It also seemed like i was taking most of it after the monk got off his FD.<br />
<br />
Just my observations from what little I was able to see of ramp mobs.  Still not certain which theory I subscribe to just yet.  Gonna be looking into this a bit more as I'd like to get on a regular Kael cycle, but I thought I'd come share and say thanks for the info I got from you all.  I actually looked like I knew what I was doing even if I couldn't hold aggro. =^_^=</div></div><hr />

He hits like a wuss and the rampage only makes it so the cleric needs someone to be a rampage tank.  Testing on him not only would be safe, it would be trivial, as there is no pulling to get to him or any need for a mass of people.<br />
