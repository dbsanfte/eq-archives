Go look at what the DOZEN of RETARDED AA people have asked for OOW<br />
<br />
- Snare<br />
- Stun <br />
- Holy Steed<br />
- Slow<br />
- Mana Taps<br />

- Channeling<br />

- Spellshield<br />
- DoTshield<br />
- Shielding<br />
- Swarm Pets <br />
- Purify Cures<br />
<br />
Etc Etc Etc.<br />
This is not beeing Creative, this is sheer stupidity. Not only we might actually get some<br />
of that useless trash, it could even mean we will get these instead of much better AA,<br />
i dunno like Improved Faster AE Taunt, Faster Incite, 355 Stat Cap, Innate Echo of Incite.<br />
<br />
<br />
I want my Epic 2.0 to be usefull for the 2 things i do in my life :<br />
- TANK<br />
- DPS<br />
<br />
So if asking for something usefull with some polyvalence is &quot;uncreative&quot;.<br />
Then Fuck Creativity.<br />
<br />
I dont want a glowing pink stick that will summon a war boar while procing a doting tash<br />
and give me a soon to be capped shielding mod with 40 atk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here is the suggestion I posted. Tried to make it relevant, a bit outside the box as far as effects, and sticking with EQ lore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Proc: Wrath of Zek<br />
<br />
Proc description: The power of Zek slices your target's soul, sapping their will to fight and bolstering you to victory.<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Defenseless(3.0 seconds. No level limit!). Target takes 4x damage from all melee damage for 3 seconds and target's melee damage output is halved.<br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 250. Your target's lack of will bolsters your soul.<br />
3:  Increase Hate by ?. Obviously the mob would be mad at you once the timer wore off. :)<br />
Type: Lifetap<br />
<br />
Proc Emote: %t's will to fight leaves them.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see something creative like that that also follows the lore of the original Epics. This would provide the weapon with an ability that is useful in all situations(raid, group), has relativity to our class(increased damage is limited to melee), and is likely to be unique and desired regardless of new weapons that drop. It would be a great weapon regardless if it is 1 hand or 2 hand.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is a very powerful proc, but an Epic weapon should be and it's effect should be unique in all the game. This would also make it highly desirable and deserving as the crown jewel of all Warrior weapons.<br />
<br />
Focus Effect: Guard of Zek<br />
<br />
Focus Description: The power of Zek wills you to battle.<br />
<br />
1. Chance to Cripple Hit<br />
<br />
<br />
That was my suggestion. Hope others think of some creative ones. I don't know if mines all that creative, but it's not quite the same old stuff we have.<br />

Seriusly how about anger3 (or 4 or 5) and a + accuracy mod (increase hit rate--unless that opens a can of worms...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tuddars suggestion is interesting :P an chance to Crippling blow focus(without being berserk) with increased hate would be an awesome deal(short duration of course)- and I like that beneficial proc to the raids and groups that decreases opponents defenses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well I was thinking something that proc'd a shark with laser beams and a jetpack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">distinct look and weapon for each race.<br />
<br />
customizable weapon by the choices i make while doing the quest with differnt worn effect, proc and ratio depending on how I do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think a good right click ability would be an instant right click buff that would add a buff in the buff window that would proc a DD for around 200-250 points or mabey more AND make it so any other procs that are on the weapon regular ones or augs would not proc.<br />
<br />
Presto chango no need for 5000 weapons the same weapon you use to melee and hold agro can be used to DPS with simply by clicking it then if you need to tank you only need to click off the proc buff. It would be good in that the effect would be helpfull to any tank at any level and make life as a warrior simpler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Note: These are for epic 2.0. For epic 1.5 the effects can be lesser/different and more tailored towards the single group and small raid content which it's targetted at.<br />
<br />
Focus: Chance to Riposte +10000<br />
<br />
1: Would avoid the rediculous situation now where at 10% on every single mob, the warrior who's been shouting obsceneties and doing everything to catch it's attention, suddenly stops attacking for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
2: Offer the benefit of smoothing out the small amount of 'spike' damage<br />
<br />
3: In the current system, warrior 1handers have to have high delay to be feasible in PRI due to ripostes, and as a result that makes them overpowered for offhand. No ripos would remove that limitation, hence removing the need for warrior mainhanders to be flagged PRIMARY only. Since ripostes are no longer a consideration, warrior weapons can have a regular ratio, in line with the content it's obtained in, then can be RE-USED in the offhand in the future - the same as it is for all other dual wielding classes.<br />
<br />
4: Warriors can be out front rather than cowering behind poking the mob in the ass with the rogues<br />
<br />
Clicky/Proc/Worn effect: Something of the Warlords of Zek<br />
<br />
Having to choose one of all 3, I feel, is to restrictive. But if forced to choose, the answer is simple:<br />
It's a weapon. <br />
It has to have a proc.<br />
<br />
It's VERY hard to find something balanced, not knowing what's going to be around at the time, but here goes:<br />
<br />
1: Stun (0.00sec/80) <br />
a CHANCE to interrupt exp content's spells if you proc at the right time<br />
<br />
2: DirectDamage<br />
Whatever's appropriate at the time, possibly a lifetap<br />
<br />
3: a 1-3 tick DoT (subject to balance) which significantly drops a mob's AC and Resists so others fighting it gain a short DPS boost. Stackable with everything but itself, and if it lands on a mob already DoTed, it overwrites rather than 'not take hold'. This would REPLACE the +pure agro line of spells as a concept for future itemisation, with the agro generated tweakable by the amount debuffed.<br />
<br />
I would like it to have a rightclick too, but since you specifically asked for only one, can't suggest one without detracting frmo the above.<br />
<br />
What I do NOT want from the epic:<br />
 <br />
A pet<br />
A large heal<br />
A horse<br />
A slow<br />
A snare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">this weapon came to me in a vision when I was on the crapper:<br />
<br />
That's where all the best visions come from IMHO.<br />
<br />
If this weapon is going to be 2hs then it needs to have SICK stats.  Don't make warriors lose AC/HP +stats just because we're using a single weapon.  Pack it on as if we were using 2 awesome 1hslasher's.<br />
<br />
If it's 2 1handed weapons maybe one could have a worn effect similar to the SK voice line.  With a solid hate proc on the mainhand A3 augged, and the voice (worn) with A3 offhanded you should still have solid aggro.  Make it stack with Voice of Thule of course.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of customizable graphic for race or path taken to complete the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">chance to riposte 10000?<br />
<br />
I'd never ever use another disc as long as I lived but fellstrike!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Here's what I want and posted in the other thread:     First, and against &quot;and are not currently looking for suggestions or feedback on stats, weapon type or design&quot;, but tough. I'd like it to be able to be converted into an equivalent weapon of different damage types. As a warrior, I'm supposed to be the master at the different weapon types. I believe the warrior epic should be able to be converted, depending on the situation, to any of the weapon types (1hs, 1hb, piercing, 2hs or 2hb). Also, I'd like each of these different versions of the epic to be unique in role. The 2hb, for example, could be high damage, medium delay with higher DPS with a low to medium aggro proc. The 2hs could be a lower delay, medium damage weapon with a high aggro proc (similar to a BoW). The 1hs could be an offhand only weapon with a proc rate double the normal. The 1hb could be mainhand only, with a high damage, medium delay with high aggro.<br />
 <br />
  Second, if we only had one proc to choose from, I would want this weapons effect to be threefold. I'd want it to have a proc with the following: lifetap for additional DPS and self healing, 0 second stun up to at least 70, and increase hate. Instead of the lifetap, it could have a self heal instead. It should have a significant proc modifier, which would be far more important than each proc having an increased effect. Even if the effect is the same over time, I'd much prefer half the effect twice as often. Here's an approximate (no numbers) Lucy description of what I'd want:<br />
 <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(0.00 sec/&gt;=70) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by XXX <br />
3:  Increase Hate by YYY <br />
Type: Lifetap<br />
 <br />
  For a focus effect, I would absolutely love an effect that has a random, low chance of completely canceling out a proc/spell cast upon the warrior. This could include DT, and I would prefer it to. Perhaps the chance of it going off could decrease the higher the spell level is, so a low level spell would have a higher chance of failing than a higher level one.<br />
 <br />
  As an alternate focus effect idea, I'd like something that has a chance of negating any ripostes. See the strikethrough focus effect, or warriors tactical mastery AA for what I'm looking for, only make the check BEFORE the mob swings, not after. Something to reduce riposte damage while increasing DPS, like the above abilites should have done.QUOTE] <br />
<br />
  And my additional post: [QUOTE] Uh... actually, I'd like to change that proc. Remove the pure hate, and instead add something like a 20% slow with disease counters with an ac debuff. Pure hate was silly when they implemented it, and I'd actually much rather move towards replacing it with actual useful effects that generate an appropriate amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
  Emilia: I was poking fun at you, and if you think all suggestions brought up by other people are bad, come up with a better one. I was just suggesting that you could find a new way to do an old job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">chance to riposte 10000?<br />
<br />
I'd never ever use another disc as long as I lived but fellstrike!<br />
<br />
Bah, lol, I meant immunity to ripostes, not 100% riposte rate hehe. I wrote it wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Enrage ignores immunity to riposte.  Most swarm pets never get hit by riposte (i.e. cleric hammer can be on the front side of Xegony for hours without dying) but still dies on enrage.  I've the feeling it's just not easy to make a mod that will let you not get hit by enrage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shakkha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">dumb to have only one effect...<br />
<br />
I would go for a traditional proc: dd/stun/anger <br />
<br />
and another instant cast rightclickable effect, clickable from inventory for when the weapon will be obsolete dmg/dly wise (one expansion after OOW basically) that adds another proc who do basically DD/stun/anger, or maybe a Voice of Thule ugraded type of buffs?<br />
<br />
shielding and riposte mode would be good adds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hrm. Some &quot;fun&quot; ideas that are somewhat RP.  Would have to have killer dmg/dly/stats/focuses too obviously.<br />
<br />
procs:<br />
-a deathtouch (32k hit) vs. green mobs, perhaps like finishing blow does on runners now, but working at any time during fight.<br />
-a massive but short duration damage shield (like 500+, for 1 tick, or higher damage but like the drood AA that is 1 dmg absorb which drops next hit).<br />
<br />
Focus effects<br />
-allow/increase chance to cripple when not low health<br />
-massive endurance regen (assuming we get more discs that use up what we have)<br />
-decrease re-use time on discs<br />
-fear, blindness and/or stun immunity<br />
-channeling! (for it's right click effect) ;)<br />
<br />
Right click<br />
-&quot;cannibalize&quot; for endurance (i.e convert hp to endurance, tho this might be better as an AA)<br />
-relatively short cast right click 1 round rampage.<br />
<br />
Not the most &quot;uber&quot; effects granted, but stuff that doesn't exist now and wouldn't (necessarily) be obsolete after a followup expansion...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The transmute 2h -&gt; 2x 1h is nice, but you put aug slots on it which isn't possible with summoned items. I think it should be 1 2hander and 2 1handers like the original epic. <br />

Proc: Should be incite like, instant hate + DoT of hate along with a stun and DD.<br />
Increase hate by 1000 and 100hate/tick for 6 ticks<br />
DD for 250<br />
stun 1.0/75<br />

and of course ungodly stats for the rest ;)<br />
<br />

Just some stuff I came up with, I'm sure someone else will think of something better :)<br />

I get the same thing, but randomly.  Have the site bookmarked, and it seems 50/50 whether it will say no cookies for Lucy or I'll get the actual site.  Getting the no cookies message, I just hit refresh and there's the site.  No idea why it happens though :(</div></div><hr />

In fact my idee is to give different effect depending on the deity (and a big hate proc for the agnostics) that would gives much hate but with in a different maner for each god. This would augment the versality between the top end warriors.<br />
Moreover it would have a proc rate increase and two slot equipable (type 4 and 8) and a focus effect to increse riposte (ours) and more strikethrough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you would increase this idee and developpe even further the different effect possible.<br />

<br />
Immagine a weapon that had 10 slots like aug slots but they would only take special augs you could get free of charge from your epic quest giver. The weapon would start out as a nice weapon but you could add the demi-augs to make it in to a weapon that was tailored to you specificly.<br />
<br />
As an example you could put augs that would increase the damage, add or increase procs, add HP, add AC, add stats, add spell shielding, add shielding, other effects and such. <br />
<br />
Then by it's very nature it would be a very powerfull tool.<br />
<br />
Something else I was thinking of (and may help current warrior weapons) is main hand damage bonus. Currently DBotW and the good ones from GoD can not be used by a warrior in off hand because the damage would be so insane. To let warriors continue using there weapons and likely there epic make an extra damage field that would add damage when a DBotW is in off hand it would be around a 34/35 or similer while in off hand but once switched to main it would become a 38/32 again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see what your saying and agree with you here frodlin, my thought are we need a weapon that can do what most every warrior wants and create agro but i say they also make the weapon transmutable like the current epic so when you want Agro you simply use you 1 hand slashes and they maybe have anger 3 on one and maybe a life tap on the other and then when you just want DPS you change them into a 2hs with some cool worn effect and slash it up....just my thought</div></div><hr />

Seems to me that what you want when tanking (aggro) and when not (DPS) are diametrically opposed.  However, along the lines of Epic 1.0, where the 2hs can be turned into two 1-handers, it would be interesting if one form, say the 2hs, had Anger/Stun style effects for aggro generation, and the 1-handers had lower aggro DD/debuff effects for DPS (or vice-versa).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">If the weapon isnt high aggro in one way or another, or has a clickable buff that makes it SIGNIFICANTLY higher aggro when its on (or focus) - No high end warrior will use it save for exp grouping and soloing, making it rather useless, please dont give us a useless weapon, thankyou!.  If its very high aggro on the other hand, warrriors will have to keep in check their aggro on raids like they do now with almost every warrior using a darkblade + aggro offhander or they will have to switch to a different weapon if they believe their raid cannot handle the extra heal it will take if the mob switches to a different warrior on trash clearings(jeez I dunno about you guys but every warrior pretty much tanks a WHOLE bunch on our clearings) <br />
<br />
In other words- if someone feels their epic is to high aggro than they will make the judgement call on if they wanna cycle, switch weapons, or try their luck (or maybe not Anger 3 aug every weapon in their backpack if they arent one of the top tanks!!), dont take away all the danger, thanks, mind you BOSSes consist of a very small percentage of the raids kills in comparison to the clearing and figuring out of the encounter to get up to the boss.  If your healers cannot keep up with aggro switching among multiple tanks up until a boss fight where people are generally more careful, than you need better healers or tanks with better gear..lol (Health of targets target is a good AA!)<br />
<br />
P.S. Dont give us anything that resembles another classes spell please, I dont want Jolting blade, thats for rangers, my jolting blade is auto-attack off, or switching to my 45/22 2hander if and only if necessary, which is less than 1% of the time even on raids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ya, that's pretty much what I think. The Wariror Epic shouldn't be a Knight or Ranger sword. When I group I MA. When I raid, I MT or wait my tuen to MT.<br />
<br />
This looks like an 2H for sure. Make it meet a Warrior's actual class defining needs - an aggro machine. Switching in another 2H when not MTing or MA isn't much of a burden.<br />
<br />
I never did use my Epic for DPS and I stopped using it because it just didn't do the job - A G G R O.<br />
<br />
Yes, if they ever did something like what I once suggested  - giving Warriors a taunt button that mimiced Paladin stuns without stunning, all the other silliness could go away and we should ask for a DPS weapon with Cleave and a DD proc. But cooler heads prevailed, we need aggro weapons, and that's what the Epic needs to be.<br />

<br />
How about a nice 2hs with all the trimmings and a nice DD proc (Time Lapse for eg), and then, a clicky from it that imbues a high aggro proc.  ala Anger, Frenzying Blow etc<br />
<br />
This leaves us a weapon useful no matter what other weapons emerge, and means we don't have to waste dkp on dps weapons when not MA.<br />
<br />
As for the point raised earlier, yes it needs stats to match up to DW if it's gonna be a 2hander... but atm you can get something like 150ac 350hp 7% shielding silly resists and stats... sadly I doubt that they are gonna put stats as high or higher on a 2hs.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you seen the concept art for it yet? /sigh <br />
I would greatly urge them to change it to a funky battle axe, an evil Seru-looking sword, or anything which looks better... like urmm an ssoy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">My thoughts as posted on the eqlive site: <br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
How hard are you going to make it to get?  <br />
<br />
It isn't going to go over well if you have to be fricken Time geared to complete the quest.  Yes, the original epics had raid drops.  But any guild had a chance to get them.  <br />
<br />
Make it so that there's a base weapon that is hard to do, but is able to be gotten without keying your guild for some zone.  This base weapon should be better than the readily available stuff in the bazaar these days.  Create 'epic only' augs (or have a quest that you turn in the epic plus some piece) that increase the weapon's power.  Get creative.  Maybe have a couple of different paths a warrior can take to customize the weapon they want.  If its done properly (i.e. the different paths are balanced) this will allow for players to have a bit of creativity in how they play their char.  Some or all of this stuff can be poked away in different keyed zones.  This gives a reward to those who have done the work to get into different places.  <br />
<br />
Think the idea of making this accessable is more important than whether or not the thing has an anger proc vs. a stun proc.  My only comment on actual effects to give it is to avoid doing something class different.  I think having a warrior weapons summon something (pet, horse) is dumb.  The aggro, DPS boost (personal and group), Debuff ideas are all good.  Hey... there you go.  There's a few paths you can take with the augmentation concept.  Maybe varying degrees depending on how hard the zone is to access...</div></div><hr />

I came up with a few things, using the idea of two 1-handers that combine like the original epic, trying to balance them against current Txevu+ weapons.

I tried to keep these as balanced and versatile as possible, while adding a few unique things. Anger of Vadd will work on aggro procs but not the Incite-line, which is intended, because adding any more to Incite/Mastruq is a balance issue against knights' snap aggro capability. The Decorin proc is a Vie effect which uses the short buff box, mitigating 3% of DB+DI, giving protection against spike damage and a bit of overcap shielding, I guess. It only lasts 2 ticks because if it were on all the time, it would be another balance issue on xp content against knights (though with very high combat effects it could be sustained).<br />
<br />
The versatility I was striving for when I designed this was simple - I wanted to create a setup for warriors like Battleblade and Celestias, that want high aggro, tanking weapons, while having a lower aggro combo for warriors like Frodlin. Then there needed to be an easy, fast way to switch between the low and high aggro setups so this doesn't happen -<br />
<br />
So MT down ...<br />
<br />
/furious<br />
/put the epic 2H in a bag<br />
/combine<br />
/put back the 1H for tanking mode<br />
<br />
Pure aggro - Brutish/Darkblade + Nihilite<br />
Tanking - Nihilite + Decorin<br />
Low aggro - Decorin + Nihilite<br />
Lowest aggro - Decorin + whatever<br />
<br />
So MT down ...<br />
<br />
Decorin and Nihilite swords switch places<br />
Done<br />
<br />
For the 2-hander enthusiasts; Blade of Tactical Fusion can be used as an aggro or DPS weapon, since it should be less aggro than the two epic swords paired. Its high PPM and damage means you might have to wait a second or two or cycle after the MA engages if you don't want to pull aggro, but it doesn't have as much aggro over time as the paired swords.<br />
<br />
PPM (mainhanded at 305 dex, including WA5 and unknown070 but not combat effects)<br />
Nihilite - 4.65<br />
Decorin - 3<br />
Tactical Fusion - 4.65<br />
<br />
None of the swords have augment slots, and they're balanced for that, because they are combinable. When LDoN released and the original epic was altered to make it augmentable, it also allowed warriors to own 2 red blades, 2 blue blades, and a 2-hander all at the same time. Being able to use two Decorin swords would be 10% shielding + near-constant 3% vie. Being able to use two Nihilite swords would be far more aggro over time than balanced.<br />
<br />
The lore and the names of the swords would indicate a long three-part epic, split between Gates/Omens content dealing with the Nihilites' struggle against Mata Muram for the Nihilite sword, PoP/Velious (Kael) content dealing with Rallos Zek for the Decorin sword, and something different (New Veeshan's Peak maybe?) for the scabbard to combine them. Lots of room for new content in old zones, and quest lore. I'd write a brief outline on it, but I'm not on Sony's payroll  :D <br />
<br />
That's my Vision(tm). I'm not a warrior, so if I'm wrong on something, fine.</div></div><hr />

I think it should start at the current epics level and go up in 10 increments of progressive quests each adding a slot that can be customized from a library of sub quests for &quot;epic only augs&quot;.  That way every warr can build their own 10 slot weap to their tastes.  This would be alot of work but would so incredibly energize the long term value of this weap.<br />

Was just kicking around some ideas and this is what i made of it. The lowering of your opponents defenses would refer along to lower rate of rampage/riposte/parry etc during those 3 ticks thus allowing everyone to benefit from increased damage during that time, and concurrent procs would start the 3 ticks over instead of just not sticking.</div></div><hr />

GoD gave us not a damn thing for agro upgrades, Time weapons are still the best or, at worst, equivalent.

Not some lame assed crap like the incite line which totally fails at what it was intended to do, and has too long a refresh to be useful.  You already screwed us in GoD dont do it again in OOW, or you are going to lose people the same way you did in GoD. <br />
<br />
And oh yeah do something EARLY this expansion, since you bent us completely in GoD.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would make me so happy I'd pee a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Vyrance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">anyone know where the epic 2.0 quest starts?  ive been looking around but no luck yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>OrgroInsanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I'd like to be able to bash with it like it was a shield like the Original pally epic.. <br />
<br />
Like wise could put a Furious Bash type focus on it, for that extra little treat of aggro.. Not to mention bashes do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>OrgroInsanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">And for those of you talking about not putting an aggro proc on it need to realise you're a Warrior..<br />
<br />
When you're not tanking, switch to a different weapon.. You're not a DPS class, realise it.<br />
<br />
I'm going with and Anger Upgrade proc.<br />
<br />
Able to Bash with it.<br />
<br />
An improved Furious Bash focus.<br />
<br />
If i could pick between a 2hander and 2 1 handers, i'd pick 2 1 handers.. (Providing the primary sword had a 30ish or higher Delay)<br />
<br />
Not only does that gives us more procs, with more potential for aggro, it also gives us another Aug slot. Which can be used for a stat increase or another proc.<br />
<br />
1 handers also gives us the chance to take advantage of the Shield Block AA when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>EQSgmorris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Any one Tell me where i can find a Step by step for our new epic ? or e-mail me it at eqsgmorris@adelphia.net  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Dude, the expansions been out 2 days........<br />
<br />
Think about that.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">What?  There are no l33t spoilerz yet?<br />
<br />
Get on that right away, this is important.  Thousands of gimps are depending on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Graco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">note yes the epic is very new and a lot of ppl working on it so lets not way lay the ones that don't want to put time into figuring out the quest,<br />
<br />
as for anger augments  on weapons and us being a dps class we  are not unless you count the few seconds we use fellstrike<br />
<br />
2 1handers = more procs als0 = more reposites  mob pending = dead tank 1 round<br />
<br />
1 2hander = less procs also = less reposites  = less agro yes but a live tank none the less remember you get agro from big damage as well as from fast damage<br />
<br />
NOW lets get back to the top folks Epic 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>OrgroInsanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">With AA using 2 1 handers makes no difference in the number of Ripostes, as long as the 1 hander is of a fairly high delay.. Slippery Attacks make us 100% immune to ripostes from attacks with our offhand.<br />
<br />
More procs, More stats, Same number of ripostes plus all the Shield benefits make 2 1handers the clear choice..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Give it a worn effect to lessen the re-use time on Disciplines and an Anger proc and I would be more than happy.</div></div><hr />
