I have started a Warrior and was curious how their DPS compares to a Rogue at higher lvl's. I know that Warriors tank much better, and their DPS is lower, but how much lower is what I really wanted to know. I solo most of the time and would like to be able to continue to do that. Without decent DPS I am afraid that the fights will take too long and multiple mob fights will be near impossible. Thanks in advance for any info.</div></div><hr />

Warrior DPS vs Rogue at high levels is around 1/2 to 1/4 depending on spec.<br />
<br />
You can continue to solo most of the time with no problem as a warrior.<br />
<br />
Your view of multi mob fights is actually backwards, strangely enough, rogues do dps faster than warriors but take dps MUCH faster than warriors, so a warrior is far more likely to survive a multi-mob confrontation ( noted exception, combat spec rogue with blade flurry and evasion available vs two mobs only ). Also note that a rogue takes much more than twice as long to kill two mobs simultaneously than they do to kill a single mob, and a third makes it even worse.<br />
<br />
It's sort of the monk effect from EQ - while having 40% dodge rate and 40% mitigation are equal in theory, 40% dodge doesn't mean that a mob won't hit you 10 times in a row, just that it is unlikely, whereas 40% mitigation means you are going to save 40% no matter how the random numbers turn.<br />
<br />
The value of getting a lucky string of dodges that leave you finishing a fight at near fulll health in no way balances the downside of getting an unlucky string of dodges that leaves you dead.</div></div><hr />

Even with good, up to date gear I don't get near lvl +3's for solo leveling, and frankly the sweetspot is at lvl -1/lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your view of DPS taken versus dealt is wrong.  If rogues end up less likely to survive multi mob pulls then they're not going to be able to solo +3 mobs with ease (which you can think of as just having 2 mobs at once) while a Warrior have problem.  The number 1 rule of EQ raid applies here:  if you kill stuff faster than other guys, then in essence you tank better by not having to tank as long.  You can always burn one mob down while evasion is up and this turns a 1vs2 fight into 2 1vs1 fight with you starting the 2nd fight at about 80% with evasion running out.  In the same situation the Warrior would end up with significantly less than 80% health when the first mob dies since he can't kill a mob in 15 seconds, and effective evasion mitigation is well above whatever mitigation your AC gives you.  <br />
<br />
Also since it takes about 20 seconds for a rogue to solo a -1, you can keep a mob stunned 9 out of that 20 seconds with Cheap Shot + Kidney Shot level 1 which is a straight 45% damage mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps that may be the case, but you are comparing tanking for soloing.  I was playing my girlfriends priest with an equal level warrior and rogue.  If the rogue went down, the warrior could still tank and keeps mobs off the priest.  If the warrior went down things were much much more difficult.  Sure, kills were faster with the rogue, but the inability to take damage and keep aggro of a rogue makes a warrior a far far superior tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume you're dealing with elites because those are the only things that have enough HPs where the lack of tanking can catch up to you.  Even then, elites don't really live that long so the more DPS = tank better argument still applies.  If your only DPS is either a rogue or a War, then if a rogue does double DPS of a warrior (and I'm pretty sure they do), that means the rogue only needs to be healed for only half as long, which is really the same thing as if a rogue just takes half damage from everything to start.  The only exception to this would be if a rogue will somehow die while tanking because he takes too much damage per hit.<br />
<br />
If you're talking about even level mobs, you should just have the priest start nuking, and then rogue get aggro by an ambush, and at this point the mob is halfway dead anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felwin</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats the highest DPS warrior build?  Arms and MS, or Fury with Flurry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogue DPS is far greater than Warrior DPS.  They have a lot more versitility too.  If they need to fight two mobs, they can sap + poison one and proceed to kill the other.  Sap + poison lasts so long, they can usually rest inbetween fights.  IF things really go bad, they can effectively kill 3 mobs at once.  Sap/poison one, dps unload on the 2nd one, once the 2nd one dies they can vanish and rest up.<br />
<br />
As for instances by themselves for say, they can stealth all the way to the boss.  My guild rogue friends farm boss mobs for the loot, its real easy.<br />
<br />
As far as aoe dps, mages win hands down.  Their AOE spells are just insane, the trick is to keep them alive.  Priest + mage are AOE powerhouse.<br />
<br />
As for the warrior, I have am Arms MS build so far and rogues kill way faster than me.  I can dish out some pretty good dps, but they kill the same mobs in half the time.  That + their damage avoidance skills allow them to take very little damage in the meantime.  If they get hit in instances by elites though, they are going down fast!<br />
<br />
As far as Arms vs Fury, it depends.  Fury allows you to generate dps and rage but no where to put it.  Arms lets you unload major dps, but doesn't generate as much rage as fury.  A smart combo of the two will make you a dps powerhouse (though not as high as rogues), but limits your ability to tank as effectively with stuns.  It depends on what you want to do in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is *exactly* my point.<br />
<br />
If you fight a single mob, you can start with cheap shot, blow energy, kidney shot etc. It will die exceedingly quickly and you will take little damage.<br />
<br />
If you fight two, you still take all your energy and cheap shot to kill one, but the entire time the second one is beating on you, and you start the fight with the second one unstealthed, wounded and with 0 energy or combo points.<br />
<br />
If you fight three, you take all your energy and cheap shot to kill one, but get beaten on by two for the entire fight, then have to kill one starting from no energy and combo points, while another one is beating on you, and then end up facing the third one in the same position only much more badly hurt. <br />
<br />
The difference of a warrior vs multiple mobs is that the more that are on you, the more rage you have, and three mobs do about six times as much damage as one mob does, unlike a rogue where three mobs do 12 or more times as much damage as a single one does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd estimate if a mob has 2X the HP a rogue will take about 3 times the damage compare to 1X HP since a rogue can basically take down about half of a mob's health for free (opening stun, combo stun, plus an energy bar to unload).<br />
<br />
Though, even against multiple mobs, a rogue is still doing more DPS to make up for lack of mitigation, and being able to drop one mob fast (in conjunction with Evasion) reduces damage taken by a lot.  A Warrior simply isn't too great at killing the boring -1 mob that you should xp on for the majority of the game.  Only Elites have enough HP where long term mitigation matters, but since Warrior can't heal, soloing Elites really isn't a viable option.</div></div><hr />
