<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First question, is flurry rate effected by dex?  Are crit hits effected by dex?  <br />
<br />
Maybe someone could help me locate the thread, but I searched for flurry parses and couldn't find one that showed percentage of swings that resulted in a flurry.  Flurries per minute is not very helpful because flurry is dependent on the number of swings you made, not on time like procs.  <br />
<br />
I parsed with Flurry2 last night.  I also have ambidexterity and ferocity3 increasing my swings.  This is relevent  because a double or triple attack is required to get a flurry proc.<br />
<br />
My results:<br />
50,537 total weapon swings.<br />
316 flurry procs for 632 swings.<br />
<br />
50,537 - 632 = 49,905 swings without flurries<br />
632 / 49,905 = .01266 or approx. 1.27% more swings<br />
<br />
So for 9 AA points I got a 1.27% increase in number of swings and dps.  Oh boy.  <br />
<br />
The next flurry is 9 more AA.  I don't have the parses, but from what I've heard the offhand weapon dmg boost in GoD AAs would be a better deal for raising dps.  It won't really raise aggro like more swings can, but if flurry is such a tiny upgrade in swings, it doesn't help much either.  <br />
<br />
So anyone have parses for the higher level of flurries that can say what % increase in total swings you get?  I have 197 AA right now and I'm not sure more points spent in flurry is worth it.  Saying, &quot;I have flurry6 and it seems to help a lot&quot; doesn't help.  This upgrade is too minor to just eyeball it and know if its worth it.<br />
<br />
Finally, does anyone have crit hit rate parses showing how much additional benefit CF and Fury of the Ages give?  I have CF3 and FotA1 right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a thread on here some months ago with parses with various dex stats and the percentage of flurries, crits, and procs. Dex did have a positive effect on procs and crits but flurry remained constant (about 1% if I remember). The guy conducting the test had flurry and crit AA maxed - there wasn't any AA to increase proc rate at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why don't you parse the data for your own questions?  Do a long parse with low dex and count flurries/crits, then do a long parse with max dex and count flurries/crits.<br />
<br />
2. Swings are not the same as hits, yet you seem to use them interchangeably for both meanings because the only thing that would affect actual *swings* is haste.<br />
<br />
3. Flurry, at least to the extent of my knowledge 6 months ago (it may have changed), only works on the main hand.  Therefore, ambidexterity would have nothing to do with anything.<br />
<br />
I don't get why people make these posts demanding information without first doing anything appreciable themselves.  If you don't want to spend 9 AA on the next level of Flurry, then don't.  There's numerous levels of Sturdiness and other things to be had that you know exactly what the result is going to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In talking about flurries I don't think I used the word &quot;hit&quot; at all.  Flurries go off on a double/triple attack and give you 2 extra swings.  It has nothing to do with hits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flurry, at least to the extent of my knowledge 6 months ago (it may have changed), only works on the main hand. Therefore, ambidexterity would have nothing to do with anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hadn't thought about that, but it will be easy to check in my parse.  I used a 1hs and a 1hb.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't get why people make these posts demanding information without first doing anything appreciable themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
I posted the log data I have so far.  The information I want might already be out there though without running numerous other logs with different settings.  And without spending the points for more levels of flurry, I have no other way of knowing how good they are.  So I thought I'd ask.  I thought exchanging such information was the main purpose of a stats and skills board.  If that bothers you, well, I don't really care.  Don't read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">found it... <br />

http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=490&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1<br />
<br />
The main poster in this thread had flurry3 and raging flurry 3 plus ferocity3.  Ambidexterity doesn't matter as flurry appears to be mainhand or each attack round effect (you can't flurry twice in one round).  Dexterity doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
It looks like overall the flurries added about 2% more total swings and thus 2% more dps as well.  Given the AA cost of getting all 6 flurry AAs...  wow... lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thread that you linked is flawed because the flurry parses were done with dual wield.  Since the offhand can't dual wield you get a lot of extra attacks that can't have flurries associated with them.  The best way to parse flurry rate is to use a two hander.<br />
<br />
I have flurry 3 fero 3 PB 3 and I parsed one of my logs from last night doing LDoN.  During the fighting I was only using a two handed weapon.<br />
<br />
From the log I had<br />
<br />
Total Attacks 3,959<br />
Total Flurrys: 59<br />
Ripostes: 146<br />
<br />
So to figure out the flurry rate first I removed the riposte attacks from the total number of attacks (since ripostes can't flurry) then I removed the attacks due to flurries from the total attacks (since we are trying to figure out the number of extra attacks that I would have seen without flurry trained)<br />
<br />
This gave me a total of 3,695 attacks with 118 extra attacks due to flurry (59 flurrys * 2).  Or an extra 3.19% swings from having flurry 3 trained.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I believe that if I did not have ferocity or punishing blade trained that the percentage of extra attacks due to flurry would have been higher, but the absolute number of attacks due to flurry would have been the same.  This is because PB and fero increase the average numbers of attacks per round, and flurry can only trigger once per melee round.  So you are increasing the number of attacks without increasing the number of chances to trigger a flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so in other words flurry gives you a higher % increase in total swings and dps if you're using a 2 hander rather than dual wielding?  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't say the parses I linked were flawed, but yes, it should be noted that they are for dual wield.  I parsed a bit myself with dual wield because that's what I usually use.  I wanted to know how much improvement I could expect from flurry with my usual weapon combination.  By the parses linked above, it looks like it's only about 2% more with flurry6 while dual wielding.  For what... 30 AA?  Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Callon,<br />
<br />
What Sulvar is saying is that the original post you had listed attacks using two weapons.  Well, the off hand weapon can never flurry, ever.  So, if you base your numbers off the # of total attacks and do not eliminate the number of off hand swings, then your percentages are off.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
115 main hand swings<br />
50 off hand swings<br />
15 flurries<br />
<br />
If you just go on those numbers you'd say 15 flurries per 165 swings or 10% increase in swings due to flurry.  However, in reality, you should be 15 flurries in 115 attacks.  This put you at 15%.<br />
<br />
If you just use a 2 hander, you eliminate the need to remove the off hand swings.  Of course, if you use 1h blunt and 1h slash (etc) in each hand, you can filter then out easy enough.<br />
<br />
So, according to Sulvar's numbers he sees a 3.19% swing increase for Flurry3.  Perhaps flurry6 is ~6% or so.<br />
<br />
p.s. my numbers above are make believe and just used to illustrate some differences and get the point across.  I did not check any numbers, just made them up on the fly, so please forgive any inaccuracies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Callon I do think that your parses and my parses back up what most have known for a while, though, that flurry gives a higher DPS increase when using two handers than with dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Callon <br />
so in other words flurry gives you a higher % increase in total swings and dps if you're using a 2 hander rather than dual wielding?  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
No, what he is saying is that if you can mask all of the extra attacks you get from your offhand weapon, and from various AAs, then you can expose what flurry is actually doing.  It's better than you think it is, but it doesn't apply to the off hand, or to things like ferocity that also result in extra attacks.  My reading of it if you take all that into account, is that for each ATTACK ROUND you execute with your main hand, each level of flurry gives you a 1% chance of executing a flurry, at 305 dex.<br />
<br />
So, if you havae maxxed flurry AAs, and you could flip a switch and turn off DW and all the other extra attacks, you'd see a 6% gain.  But, when you restore all the other stuff, naturally it will reduce the overall contribution that flurry makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Gnomos that is exactly what I mean.  Flurry is one of the higher cost dps AA skills, but I still like it a lot, something about those &quot;You unleash a flurry of attacks&quot; messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Sulvar is saying is that the original post you had listed attacks using two weapons.

<br />
but the data I'm interested in is how much of an increase in swings and dps I will see with my standard weapon setup (which is dual wielding) by adding more flurry AA.  That's nice that the get the correct flurry &quot;proc&quot; percentage you should only count primary hand.  I understand.  But to know how much of a total increase it is for me, I need to take my current swings and dpswithout flurry, which includes offhand attacks, and then add the flurry in to determine its impact.  According to my parse with flurry2 the impact was 1.27%.  According to some smaller parses on the thread I linked, it was roughly 2% for flurry6 while dual wielding.  At least I'm pretty sure I'm understanding it correctly...<br />
<br />
I understand that removing dual wield and any other offensive AA like ferocity would show a larger % gain from flurry.  Just for my own purposes I was trying to determine what impact adding more of the skill would have on me right now.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the input.  I think I got most of what I wanted.  It's convinced me to hold off on my flurry for now.  I'll get a couple more levels of weapon affinity first, maybe sturdiness 3, sinister strike, and then... hmm... maybe flurry 3 after all that.</div></div><hr />
