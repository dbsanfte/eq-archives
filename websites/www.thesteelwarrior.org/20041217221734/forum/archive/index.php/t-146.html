<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinblade</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, just surfing the web as i was too bored and found this:<br />
<br />
Sarnak Warhammer<br />
1 HB<br />
9/20 <br />
effect:stun<br />
Class: War/Pal/Shd/Mnk/Brd/Rng/Rog/Bst<br />
<br />
I further checked the stun is a 4 sec stun, according to Lucy.<br />
<br />
What most weird this supposedly decent aggro weapon is not sold by anyone, no one mentioned it when we talking about aggro weapon, and those comments in Allka are around 2002.<br />
<br />
I personally use WC/Frosty combo or Greatstaff of Thunder, so no, I am not making a post here then sell this stuff in Bazaar =P<br />
<br />
Just curious on this weapon's performance (aggro wise) and why it is not mentioned alot, am I waaaaaaaaaaay off or do I miss something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a decent taunt weapon just not the best ratio especialy compared to the newer weapons avilible.</div></div><hr />

It's a great weapon, just rare, and generally ignored because of the ratio. I would put it up with FB, new Yaks, and WC in terms of agro.</div></div><hr />

Majority of tier 1 mobs can actually be stunned by it so it is all the more worth it. It might not be flashy or have stats but it has served me well. <br />

Warhammer is not from Chardok, the Sarnak Battlehammer (30/40 2hb) is, warhammer drops in Sebilis disco.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charmazal</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That brings back good memories.  Was a fun weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kebilal</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I used one from level 25 (it doesn't proc till 47) - bought it for 250pp!<br />
<br />
I used it in main hand with a Lammy in off till 52 when I was able to get my hands on a Frosty to replace the Lammy.<br />
<br />
I started tanking in PoP from about 55 onwards (PoI, PoN)  - but the ratio was becoming as issue. Tried a variety of setups with it, but eventually it boiled down to one thing - a 9/20 weapon with no other stats against PoP mobs ain't terribly good. Proc is nice, and I loved that weapon, but it simply became unusable. Around that time I was fortunate enough to get an Anklesmasher on a royals raid, so used that in conjuction with the Frosty ( AS - 10/20 AC4, procs snare).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Started using a Barnacle Covered Axe (9/21, AC 2, Sta 8, SvM 5, proc is &quot;pique&quot; a 50pt DD and +100 to hate) just a bit ago.  <br />
<br />
Damage is... tolerable, but the proc seems to do well by me, don't have any agro issues with pre-PoP mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i currently have the barnacle axe thing, its nice, but what would be better as an offhand at 51 tanking in PoJ (not trials) the barn axe or the warhammer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">warhammer &gt; barnacle for offhand.<br />
<br />
better ratio, and stun aggro owns.  if you really dont know how well stun can keep aggro, go pick up a few Gnoll Hide Lariats (3/20, proc stun) stuff will stick to you like glue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinblade</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the comments guys, looks like it is a good aggro weapon pre PoP /mentalnote.Too bad, as other fella stated above, 9/20 ratio is not enuff for PoP mob, I myself found my WC works very lousy against PoP mobs. <br />
<br />
Keeping aggro and maintaining aggro, to me, are 2 different issues. Just like Sarnak hammer and WC's procs can certainly grab the attention of those bad arse, but the dmg they produce are just too low to keep them hate ya. Well, looks like those no-drop 1 hand weapon with EB/TB are the only solution for DW without losing aggro :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Side question, since someone brought 'em up .. <br />
<br />
Just how high is the proc rate on a gnoll whip, assuming around 200-ish dex?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kebilal</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just on the whole aggro issue here, I use a Frosty/Velium Maul of Superiority combo - I have found that a combo of proc in main and decent DPS in offhand does pretty well in PoP.<br />
<br />
I originally thought the Frosty would be too slow for main, but after trying it a few weeks back, I heartily recommend it.<br />
<br />
I an dead average as far as gear goes (look at sig), and have no plans to do my epic (too much work!).</div></div><hr />

Usually only bring it out when I'm fighting a caster, but I think I'll give it a go.</div></div><hr />
