<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shoulders seem to be one of the harder slots for warriors to fill with a decent item so I figured I would try my hand at picking the top 10 warrior equipable shoulder items. This turned out to be a lot harder than I though because of the unusually low AC that many shoulder items carry. This wasn't much of a problem in the pre-SoL era, but with AC again having importance over the 1200 level, I found that there are quite a few shoulder items that have very good HP, but craptastic AC. For the most part, the only effect that I considered significant in comparison to other effects was Haste since the only high end haste shoulders also have excellent stats, opening up other slots that have considerably better items replacing the common haste gear.<br />
<br />
For the sake of the comparison, I valued set the base value of HP (x1), STA (x3), and AC (x5) then factored in effects to determin the final order. I used a x3 factor on the STA because morst warriors capable of getting these items should be able to easily max STA with buffs. I also gave AC a x5 factor because as many people will point out, AC doesn't stop AEs and all the AC in the world doesn't help when you are out of HPs.<br />
<br />
This is what I came up with:<br />
<br />
1. Shroud of Survival (Time - Inny)<br />
AC: 33<br />
STR: +20 STA: +20 WIS: +10 INT: +10 AGI: +18 HP: +190 MANA: +180<br />
SV COLD: +25 SV MAGIC: +25<br />
Effect: Haste (Worn - 46%)<br />
I chose these for #1 because of the Haste effect. You are not giving up very much in the way of stats to put your haste here, not to mention the extra 5% haste is nice when there are no haste casters around.<br />
<br />
2. Pauldrons of Devastation (Time - RZ)<br />
AC: 45<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +12 STA: +17 WIS: +17 INT: +17 HP: +195 MANA: +175<br />
SV FIRE: +12 SV DISEASE: +12 SV COLD: +12 SV MAGIC: +12 SV POISON: +12<br />
The highest AC and HP available on any shoulders for warriors. Very good stats and good resists. The only thing that kept these off of the top of the list is the lack of a useful effect.<br />
<br />
3. Flowing Moss Mantle (PoEarth - Peregrin Rockskull)<br />
AC: 25<br />
DEX: +18 STA: +20 WIS: +12 INT: +12 AGI: +18 HP: +135 MANA: +125<br />
SV FIRE: +20 SV MAGIC: +20<br />
Effect: Haste (Worn - 41%)<br />
The lack of AC kept these shoulders are the only weak spot on these shoulders. Everything is pretty dead, on - good resists, STA, and HP to go with the effect that really makes these stand out.<br />
<br />
4. Exquisite Phoenix Feather Mantle (PoAir - Xegony)<br />
AC: 20<br />
Skill Mod: Dodge +8%<br />
STR: +20 STA: +15 CHA: +10 WIS: +10 INT: +10 HP: +155 MANA: +125<br />
SV FIRE: +18 SV COLD: +18 SV MAGIC: +18<br />
Required level of 65.<br />
Effect: Vengeance VI (Worn)<br />
The low AC on these hurts, but the effect and skill mod coupled with the excellent stats make them a very good option. Also, the added CHA is a nice bonus that seems to be lacking on most warrior gear.<br />
<br />
5. Puresteel Mantle (PoAir - Melernil Faal`Armanna)<br />
AC: 40<br />
STR: +20 DEX: +15 STA: +15 HP: +135<br />
SV COLD: +20 SV MAGIC: +20 SV POISON: +10<br />
Effect: Shield of Pain (Any Slot/Can Equip, Casting Time: 5.0)<br />
Excellent AC and warrior stats on a warrior only item. Surely a mistake, but who am I to complain. This beat out a few other very nice items due to the 2nd best AC available on shoulders and the resists. Had these had a better effect, I would have placed them above the Xegony shoulders.<br />
<br />
6. Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads (PoWater - Coirnav)<br />
AC: 31<br />
STR: +25 STA: +15 WIS: +12 INT: +12 AGI: +20 HP: +140 MANA: +155<br />
SV FIRE: +25 SV MAGIC: +10<br />
Wind Instrument<br />
Effect: Aura of Daring (Worn)<br />
Focus: Preservation of Solusek<br />
These shoulders are much better suited for a hybrid, particularly bards due to the wind intrument classification. They are still great warrior gear with very good AC and HP. I would however pass on these unless no hybrids need them as they are much better for other classes.<br />
<br />
7. Ensorcelled Metalcloth Cape (PoAir - Avatar of Wind)<br />
AC: 20<br />
STR: +25 STA: +25 WIS: +15 INT: +15 HP: +140 MANA: +100<br />
SV FIRE: +15 SV DISEASE: +15 SV COLD: +15 SV MAGIC: +15<br />
Great stats, great resists, crappy AC and no effect. These could have been a top choice but the lack of effect kills them compared to others ranked higher.<br />
<br />
8. Pauldrons of Seething Darkness (VT - DXVT)<br />
AC: 35<br />
DEX: +10 STA: +15 WIS: +10 INT: +10 AGI: +10 HP: +85 MANA: +85<br />
SV FIRE: +15 SV DISEASE: +10 SV POISON: +10<br />
Effect: Vengeance IV (Worn)<br />
The low HP holds these shoulders back. Excellent AC and resists make them a very good option still and the Vengeance is an added bonus.<br />
<br />
9. Spiked Shoulderpads (VT - Aten goo)<br />
AC: 30<br />
DEX: +15 CHA: +15 AGI: +15 HP: +90 MANA: +90<br />
SV FIRE: +10 SV DISEASE: +10 SV COLD: +10 SV MAGIC: +10 SV POISON: +10<br />
Effect: Vengeance III (Worn)<br />
Again these are excellent across the board except for the lowish HP. Great AC and resists with the bonus CHA and a decent effect. A few more HP would have moved these up the list.<br />
<br />
10. Viik's Pauldron's of Pain (ToV - Vulak)<br />
AC: 38<br />
STR: +15 STA: +10 HP: +75<br />
SV FIRE: +12 SV DISEASE: +12 SV COLD: +12 SV MAGIC: +12 SV POISON: +12<br />
Amazing AC and great resists, but the low HP and lack of effect are big drawbacks.<br />
<br />
Honorable mention:<br />
Yttrium Studded Mantle (no effect - great stats), Shroud of Vigor (crappy AC and effect, good HP and resist), Chitin Shoulders of Decay (good AC and a decent effect, no resists and lowish HP) are all nice options but each has enough lacking to keep them off the list. Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates, Spirit Wracked Cord, and Strength of the Elements deserve mention because they can be obtained by just about anyone with a few friends. There are several other good options (Spiked Skull Shoulderpads, Resplendent Epaulets, Platoon Leaders Pauldrons) but their insanely low AC make them a much worse choice anywhere that the AC softcap doesn't apply.</div></div><hr />

Using your formula (unless I made a mistake) these come out ahead of Vulak shoulders, 320 to 295. I didn't check the results for any of the other shoulders (too lazy) on your list. AC is pretty good, saves are better than any of the other shoulders on the list, and the HPs aren't too low except compared to the very top stuff. The only other downside would be the lack of an effect.</div></div><hr />
