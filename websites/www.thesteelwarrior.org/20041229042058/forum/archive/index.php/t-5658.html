Wrait Chimera tells you, 'A fine donation!  You'll receive 13644 favor for that Weighty Polearm.'<br />
<br />
Weighty Polearms sell for almost nothing in the bazaar. Well, they did until people read this post. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bazaar prices are higher(inflation), because of more money in the economy due to exploits, duping, etc.<br />
<br />
The casino is a good implimentation because it actually takes money out of the economy.<br />
<br />
However, the entire concept of the tribute system shifted the demand curve to the right(increased it) immensly for droppable (AKA bazaar items) where acquiring those items is easy and reward is greater than its utility....weighty polearms etc.<br />
<br />
Before GoD went live I was actually hoping the tribute system worked also for no drop items. I have tons of no drop items that I have parked in the bank. I plan to see what endurance values they receive before I hit the delete button though.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see how long takes them to figure a solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How often do we see guilds, groups and even individuals now Farming dragons and other lesser contect to get droppable loot and making huge profits from it, while high end raiders continue to bank Elemental Planes gear, Early Pop gear, Vex Thal gear ect ect ect and received nothing.<br />
<br />
The tribute system would be a natural way to fix this by letting raiders do something besides take up bank space with their well earned gear.  Nothing would be more fair  (this side of removing the no drop tags over time)  than to let people trade in their no drop gear.</div></div><hr />

Yah.  Between the casino and the tribute system (as implemented), it seemed apparent that this was going to have a significant impact on the in-game economy. <br />
<br />
It's just that it seemed like sort of a grenade-in-the-pond approach.  i.e.  let's see what turns belly up after this. <br />
<br />
I was surprised; and not surprised that they put the brakes on both changes so quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
Heard two unsubstantiated rumors about the changes; first was that there was another cheapo item that worked in the casino the way bat wings did last time (i.e. turn in 1sp batwings instead of 100pp casino tokens).  The second was that the tribute folks had a bug that allowed insane HP (other?) increases by quickly upgrading then downgrading.  Both bugs quite worthy of GM /kills imho.  I'd imagine they weren't happy about the turn in cost for some items either...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tribute was probably more because of the 15000 tribute points gained for a milk, or the 1K for a fishing grub or thousands for some cheap tinkered item. Some folks farmed millions of tribute points for a few hundred plat or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monotonous</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason SOE continues to release patches without any proper testing.  They need to hire a couple of people to perform some model-based testing, and directed ad-hoc testing, and write some damn automation.<br />
<br />
You cannot rely on people playing the game to be testers.  I know you are able to create some simple automated scripts that check every item in the game vs tribute it would receive, and generate a cost to create vs tribute ratio and then compare that to whatever you decided was the ratio you wanted.<br />
<br />
Same with the casino...<br />
<br />
With today's testing technologies there is no reason any of these patches should have the problems they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a saying from government military contractors: “I can build it fast, cheep and well, pick only 2.”<br />
<br />
They tried to cut costs and use a bad method to pick tribute values, would you rather it cost triple the cost or more or take way longer to get it? While I agree they should have seen this coming they are doing an ok job considering this is one of is not the most complex game in existence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that it's the most complicated game in existence does not excuse poor testing, poorly thought out design, or poor implementation.  Quite the oppositte.  The level of complexity means that it's both harder and more important to test thoroughly.<br />
<br />
Taking the tribute system as an example.  The system is now broken and the only possible fixes will be painful.  Those that used exploits to jack up their points have an enormous advantage over everyone else.  This is made worse by the fact that while nobody else can turn in any items for points, those that did it before they came down are running around with full tribute points.  The only solution to the problem is to strip everyone down to zero tribute points, and you can imagine the outcry that will cause from players that spent their hard earned cash on their tribute points instead of exploiting them.  This is essentialy unfixable without causing a huge amount of grief from the player base.  Was it preventable?  Yes, rather easily.  It would have cost SONY some money and some time before the release of GoD.  Now it's going to cost them the goodwill of many of their players.<br />
<br />
I'm not a SONY hater.  I'm not one of the people that runs around saying just wait until game XXXX comes out, eq will die.  I'll probably play EQ for as long as it continues to be supported.  It just pains me to see them do stuff like this is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There actually tons of economics graduate students they could utilize for this.  <br />
<br />
This release is an abdomination from a QA perspective; 2 major pieces of new functionality (tribute and casino) are now offline.  Reports have it that some of the AA skills (triple BS in particular) are fooked.  Not SoE's shining hour</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mytemo</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate to sound like a paranoid conspiracy theorist, but I am thinking perhaps this snafoo with the tribute system was planned.  If it wasnt, then it was a genious stroke of luck on SOE's part.<br />
<br />
Think about this...what better way to reduce the cluttered databases from both cash and items with a 'bug' such as this.  The system will be corrected and all those old items will no longer be in game, nor the cash many players used to buy some of the tribute items from NPC vendors.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see how the economy stabalizes once this is settled.</div></div><hr />
