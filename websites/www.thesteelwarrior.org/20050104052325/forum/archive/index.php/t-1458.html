I would try to do the shoulder quest out of SS (where you kill the 4 dragon hunters in ww) 15 ac 12 str 12 sta 6 cold, 6 fire, and you cant beat the price.<br />
<br />
I would also replace wrists, mask, guantlets, possibly arms.  I definitely would be working on these long before replacing your earrings or going for BoC, but thats just me.  Probably your next step is to try to get your hands on some thurg armor, and go that route.</div></div><hr />

Get ally with CoV, ditch both bracers and get bracers of benevolence by doing the quest.  Get draconic pauldrons by doing the quest.  New gloves, buy a SS plate gloves MQ.  Neck is alright buy could be replaced by clattering bone necklace.  Get crystal spiders eyes for your face piece or for a little more darkmetal visor or if you have even more the grimling contraption mask(forgetting real name, has aura of health on it)  Ditch the monk arms hehe and buy a SS plate vambraces MQ, same for boots, your AC is lacking if anything.  Cobalt bp is good unless you want to throw down the cash for a SS bp MQ or if your guild is doing ssra they should be able to take down vindi I'm guessing.  If you want more hp while not peeling or pulling with a bow buy an idol of thorned or goranga idol.</div></div><hr />
