<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello. I have a level 57 enchanter and level 60 shaman that I've been 3-boxing with my monk. I'm getting tired of the monk, because he can't hold agro at all. So I'm ready to make a switch, and need your advice.<br />
<br />
I've got a level 56 warrior and level 47 shadowknight, but I haven't played either character in probably a year, so I'm not exactly up to speed on class changes. My question is this: in a 3-box trio with an enchanter and a shaman, which character makes the most sense?<br />
<br />
I won't be raiding, just mostly 3-boxing or maybe joining some exp groups/LDoNs (as a single - won't 2 or 3-box an LDoN). The problem with my monk is that he can't generate enough agro. When my shaman throws a slow and even a single DoT, agro switches and I usually don't get it back. I've got some good gear on my shaman, so it's not a huge problem now, but it will only get worse as I fight tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
So I need a tank that can hold agro and still put out some decent DPS. With good agro, my shaman can generate very decent DPS via his stackable DOTs and dogdog. With the enchanter, I can handle adds without too much problem, and can lull/pacify, so pulling isn't a huge issue. I don't charm with the enchanter, so he doesn't really do much for DPS right now.<br />
<br />
I just haven't played either the warrior or shadowknight in so long that I don't know which character makes more sense. I know warriors got an upgrade to their taunt, but have no idea how effective it is compared to SK spells. I also don't know which character will put out higher DPS - I assume the SK would with a lot of spells, but casting lots of spells is tricky while 3-boxing, especially with a constantly-canni-ing shaman. <br />
<br />
So I'm leaning toward the warrior, but don't really want to jump back into that if the SK is a far superior option. On the shaman crucible, the consensus there is that SKs make the best partner for a shaman, but that opinion may have been formed prior to the recent warrior taunt upgrade. With the enchanter (have clarity II now at level 57), my SK would probably always have mana, so maybe that option makes more sense.  I have some decent gear on warrior already, and have about 60k in the bank, so I could probably score a CHoS/Bloodsworn combo for agro - unless there's a better option.  I've already got a Greatstaff of Thunder for 2hb agro.<br />
<br />
Any advice or similar experience you coud give would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go with SK. You'll have less management for agro holding, thus giving you more time to focus on the other characters, so you won't be so overworked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The opinion that SK make a better partner doesnt have as much to do with aggro/taunt as it does with utility.  SK's are better pullers, can snare, can group mana tap/buff, etc.  The reason they're better to partner with a shaman is all that &quot;useless&quot; utility in their spellbooks. :)<br />
Warriors are still a little better at taking a beating and their aggro is adequate for all but the most retarded of overnuker/slowers, so for really hard mobs warriors are still a little more durable, but if you're 3 boxing, odds are you probably won't want to push the envelope of safety more than you have to anyway.<br />
Play wichever appeals to you the most, ultimately they're pretty well balanced these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zeeko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your intent is to mostly 3 box then the SK utility spells will help you a lot more.  The snare/FD are nice.<br />
If your intent is to usually grab some pickup person(s) or guild member(s), then I would go with a warrior.  A warrior is going to be able to tank tougher mobs and nameds much earlier then an SK with equivalent aa/equip.  With the Enchanter there you can pacify pull or pull-mez and you can work around the snaring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I'd go SK.<br />
<br />
Mainly because utility &gt; defensive in small group situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">depens how good you are at 3 boxing.<br />
If you want to hit auto attack on tank and thats that then warrior.<br />
If you are very dexterious with 3 boxing then SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would have to go with SK.  They can do the things your Shammie cannot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SK is a frame of mind, if you have to ask, play the Coffee Maker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What do you use to 3box? KVM switch? 3 computers? EQ windows? Any of these ways I would go with an SK. A lot less switching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In that situation I'd go with the SK.  When I 2 box my shaman (warrior here), I have to wait on the dots to avoid agro.  This seriously reduces his dps.  With an SK you don't have to wait.<br />
<br />
The downside is, if you get that overpull you don't have the Defensive option to bail you out...but with an enchie there you should still be ok.  (and the SK can FD on the pull if it looks bad)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use three computers.  Two are quite old, and have nothing installed except EQ.  Even an older machine with a fresh install of Win 98 will run EQ fairly well with the textures turned down, sound off, and spell effects off.  I have them all arranged in such a way that I can see all three monitors at once, I keep one keyboard on my lap and have the other two on a table in front of me.  It works out fairly well - most of what I do is either macro-keys or straight hotkeys, so most of my attention can focus on the main character - usually a melee type who needs to stay in range.<br />
<br />
I fired up my old shadowknight last night.  He's only level 47, so the level difference is going to be difficult for a while.  But it seemed to be working out ok.  I pulled with clinging darkness, and if it stuck I had time to throw another on before the mob hit camp.<br />
<br />
Once I engage in melee, I have a macro on my shaman to target the shadowknight, assist him, tell my pet to attack, and cast slow.  Even with my monk, at level 58, I'd occasionally get agro just from the slow and sending in the pet.  With my monk, the minute I cast the shaman dot Bane of Nife, agro would switch to the shaman and I'd likely not get it back.  <br />
<br />
Last night, with a level 47 shadowknight (11 levels lower), I never once got agro from slow.  I would be chaining CD on the sk while waiting for slow, and would then immediately cast BoN on the shaman.  If I'd gotten off 3 CDs by then, I wouldn't get agro.  After about 10 pulls, I had it figured out and could sit immediately after the BoN (or canni-dance).  It worked quite nicely.  3 CDs was enough to pretty much guarantee agro throughout the battle.  My enchanter can cast his stunning nuke (can't remember the name) without fear of agro.  My shaman can canni-dance right in front of the mob, without getting agro.  It was quite nice.  <br />
<br />
And, because I had C2 all night, my sk never got below 80% mana.  I could chain CD and my little lifetap all I wanted without problem.  <br />
<br />
My gear is ok for my level - mostly cultural (I'm a Cazic-Thule worshipping ogre, so it's fulvous darkscale for me).  A good old sceptre of lightning for 1500p in the bazaar, and I'm good to go.  I have a diseased greatstaff for 2hb - I don't understand why that weapon is so cheap.  It's quite nice and is a fraction of the cost of a windblade or war marshal's bladed staff - I think I paid about 2000p for it.  Anyway, it was great fun.  <br />
<br />
I can't wait to see how things work out when I get a few levels on the sk.  Right now the mobs I was fighting were right around my level - some db, white, and yellow.  They're all db to my level 61 shaman.  When my sk gets a little higher, he should be able to generate more dps and agro, resist more spells, and things should really start to click.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice and opinions.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With my warrior I at times lose aggro to the shaman not usually after the first slow, but often if it is followed up by a dot.  I can usually get it back quickly, but if I were boxing three chars, it would be a pain.  I'd have to hold back more with the shaman.  I also have to use my silken whip to snare at times which reduces my dps and aggro in comparison to my other weapons, at least until it procs and I can swap it out.  I almost wish I had played an SK.  But I like the fact that I can dual wield and that I can take a beating quite a bit better than an SK, especially taking disciplines into account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AThousandYoung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your SK is low level.  That creates massive aggro no? Even when he catches up he should still be able to hold aggro though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lower level = bigger agro range<br />
not more agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I personally run a team of 6 chars.  Its not easy, takes alot of getting used to, but its nice to always have it there when i need it.<br />
<br />
Personally i recommend warrior, which is what i use.  I scrapped my paladin for warrior just due to the fact that warriors are better at taking damage - period.  With good weapons and knowing my own slow times etc, aggro is not an issue.  With the new aggro discs, aggro procs, and nice weapons its not too difficult to keep up on aggro.<br />
<br />
With this setup i can take down mobs that i could not with my paladin - i dont raid much with my warrior, so buyable or two groupable items are the best hes going to see - with defensive he can stretch those hp alot farther then a paladin with fewer hp ever could.<br />
<br />
Now i would imagine an SK would have higher damage output, but i dont think it should be taken as strong enough of a difference either way to make your choice - a tank is a tank, not a dps class. Overall i dont think that will make all that much of a difference.  The dps classes in whatever group you are in are goign to do the LARGE bulk of the damage, and if your using a tank alone to kill mobs it will take you forever either way. So i woudl say, make your choice based on defensive/aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
Sk's will have faster instant aggro - aka faster slows/nukes.<br />
If you want the utility, and are just looking to have a tank for normal exp group - go sk.<br />
<br />
Warrior will take the hits better, and eat up less cleric mana(forget not Defensive/Stonewall).<br />
If you want to be able to tackle larger mobs easily without getting raid quality gear, go warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">with a shaman as primary healer it doesn't matter how many hp the tank has as long as it's enough to tank the mobs efficiently.  I'd have gone SK as well.</div></div><hr />
