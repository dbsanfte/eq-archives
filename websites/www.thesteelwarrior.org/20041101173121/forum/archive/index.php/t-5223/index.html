<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My AC is not hurting all that bad, but I feel that it should be higher. I have plans to get a Tak BP and an LDoN haste cloak as well as a 10ac aug for my neck, but I am at a loss where else I can look for high AC items. I really don't think I will find much in the bazaar and I would rather not have to get a bunch of 10ac aug if I can just get better items. Any ideas on stuff I can get with small raids or single groups?<br />
<br />
Before anyone suggests ToV quests, it is too much trouble since Doze is perma dead and I would rather not do the faction again (ally giants). Here is what I have planned for know, any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same problem as me ( before i got my BoW I think i was 1350-1360 AC~, same aa's as you )<br />
<br />
only mask i can think of that can be augmented pretty decently is Mask of Venom from ToVN_land ( easily 2 groupable that is ), with a cheap augment I got a 19AC 85something HP's + resists mask. it's on my magelo profile. with a 10Ac aug it has some nice potential pre-VT level gear.<br />
<br />
than there's always more aa's.<br />
<br />
1383 tho...it's really not too bad. I know most of your guild's warriors are at 2K(+) but 1383 ain't bad at all for having the gear you got..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Get Moordian Invited to a PoF raid and camp him at 1st Castle<br />
And farm the Shit out of 1st castle to get the range there, this<br />
should be very easy with people AAing for GoD.<br />
(Got a 55 paladin all fire items exept C2 ones)<br />
<br />
Ac28 hp100<br />
<br />
2) Do the Katta &quot;Loyalist Shield of Honor&quot; Quest <br />
<br />
Ac50 hp75<br />
<br />
3) Work on the LDoN haste belt<br />
(Dont remember the combo/stats but its the same as yours with haste)<br />
<br />
Gonna try and think of some other stuff.<br />
The neck has to go for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: NECK  <br />
AC: 11<br />
STR: +15  DEX: +10  STA: +16  AGI: +10  <br />
HP: +85  MANA: +65  <br />
Recommended level of 56.<br />

Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD MNK BRD ROG BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
Slot 1, type 7: Flawless Yellow Sphere of Fortitude<br />
<br />
The black plated cooler is a good neck item (its droppable), might be one group or more farmable in Tactics (low level waaay in the back).<br />
<br />
Our AC is close... although you have 1000HP on me. Not really a lot you can buy that is much better... I see you will cap STA when you cast heath whereas I will get more benifit from mine when I cast it so you have like 700HP on me... <br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think there is much better non raid level gear avalible... Just LDoN, not even good items on hard setting...<br />
<br />
<br />
I would get the ornate BP for the Shield effect... With virute, self sheild and self health I have 1680HP and 1493AC...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are pretty rare, but I was able to pick up a Thulian Visage of Horror in the bazaar or you can try the CT quest. It's 30ac 100hp which is about as good as you can find without raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Opps. Posted my actual magelo, meant to post the goal until I can figure out some other upgrades. With an LDoN haste cloak, Tak BP, and 10ac aug on my neck I end up around 1450ish.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=460039&amp;alt=120394<br />
<br />
I like the PoF idea. Should be able to get the range and the cloak pretty easy with all the AA farming going on. I've been watching for a black plated collar and a thulian visage for a while, but apparently those items are not finding their way in to the bazaar on Terris. Some good ideas though, keep em coming.<br />
<br />
And /rude Shik!<br />
<br />
er ... I mean grats on the BoW ;) I would like to get around 1500ac unbuffed, guess we'll see how lucky I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i've been looking for that black plated collar too; wearing Zland necklace as an upgrade instead of a ST key is killing me :(<br />
<br />
i saw a few masks of the dragonslayer(s) going for 40K in the bazaar tho...there were 2 there last night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well did some searching.<br />
<br />
 Katta Shield/Cloack = AC60 Hp75<br />
(Long quest, MM 510 Ac)<br />
<br />
LDoN Belt =  25AC 80Hp 36%  <br />
(Guk 1492 Belt, MM 510 Ac, Someplace 1150 20hp, MM 1150 Haste)<br />
<br />
Total   AC85 hp155 36%  for 4812 Points <br />
<br />
Your combo is :<br />
<br />
 Rubicite Belt = 35ac 85hp<br />
(CT belt &amp; MM 510ac)<br />
<br />
LDoN  Cloack : Ac24 hp100 36%<br />
(Somplace 1492 Cloack,  MM 510 Ac, Someplace 1150 20hp, MM 1150 Haste)<br />
<br />
Total : 59ac 185hp 36% for 4812 points <br />
<br />
Both seem balanced, exept that the one with Katta shield is<br />
a long &amp; boring quest (camping if i recall).<br />
<br />
Arent there any possible outside LDoN haste ?<br />
(You could gank Yelinak for the Gloves no ?)<br />
<br />
Because if you can use Katta Cloack &amp; Rubi Belt &amp; PoF range.<br />
Your AC will skyrocket.<br />
<br />
Doomshade drops an ac3 hp25 41% earring.<br />
Of course it sucks compared to Bloodmetal.<br />
<br />
But frees up the cloack for Katta one (which rocks)<br />
And saves you about 4300 AP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bloodmetal Earring: Ac7 hp75<br />
<br />
LDoN  Cloack : Ac24 hp100 36%<br />
(Somplace 1492 Cloack,  MM 510 Ac, Someplace 1150 20hp, MM 1150 Haste)<br />
<br />
Total = Ac31 hp175  36% for  4812 Points <br />
<br />
<br />
Doomshade Earring : Ac3 hp25  41%<br />
<br />
Katta Shield/Cloack : Ac60 hp75<br />
(Katta Loyalist Shield of Honor, MM 510 ac)<br />
 <br />
Total : Ac63 hp100 41% for 510 points <br />
<br />
Now if these 4300AP are worth 75hp for you, would be a good choice.<br />
And they should be since its 4x40hp augments.<br />
<br />
(I farmed DS for some EP Monk recruits, so we could full EP them<br />
and use 41% hastes with minimal stat lost)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's the Haste necklace (40% I think) from the POI dragon ... forgot the name of it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dunno if he's 1 groupable with Time Gear, Same for Yelinak :)<br />
<br />
Ac8 hp50 41% Xanamech Necklace<br />
Ac8 hp40 41% Yelinak Talisman<br />
Ac30 hp75 41% Yelinak Gloves<br />
<br />
DS is a pushover with 1 Time group &amp; a decent puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess I am going to have to suck it up and look in to doing the Loyalist shield quest. 50ac on your back is hard to pass up. I went ahead and got 4x 10ac augs last night, that helped a lot so I am getting closer. A few more APs and I can get the LDoN BP too which will be a 24ac upgrade over Vindi. Thanks for the suggestions! Keep em coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">xanamech should be easily one groupable even before time...the choker is one of the more rare drops, unfortunately, so you might have to drag people back multiple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you haven't bought the cloak yet, you may want to look into doing some Hard Miragul's adventures. The haste cloak from there is 17ac 90hp 36% haste. You'd gain 3ac and lose 10hp over the Tak cloak, but you save 4k points. They were pretty common for my group, we got 4 in 10 adventures.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if it is worth it since you already have an augmented GBoS, but the Loathsome Bludgeon of Depravity is 15/20 25ac 100hp. I use BoC/Bludegon both with anger 3 and it is more than enough aggro and a nice AC boost.</div></div><hr />
