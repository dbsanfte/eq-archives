<br />
ok for the slow let me state this one more time there was a minor stealth nerf in the patch. the stuns that had the 55 cap previous would stun mobs 55 and below actually stun them aka interupt a caster the non movement ones. Now toes same stuns do not stun a 55 mob only 54 and below so in effect they lost one effective level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well in chardok I use stun and holy might and force since they cost less mana and the mobs I fight when expin aa there are level 55 so this has impact the above statement is false. to the 65 pally this has little impact.<br />
<br />
[quote]or thunder of karana<br />
<br />
that made me chuckle as ToK reduces mana by 100 and has no stun component and very very little hate assosiated with it.<br />

How grand.. No one gives a crap.. How about this, Step up here so I can go to town on you with the Joe Pessci endorsed nerf bat? How about lets say, We drop your mitigation down 30%  So those BoT yard trash hit for 700+ on Hybrids? <br />
<br />
Now thats a nerf, Acting like a gimp whom couldnt make it to the shortbus for school everyday then saying you want a prize for it wont earn you kudo's here.<br />
<br />
Dont expect love here for your paladin self. That what bards are for, go be gay with them. Here you'll find the steel toed boot to readily be applied to your ass should you need it. <br />

If hybrids wanna tank go for it,  But if sony ever asked me for what I would do to em, You boy's and girl's would be on chain class mitigation.<br />

Personally I think cease (level 9 spell) shouldn't be able to stun anything over level 30, and if cast on anything over level 30 should net 0 aggro. Basically stuns should have scaled in regards to what level of mob they can effect, and how much hate they could induce. I also think that lower level stuns such as cease and desist should have around a 1 minute refresh, and that higher level stuns should have scaled down from there. Seeing level 60 paladins using level 9 and 15 spells over their higher level stuns because the higher level stuns give no advantage and cost more mana is just wrong. I know this will make me very unpopular over at Paladins of Norrath, but I really couldnt give a shit.

If I was looking for a nice pat on the back and a brownie point I would have gone to the PoN boards :p<br />
<br />
What I do find kind of interesting is that on PoN you have pallys saying they need upgrades to epic/disc/ect on SW you have wars saying pallys are too overpowerd and nerf them or make us better then them yada yada I have yet to figure out who is right and I prolly never will hehe sorry just strikes me kinda funny.<br />

umm you just gety off the short bus? get back on it and go back to PoN the nerf was minimal all that hcanges is the pre 50 stuns will no longer actually stun a 55 mob only 54 and loer now we lsot one effective level nothing big, you can still cast them on 55 and above mobs and get aggro.<br />
<br />
I had originally posted this to make some wars happy that have the big h8 for pallys but it had the reverse effect (which I did not expect) apperently warriors wont be happy untill the big ass nerf bat hit's pally's or SoE hand's each and every 65 and below non uder warrior the best equip and tons of HP and some new gimick. anywhoo carry on this thread is dead sorry to get your panties in a bunch warriors.

I wasn't particularly bothered at that until you made the sweeping generalisation that anybody who didn't react positively to a 1 level 'nerf' on stuns is just a whiney biznatch. Your poor presentation of it caused some of the more 'hair triggered' folks to fly off the handle, agreed.  Why that should be a surprise I'm not sure :)<br />
