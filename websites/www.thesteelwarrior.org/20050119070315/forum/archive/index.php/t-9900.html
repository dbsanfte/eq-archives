<br />
I'm planning on putting HP Augments in the other slots, but what should i put in the type3? AoB? Regen5? Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless you really want to fill that slot badly, I'd say nothing.  Other tak armors may not be as big an upgrade, but you'd still get more use out of another piece of armor than a slot 3 aug, especially if you're looking at paying something like 1150+ for an aug.   The only tak upgrade that wouldn't be an upgrade is helm, and bracer looks like the most likely choice for a second piece, since even if you're looking for oow upgrades, it will take a while to get two, plus you may come across an all type HP aug to put in the slot3 eventually.   Although looking at your magelo, upgrading those anger2s is probably your best bet after the BP (or even before.)<br />
<br />
Any effect you put in that slot is going to be minor and a marginal help, so it's really whatever you feel like you need the most.  If you really don't see a need for more tak armor at all, and you want to spend the points on a type3 aug, vengeance is probably your best bet, unless you need an effect like see invis or EB.  Yeah, people might tell you that attack doesn't help that much, but unlike regen it's pretty much always helping you (i.e even when youre at full health or when heals are so quick that the regen doesnt come into play.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I have used anger2, long ago, when you couldn't remove augments and reuse them, I put an anger2 in my offhand on a weapon I didn't hope to keep around too long; I eventually sold it back and bough another anger3 when they implemented removing augments.  <br />
<br />
I really don't see what your point is or what it is you're getting at, you asked for suggestions, I gave them.  As far as AC goes, putting some effect aug in your future BP's slot three won't give you any more AC than anger3 will, and less AC than the other tak armors I suggested.  If you think your agro is trivial, great, but regen of AoB in your slot3 still won't help you any more than added agro will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my point is i asked for Bp advice. in the zones i'm tanking right now (not even in mpg yet much) agro is not an issue for me. since augments are removabale and resellable now i do plan on replacing them (as i posted above). I'm probably going to try to build a 200hp bp out of it, screw the effect. its an ac14 upgrade immediately, and i can farm/buy the other augs easily enough i guess. Oh, and i have some time/qivc+ friends helping me get oow armor bits so im not all that worried about anything but bp/legs.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And my point is, it's not worth spending points on effect augs unless you already have all that OoW armor - that's my adive on the BP.  Like you said, you can get points refended, buy some armor and trade it in for effect augs eventually if you reach a point where they're they only things you need.  As it stands, they aren't the only thing you need, and effect augs are a long ways from being worth it.</div></div><hr />

the Tipt mobs have very low HP thus a group can kill them in few seconds (by the time furious drop).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sucana</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought angerII was great, but I needed more agro when the level went up.  If I had to do it over, I would go for angerIII, a full set of AC10 augments, and use an ornate BP.  I still love the nro bp, but I'd prefer the clicky on the ornate BP, because if I have a shaman around, I really don't need to worry about my defensive setup too much anyway.  (However, if you can get those augments to drop in tipt, go with Yoda's setup.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mashor Dabashor</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other option for your slot 3 is an Enduring Breath aug out of the Guk camp in South Ro.  Costs around 300 points and eliminates the need to switch out a high ac/hp item for some crap EB item when you are raiding or doing exp in an airless zone.  <br />
<br />
The augs out of Tipt are a great suggestion though and I would recommend having both the 30/30 type augs and making your friends happy with free 2flowing though/2regen augs and 10attack/2regen augs.  All of these can be used in any slot and any type.  If you are careful you can single pull all the way to the queen area where 6 mini cragbeasts spawn. Clear them and when the sixth dies the Enraged Maternal Cragbeast spawns and charges the group.  Can use ripost disc or defensive/stonewall.  Hits hard but dies fairly fast.  At 65 we'd farm this with a group of 4-6 for augs and we'd make close to an AA getting to her.</div></div><hr />
