Oh yeah, we needed to give casters 4+ spells each that they could do without while warriors are working with half-effective bandaids.  Yeah the separated disc timers was a huge step forward, but personally I have trouble chaining 2 discs without running OOE half way through the 2nd.  +end on items would/will be a huge boon that was neglected yet again.

<br />
Exactly.  Why waste the effort creating them if they don't add much to the game?  +end itemization would help warriors a good deal.  <br />
<br />
My point is not to whine about pallies, but to question where part 2 of balancing is.  It was promised (to my recollection) in the Feb 10th patch separate from GoD.  Where is it?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I thought that the Live team was separate from the expansion team.  Granted I'm recently back from a long, long break  so my memory is rusty and/or outdated.  And I would think the Live team would be doing balancing while the expansion peeps would be fixing GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was about to post myself about the endurance on GoD items only and nothing on previous items. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its cool to have some developers browsing these boards and replying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally I have trouble chaining 2 discs without running OOE half way through the 2nd. +end on items would/will be a huge boon that was neglected yet again. Cheers SOE!<br />
<br />
You're level 54, you don't need to actively chain discs.  Also, the endurance was not made unlimited for a reason, it's so people have restrictions.  I don't hear wizards complaining because they can't chian nuke indefinatley.  <br />
<br />
So stop whining, you're supposed to go &quot;OOE&quot; if you use multiple discs in succession, it will make you think before you start chaining discs that you don't even need to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also<br />
<br />
+end itemization would help warriors a good deal.<br />
<br />
If by good deal, you mean just a little bit, then you're correct.  I only run out of endurance if I use spirit of rage followed by defensive/evasive and actively chain incite, or when doing long long fights like emperor ssra.  99% of the time, I use two discs, Fortitude then Devensive or Evasive, depending on the situation.  After a fight like that, I'll still have 20% or so endurance left over.<br />
<br />
So adding mass amounts of endurance to all the items is only really going to let everyone chain all of the different types of discs in a sigle battle, which is completely unneccessary.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />
<br />
o, an edit:<br />
<br />
mobs in GoD probably have AEs and spells that take away endurance, thus totally voiding my point in that situation. Oh well, my point still holds pre-GoD :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with Frodlin--why is everyone so quick to thank SOE for neglecting an important game mechanic on the simple promise that it is the &quot;first on the list&quot;?  <br />
<br />
Mostly because it's the fucking status quo with SoE.  They can't get shit done when they say they're gonna get it done, mostly because they're too stupid to withhold date.<br />
<br />
However, I'm happy as fuck when game developers take the time to do things right.  WoW being a prime example.  I don't care how the fuck long it stays in development, as long as when it comes out, the game is bug free.  I can't really bitch at them for NOT doing something their normal halfassed way.  <br />
<br />
I also understand their main priority is expansions and always has been.  They don't give a flying fucking shit about game balance, and everyone around here knows it.  The only reason we got incite and unhooked discs was because some guy worked thru his lunch hour one day.  There just comes a time when you get too fucking sick of their bullshit to even call it on them anymore.  That's a bad sign for a company, but a good sign for me, because I'm starting to feel indifferent towards this game and even tho I've taken extended breaks on EQ before, I still thought the game had potential.  Now I don't.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, I'm waiting for Haass to come put the smackdown on my forum noobie butt. <br />
<br />
Pff, if I actually had the willpower to bitch about them, I'd be saying the exact same things you are.  Well, aside from that whole bitching about running out of endurance thing, but everyone gets one mistake :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly doubt the first melee changes came about over lunch, Haass.  I'm a developer myself, and I'd imagine that the effort involved in conception, design, coordination, execution, and testing of these features probably spanned a couple of months, and involved 5-10 people if not more.  You'd probably be surprised at how much effort goes into even the seemingly smallest thing when you work in a large software company.  You wouldn't believe the number of times I've been given a day to work on something that turned out to take weeks or months, simply because a manager thought &quot;Hey, this'd be easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Walk a mile in their shoes before you come here telling them that they're lazy, incompetant idiots.<br />

Now, if you're talking about The Vision(c)(tm), then rant on... there's no excusing some of the blunders that have been made in the planning stages of this game, but that's a whole different kettle of fish.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I think I'd be more devastated if my character got deleted than if someone stole my TV (and it's a good TV, heh)... I've just put so much into the lil tyke.<br />
<br />
Key point, in my opinion, is that it does us no good to bash the guy who comes here to give us answers to our questions.  Where's our +End items?  Coming soon.  Fair enuf.  If they don't come soon?  Go ahead and call him on it.</div></div><hr />

Thats the least they owe to us, or is it a bait to get warriors and paladins and sk's to run amuck and beta test GoD and try to get gear?<br />

Dont give us a &quot;Hey its on the top of the list&quot; <br />
Which list? This months list? This years list? Why not back that up and give us a guesstimation at least?<br />
<br />
SoE has dicked around Melee for way damn too long, Melee balance Sure its in the works, But oh yeah before we do that here, take a assraping of weapon resistance first. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt even mind the weapon immunities / resistance IF Endurance / Melee revamp part two CAME OUT BEFORE IT. <br />
Instead were shown as a after-thought by some sick twister caster playing dev who said, Hmmm how can I rape melee more?<br />

A wizard cannot chain cast nukes indefinatley, which was the point I was trying to make.  I know, that a wizard cannot chain cast their nukes, and have...FT15...make up for the mana they are losing, to even consider that a possibility is ridiculous.<br />

I can already chain fortitude/furious, defensive and get a good 5-6 incites on a time god when tanking.  At the end I am sometimes OOE...  By the time we are starting the next one my endurance bar is full (takes less than 10 minutes ).  I don't even really see a need to train the endurance regen AA or the need for an endurance regen buff, as I'm already constantly clicking off buffs i don't need, and if i can gain 500-1000 more END from my current items, as i'll probably rarely burn all of my endurance in a single fight.</div></div><hr />

I have wizards friends who regain 118 mana a tick, and whose spells cost after reductions 300 mana. <br />
I dont seem to understand why people say they cant cast indefinitely, I have watched them almost do so (only slowing down to avoid aggro)<br />
<br />
As it stands now, +endurance on GoD items just makes us need to beta test their live release, and report the bugs. That isnt cool.  The reason I say we should ge tthese thing's,  Is the supposed melee revamp part 2, Was supposed to have more on demand abilities that used endurance.<br />
<br />
As it stands endurance is useful for incite / SoR / Defensive and your done. What happens when these abilities release? Why should if they even bother giving us more on demand abilities as they promised, we run OOE because we have nothing to help increase the bar atm, (except GoD gear) or anything to help regen it?<br />
<br />
Also why laugh at a simple request of having what was PROMISED to us by yesterday be asked to be had by the end of the month? Endurance on all items Febuary 10th? No, How about by the end of the month?<br />
<br />
Why do so many people assume bashing when instead of saying mm yummy carrot on stick, We instead ask, Hey when's this list gonna be done? Wanting solid dates isnt a bad thing, In fact its normal for a paying customer to want to know when / where upgrades are going to happen. <br />
<br />
I give everyone benefit of a doubt, But why may I ask, could they not have come a day or two before GoD release and said, Hey guys it wont be ready we have to push it back? Instead of playing the make up game?<br />
<br />
Thats my questions maybe they will get answered maybe not. (Damn Haass im becoming more and more cynical like you ~</div></div><hr />

A 65 wizard with bazaar loot and 20aa's doing an ldon sure as hell can't, but that's not really the point. There are so many buffs that stack and add mana regen that it scales to a retarded point on raids.<br />
<br />
At the high end, with all the right gear and aa's, in a raid situation with raid buffs, wizards most definitely CAN chain nuke indefinitely. And wizard nukes do some pretty insane damage, certainly of a greater effect than chaining INCITE provides. <br />
<br />
When I say chain nuke indefinitely I mean for the duration of a boss fight, with ease. You add up mental clarity 3, FT 15, SCM3,any WORN focus effects that reduce mana usage, add in bard song, c5, SD, po9, click stick at the ready, whatever other buffs they might have from emp robe clicky or whatever, and YEAH trust me...they can nuke for freaking ever, assuming a brief pause every once in a while to cast concussion so as not to overaggro and go splat. <br />
<br />
So yeah, imho asking for one, maybe a couple spells, that BOTH regen endurance, OH and maybe something else useful to do with it besides incite would be nice. (remember that promise of working on more abilities indepedent of the scrapped random opening system?) like maybe an on demand stun that you have to be in melee range to use, or a group attk buff, or even an ac debuff....whatever, the fact that it was promised and seems to have disappared is dissapointing.</div></div><hr />

Right, because I was wrong for saying a level 54 warrior shouldn't be bitching and moaning in the Overlords Sanctuary. IM SORRY. idiots.<br />
<br />
edit: Also, Haass, he didn't mention buffs with regards to his initial example wizard who could chain nuke, which is why I brought up the point that an unbuffed wizard does not have 118 mana/tick regen. Ok?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it's a valid comparison based on the state of the game.  We don't compare warriors to casters from 4 years ago who maybe had Clarity either.  Casters can obtain a massive amount of mana regen.  You know your endurance regen.  Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then why shouldnt we get endurance regen buffs?<br />
Why am I comparing them as well? because when melee system 2 goes live, a lot of our new on demand abilities will require endurance. <br />
<br />
Which we wont have if we use spirit of rage + incite and chain into defensive/evasive.  Thats why im comparing the two, we cant regen crap with attack on, and encounters that last more then 5 minutes screw us on endurance regen. <br />
<br />
No direspect to casting classes, but hey since we have our own &quot;mana pool&quot; now, why shouldnt we have focus effects for our abilities that either lesson the amount it takes, or gives us better regen?<br />
<br />
If we have to play with spellbooks now (combat abilities book) we may as well have focus abilities like I.R for incite, Or Endurance Presevation effects. <br />

Hey they stuck us with a spellbook, Call it whatever you want,  We have 8 gems , Casters have 8 gems, We have a pool that whenever a gem is used, the juice for it comes from.<br />

I just call it as I see it, We are no diffrent from Paladins or SK's now (we just still have medicore aggro generation ability) We have spells that contribute to attack / defense / aggro. <br />

These abilities are supposed to refresh around the same time as incite or thats the rumor on the street.<br />
If those do come into place, then why shouldnt we have endurance regening buffs, as well as items that conserve endurance?<br />

Comparing the need for +end buffs to casters need for KEI is ridiculous.  Warriors can do thier job with zero end, casters can do ansolutely nothing with no mana.<br />
<br />
 I also think that people have different meaning of 'chain casting'.  Chain casting for a wizard is like this.  Start to cast big nuke ... 5 seconds later it goes off ... wait 2 secs for gem recycle .. cast concussion ... 3 secs later it goes off ... wait 2 secs for gem recycle ... cast nuke.  So you are looking at a nuke every 15 seconds or so.  This is a bit diff than truly chaining an instant ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FT-15: 15 mana/tick<br />
SD: 9 mana/tick<br />
VoQ: 18 mana/tick<br />
BoT-9: 8 mana/tick<br />
MC-3: 3 mana/tick<br />
Familiar: 8mana/tick<br />
Mod-Rod: 360 mana spread over a 3-5 min reuse time (I always forget which): 7-10 mana/tick<br />
Castable, stackable mana regen from PoTime: 8mana/tick (if you refuse to count PoTime there is a 5/tick that coming from about 3 items in SoL).<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm still forgetting something too, don't worry it will come around eventually Now, we're not factoring in any innate standing manaregen or horses into this equation. <br />
<br />
So: 15 + 9 + 18 + 8 + 3 + 10 + 8 + 8 = 79 mana/tick. Again, we are not factoring in innate mana regen, nor bard songs nor paragon of spirit. Now, add mana song, chorus of marr: 21 per tick and you're at 92 mana/tick. Factor in innate regen and you're pushing 100. Add paragon of spirit, 480 mana over 36 second (6 ticks). But, let's say we spread the paragon regen out over a 5 minute spread. 5 minutes = 50 ticks. 480/50 = 9.6 (we'll call it 10mana/tick). Add that, and you have 118mana regen/tick. <br />
<br />
Now, you have regen established. Take the mana cost of a wizard's best nuke (SoS). Factor in specialization, advanced specialization, cast time, mana preservation, spell cast time, Blessings of Reverence, and casting concussion in between nukes (25 mana, really insignificant cost in this whole process esp since you can get it free with ele pants). Considering SoS (we'll use that as a benchmark) is 8 second cast time, 1 second disparity between end cast SoS and start cast concussion, and a 2 second cast time for concussion and 1 more second to cast SoS again, with BoR, let's reduce that to 9 seconds, for argument sakes.<br />
<br />
 Now, take the 640 mana cost of SoS, subtract 10% = 576. take 576, and subtract a good 25% from a good nuke-specific mana conservation focus effect(there are plenty out there, inferno of sol for instance, ther are even a rare 30% but whateveR). 576 - (.25 * 576 ) = 576 - 144 = 432 mana every 9 seconds, which = 288 mana/tick. now. assuming the wizard is 100% paying attention and focused on 1 particular mob and never stop nad keeps following this routine. 288 - 118 = 170 mana spent/tick. HOnestly, considering people with these numbers have a roughly 6k+ mana pool mana pool, you'll need almost 4 minutes of non-stop nuking to bring that wizard to oom status. 4 minutes non-stop nuke/conc/nuke/conc. <br />
<br />
Guess what, thats not going to happend, if for no other reason then because hte wizard will get summoned and killed. So ,add some more seconds to latency wait time, some time sitting  on a horse rather than standing, and suddely you wind up wasting less than 100 mana/tick. I'm not  a wizard, but I'm assuming it would work something like this. When you're talking about these figures, you suddenly understand why it is possible for wizards to chain-nuke without OOMing. <br />
<br />
They also serve to disprove your entire basis of logic Niafix. Here's a piece of advice, you come to these boards pretending like you're big shit in terms of EQ knowledge, arguing with everyone and anyone, even if they present evidence while you add nothing but &quot;well I saw this one time when....&quot; Here's a tip, &quot;foot back in mouth&quot; and you'll come out the wiser.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure waiting in between casting isn't considered chain-casting, otherwise you could say that casting one nuke every 10 minutes is chain casting (huge exaggeration, but you get the point).  By your admission, a truly chain casting wizard with all the bells and whistles will run out of mana in 3-4 minutes.<br />
<br />
Mind you, the mana regen numbers you quote are very impressive, and can certainly turn a wizard into a massive-dps engine for relatively short bursts (assuming a long fight, such as would be normal in Plane of Time, I imagine).<br />
<br />
Anyways, is the point of this the argument for endurance regen?  If so, then I imagine the discussions on boards like Graffe's about the relative merits of mana pool vs. mana regen would be fairly applicable here.  Regen is important, and I imagine they'll eventually succumb and add this feature to the game, but it'll probably only be after a lot of number crunching on our parts.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm going to be very happy with the +End on existing gear... I don't need to keep chaining discs all the time, but I really would like to have enough juice to hold things together when the crap totally hits the fan.<br />
<br />
Btw, anyone else notice that the gear coming out of GoD with endurance on it has the exact same value for +End and +Mana?  If this works out the same with our existing gear, then I imagine some of us will be getting huge boosts to our pools.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you know a wizard who can chain nuke longer than 5 minutes that's usually a sign of they suck, because it can't be done if they're using any real nukes.  <br />

It's kind of funny how all the high end wizards I group with eventually runs out of mana if they start nuking seriously, while all these imaginery pickup wizards can chain nuke all day without ever dipping below 99% mana.</div></div><hr />

What the fuck? If you read the first sentence in that paragraph, I said that AGRO is the reason a wizard can't necessarily chain-nuke, because any wizard that stands there and chain-nukes for all eternity will be dead well before he goes oom. THerefore, to prevent dying, you'll need more time between nukes. Reading the entire post and comprehension is your friend... really.<br />

PS, the 4-minute figure I've already STATED in a preveious paragraph, and it is a reference to a boss encounter situation. If this was not the case, you have to factor in switching targets, waiting for pull to reach raid/group and giving the tank some time to agro.</div></div><hr />

Because of this, it is kind of difficult to justify in my mind endurance regen, considering that endurance refreshes faster than discs, so the only current thing that can be considered a &quot;drain&quot; is Incite, and for the most part you don't really *need* to chain incite every time it refreshes.   <br />

I could be all wrong if melee &quot;revamp part 2&quot; turns out to have End consuming skills, but as of now, adding +End on items would be pretty sufficient, at least for my playstyle.<br />

Comparing Endurance to mana doesnt' really work, since Endurance doesn't serve anywhere near the same function as Mana does, the only similarity is that it's &quot;The other non-hitpoint bar&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Some lucky wizzies have no-mana clicky nuke items (tho most are drop nerfed now) that DO allow &quot;nonstop&quot; chain concussion-nuking.  Rend robes and the like, while not on the level of SoS, do allow the extra time to regen mana without entirely stopping the DPS.  Dropping a few click nukes into the rotation with that level of mana regen is more than enough to maintain a positive manaflow.<br />

All stats are at 305 when buffed, I have the overwhelming urge to use Mighty strike every time I hit berzerker frenzy, and I do quick clicks of incite on mezzed mobs while still fighting the active one. More often than not I have had Defensive/Stonewall cut out early because I didnt have the end to sustain it.<br />

Yup, entirely mine.<br />

However I kinda like the fast paced fly by the seat of my pants and heavy utility useage of unlinked discs.<br />

Inciting every mob, using defensive on the ones who hit hard enough to scare the cleric, and I was regularly OOE.  A bigger pool will certainly help with that, although lack of regen means that it's a losing battle if you're talking about a long grind.<br />

my current beef is the endurance regen is a GoD aa for a stat we get weither we have GoD or not. it should be put with the mana regen aa's for everyone and at the same cost. make aura's work like ft regen attack endurance, or create flowing endurance effects for items. i also dont get a skill like meditate i can only assume my regen rate is the same standing fighting sitting and the same as a lvl 1 war.<br />
<br />
the only thing i run into though is even with every disc yellowed out i can regen enough to get off a incite the nex lower one befor another mob is brought back to camp. and am hard pressed to find out that it's not decently balanced regen vs. use.<br />
<br />
if everything in the group is working like it's supposed to in ldon(the massive dps caster drainer of mana) i get low on end about the same time dps casters get low on mana. the difference being in 30-90 seconds they have enough to continue on for a while. and i have just enough for 3-4 incites depending on how its pulled and time between pulls.</div></div><hr />

Indeed I have noticed this. Put that amount of END on my MANA items and add some to my warrior only items too and that'll be about 2000 added Endurance. What do we have by default? Somewhere between 2500 and 3000 isn't it? That would be a very very nice boost. Could go a long haul using Incites and a few discs without going OOE, or on a boss you can genuinely chain Furious, Stonewall, Mighty Strike, throw in a few Incites and cycle back to Stonewall when it pops up again if the fight lasts that long. Maybe even throw in that load of tripe that adds melee aggro (See how much I use it? Can't even remember its name!). All that added aggro (mainly from extra incites) will let the raid do that much more damage that straight up fighting encounters would get a lot easier. Thankfully there aren't too many of those in the higher game now.</div></div><hr />

Niafix,I have wizards friends who regain 118 mana a tick, and whose spells cost after reductions 300 mana. <br />
I dont seem to understand why people say they cant cast indefinitely, I have watched them almost do so (only slowing down to avoid aggro)  <br />
<br />
I am more pissed when I watch a Wizard/Druid/Bard kite 20 mobs for massive exp. *Sarcasm on* obviously proving that kiting is alive and well in EQ. <br />
Willing to wait a bit for endurance items, but still waiting on that WoW beta too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I am wrong, but wasnt hybrids supposed to have less END than pure meeles? I always thought that meeles should have the edge on END, but now, to the problem of the armor that has the same HP for all plate classes, plus the mana that can only use hybrids, they also put END, so hybrids get the same benefit , and the mana too. I really dont know how many disciplines or how can they chain em or their reuse time for hybrids, but I remember reading that they were gonna have a lower amount of END just to use their disciplines and we were gonna use it for skills (and disciplines). Maybe it doesnt break anything, maybe their reuse timers make it so that even when they have the same END we do, they cant really use it... but again, the itemization for 'all plates' screwed us once....</div></div><hr />

<br />
It used to be that a bard (good or bad, it was situational)), could pulse the group only level 32 mana song because it did not have a duration, it literally just gave mana each time it &quot;pulsed&quot; which meant a bard could twist it twice per tick plus keep a normal group/ae song up.<br />
<br />
However, this was nerfed recently because SoE finally realized just how much mana a bard could pump out doing this.<br />
<br />
I am really hoping they only add End (or substantially higher amounts of End) or the pure melee items only. Just looking at elemental armor, the benefit of any given peice to a hybrid (mostly I have compared Paladins) it substantial since they gain mana and 2 focus effects for a very small hp/ac loss. Making End on older gear would help balance the difference some, in my opinion. Either way, I am looking forward to the addition of End to older items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, the expansion stuff kept us all pretty busy. It's first on my list to do now that we've shipped.<br />
<br />
<br />
So where is this? Its been damn near a month now.  This CAN'T be that hard to do, I could set up a simple database data miner that could do this changeover fairly quickly(assuming I knew the EQ's item database system), would look something like this . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If expansion = GoD, ignore the item and move on (this could also just be coded as &quot;If item has END value, ignore and move on&quot; or just use both to cover all bases)<br />
<br />
If item is NOT wearable by at least one pure melee class, ignore and move on (hybrids don't really need END, and they'll end up with more than they need from items shared with pure melee of their armor type)<br />
<br />
If item has no HP or mana value, ignore and move on<br />
<br />
If item has a mana value, set END = MANA<br />
<br />
If item has no mana and an HP value &gt; 125, set END = HP*0.9(rounded to the nearest multiple of 5)<br />
<br />
If item has no mana and an HP value =&lt; 125, set END = HP<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Code that to match your database, run it and bam all existing items have an END value that probably pretty damn close to what we're gonna see once they're done doing this by hand anyway.  Other than adjusting the % modifier of nonmana items and the breakoff at which END is no longer = HP but rather a % of HP, I don't see any contingency this doesn't cover.<br />
<br />
And yes this is an old thread, I specifically went looking for it and bumped it on purpose.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - Initially was gonna present this as BASIC code for kicks, but I didn't wanna be too geeky, plus the whole END abbreviation would cause problems.</div></div><hr />

Um Wizards at the end game, Can chain nuke without going OOM.<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
I apologize for the bump.  I was browsing the the board reading up on agro when I came across this comment.<br />
<br />
Chain nuking as defined as casting a series of direct damage spells, one right after the other, without using concussion.<br />
<br />
You are correct in claiming that endgame wizards have the ABILITY to chain nuke, given the current state mana regen, mana pools, focus items, etc.<br />
<br />
Managing the hate this generates is what limits the usefulness of this ability.  I will add that this is more than just &quot;right-clicking&quot; a hate reducer with your ep pants.<br />

Of course, I could have been imagining things.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Just happened to catch me between swigs!<br />
<br />
edit: I'd like to hope that if they give us endurance on our pre-existing items that they would add at least another disc beside defense/offense and incite. <br />
<br />
I'd really like the endurance pool to be used more. If they add more items then we'll have enough to use it more often. I realize a balance needs to be in the forefront of the decision making process, but I would like to see the current mind-set expand on the orignal concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good news... <br />

This is in on test.  Not sure if it is finished, but as a cleric I had almost 200 end and the warrior I usually group with said he had over 1k from items.  <br />
<br />
So... it's coming.  :)<br />
<br />
For the most part it seemed that endurance amount was equal to mana amount on items that had both but don't think that is necessarily true for everything.  Guessing they may have put that in as a starting point for the all/all type gear and did something else for melee only gear but since I don't have any melee only gear I can't tell you for sure.  I'm sure you'll be hearing from test warriors soon with more details.</div></div><hr />
