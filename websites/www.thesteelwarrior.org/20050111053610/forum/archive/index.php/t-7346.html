<br />
<br />
Well today a friend and I where roaming around Nedaria's Landing and came across a Newer Model Taelosian female(Nideno Eliagy) in a cave up the river from the Wayfarer camp.<br />
<br />
Nideno Eliagy gave a small description on her purpose and then refrerred me to a npc named Eldros Damor who is located on one of the docks in Nedaria's Landing. After some responses to Eldros I was given an Expadition(6 people/1 group) and the course was marked on my compass. I was lead back to Nideno, I hailed with the response &quot;forgotten halls&quot;. She continued to explain the purpose of this Temple that has been hidden from the armies of the Muramites. When she was done, the rock behind her began to glow faintly, we then clicked in.<br />
<br />
This zone was fairly laggy for me and amazing laggy for a guildy of mine.<br />
<br />
The architecture is what the taelosians great temples and buildings are to resemble before the destructive Muramites came. One room in particular is very similar to the zone in at NTOV(room with the light gleaming into the center), it is quite a site imo. The zone itself is small, consisting of 6 rooms all connected by halls and non kos npcs. Three of the rooms have the new bat/rat models you seen in the above screenshots, one room consists of 12 or so bats, one with 12 or so rats, and another with a mix of bats/rats and small golems. Outside two of the rooms a npc asks you to get rid of the vermin inside the rooms, SK partner with me tried to single pull and got the whole room. The mobs hit for 140-470ish melee, a necro friend of mine zoned in and we did manage to kill 1 bat, but with it being early morning decided to leave.These seem like small tasks that might or could lead to another task and possibly be a small ring event. There is 2 oversized golems in the room that is connected to the first hall you see when you step out of zone in. They are being controlled by a few npc's who are making them fight against each other. <br />
<br />
<br />
The purpose of this zone (imo) is just to give us a taste of what the Taelosians lifestyle was like pre invasion. Also it seems that this is all the screenshots that SoE has released on the upcoming Omens of War expantions compiled into a zone, a teaser to a degree. <br />
<br />
Anyhow I'm posting this mostly becuase I had heard nothing prior to us stumbling upon this zone, and wanted to spread the word.<br />
<br />
Please post here if you find any further info on this zone and anything I may of left out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruldar</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say, 'Hail, Nideno Eliagy'<br />
<br />
Nideno Eliagy says 'Greetings, traveler. This is a beautiful land you have here. . .very different from [what I am used to]. You must thank the gods daily for the bounty they have bestowed upon you.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What are you used to?'<br />
<br />
Nideno Eliagy says 'Since the coming of the Muramites, my land has been broken and defiled. Taelosia was never a lush land. It could be hostile to the unwary, but it was once [beautiful] in its own way.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Beautiful?'<br />
<br />
Nideno Eliagy says 'Although the army of Mata Muram has defiled our cities, there are still places that their claws do not yet reach. . .places they do not know exist. If the Wayfarers hadn't come to Taelosia when they did, I'm sure the Muramites would have found these hidden locations as well, but thankfully they are too busy with their own defense now to worry about enslaving the last of my people. One of these places is an old temple that we refer to as the [Forgotten Halls]. The elders have decided to allow outsiders into the Forgotten Halls in the hopes that you will understand better the plight of the Taelosian people once you see the unblemished beauty of an ancient Taelosian temple.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Forgotten Halls?'<br />
<br />
Nideno Eliagy says 'I can grant you passage to the Forgotten Halls, but you must first speak with Eldros Danmor. The Wayfarers have appointed him as the one who will determine who can enter the Forgotten Halls and who cannot. I apologize for the inconvenience but I have little knowledge of your people. I must rely on others to determine who we can trust in order to ensure the security of the temple.'<br />
<br />
Eldros Danmor says 'Well met, Ruldar. I've recently been appointed as an ambassador of sorts to Taelosians who wish to visit our bountiful shores. It is my duty to ensure that visiting Taelosians are looked after and kept safely away from the greedy intentions of our less savory Norrathian cousins. It's not expected that many will undertake the journey, but we have had one [Taelosian] visit our shores recently.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Taelosian?'<br />
<br />
Eldros Danmor says 'Her name is Nideno Eliagy. She is an elder within her community, an Undari as they are known. Nideno has come to our shores in the hopes that she can teach us more about her people.  She has brought with her the means to transport others to a [temple] deep in the mountains of Taelosia.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Temple?'<br />
<br />
Eldros Danmor says 'Nideno refers to the temple simply as the Forgotten Halls. On the surface, it appears to be a place where Harindi, those Taelosian skilled in the ways of geomancy, are taught their craft.  I believe the Forgotten Halls holds a much deeper meaning for the Taelosian people, though. Nideno has offered access to the Forgotten Halls to us so that we may see the beauty of an ancient Taelosian temple unscathed by the ravages of the Muramites. In the interest of security, she has asked that anyone [interested in visiting] the Forgotten Halls speak to me first so that I may give them my blessing.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Interested in visiting?'<br />
<br />
After zoning in...<br />
<br />
a harindi guide says 'Welcome to the Forgotten Halls. Many Taelosians make pilgrimages to these ancestoral halls to learn the secrets of geomancy or simply to bask in the splendor of the ancient architecture. Enjoy your stay here and please be respectful of your surroundings. When you are [ready to leave], let me know and I will return you to where to where you came from.'<br />
<br />
a yunjo spectator says 'Be quiet in here. The controllers need all of their concentration to maintain dominance over those massive gladiators. If they falter for even a second, the gladiators could break loose and destroy us all! Exciting, isn't it?'<br />
<br />
a yunjo groundskeeper shudders. 'Rats make my skin crawl. Filthy creatures! I don't know how they got in there, but please, I beg of you, get rid of them!'<br />
<br />
a yunjo groundskeeper says 'I. . .I hate bats! I have no idea how those foul creatures got into the room, but if you could get rid of them I'd be very thankful.'<br />
<br />
a yunjo pilgrim says 'It's hard to believe that not far from here our people are enslaved by the Muramite army, yet here we stand in peaceful tranquility under a beautiful night sky.'</div></div><hr />
