<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've been spending a lot of time in Droga lately, because my guild is working on chardok faction for rings/cords, and so that we can epic up the brand new clerics a bit easier.  In my bank I have loads of Sashes, Ice Fetishes, Earth Totems, Depredator Blades, and Hoodlum symbols, as well as items from each of the level 60 named in there, so I decided to do some digging and find out what they're for.  I must say, I was rather impressed with the results, for the most part.  Cave Lord Sashes and the Earring off the King nets this --<br />

Darned nice.  It seems that some chimp down at SoE headquarters fubared the Intelligence stat and put it in as wisdom, but hey, I still don't know anyone who would turn down 75 mana and FT 2, even if it does have wisdom on.  So after questing up a few of those for the chanters and whatnot, I figure there must be items for other classes, and yep, sure enough, 3 ice fetishes and the staff off Cialin grants you this :<br />

Well hot freaking damn.  A quest item I'd actually use, 2 of them in fact.  What a great idea.  The next item I came across was the hybrid earring --<br />

That's right, no more must you make the choice between a Bloodmetal earring or a Solstice earring, this is the best of both worlds, one helluva hybrid item I must say.  Which brings me, unfortunately, to the last item, the Pure melee item.<br />

<br />
WHAT THE FUCK?! <br />
<br />
You have got to be kidding me.  Every goddamned set of classes in the game gets a completely USEFUL piece of gear, and we get this mediocre at best piece of completely worthless shit.  Every warrior rogue or monk I know is either wearing Cultural Bracers (ac 25, 55hp, 5 all saves) or bracers of Benevolence (AC 17, 8 sta 25hp, 12 mr/cr) and we get this utter garbage.  I don't even know where to begin with what's wrong with this picture.<br />
<br />
Every other item off these quests gives 3 saves, not to mention that the caster items give an entire 12 points more of saves than the melee items do.  5 ac is completely bogus for the level that this quest is at, not to mention the fact that it gives exactly the same amount of HP as the Hybrid earring, and the earrings has other stats that make it a better piece of gear.  Every other item is definitely equippable for a pre-heavy raiding player, because FT is infinitely useful, but we get 10atk....I get that off my goddamned goblin earring.  For me to even think about equipping this bracer, it would have to be upgraded to 20ac OR Vengeance 4 or 5 and even then it would be a lateral upgrade at best.  No one is gonna give up 20-30 modded AC for 10atk, even the monks and rogues I group with don't wanna drop the BoB's for this piece of shit.<br />
<br />
Still don't think pure melees have been totally forgotten in this game?   Think again.  No one who designs gear down at SoE has any idea what to do when it comes to us, and we're taking it up backside for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ouch.  Good point Haass.  If that bracer was made into an earring, I'd be all over it.  As a bracer, thanks, I'll keep my 2 Warlord bracers...<br />
<br />
Melee itemization blows and has blown for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good point, only spot it would be worth a crap is the ear, how sad :(  Maybe a finger for some, but I got better with the Valor ring thingy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like that on my neck too, but yea, that McSuxxors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a little pissed that they put the priest item in the same slot as the second most common FT item around. But still, we got nowhere near as screwed as the melee on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know monks and rogues will like that bracer :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over a BoB that they can get 10 times easier?  I think not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Monk friends of mine like this bracer just cause they dont give a crap about AC and only want attack.  That said all the pure melee ornate bracers also have vengence 2 and and much higher AC with similar hps.  I do agree with Haass, however, that this item sucks for warriors and it terrible compared to the other class drops</div></div><hr />

<br />
doesnt BoB has like... next to no hitpoints, 25 or 30 something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It has 25hp, however the thing is that most monks/rogues aren't near the stamina cap..so the 8 sta does indeed make a difference.  When you compare the 12 AC loss between the 2, I really don't see any way to choose the bracelet of gore.  I had to twist arms to get these things quested amongst my friends because they're just crap.  I had like 12 earth totems in the bank, I thought SOMEONE would use some up, but I ended up talking to people about them for days before finally just questing one myself because I knew I wasn't gonna get rid of them.<br />
<br />
It's really bullshit that I'm even discussing it.  There is ZERO discussion about any of the other items (Gimmel brings up a good point, however I'll take a few days in droga over working up all my tradeskills anyday).  The fact that this is not something that everyone would look at and say &quot;Damn, I'd like one of those,&quot; is really, really wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot; 5 ac is completely bogus for the level that this quest is at,&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
However, the reason it has such low AC is because the monk class is listed on the classes that can use it.<br />
<br />
5 AC is about right for the level of quest when you think about &quot;monk&quot; armors.<br />
<br />
Still, I wouldn't give up my Skyshrine Bracer for that thing, let alone my Fortitude bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, that thought has crossed my mind, and the only thing that I can think of in return is &quot;Fuck monks.&quot;</div></div><hr />
