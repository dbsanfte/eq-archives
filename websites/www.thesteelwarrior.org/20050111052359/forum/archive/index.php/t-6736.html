<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annoc Starshield</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Posting here instead of on PoN because I need some people to play Devils Advocate.  I have a pretty simple idea for a lvl 65 spell that would act similliar to defensive by mitigating damage.  It would need some draw baks since I don't want to have Paladins be a alterative to Warriors as a RAid Tank.<br />
<br />
1) It would be a buff and there for take up a slot.<br />
<br />
2) It would be a constant drain on my mana.  That way I can't cast and then regen my mana.<br />
<br />
3) When I get hit I loose a chunk of mana just like HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now remeber we are also asking for Stuns and heals that would scale with the lvl of the game as it is now.  I would be casting these in battle so you  need to take into effrct these too.<br />
<br />
With this buff it would force me to do certain things.   Such as make sure I have good solid FT items and a large mana pool.  Of couse this should have an effect on my HP and AC.  If done right this could make a clear cut difference between Warrior and Hybrid items.  Please posts what you think is right and wrong.  After all this is just a rough idea of a single person.</div></div><hr />

As the only paladin experience I have is the 20 minutes I've played on an inherited one so far, fill me in some here.  Does not the AA stun work up to level 65, with a max 9 second refresh timer, and works on any mobs other than the usual uber dragons/giants/gods, etc? <br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure what you mean by saying that you don't want paladins as a replacement for warriors as raid tank, as that seems to me to be the exact and direct aim of your proposal; namely making knights a viable raid tank.  Or am I misunderstanding you?<br />
<br />
To be honest, my biggest concern with knights getting a form of defensive in any flavour, is that it is taking away a huge part of the warrior class's very limited uniqueness.  If you have a form of defensive available to you, even with a long refresh timer, what is to be gained by choosing a warrior tank?  Honestly, how many times do warriors use defensive on a raid?  I could be wrong, but I definitely think it's a minority of the time where the same warrior is called upon to use his defensive disc a number of times in a short while.  And in an experience group, if a warrior needs to use his defensive as soon as it pops, or even finds a reason to, well then that warrior is out of his league to begin with.  Were he properly levelled/geared/AA'd for the content he's fighting, there would not be a need for constant use of defensive.  Note that the above paragraph only applies in instances below the very leading edge of the game (which is by far the vast majority of players) At said leading edge, all warriors are fairly equal, as are all paladins, SK's, etc.  At this point of the game, a guild would not replace their warrior tanks with their perhaps better geared pally tanks, as the warrior tanks would already have the best gear available, making them still superior to even the best geared knight tanks.  However, the higher-end warriors might still have the same issue with this; I don't know as I don't play in that part of the game, so I can't comment. Perhaps if you throw out some ideas of what you see as drawbacks/limits to using this spell, I can see it more from your point of view.<br />
<br />
-edit- hmmm something that might limit the spell, is if it required a HUGE mana pool to cast it, well beyond the range of your typical bazaar/LDoN/Elemental  knight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 IIRC, Divine Stun works on mobs up to level 68, but it has no duration. I can see the case for a 65 Stun of 4 seconds, IF you're not going to give Paladins an autoparry disc. Still not sure what it would do for SK's besides make them a clear number 3, tho.<br />
<br />
 And as far as 'defensive-like', sorry, it doesn't fly with the majority of Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annoc Starshield</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok what I am refering to is the Single group trials that re required for advancement in GoD.  Basicly you have to have a Warrior as the Tank to survive.  Since Paladins and SK's don't mitigate the damage well enough they can't tank and are not good enough to do other things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what I would really like is for SOE to throw GOD out the window and start over.   The fact SOE won't do this but some other kneee jerk patch and will probly screw all other content up is why I am bringing it up.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure what thypes of advantages and disadvantages is why I brought it here.  I am basicly thinking of a new Divine Aura.  If this is a bad idea let me know but be constuctivve and add something in.  Like a base mitigation that has been brought up.  Making a real difference in Plate wearing Tanks.  This spell would of course be droped in GoD off a mob like Rondo Smith or harder.<br />
<br />
Divine stun is a Luclin AA that enables up to lvl 60 Mobs to be stunned unless flagged unstunable.  The mobs in question of course are unstunable.  This throws the idea of stuning them out unless that is changed.  Not sure of the recast time if you get the AA since I never bought it but I am pretty sure its more than 6 seonds.<br />
<br />
If Paladins had some heals that we could use to getto mitigate that would be an Idea also.   My best fast heal now only does 900 hp.   With the HP need for GoD mobs this won't cut it.<br />
<br />
They could retune mobs to where they did less melee but did more dmg through spells.   This could work off Paladin's Sanctification disc but would leave SK's in the cold.<br />
<br />
Basicly I just want some ideas that wouldn't cut into a Warriors job as the prefered raid tank.</div></div><hr />

However given the fact that a stunned mob doesn't stop its round delay from refreshing the actual benefit you get out of Divine Stun isn't much, unless you're paying attention to when a mob's round is going to be.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, my biggest concern with knights getting a form of defensive in any flavour, is that it is taking away a huge part of the warrior class's very limited uniqueness.  If you have a form of defensive available to you, even with a long refresh timer, what is to be gained by choosing a warrior tank?<br />
<br />
Greater survivability and better success rate. Remember that content is tuned to 3 factors. <br />
<br />
50% defensive from warriors (45% defensive + -1 DI)<br />
CH from clerics<br />
Slow from shaman<br />
<br />
That being said. The 1st survivability factor is the warrior. Since they have a 50% mitigation ability replacing that warrior with a knight with 25% mitigation would yield a much lower success rate. <br />
<br />
You do not gain more in the game for doing things the harder way. This is why warriors would not lose their raid role. There is absolutely no logical reason for guilds to risk failure when they have the best classes present to minimize that possibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, how many times do warriors use defensive on a raid?  I could be wrong, but I definitely think it's a minority of the time where the same warrior is called upon to use his defensive disc a number of times in a short while.<br />
<br />
It's not how many times do they use it. It's is there a specific reason why they do. The answer is there is a reason. And that reason will always be there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You presume it would yield a much lower success rate.  You can't be certain of that.  For example, no one even seems to consider the power of a 25% defensive combined with the ability to refresh your own HP pool via LoH.  Yes, I know LoH has got a long refresh time, but against raid bosses you aren't typically called on to tank every five minutes.  There is certainly some unexamined potential there.  I await the Paladin responses about how LoH is pointless, worthless, meaningless and never ever used. <br />
<br />
No, defensive is not an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If LoH is self only you might have a point.  As it stands I've seen Warriors get LoHed way more often than a Paladin.  You might as well consider LoH part of a Warrior's arsenal of mitigation.<br />
<br />
And LoH isn't nearly as good as Furious anyway if you're just trying to save yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, defensive is not an option.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glaitus. LoH is 1 ch. Now if you're telling me that the difference in survivability for an encounter where defensive has to be used is 1 CH then I'd beg to say that this content is either 1 group content or trivial raid content.  There's no other possibility.<br />
<br />
1 group would display approximately the culminating of the trials in GoD where a knight even with 25% defensive may sometimes have to use LoH because of a few bad consecutive melee rounds. But we're suppose to be in agreement that knights should be capable of tanking the trials.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation fights last alot longer, the mitigation difference of 25% vs 1 CH isn't comparable in any way. The extra mitigation just far surpasses the CH value of LoH.</div></div><hr />

Divine stun will mitigate ZERO% of incoming damage because these mobs are stun IMMUNE. <br />

If stuns WORKED we obviously wouldn't be having these issues as much. We'd still need help but not to this extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you want to cast spells you have to give up some part of being a tank. as it stands the only thing you give up and the tank catagory is defensive and a few skill points and -5% innate mitigation and some hp.<br />
<br />
knights dont get a auto repost/avoid because they have db/harmshield 15 second invon spell.<br />
<br />
the only way to maintain balace with 30+ mitigaton disc/spell would be to make knights a chain class, and also give it to rangers beserkers rogues, and a 40% to monks. then it would become your defining tanking ability, but rangers rogues and every other chain melee hybrid would be just like you. ohh and bump up ranger heals to knight lvls. of course you now get ranger dps. but also ranger hp. and a one hit fellstrike ability for like charghing with you lance or something. ohh and lose the aa horse and gain sow, or ranger get a aa pet = to mage pet only its like a feild mouse on crack or something.<br />
<br />
eh enough of that was fun though.<br />
<br />
what's realy happening is you nolonger want to be a knight, but a tank and still have spells. it's encroaching on becoming a full warrior. would 30% realy help but how much are you closer to being a warrior. if so why not play a warrior and be all the tank you can be. or cleric and be all the cleric you can be.<br />

<br />
Be a knight not a tank? What the hell have I been doing in EQ 85% of the time in the last 5 years?<br />
<br />
Answer: Tanking.<br />
Reason: We're a tanking class.<br />

<br />

<br />
The only thing?<br />
<br />
We give up 45% defensive<br />
5% inate mitigation<br />
We have lower HP<br />
We have lower AC<br />
Lower skill points<br />
20% less DPS vs 90% of all content<br />
No offensive discs except vs 10% of the content <br />
No avoidance discs<br />
No riposte discs<br />
<br />
Try again.<br />
<br />
knights dont get a auto repost/avoid because they have db/harmshield 15 second invon spell.<br />
<br />
It's DA not DB. And you have the ability to cast DA as a warrior using items. <br />
<br />
Try it next time you MT a raid for your guild and tell me if they think the outcome is the same as using a riposte/parry disc.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is so far out of whack I wouldn't even know where to begin.<br />
<br />
rogue is a hybrid?<br />
monk is a hybrid?<br />
<br />
Ranger heal though healing less are more mana efficient then ours<br />
<br />
Ah yes the AA horse. The game breaking ability.<br />

<br />
<br />

Well if warriors would stop bringing this into the friggin equation as a *TANKING* ability maybe I wouldn't bring up the fact they can use it. Of course, THAT part seems to elude you all the time. <br />

<br />
That's BS and you know it. How many classes borrowed from others? How is it a borrow from your class for bst is ok? how is it a borrow from your class for rng is ok? how is it that a HALF borrow from your class for knights is unacceptable. And yes, I know rng/bst didn't get a defensive type disc, but they for all intents and purpose are NOT tank classes therefore it does logically lead to making sense that disc wise kngihts should receive a defensive type ability rather than parry. LOGICALLY speaking that is.<br />

<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that most mobs in the game are not named, and are not stun immune. On those mobs, paladins (at least) maintain a significant advantage. A good friend of mine plays a cleric and consistently complains about how much harder it is to keep a warrior alive when tanking hard ldon's vs. paladins because of their stun. He has trouble keeping a 400+ aa 9.5k hp warrior alive (4+ ch's per fight) compared to a 8.5k 60aa paladin (~1 ch per fight). Maybe paladin stuns need to be nerfed? <br />
<br />
Knights tank just fine, just not on the top-level stuff. If knights can tank top level stuff theres little room left for warriors, since knights already are more efficient for many if not most xp group situations and bring buffs and utility warriors can't touch.<br />
<br />
GoD trials are a very small portion of the game, CAN be tanked with a knight, and AREN'T required. Give it a rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So much whining, so little time... the ONLY problem with knight tanking anywhere in the game is in Ikkinz trials. It makes infinitely more sense to fix those trials then to fuck around with classes which are finally fairly well balanced everywhere else. Paladins in particular are perfectly fine right now, SKs might need a bit more scalability in lifetaps but thats it.<br />
<br />
Paladins and SKs can tank DD, the priests and the flesh hunters perfectly fine once they have decent enough gear. Ive personally had a DD fight last for almost 6mins because we had extremely crap dps in the group. Ive had a paladin and a SK tank a priest, hell a monk almost did it the first time we reached them. I usually tank 2 of the 3 flesh hunters with no defensive, no furious.<br />
<br />
The only problems come from the 3 initial blocking mobs once you get in the zone, moreso the Pixxt and Hexxt rather then the Rav. To solve this greivous problem all that needs to be done is to drop the dps on those 3 mobs and rejig their damage spread so that they rely on DB more and DI less. This places the emphasis more on loot (shielding items) and less on stonewall. Noone has mentioned that unless your group has decent dps, using defensive/evasive and dropping your dps by 100+ can be the difference between the clerics running oom or not.<br />
<br />
Oh and knights offtank just fine in Uqua, anyone claiming otherwise is full of shit.</div></div><hr />

You finaly figured it out hurray for a Warrior you notice that we are far closer to a Warrior than we will ever be to a cleric.  We get goups for our Tanking abilities than our damn spellbook.  I am am in awe of you mental capeabilities that you noticed this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Warriors like Lokkat actualy just took the time to actualy look at what my spell book can and cannot do they just might learn something.   While it does have some good advantages it also has some worthless crap and stuff that is decent but over rated.   BB while I don't always agree with him notices this.  My spellbook while it is not storng enough to be class defining has in the past and should be again.<br />
<br />
Now was I sarcastic when I talked about whining Warrior. Why of course.  But the thing about it is many Warriors come off that way just as many Paladins come off whinny to Warriors.  Trust me just look at list of improvements Paladins are looking for over on the EQLive boards.   Many of them have been politely told to STFU.<br />
<br />
Now do I have nads?   Cast Iron probly just like yours.   Many tanks do it comes from looking at the mob that is beating on you and yelling at the screen telling it to bring it on bitch.<br />

Now about the no brains part you might want to let some of the Warriors that post here in on that one.</div></div><hr />

Zito your actualy not far off.  While my spells are damn handy and can be very useful from time to or on a regular basis.  I am not asked to group for my heals or my buffs or my stuns these days.  Now Paladins did get groups based on my spell book before Warriors got upgraded but that was just for my stuns.   Most groups just look for a Tank and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Well, I know from your response to the first item, that you did not reply to that with any truth.  I can not count the number of times I have seen a Paladin res a Cleric in both single and raid environments.  It is mostly during new events (testing out new encounters.)  But your purpose for dismissing the spell is to suggest it is not used.<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less what mobs are stun immune.  I also play a Cleric.  I played a Cleric before I starting playing a Warrior.  I still play a Cleric.  I have played a Cleric in GoD.  I know how easy it is to keep a Paladin alive in any zone with stunnable mobs.  It doesn't matter if &quot;high end&quot; encounters have many (if not every) mobs stun immune.  The fact is that it takes less mana and less mana regen to keep a Paladin alive.  The gear of the Paladin matters a lot less than the gear on a warrior, if the pull rate is sufficient to enable a lot of stuns during combat.  If you try to say otherwise, then you wish to obstruct the truth.<br />
<br />
The rest of your replies makes it very clear that you wanted to confuse the truth.  You tried (and failed) to think of situations that would be inappropriate to use those skills.  If not, you tried to say something like &quot;oh but I need to spend AA on that&quot;, when you fail to mention many of the AA abilities that Warriors need also cost AA points.<br />
<br />
If these spells are so useless to you, then don't use them.  Remove them from your spell book.<br />
<br />
Also, you must have been angry.  I count at least 8 spelling mistakes in the reply.  Calm down, and learn to play the class that your are designed to play, you may find it more fun than trying to play a Warrior that can res.</div></div><hr />

Actualy there are lots of Mobs that can't be stunned.  In fact the farther and farther you get into PoP or many of the expantions the more common they get.  If a mob is unstunable we get a nice little red message that we learn with Ghoulbane.    I still swear it would proc far more vs live mobs than it did vs undead. ;)   Your right it does not remove it from our spell book but it does grey out the spell untill it recycles.  However we don't get the stun mitigation as you pointed out.  Now did we use to get this?  Sure we did and it was very useful not just for that but interrupting those damn frogs back in OS.  But not anymore.  Now the biggest advantage of stuns is the agro it creates.  This ofcourse is the source of my snap agro.  <br />
<br />
Starting a 2nd Paragraph since I am kind of changing subjects but because it is also easier on the eyes.  Now since I am on the subject of agro this is how a Paladins gets or to some extent does not get agro.  Ok since Taunt is useless I get my agro though stuns.  Even though I can't mitigate or disrupt spell casting with  them any more I can sure piss stuff off.  I do that by chain casting 2 low lvl stuns called Cease (lvl 9) and Desist (lvl 15).   I use these because they are fast casting, recycle quickly and are damn cheap mana wise.  These 2 spells in my opinion are by far the best in my spell book.<br />
<br />
Going to list the zones where alot of the mobs are flagged stun immune.<br />
-BoT after all they are Giants<br />
-Tactics BIG ogres and stuff that worships RZ.<br />
-Elemental palnes lots of giant type creatures in here.  You should see the Crocs.<br />
-TSR again lots of Giant types<br />
-Ferubi GoD zone.  Even though I can tank there mobs are stun immune.  At least I think they are.  Might have to go back and check.<br />
<br />
So in the end are my stuns useful?  You bet they.  Just not the way you thought they were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously only once have I been the one that needs to res a Cleric.  Normaly most of the Paladins die before or soon after all the clerics.  So yes I will admit it has happened but it is just not that often.  Its far easier just to camp a cleric or have the Necro FD and res a cleric.<br />
<br />
Why do you not care about if a mob is stun immune?   You yourself said if I can stun it costs less mana for you to heal me.   If I was a cleric this would be damn important.<br />
<br />
AA you say?   Trust me I know all about the AA a Warrior need to spend.  As a Tank I tend to get the same ones.   Remember you are the one that brought up that Fearless was an important for the difference between Warriors and Paladins.  With all the other usefull AA Paladins just don't spend that many on something is mostly only useful vs Dragons.  There none in Luclin and only a few in PoP.<br />
<br />
Actualy I was more frustrated not angry but that didn't matter I just suck at spelling.  And if the best you can say is I can't play a Paladin you need to work harder.</div></div><hr />

Please bear in mind that most mobs in the game are not named, and are not stun immune. On those mobs, paladins (at least) maintain a significant advantage. A good friend of mine plays a cleric and consistently complains about how much harder it is to keep a warrior alive when tanking hard ldon's vs. paladins because of their stun. He has trouble keeping a 400+ aa 9.5k hp warrior alive (4+ ch's per fight) compared to a 8.5k 60aa paladin (~1 ch per fight). Maybe paladin stuns need to be nerfed?<br />
<br />
First off I wasn't speaking about all mobs. We're discussing the problems with knights unable to tank trials in GoD. What are we incapabe of tanking in those trials? Named mobs. That is where the *named mobs cannot be stunned* comes from. The fact of the matter is that you have a warrior that posts a bunch of BS to try to make it look like he knows what he's talking about which is refuted by pure logic and game mechanics that then replies with a list of things that had no bearing on the original argument and ends with ppl getting the original discussion crossed. Meaning for instance you replying that not all mobs are stun immune which was not what I was saying when I replied originally to Lokkak.<br />
<br />
BTW. I must say I find it a little hard to believe that your cleric is having more difficulty keeping your warrior who has 1k more hp and 340 more AA alive. Make that I find it VERY hard to believe. The fact that he's saying he needs 4ch for warrior to 1ch for a paladin is just proposterous.<br />
<br />
<br />
GoD trials are a very small portion of the game, CAN be tanked with a knight, and AREN'T required. Give it a rest.<br />
<br />
God is cutting edge content meaning it's NEW. Saying it's a small portion of the game to the whole player base is valid. But to full geared PoTime players it's the majority of the game. So that argument holds zero relevance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zito:<br />
<br />
When talking single group content ( pre bad ass single group trials, in any case), not raid content, any knight who says they have not gotten groups because of their spellbook is not being anywhere close to realistic or accurate. In raids, at least in my lower-end experience, that spell book also comes in quite handy with rezzes *I've been on 2 raids where a pally rezzed the raid, after the clerics were taken out. It may not happen that often, but it has happened.*, stuns, group heals, remove curse, snares, agro buffs, pulling, etc. Never mind snap agro. While your spells may very well have fallen behind their priest/caster counterparts in power relative to mobs and need upgrading, to entirely discount them as useless is very inaccurate and misleading.<br />
<br />
Let me ask it this way. If paladins had only stuns for spells, do you think they'd get all those xp groups? The answer is yes. This is the only meaning in regards to paladins saying we don't get xp groups from our spellbook. The opposite would mean that paladins get groups regularly as a secondary class in those same groups and we do not. If an xp group has a warrior and 1 empty slot left with all other classes being an option to fill the slot groups will not choose a paladin. <br />
<br />
And we're not discussing raids here. I don't have issues with my raid role outside of GoD. Sure I wish my heals were better since at the higher end of PoP they're close to meaningless healing vs dps and with the introduction of 3 classes with mgb hots our group heals are a paltry comparisson, but the fact is that we do have our role and we do do it. That's never been the issue.<br />
<br />

Lokkak:<br />
<br />
So? What is your point? My point is you can mitigate against mobs that can be stunned. You seem to think that if a mob exists in game that can not be stunned, that this somehow removes the ability to stun mobs that can be stunned? Does it gray out the spell? Does it remove it from your spellbook? How does having a single (or more than one) mob in game that can not be stunned remove this spell from your list of skills?<br />
<br />
You should have tried that argument with chanters and shaman when they discovered that casting slow on mobs in PoP could have the reverse effect or only partial effect. <br />
<br />
And yes. If I can stun ALL of eq that's 4 expansions old but I can't stun 80% of a new expansion then I DO have a reason to discount stuns. Or are you telling me if they make the next expansion with a high percentage of mobs (inclunding named) immune to defensive you'll be OK with this if they're not stun immune because according to YOUR logic it still WORKS. And we're talking DAMAGE MITIGATION vs mobs that KILL knights. And guess what. Those MOBS in GoD are NAMED mobs, and NAMED mobs are STUN immune because ALL named mobs are STUN immune. See the pattern?<br />

I did not make the comment. So I did not indicate that as the only difference. You seem to try to hide the abilities a Paladin brings to the table. I am refreshing the memories of everyone reading.<br />

You are the one that said those things were the ONLY differences between our 2 classes in the TANKING role. I just pointed out that you'd missed a few.<br />

Wanna try that again?<br />

I have intimate knowledge of what is and is not in a Paladin spellbook/aa line up. You must say this to persuade others to your side with the &quot;he doesn't know, so listen to me&quot; method. Is that about on the money?<br />
<br />
He didn't say you didn't know what was IN the book. He said if you knew what the book is capable of DOING. There is a VAST difference.<br />

Just looking at your Mangelo there Annoc, there is no way you SHOULD be tanking in Ikkinz. Infact I daresay someone with that gear shouldnt really expect to get past Tipt. If a 6500hp/1700ac warrior was posting and complaining about not being able to tank this shit id say the exact same thing. Fortunately so far it seems that none of the warriors here have been that shortsighted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get some gear and experience the content yourself, by the time you are ready for it there is a good chance that the trials will have been fixed to be less demanding of defensive.<br />
<br />
Not trying to start a needless argument with you, and I do know that gear plays a factor at the lvl of play ppl play at (from newbie to endgame). But don't you find it ironic that in the first quote you're implying the issue is gear related and then in the second quote you say by the time he gets the gear the content might be fixed which leads to whether he had the gear or not there's a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read the 10 orso other comments I made about this topic on several threads here ive stated in every one that there IS a problem, and that is with Ikkinz trials only. It should be fixed by fixing Ikkinz, not by giving existing balance the flick. Knights can tank everything in Kod'Taz just fine, given good enough gear (and im not talking about being geared up like I am either). Knights can tank the endbosses of all 3 trials quite well, though DD might need a bit of work. The only real issue is the Pixxt, Rav and Hexxt. They should be fixed to be less reliant on defensive/evasive/stonewall, but maintain the general overall difficulty. <br />
<br />
You claim that 25% disc would have no impact on content design for raids. This frankly is bullshit. It adds another layer of complexity that devs need to factor in if they want to keep warriors in their only exclusive role as raid tank. In ikkinz raids and Uqua, I often tank the shit there with no disc up if they are close together, ie the class specific golems in Destruction. A knight could tank them just fine also.  There is maybe 2 mobs in the game that I have encountered so far that I couldnt tank reliably with either 25% or 45% disc. The reason this is so is mostly because of their 6k proc on top of heavy melee. 25% disc opens up a huge amount more raid content to be knight tankable RIGHT NOW that shouldnt be. Far more then those 2 mobs. It also makes designing new content all the more hard for SOE.<br />
<br />
I find people complaining about content they havent even seen quite offensive. Its like someone sitting around and bitching about taxes they would have to pay if they were earning 200k a year, when they really work at burger king. I just wish that a bunch of uninformed people would stop pushing this issue with the specific intent of trying to weedle upgrades out of a lazy developer. Paladins and Warriors are at a balance level that hasnt been seen in a long time, near perfect. I do freely admit that SKs could use some work, but that would be in the realm of some spellbook revisions and fixing their +agro spells to work properly. <br />
<br />
No knight needs a mitigation disc/upgrade/anything to make them closer to tanking like a warrior... this is proven by Uqua.</div></div><hr />

Interesting analogy. Even more interesting is the basis that even BB who hates knights with such a passion he should be instituted for it keeps recommending book upgrades + -1 DI + working stuns + heal revisions + a vie like buff etc.<br />
<br />
As for only 3 mobs. That's wrong and you know it. It's more than 3. Sure, knights HAVE managed to tank some of the named but tanking 1 out of 50 tries is not considered ABLE. <br />
<br />
Uqua: Here we go with content I have no access to. Ok so I'm relying on info I have from a paladin friend who's in the top guild of my server, plus relying on a cleric friend who's in the top guild of another server, then I'm using information I've gotten from warriors on this board and PoN compounded with info from paladin posters on PoN and here. Tell me. ALL these ppl of MULTIPLE classes that are dealing with this VERY content at this VERY time being at the APPROPRIATE lvl are all full of shit and lying through their teeth. Interesting indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for my 25% defensive not breaking the game. I'll pose you the question that Frod posed BB. Name 1 encounter where using a knight with the new 25% defensive would remove the warrior from that spot? There is none. And yes I CAN say that because the game is tuned with the following in mind<br />
<br />
45% def<br />
5% inate mitigation<br />
Highest AC<br />
Highest HP<br />
Furious<br />
AE Taunt<br />
<br />
ALL of those things combined are what the devs create content around. Saying that 25% is equal to all that is just plain stupid. No ifs, No ands, No buts. <br />
<br />
YES it WILL allow a knight to be able to tank raid mobs a little sooner than usual, but the fact of the matter is that if you have 75% chance with a warrior and 25% chance with a knight, you're going to use the warrior EVERY SINGLE TIME. Why? Because the game will not give you more LOOT or more XP by using a knight instead.<br />
<br />
And again. It's not like we're NOT primarily tanks because we ARE. It's not like we're asking for *something* to do *something* we've never done before because we AREN'T.<br />
<br />
So, tell me. Where will it break it? HOW can a game tuned to ALL the abilities of a warrior be broken to make knights the PREFERED TANK in all content with but HALF an ability of a myriad possessed by a warrior.<br />

No Annoc. You are a Tank/priest. All three tank classes are interchangable in normal experiance groups. You should have the tools that allow you to perform an add tank/off tank/Combat Medis/CC/GRC/Res role in raids. But Off tank does not mean MTing red high DI mobs or all named high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
Those mobs you get to tank when you posess enough of an expansion's gear to permit it and when your guild's progress has made them relatively trivial.<br />
<br />
It has been that way for quite awile.<br />

-BoT after all they are Giants<br />
-Tactics BIG ogres and stuff that worships RZ.<br />
-Elemental palnes lots of giant type creatures in here. You should see the Crocs.<br />
-TSR again lots of Giant types<br />
-Ferubi GoD zone. Even though I can tank there mobs are stun immune. At least I think they are. Might have to go back and check.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that you're wearing gear from time, part of me doubts you've ever been to any of those zones.<br />
<br />
The Vision's rules on giants went out the window with PoP; or is every giant in storms/bastion immune to mez? They aren't immune to stun either.<br />
Tactics ogres aren't immune to stun (though they are slightly MR, but since your stuns have resist adjusts you don't need to worry about that  :rolleyes: ).<br />
Most, if not all elemental planes trash mobs that are level 65 and under are stunnable; I don't think I've seen any immune to stun, but crocs are definitely stunnable.<br />
TSR's (Tower of Solusek Ro, I'm assuming) most common trash mobs - protector of Ro - are stunnable.<br />
<br />
Let me add to your list - LDoN trash mobs (normal and hard) are all stunnable.<br />
<br />
I've tanked in all of those zones, and while cleric aggro-lock has nothing to do with stun, I use it to mitigate some damage and buy some time when I need it.<br />
<br />
GoD has several different mob types that are reused across various zones; Mastruq, Noc, Hynid, Cragbeast, Kyv, Ra'tuk, Turepta, stonemite, Beludu, Aneuk, Stoneworker, Ukun, Ikaav, pooka, among others. Stunnability varies by zone, but no zone has more than only a few of those flagged unstunnable. <br />
In your example, Ferubi, I've only found Noc to be immune. Same with Qinimi. Barindu and Riwwi I've never tried stuns in. As for Tipt, Vxed and Natimbi, nothing (trash) is immune, and I've stunned plenty in all of those zones. Even named in Natimbi aren't immune.<br />
<br />
Stuns are fine against trash; maybe you should be using stuns appropriate for your level?<br />
<br />
On those mobs, paladins (at least) maintain a significant advantage. A good friend of mine plays a cleric and consistently complains about how much harder it is to keep a warrior alive when tanking hard ldon's vs. paladins because of their stun. He has trouble keeping a 400+ aa 9.5k hp warrior alive (4+ ch's per fight) compared to a 8.5k 60aa paladin (~1 ch per fight). Maybe paladin stuns need to be nerfed?<br />
<br />
Congratulations! Most clerics are mediocre.<br />
<br />
It's either the cleric or the dps. 4 CH chain casted takes 47.5 seconds, so either way that's a loooong time to take killing 1 hard ldon mob. Having to chain CH at all with that solid a tank means your cleric is scared. I've done hard ldon/sewers with a &lt;5khp SK tank and didn't have to chain heal very often; I've tanked hard ldon/solrotower myself using my own CH (1-2 per mob), 1 stun memmed for between aggro spells, and quiescence. It's really not that hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it *is* only 3 mobs that have &quot;broken&quot; the knight class.  If you were actually in Kod'Taz and doing the Ikkinz trials you'd know this.  They are the ONLY 3 mobs in the game in a non-full blown raid setting that I would even expect the knights in my guild to have a hard time with.  Hmm, 1 out of 50.  So, you're telling me you've tried Ikkinz trial #1 50 times and only won once?  Or, wait, you're pulling that number out of your ass.  I don't know what you're sekrit uber friends are telling you about Uqua, but you're only hearing what you want to hear.<br />
<br />
Again, you're comparing getting a 25% defensive skill against the ENTIRE warrior skill-set, saying it's only a minor upgrade and we shouldn't be against it.  You're COMPELTELY ignoring your own AAs and spells in that comparison, however large or small they may be.  (as a side note, defensive does around 45% mitigation MAX, there are many mobs against which it does less)<br />
<br />
I would love to know where you got these &quot;75%&quot; and &quot;25%&quot; numbers from.  Oh wait, you just made them up.  When it comes to doing trials, other than those 3 specific mobs, the failure rate depends solely on the skill of the player behind the tank, not whether or not it's a knight or a warrior (as long as they are equivallently equiped, obviously).  There are several knights that I would give a higher chance at winning a trial over a warrior, and it's not because of a lack of gear on the warrior's part.<br />
<br />
You're primarily a tank, but you're not the primary tank.  You're definately asking for *something* to do *something* you haven't been able to do before.  You're asking to tank on par with or slightly below that a warrior against 3 specific mobs.  Any changes to our CLASSES that would make this come true would be the equivalent of giving druids a 7kCHeal that cost 450 mana (ie, you could then do the Ikkinz trials with 2 druids and no cleric).  It would cause a total cluster fuck in the balance of our classes across the rest of the 99.995% of the content out there that is not related to those 3 specific mobs.  If anything needs fixing, it's those 3 mobs; not our classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really true, but true enough to not quibble over.  However, you do your one thing not by being the &quot;best&quot; tank or even really close to the &quot;best&quot; tank.  You do it by being an &quot;okay&quot; tank combined with additional abilities added by spells.  Yes, I know, you're going to tell me how your spells suck again.  And I'm going to tell you that if you weren't assuming a scenario where you're facing a high DI mob specifically designed to play to the Warrior strength of defensive that those spells would be much more useful.  Do those spells help out against trash mobs?  Yes they do.  Do those spells help out most every place but some parts of GoD?  Yes they do.  Are those spells therefore completely worthless, should be completely discounted and instead Paladins should be made Warriors while left their spells as a &quot;bonus&quot;?  The answer is no.<br />
<br />
And if you have problems with your spells, address the spells.  It makes no sense to say, &quot;my spells don't work like I want them to, make me a Warrior.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Went to Earth today and have to say you are right and I was wrong.   Was actualy the most fun I had in a long time.  My stuns actualy meant something instead of just agro bitch.

Makes skill important instead of just burning the SoB down.  Actualy a nice pop with Cease on inc and regualr interrupts seems to work just fine for agro.<br />

Almost every time ive done priests in trial2, the 2nd tank in the group has been a knight. I can guarantee that knights can tank Flesh Hunters just fine, with 100% success if the group is appropriate (2 healers+decent dps) and doesnt fuck up. That leaves DD, which could do with a little work and the 3 named I mentioned. OH NOZ 4 MOBS! Clearly its far easier to start inventing new abilities then to fix 4 mobs hit pattern to lessen the need for defensive. Much easier to balance too!<br />
<br />
As to Uqua, my guild and the other top guild on my server have both had to use knights there as offtanks multiple times for the traps. Im not talking about tanking the named near the end, im talking about offtanking.. which is what knights should be doing on raids. I guess Veeshan's knights are just made of sturdier stuff then your friends because ive seen it done with my own eyes and they didnt need any special extra healing.

Im not saying it would be equal, im saying its not needed. Its not needed at any level of the game. Paladins and Warriors are nearly perfectly balanced right now except in the 3 trials. SKs could use some work on spellbooks yes, but thats it. There is MANY encounters which a 25% disc would mean that both warriors and knights could have 100% success in. Pretty much every boss in Ikkinz trials except the ones who have 4k melee+6k proc. There would be no point in a warrior tanking anything in Time ever again. The minis in Uqua now post tune. All would be tankable by knights with a 25% disc just fine, infact almost all of them are tankable WITHOUT that disc. Knights are already very close to warrior tanking without narrowing the gap even further, all based on 3-4 mobs in 3 trials.<br />
<br />
Also, you give SOE way too much credit if you think they actually test any of this content based around making it extremely hard to tank. There is currently maybe 2-3 mobs which are actually hard to keep a warrior alive on, given the appropriate gear. DI sees to that. Replace warrior with knight, and the number doesnt raise by much, even WITHOUT your 25% defensive idea.<br />
<br />
There is no need for knights to get a defensive upgrade at all, if anything had to happen apart from fixing the trials its a better quick-patch heal for paladins and some attention to SK spellbooks overall. Continue to run around flailing your arms madly, we all know that the squeeky wheel gets the grease and Sony will eventually cave to your baseless whining if you keep it up long enough. Its a pity that this is true because balance in EQ among tank classes is the best its been in years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
saying that the downside to paladin defensive would be that it would burn up manna is a pretty lame argument presented to a class that doesnt even get manna. &quot;yeah warrior we will mitigate like you but we will use up manna&quot; ... yeah right.<br />
<br />
hey let me tell you more about that epic mob. i have a 65 warrior but my ranger friend tanked the mob and you want to know why? because i told him that the damage i could dish out with my druid if he tanked was superior to the extra damage he would dish out with his ranger if my warrior tanked. he agreed and we went that route. what im saying is that even with the extra mitigation i would have gotten it does not make warrior tanking an automatic choice. we are not an obvious undeniable choice except for the most difficult of all encounters and that is a sliver of a role to base an entire class decision on. and then these complainers want to take this advantage away from us too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's the case, why not give up your spellbook altogether? I mean, you don't get groups because of your spells, your stuns don't work, your heals are useless, your buffs are overwritten by clerics, noone wants a 90% rez... on and on and on... why not give them up and get this tanking fix that is the only thing that matters?<br />
<br />
Yeah. I didn't think so. The FACT is, much as you whine and complain about how useless your spell book is, and how little it does for you, as soon push comes to shove and you're called on to put your money where your mouth is, or in this case challenged to give up the spellbook if it's so useless, you prove your OWN claims false by shutting up instead of putting up.<br />
<br />
I've made this point over and over. If hybrid spells are so terrible, and are so useless, and you so desperately need the tank fix, give up the damn spells that you claim are so useless. But no, not once, EVER, has a SINGLE hybrid, even the most rabid &quot;my spells are all useless&quot; hybrid has proven willing to give them up, when push comes to shove. <br />
<br />
That speaks volumes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally if its only used for the trials, good, im sick of everyone bitching because they have to wait in line with all the other push thru classes even tho there isnt that many people doing this content, if those people are doing trials anything else they could do would probibly be bottomfeeding and something they could do without a mock defensive anyhow.<br />
<br />
as far as knights and getting groups? bullshit, any other zone you can get groups, quite bitching about something most people dont even do for exp, as long as you can get LDoN, BoT, PoF groups then there isnt really a problem<br />
<br />
the group i really feel sorry for is shaman, their play style is ment to be endurance fights, aggro intensive spells they have to spread out... GoD rims them left and right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually been thinking about this for a couple of weeks ago. Now, I've been retired (happily) from EQ for about 2 months now, so I'm not up to date with everything. But, I have had certain experiences with GoD, and I have been reading up on it, somewhat. FRom what I understand, there's a slight bit of exaggeration going on on the part of Knights (gee, this does bring back memories of similar over-stating the truth when warriors complained about agro problems a while back). Anyways, here's what I've gathered<br />
<br />
1) It's not that knights can't tank the GoD trials themselves. THe problem is, they can't (reliably) tank the bosses and a hand-ful of other mobs. While it's certainly not a guarantee, a defensive warrior helps a shit-load in doing so. <br />
<br />
2) Survivability for a Knight IS possible, but it's not very favorable odds, and requires very hefty gear. <br />
<br />
Now, there's an obvious problem with either creating weaker knight-instanced trials and givings knights defensive without adequate compensation. THat problem is, we'd be back to square one, back to PoP, and worse. Giving defensive would also create a whole shit=load of prior content issues. So, what's the middle ground. I think I may have an answer. Like many of my other proposals, it's a multi-step process.<br />
<br />
1) Put all the bosses and other with damage output that creates an UNJUSTLY difficult tanking scenario without defensive in a particular Bane category<br />
<br />
2) Create 2 varying Bane spells, one for each knight class. Have them function as kind of a reverse-BoV type spell. Unresistable, 1 minute duration, 40 minute reuse, very hefty mana cost. The basis would be, it would reduce the damage done by any of the mobs's attacks for the next minute by some %, I would say 20 off DI. THe paladin one, because they are of defensive nature, could be a larger mitigation percentage and have a heal ocmponent. the SK one could have a DoT (stack with everything) component.<br />
<br />
<br />
What, I believe, this solution would accomplish:<br />
1) Create additional survivability without creating defensive<br />
2) Warriors still retain an overall tanking advantage because defensive would still be significantly more mitigation, and better overall.<br />
3) Because it's limited to Bane, it could not be used for the entire trial, just certain mobs. <br />
4) (This i think is really nice). THis creates an actual reason for 2-tank groups. I mean think about it, this will give a very good reason to go double-tank. After all, because you could use this, in combination with defensive, this would actually create a scenario where you can somewhat compensate for a lack of gear that would otherwise make killing a particular boss impossible by bringing say a warrior and a paladin. Of course, the flip side is a loss in DPS throughout the trial.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know certain details would need to be worked out, but I think it's a feasible idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trials in question are single group encounters where every spot in the group is important.  Since the mobs hit for so much damage it is necessary for the Tank to use Defensive to mitigate enough of the damage to give the healer enough time to cast the needed heals.  This means a Warrior needs to be the one Tanking.   Now the problem with Knights comes in since we do not do enough damage to be dps, can't heal enough to get a healer spot.and so on.  Making a group have to piggyback use in as a weak link.  Now I havn't done the trials myself so if there is a person with a better understanding please say so.<br />
<br />
Oh and the Holy Trinity is Warrior, Cleric and Enchanter which came out of Kunark.   This is a thing of the past hough since EQ has changed alot since then.</div></div><hr />

how stupid do you have to be to play a paladin and whine about getting warrior skills?<br />
<br />
-give me your heals<br />
-give me your self buffs<br />
-give me your horse because im tired of taking 10 minutes to run from poe to pok and if i had 100k to spend i sure as hell wouldnt waste it on a horse<br />
-give me knightimization because im tired of hoping for one of the 2 weapons worth a damn before time-loot (both of which are knight usable btw)<br />
-give me DA<br />
-give me stuns because taunt fails 60% of the time, EB and Anger3 don't proc fast enough when the shaman wants to have mobs debuffed and slowed before you are in melee range.<br />
-you get FT15 and C5 to increase your mana regen...my 10, 20, 30 minute reuse times on disciplines don't ever go down, and my yellow mana bar goes down just like yours...where's my FT15 and C5?<br />
<br />
so you can't tank a gates trial? who cares! get into a group with a warrior and practice AoV, or wait and get some upgrades to your gear. we're only a couple months into a halfassed expansion, would you like to just be able to solo your way to the end instead? let's find a level 4 spell you don't use much and make every mob in the expansion completely vulnerable to that. and get some big nukes with critical aa's while you're at it, it's nice to have more dps. we will call it ManaBurn v3.0, &quot;it's the best manaburn ever!&quot; because you can't be bothered to actually PLAY the game...you just want to run to the finish line and wait for everyone. or for the next expansion. NEWS FLASH: There...is...no...end.<br />
<br />
isn't it bad enough that people are running around with 10000 hitpoints unbuffed? anyone remember when the hardest mobs in the game were the 2 dragons with just about as much hitpoints as a pair of guys in Time gear? this game has lost all sense of balance. it used to be hard. no everyone starts with 200 sense heading...WTF?!<br />
<br />
you aren't supposed to be able to tank the hard stuff, you are supposed to have the versatility 2 different classes while having the expertise of neither. my advice is to delete your knight and reroll as whatever class you really wanted to be at creation.</div></div><hr />

You're proposing to change an entire class based on several specific encounters in Gates of Discord.  There is, however, no recognizance of how this will balance the game outside of GoD, where knights already tank just fine.<br />
<br />
And before I get bitched at, I do agree knights have it rough in GoD. I just don't believe giving knights defensive because of their difficulty tanking certain named is the correct way to balance things.   I do, actually, support implementing a 12 second auto-dodge disc for knights during which they cannot cast spells.  My reasoning is simple: The other plate classes (war, brd) enjoy a riposte/auto-dodge disc and two chain classes (rng, rog) also get disciplines akin to this.  The question again is, how does this affect non-GoD content?  I'd say it would have less of an impact than &quot;knight defensive&quot; especially if it were on an hour timer.<br />

The imbalance lies in a few encounters and most knights are trying to slide in massive upgrades to their class with that excuse, I really dont think its going to work this time though, heh.<br />

Knights in my guild tank adds and trash in every zone up to Uqua every single raid, certain knights are even designated add tanks alongside our warriors for every trap in Uqua (designated because of skill, not solely gear) although I agree knights should be able to tank ikkinz single group encounters I dont think Sony should or will fuck up the entire game again because knights whom arent even in these zones (the majority of the whiners) are crying to get it 'fixed' before they even get there.<br />

I still think knights and warriors both should gain an inherent mitigation bonus (warriors being higher ofcourse, like 20% for warriors and 15% for knights) with the extreme dps all of GoD brought to the table, and the fact we as tanks should never be hit as hard as a pansy, frail caster in a silk robe, ever.

Actualy giving all plate classes some type of mitigation just like you said is one of the Idea.   Some of the others are:<br />
<br />
- give a base mitigation for Knights and increase that for Warriors.   <br />
-Tune up the Knight Spell book.  Basicly ideas for Knight spells not just the handed down spells rom our casting parents.  One idea is the Group AotC.<br />
-Defensive.  Many Ideas about this one 1) just basicly get it  2) The mana shield Idea 3) Defensive based around a Shield.  Basicly you must equip it.  This might even give Warriors a reason to use a shield you never know.<br />
-telling SOE they are stupid and just redo the content in question<br />
<br />
<br />
Basicly with this thread I was just tossing out an idea.  Since you have done these encouters please include your knowldge and input it can only help.</div></div><hr />

add to that all melee classes. im personally tired of seeing enchanters pulling and tank-mezzing myself. i also dont get a lot of thrills out of any game that comes down to cheal chains that try not to miss a single round so that it requires one-rounding to take the mt down. to me thats twitch play if ive ever seen it.<br />
<br />
but it cant be done. its too late. it would trivialize so much so suddenly that it would throw the game into turmoil. so scrap the idea. i have a better idea though. NEXT expansion add more mitigation aa's that melees get and casters dont. that or hitpoints or both. like i said when enchanters are caught tanking high end named mobs just so their guilds can get a good laugh (cant remember the thread but yes its been done) i think its a good sign that casters benefited too much from hp buffs hp gear and mitigation aa.<br />

in replay to another post .. yes .. i know that GoD trials are single group affairs that because of their difficulty require each member to be selected according to the most stringent criteria. that is you need a mt you need a slower you need a healer you need 3 dps. and a paladin isnt any of those if he is not mt so if a warrior tanks the paladin is left in a position of being a drag on the group's performance. i never doubted or disputed this. i sympathize with paladins in this regard since clearly it means they have to humble themselves and beg their guilds to allow them to do it  EVEN THOUGH it will reduce the chances of success. but failure is nothing but wasted time. its no different from asking your guild to help with a named mob that you need for a personal quest (like the epics) where you and you only will be given the honor of looting. so you fail. so you try again. so the guild tells you &quot;you owe us one now for all the help we gave you&quot;. its a bummer. but ...<br />

Actualy a Knight is unable to tank not because there is a Warrior in the group but because the mobs in question do so much damage that defensive is required.  That means a Warrior must be the MA.   So I guess you think you are so cool and we are not.  Good thing SOE disagrees with you and is planning to retune the encounter.</div></div><hr />

Annoc, that simply is not true.  The problem is not that Knights absolutely can not succeed.  The problem is that they don't succeed very frequently and when they do it's more as a result of getting lucky with the random number generator than anything.  Knights have succeeded at the trials.  So saying that Warriors MUST be the MA is false.  If instead you say that the odds of succcess go up dramatically when a Warrior is MA and most people prefer to succeed, that would be more accurate.<br />
<br />
And I agree that it's a good thing SoE is planning to retune the encounter.</div></div><hr />

&lt;&lt;Annoc, that simply is not true. The problem is not that Knights absolutely can not succeed. The problem is that they don't succeed very frequently...&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
actually i wasnt even contemplating a knight tanking but rather acting as a poor man's dps / healer for the GoD trial. yes the trial MIGHT succeed with paladin as MT and just the same the trial MIGHT succeed if the paladin replaces a dps class like a rogue. whatever the roll for the paladin the assumption seems to be (and hence the complaint) that a group is not &quot;optimal&quot; if it includes a paladin.<br />
<br />
this may be true and to that i say SOME groups are better if they include a paladin. indeed SOME groups are better if they include a paladin and leave out a warrior. so now if paladins are upgraded for the sole purpose of making GoD trials easier this same upgrading will result in them being far more desirable than warriors in an excessive number of experience group situations. its more important to be desired for exp groups than for GoD trials because for every trial you do you will do a very large number of exp groups and if you cant get into exp groups you will never even be able to think about trials.<br />
<br />
and do i really think im better than a paladin? well when i play my warrior i usually dont recruit paladins but this is because i prefer pet classes to melees except for the main tank and im already in any group that i recruit by default. add to that that about 90 percent or more of the groups im in ive recruited myself.<br />
<br />
but now suppose instead i were on my druid and i were recruiting an experience group for bot for valor for ldon or whatever. i dare say in most instances i would probably take the paladin and leave out the warrior and this is most true for ldon. how does it make me feel that my main is a warrior but my alt would recruit a paladin? it makes me feel like paladins are better all around class than warriors for many exp grinds. the main exception would be grinds that can be done with little or no need for pacifying. and if paladins are my pick for the average exp grind then im against improving their defense.</div></div><hr />

The player that takes into consideration every aspect of a class, gives it thought, and then makes an educated opinion about class balacing is someone who does not keep their head in their ass.<br />
<br />
Paladin spells are usefull.  I doubt when the dev's think of new paladin spells they sit around saying &quot;lets give THIS to paladins, it will make them suck!.&quot; If you think you dont gain alot of benefit from being a paladin, roll a warrior and level him to 65.  That is a challenge.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 Warrior and a 65 Paladin, and i can say from experience both is better for different things.  To the arguement of &quot;Paladins need something to keep up in mitigation with warriors due to a trial that is being revamped that makes up a small portion of the games content.  The answer to this is a defensive type disc/spell&quot; is to me a joke.<br />
<br />
Sony went with the idea of creating one group content designed for time geared players.  While this was a good concept, making it to where the boss mobs have low HP but hit very hard was quite ignorant IMO.  While this serves the purpose of giving clerics something more then Cheal to cast, it was ill thought out.  History has dictated that not all content is hard because the mob hits harder then another mob.  When multiple adds are present, when a mob has a AE, when a mob has special abilities, many other factors can make an encounter hard.  There are many options to make the trials hard then to say &quot;this mob is farther content then one group content before it, it should hit harder and that makes it harder.&quot;  Conent is being rebalanced, i would hope the dev's have come up with a way to keep the trials difficult for time geared players while giving knights more survivability.<br />
<br />
Id imagine if more knights on the sony live boards, or even on PoN bitched more about how the content revamp should reflect how the content could be hard and still very doable by knights, this would be more of a sure bet.  Instead what ive seen recently is alot of knights bitching that they need defensive to do anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's start with this one:<br />
<br />
You mention that Paladins need to find what SOE wants our role to be. We are Tanks. We don't get Groups, raid jobs or anything else because we can cast. While it does help its not the reason. We do one thing and that is Tank.<br />
<br />
See, the problem here is that some Paladins (not all mind you) are so intent on proving their point, they will LIE to make their own ideas seem more on par. However, this only accomplishes the exact opposite; and anybody with any common sense realizes this. When you lie to try and prove your point, you look stupid. There's no two ways about it.<br />
<br />
Paladins get groups because they can do things Warriors cannot. PERIOD. In PoP, what was the prominent reason that Paladins got groups over Warriors? I assure you it was NOT their ability to tank. It was their ability to hold aggro instantanously from the second a mob entered the camp, allowing your enchanter/shaman to tash/slow/malo/whatever. Personally, I also liked having an SK as the main tank simply for the ability to have a snaring class without taking up an extra slot that could be filled with a different kind of utility class, like a monk or another rogue - and SKs could generate the same kind of instantaneous aggro that Paladins could with stuns, on a pull. <br />
<br />
But hey, says Mr. Paladin, I don't get jobs on raids because of my spellbook either. That's such utter bullshit, how do you sleep at night? Do you realize how invaluable the fact that you can CURE DISEASES is? Regardless that you can't do it as great as a Cleric (oh woe is me) that means that YOU, the PALADIN, can be designated to heal the MA from nasty effects while sparing Clerics and Druids to focus on actually healnig damage. Actually, I daresay you shouldn't need to be designated - you're a utility character, you have a spellbook and on EVERY PAGE you should act as if the word &quot;VERSITILITY&quot; was written at the top!!! Not to mention your spotheals can make the difference between a dying character waiting for a more powerful heal, and well, a dead character.<br />
<br />
On encounters like the Rathe Council, when you position the mobs (ideally 3 on each side of the cave) who uses their AA stun to move them into place while mezzed to facilitate easier targetting on behalf of the Enchanters or Bards? It's NOT a Warrior, I'll tell you that much!<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you're the diet coke of tanks. It was supposed to be that way. Why would anybody make a Warrior if you could make a class with just as good tanking capabilities AND a spellbook on TOP of the tanking abilities? No, you can't do it as good as a Warrior and frankly you shouldn't do it that good. <br />
<br />
Now let's discuss your spellbook. Who ever said your spellbook was supposed to make you an equal tank with a Warrior? I don't ever recall hearing that specifically stated. The fact is, your spellbooks give you utility. What you do with that utility depends on how intelligent and creative you are.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, well, I guess you've clearly owned me  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
No but seriously I can understand you're having difficulty sticking to the facts of what I posted, and instead feel forced to display your manlyness through your childish fit of rage directed against me. Denial is a hard thing man.<br />
<br />
Paladins (and Shadow Knights) are given utility through their spellbook to make up for their lack of ability to tank on par with a Warrior.<br />

I stand by my post.<br />

All of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's paladins like those whose opinions you know you can discount, because they just don't know what they're talking about. Either that, or they choose to ignore the truth.</div></div><hr />
