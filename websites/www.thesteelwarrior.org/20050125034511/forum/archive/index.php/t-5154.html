<br />
                 Just wondering if you guys have any ideas of what I could upgrade too. I never normally have more then 3k at a time. I can always save a little more if needed. Any idea's you guys could offer would be great.<br />
<br />
Magelo link below: Can't seem too get the food stats too add. So the stats are a fair bit higher with hero and grob liquidised meat.<br />
<br />
Thanks again fellas,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlorr</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm by no means an expert.. in fact, I am working up to making my own post in this section to get some help..<br />
<br />
But the first thing that screams out at me is haste. You simply have to upgrade your haste, don't care what slot 22% ain't enough. Dig around on Alla's for what you can camp since money is tight. <br />
<br />
Speaking of money 3k in the bank at your level is very easy to fix, you just need to farm greens for a week or so somewhere. Hell most mobs over level 20 drop 5pp a piece plus sellables so you could raise a ton more money than 3k if you got serious about it.<br />
<br />
As far as armor goes, in my very noob opinion it looks like shoulder is your weakest slot. I just came out of a 18 month retirement so I forget the name of the quest, but there is a quest in velious for good shoulders. <br />
<br />
Weapons? you have the one item that everybody here seems to point to for best bang for the buck for aggro/dps vs cost so it would seem you are good there.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, and if any of you elders detect a flaw in my advice please be kind and teach us both. :)<br />
<br />
edit: removed some bad info about shoulder quest</div></div><hr />

<br />
The quest shoulders you could get easily with 1 or maybe 2 other people are the Draconic Pauldrons.  See my magelo for stats.  Dependent on Skyshrine faction  of course.  Very easy quest to do.  Get to WW, kill 4 mobs to left just outside of the tunnel, loot 4 heads, turn them in and done.<br />
<br />
Since you are level 65, do LDoN.  There are some nice drops in all the zones and the eventual points you make you can buy some upgrades.  The legs in my magelo are 760 points in Everfrost for example.  The North Ro camp armor is probably the best for pure melee in LDoN.  <br />
<br />
To replace your haste, try and get a soulscream belt.  Save your plat for it if necessary.  Depending on your servers economy, it'll cost you between 25 and 40k.  That's 31% haste on your belt slot with nice stats.<br />
<br />
Last bit of advice I would give to you is replace your rings with Valorium rings of Gallantry and your earrings with something better.  Since you are on a limited budget, bloodmetal earrings of engagement are probably out since they are 20 to 30k on my server each.<br />
<br />
Hope this gets you going in the right direction on some decent upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soulscream is a great belt, besides the 31% haste, it has nice STA and HP, it would be a nice upgrade for you.<br />
There are better earrings you can get at your lvl, and if you have ny GM Jeweler friend, you can try to get him the pieces for Valorium Rings (drop in PoV). Electrified Earring of Tempests are not bad either, if you cant get Bloodmetal due to monetary reasons (I think the stuff drops in Tactics.. too early in the morning right now) :)<br />
See if you can replace the neck and visor with the Underfoot versions, or maybe if you feel lucky, quest an Eyepatch of Plunder (can be a suicidal camp tho), or just get another you can buy :)<br />
The Miragul's armor is pretty nice, I have Arms and Legs, you can check on the Magelo for stats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lexchess</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mosquito Leg Earrings (ac8 sta7 hp65 dr7) have come way down on some servers.  Cheaper than the Bloodmetal.  There are alot of earrings these days that are nice.  Earring of the Solstice (ac5 str6 sta5 wis8 int8 hp55 mana55 fr5 cr5 mr5 FT1) is still nice and easy quest.<br />
<br />
Check out some of the bows to replace your range item.  Bone Carved Shortbow (ac5 sta7 agi7 hp50 dr10) is one example.<br />
<br />
Since you are obviously doing LDoN with all the augments you have.  Go to PoK and get your Intricate Wooden Figurine and put your Adventurer's Stone on it and then do the simple quests to make your Adventurer Stone give you stats.  Not much, but it is free.<br />
<br />
Crinose Cape of the Werewolf (ac12 str7 dex7 hp80 cr12) is usually a cheap back item with great hps.<br />
<br />
Your rings seem fine to me since you have augmented both already.<br />
<br />
I would agree with everyone above though about your haste.  The hands / waist combo (hp0 sta5) you have is terrible.  Even if you don't improve your haste much, you should be able to increase hps / stats with better gloves and haste belt.  Soulscream Belt is sweet but can be expensive.  Do some research and check out other haste options if you have too.<br />
<br />
Take care and have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Equipping a warrior is pretty darn interesting especially given constraints of guild, number of friends, twinkiness, and playtime.<br />
<br />
For better or for worse, you can upgrade almost every slot easily, though perhaps not quickly.  Research how to craft this:<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
you can win the parts in normal exp groups in PoV.  Will cost you very little and you'll get great AAs.<br />
<br />
Same thing for these<br />
Electrified Earring of Tempests<br />
<br />
Face - look at Grimling Contraption in my magelo or Crystal Spider Eyes.<br />
<br />
Head - Helm of raldukan, winning by one group in UP.<br />
<br />
Wrist - I'd be tempted to replace the Silver Chitin Wristband with another underfoot bracer.  Or consider stat-rich<br />
Bracer of Benevolence<br />
<br />
Arms - Thurgadin/Skyshrine quest if you have friends<br />
<br />
Hands - Myrmidon (Skyshrine) again, if you have friends. Or Blood Runed Gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - /agree Draconic Pauldrons, as per above<br />
<br />
Belt - /agree Soulscream as per above<br />
<br />
Legs - Cobalt Greaves, if you can kill VS, Myrmidon otherwise<br />
<br />
Weapons - GSoT is fine<br />
<br />
Further, you can improve every major armor slot from LDoN.  Tak if you playtime is high, Mir if it is not.  I'd avoid the Tak legs, and the Mir BP and Bracers. Here are the miragul legs, 760 points, which isn't all that many:<br />
Malevolent Greaves of Suffering<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest that you just get a nice group (at the least, someone to snare, slow, tank and heal), take them to veksar, and just LIVE there for a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Soulscream belt - a very nice 31% haste belt with good stats, you won't be replacing it until you can get a 40+% haste item from a raid.<br />
<br />
Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets - SEXY SEXY gloves, plenty of STA, AC and HPs.<br />
<br />
Mithril Spiked Collar - Good AC/STA/HP neck item<br />
<br />
Those are just a few examples. And thats just stuff you can use yourself, Veksar is filled TO THE BRIM with named mobs that drop loot that EVERY class can use. Even if the most popular named spawns are camped, nobles, highborns, and highborn commanders (which there are entire rooms of spread across veksar) have chances to drop nice loot too, so unless theres 90 people in veksar camping every square inch of the zone, you should be able to find some nice spot to sit down in and kill.<br />
<br />
I also suggest you work on skyshrine faction - theres two quests there that will yield EASY upgrades. Look on allakhazam for &quot;Draconic Pauldrons&quot; and &quot;Bracer of Benevolence&quot;.<br />
<br />
The rest of the upgrades I can suggest I wear myself, so if you want to, check my magelo alternate profile &quot;Upgrades (soonish)&quot; If you see stuff you like, look it up on allakhazam to see how to craft it or where to camp it. Paying for items isn't your only option, you know. :P</div></div><hr />
