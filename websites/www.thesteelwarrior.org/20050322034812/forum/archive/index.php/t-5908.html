<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyson Dycson</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an option on the General options tab, Alt + O, that will Allow Context Windows.  This option will either allow you to right click on windows for a menu or not.  Only thing I can think of.</div></div><hr />

Hope this helps!<br />

The problem you are having with the yes/no confirmation buttons or the skills window button as well as possibly other button issues is a corruption that is relatively common. it is not due to the UI, but rather the OPTION files in the Main EQ folder and possibly some .DLL files or .EXE files. It is unsure exactly what causes this and what works for some doesn't work for all. However if you do all of the things below in order, you should be able to get your UI fixed with as little inconvenience as possible. <br />
<br />
First off, delete the following files from your Everquest folder:<br />
<br />
eqmain.dll<br />
eqgame.exe<br />
eqgfx_dx8.dll<br />
<br />
Next, load the game and let the patcher reload those files as well as do a complete file check. This will ensure you have a fresh version of these files and has been known to fix some people's problems. <br />
<br />
If this doesn't fix your problem, then open your Everquest directory and remove ALL files with the extension .OPT by cutting them and pasting them in another folder. Then load the game and let the patcher reload those files as well as do a complete file check. If this doesn't fix your problem, then take your original files that you removed first and cut and paste them back into your Everquest directory, overwriting the files that the patcher just loaded back. This will save some of your personal settings since we now know that these files aren't your problem. If this does fix your problem, then you are free to put these files back into your Everquest folder one by one by process of elimination to save whatever settings that you can until the problem comes back, in which case you need to completely delete the last file you put back that restarted the button malfunction problem and whatever settings are lost will have to be redone in game manually. <br />
<br />
Lastly, if this still doesnt fix your problem, then you need to delete the EQClient.ini file found in the Everquest directory and let the patcher replace that file. Most likely, this step will fix your problem if the other replaced files have failed, however at the expense of having to reset a lot of personal preferences and settings, as this file is the main settings file for the game. Still, a small price to pay for being able to accept a rez once again.<br />
<br />
On the slim chance that all of these fixes have failed, you will need to contact sony tech support and let them try to acknowledge their own mistake and hopeflly give you more alternatives other than the steps we have already had you take to correcet this problem of theirs. <br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
