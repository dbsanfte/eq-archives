   on that note, what about greaves?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can only get 170hp + slot3 aug if you had purchased the BP BEFORE the patch.  With the BP now being slot 1, 2, 3 its only 167hp if you get one 15hp ALLslot aug from hard missions and one 12hp ALLslot aug from normal missions, which imo is a waste of slots on minimal hp.  You'd probably be better off auging it with . . . <br />
<br />
-slot1- 10AC ALLslot aug - 510 MM<br />
-slot2- 40hp slot2aug - 1150 Takish<br />
-slot3- veng4 slot3aug - ? ?(I know there is one and that its at least 1150 points, but I forgot where)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 10 AC aug is only Shoulders, Neck, Mask, Belt, Cloak.<br />
<br />
So for the slot 1 / Type 1, Shrug, Warriors choice.  But you are looking at maybe 10 in any stat, or the 12 HP / 15 HP any slot augment.  So, better AC than Ornate, good charisma, but not much else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">12/15 hp augment is now type7, they changed those in the patch too. Ones before remain all types tho.<br />
<br />
Vengence3 type 3 chest only is from mistmoore 510pts, veng4 type 3 is 1150pts from guk but multi slot. veng4 type 3 is also 1450 pts from guk under a different name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They changed the 10/12/15 hp/mana dropped augs to type7?  I haven't seen any straight hp/mana augs drop since the patch, all the stat/save augs are still ALL slot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Long story short, the max hps on LDoN bp is now 140hps.  You cannot add AC to it.  The cheap vengence3 for BP only is probably the best type3 aug for it.  Ornate bp is now equivalent or better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">imo the way it should have been</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The prechange LDoN by was too good for the effort. 69ac 210hp is just too much for what equates to exp grinding.<br />
<br />
However, the prenerf BP with the post nerf augments would have been perfect. If you have a pre-nerf BP, you can still make a 69ac 170hp +effect BP, which is very good, but not too good. That would put it on par or slightly ahead of previous expansion top end BPs but not so far ahead that it makes the others not worth getting.<br />
<br />
Post nerf BP can only get 140hp+effect and some wussy Type 1 augment making it at best equal to ornate for a ton more effort. In the time it would take to get a Tak BP+1 augment, you could have farmed a dozen ornate BPs and ended up with a better BP in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your're kidding right . . . . . <br />
<br />
Unless you have lucky dice and raid the mini's often i highly doubt you'll get a dozen in the time it has taken me to amass 1500 points.  It's not like ornate BP's have been falling from the sky's raining down on everyone.  <br />
<br />
Just look around on these threads to see people complaining about the drop rate on the BP's . . . and a bunch of effort in LDoN is just a lame excuse.  I have a group of friends . . . we do a couple adventures everynight . . . we have fun  . . . complete about 1 misison in about an hour at 51 points per that's 153 points a night.  In 2 weeks I have walked away with the BP, in another couple i'll have it augmented.  This is not hard core raiding, and a bunch less risk than BoT and in basically less than a month i'll have what i want.  <br />
<br />
That said yes the post nerf LDoN armor is not nearly as appealing, but then again neither is raiding in BoT hoping for some hot dice.  Guess my perspective is skewed because i am not in a raiding guild that is farming ornate, but i hardly consider the ornate drops easier than grinding away on LDoN adventures.  <br />
<br />
Ideally these items were targeted at casual type guilds anyway, and for the warrior in a &quot;family&quot; guild this is a massive opportunity as compared to rolling in a pickup group in BoT (only to lose and watch as your mold is sold in the bazaar . . . . bitter . . . me  . . . . no)  I don;t really mind if ornate is better, for me this is a vast improvment over the crap cultural armor that dwarves got stuck with.  <br />
<br />
If you are in a guild that is raiding in ssra, vt or better then do yourself a favor and just drive by LDoN and get your anger aug's and never come back (well maybe for a +40hp type 7 aug).</div></div><hr />

It takes 30 LDoN normal risk raids to buy a BP, in that amount of time, you could get 30 Eindride kills. He always drops 2 items and his loot table is BP+3 other items so you would have 60 chances to get a BP (drops seem to be pretty even, so you would probably get 10-15 BPs in 30 kills). I guess the trick is getting 2-3 groups of people interested in farming the towers.<br />
<br />
FYI - if you can put together enough people to do a mini tower raid, once you get some practice, you can clear the 3 easy towers in about 2 hours. If you know the Kuanbyr fight, you can do all 4 towers in about 3 hours. That's 8 piece of very nice gear and usually some specs and runes every 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wander, <br />
<br />
i won;t debate you on how &quot;easy&quot; it is, but i can;t imagine that i've read as many posts complaining about ornate drops when they are as &quot;easy&quot; to get as you describe.  Maybe i just refuse to believe . . . and that may be true . . . however pickup groups in my experience are almost always very BAD, and are lucky not to wipe 5 times before killing one mini.  Not that it can;t be done . . . but easy would be if you are in a guild with the power to put out 2-3 groups and farm.  <br />
<br />
i took a nice break from EQ shortly before the flood gates opening patch where everyone and their brother was let into tier2+ in PoP.  Since i have been back nothing frightens me more than the thought of a &quot;pickup group&quot; in PoP . . . and nothing is remotly as scary as a pickup raid in BoT . . .  Maybe my thoughts are skewed . . . but i'd rather fight and grind with people I know and can trust (in a 6 man guild group adventure) than facing the unknown pickup group in a zone like BoT.  Maybe on your server it is different . . . but lately on mine we have got a bunch of ebay rejects running around and it's bad enough in LDoN zones where the mobs are not nearly as tough.  had a level 58 cleric who could not find where North Ro was . . . .  had a level 41 druid who did not know how to either 1) /split the loot at the end of an adventure 2) sell off items from adventure to split 3) or snare a mob (thankfully I was playing my alt ranger and took care of that problem.)  <br />
<br />
Call me skiddish, scared, unlucky . . . whatever but imho a pickup group in BoT is just a bad idea right now but your experience may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ah Tharak, you have missed one very important point - or rather assumed. I 100% agree with you about any type of pick up raids - not just PoP, anywhere. I don't do pick up raids, ever, period. Too much idiot factor.<br />
<br />
You'll notice that I never said &quot;pick up raid&quot;, but rather a mini raid of 2-3 groups. I farm the towers quite regularly, but it is with people I know. That is really the challenge, getting 2-3 groups together, particularly without a guild. Incedently, I am the only person from my guild that participated in the tower farming, everyone else is from other guilds, just friends I have made over the years in various places.<br />
<br />
If you can get a couple of groups together, then I would highly recommend doing it. You can pick up the FB4 shield, a GBoS, a GSot4W, and a plate BP in pretty short order if you do the towers with any regularity. I suggest it for everyone, the rewards are well worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">aye i see your point.  I have a close group of friends but unfortunatly our numbers are thining as more and more people are getting bored or fed up with &quot;balancing&quot; so I prob have 2 groups maybe i can pull together.  <br />
<br />
With LDoN I can easily pull together 6 though and it's quick easy and well everyone is looking forward to something (even if melee still gets the shaft out of this expansion as usual, but that would be another thread eh).  I could farm BoT, but more work to organize these days, easier to justify spending time with a small group.  Besides with a good group of 65's we tear through LDoN, and I wanted to get yak/anger3 aug anyhow armor is just icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />
