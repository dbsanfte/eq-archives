<br />
1. Vadd's BP. I suppose if you look at the Raex and Vadd BP+Guantlets as a set it's not too terrible, but the Vadd's BP does seem a little anemic. I'd heard SoE was looking into this??<br />
<br />
2. No real Warrior 2H aggro weapon in PoTime (VDD is kinda makedo) and I've not heard of one in GoD either. 2H aggro weapons being phased out?<br />
<br />
3. Quality/variety of offhand aggro weapons?<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atilette</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion :<br />
<br />
1. Vadd BP is not that bad compared to others classes BP (I would even say it's one of the best upgrade)<br />
<br />
2. Isn't Halberd of Endless Pain a good 2 h aggro weapon ?<br />
<br />
3. Demerix the Painsipper, Hammer of the Timeweaver, Jagged Onyx Staff, Verge of the Mindless Servant, Aranini's Rage, Chaotic Black Scimitar, Edge of Eternity. That makes a few options for offhand. You have to augment them with Anger III, but those are all very viable options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1: Most muramite BPs are worthless junk over PoTime. Minimally worth it over PoTime for us, the 1% shielding and a level2 melee focus with zero agro benefit don't disguise the fact that a small hp/ac upgrade aren't enough on their own. I'm sticking with Raex, and the majority of the guild in all classes are sticking with their PoTime BPs<br />
<br />
2: Looks like it, yup. To come close to compensating for two native procs plus two anger3 procs, a 2-hander would have to be obscene.<br />
<br />
3: GoD has got millions of options for offhand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between Vadd and Raex BP is pretty much the same as other Vadd vs PoTime pieces.  I don't see what's wrong with it.  It could have a total of 110 resist instead of 90 but other than that I don't see a problem with it.  It doesn't have Echo of Anger but that's what Vadd's Gauntlets are for.  Cleave 2 isn't all that great but it's something you didn't have before, and a Warrior isn't likely to have a Cleave 3 item (at least based on current loot) so it's something extra.  Spellshield mod is very good.  So you lose riposte 8% for spellshield and cleave 2.  Not exactly a bad trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if a swing hate is constant whatever the kind of swing it is, then increasing ripost rate means a little increase of aggro generation (not that much I agree). Cleave 2 is howsome, but for our purpuse, a melee focus on ripost (even at it's first step) would have make more sense.<br />
<br />
Note : cleave effect may not be actually a melee focus since it doesn't increase directly the crit rate but add a bit of it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't have Echo of Anger but that's what Vadd's Gauntlets are for. <br />
I've already 'skipped' Vadd's boots in favor of the superior runt boots. I'm skipping Vadd's bracers in favor of superior Quarm I already have and vastly superior Xxeric's I'll get very soon. I skipped Vadd's arms because I have comparable Brute ones from Time and ACM arms are arguably superior. Vadd's hat rocks for warriors, but there is probably a plate hat in Texvu or early Tacvi too. I fully expect to see a major upgrade over Vadd's for the hand slot well before I see one for the chest slot.<br />
<br />
Vadd's gloves offer redundancy for EoA effect, but all the evidence leads me to expect to ditch them before finding a new BP. Even moreso with the first Tacvi mob dropping an armortype bracer for each armor bracket, I'd be surprised if there weren't Texvu plate gloves waiting to be discovered (possibly from Golem event near Zun) and probable Tacvi plate gloves right around the corner<br />
<br />
 Cleave 2 isn't all that great but it's something you didn't have before, and a Warrior isn't likely to have a Cleave 3 item (at least based on current loot) so it's something extra. <br />
Cyno drops a Cleave3 neck, Zun drops a Cleave3 ring. Whilst niether are spectacular, they also don't suck for a warrior, and the ring especially is a decent second ring with huge hp/ac (250/35)<br />
<br />
Spellshield mod is very good.  So you lose riposte 8% for spellshield and cleave 2.  Not exactly a bad trade.<br />
Not a bad trade, sure, but it's a lateral one with a slight increase rather than a direct/obvious upgrade.</div></div><hr />

1. imho only downside of Vadd's BP is resists if u compare to Raex.<br />
<br />
2. like Atilette mentioned HoEP from the runt event is a nice 2h aggro weapon, however if u want aggro weapons why not DW?<br />
<br />
3. Atilette already mentioned above. There are plenty in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gundahar</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with vad bp is, that you either skip it or take vad gaunts as well to keep the aggro mod. With this combo you cant switch to carved bones or whatever may drop later in tacvie.<br />
<br />
The muramite armor with nearly similiar stats for many classes is ridiculous and shows how less efforts were put in reasonable item-design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthious</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you guys fail to realize is that the loot past qvic is just filler loot, since we have the next expansion right around the corner. I doubt any serious thought went into any of it.<br />
<br />
Probably only exception is the class specific items out of Tacvi, and at this point it just looks like tweaked versions of their Time counterparts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point of the Qvic armor molds is not that they are so much &gt; Quarm loot - they aren't, most of them are marginal upgrades - but that they drop like rain.  If you get to Qvic, you can load up on this stuff as a guild rapidly, instead of having to farm Time for a year to reach similar levels of HP/AC and resists.<br />
<br />
Qvic is basically the Elemental planes of GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing Txevu has all visible pieces minus bracer/bp/legs I really doubt those slots will be duplicated in Tacvi, so we're already looking at the best we can get, and Vadd is better than Txevu for the most part.<br />
<br />
Quarm and Xxeric are both better than Vadd's but not everyone will have one.  Vadd bracers are better than anything besides the two mentioned before which make them pretty reasonable choices especially given their abundance.</div></div><hr />

Some time items are arguably better but much rarer. <br />

I really do hate the 10.5 k price tag tho :/ I thought I d finally moved on from the need for pp, but now I need to sell stuff again &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well yes obviously M'shas are too easy encounters(can be done with 2clerics when u have a bard), however I do not think they need to be adjusted they are fine as they are. Think it as prizes beating uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they want to make it harder, just tack on another -100 to both of Msha's AEs and the encounter suddenly becomes quite a bit more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo, the ease of the Msha's is evidence of GoD's poor design.  In PoP, you had the entire Elemental Plains, all well thought out, balanced and itemized, that were designed both to keep folks busy for a few months and gear them up for Time.  Raiding in the Elementals was fun, even after you had been doing it for months.  Qvic is a pointless pinata fest after the first couple of times you do it.  <br />
<br />
I imagine they woke up one day and realized that they had done a crap job itemizing Ikkinz, and that all those rotting elf boot ranger swords weren't going to gear guilds up to survive Iktuta and beyond.  So Qvic became pinata land.   I can't think of another zone in the entire game that's comparable in terms of loot for effort.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree, but I point out two side effects to this assertion. Use of a shield even with a great 1Hdr like DBoW when MTing is at least to my mind pretty iffy. Epic 2.0, if it's to be an aggo weapon, is going to have to be pretty outstanding.<br />
<br />
Nayl posted:<br />

At the same time getting to QVic isn't exactly a stroll in the park. QVic's drops are also fairly limited. IF you can get there, then your guild can get a lot of armor drops. BUT, compared to a 4-5 hour PoTime clearing and it's wider variety of drops perhaps not so out of whack.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see anything wrong with Qvic.  Instead of having 6 or 16 slightly different mobs that drop 2 visible pieces once per 4 days you have 3 mobs that are all exactly the same that drops 2 pieces of loot every 6-8 hours.  How many times can you do PoFire before it gets boring?  And if you actually make the mobs different, all it means is that people wouldn't want to do the harder ones.  For example you sure don't see anyone do Avatar of Dust because it's actually hard (or rather Sigismond is hard).  Back when Ofoosa was hard people simply don't kill Ofoosa and get their elemental boots elsewhere.<br />
<br />
If difficulty is an issue, make Dark Mass save at -250 and Swirling Matter at -350.  It is not done because it is not necessary to be challenged for what amounts to the same as PoFire farming.  If it's hard, people will complain farming sucks.  If the encounters are different, peopel will complain why are some encounters harder, and most likely just avoid the ones that are difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 2h agro weap - i'll ask and get back to you guys on. If theres anything else let me know.<br />
<br />
One thing I do know is that our epic is going to be a 1h weapon - something to think about when making gear choices atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think Qvic is all that out of whack. I wouldn't mid if the M'shas where a little harder, like others have said a simple resist adjustment would make them more challenging. Right now having a bard basically trivializes them.<br />
<br />
I like Cyno, but he should have 3 non armor drops. Same with the animal ring. Due to the length of the encounter the reward should be 3-4 non armor items. I would lean towards 4 because it takes a lot longer than Cyno. Maybe tone down the HPs or something and make it 3 drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah like PoFire was really balanced before the nerf..... it should have been called &quot;plane of raining lewtz&quot;, PoW was the same btw, all minis were easy as shit (well, at least when they added mobs in PoW). On a last note about planes itemisation, rotting leather was really fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;If theres anything else let me know&quot;<br />
<br />
If you get a chance, could you suggest to them to upgrade the page that shows pictures of the epics on the OoW site?  All they have up is the same four pictures they had for the last 2 months and the rest of the epic weapons are question marks.  OoW is out in 2.5 weeks.  <br />
<br />
I would just like to see sort of what it will look like is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOW things haven't been updated because they've been working on the newer live additions (raid functionality, other fixes).<br />
<br />
That one was easy :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I second the suggestion the zoo and Cyno should have muramite armor molds removed from their table. It makes no sense you can kill zoo and find the same loot on the corpse as you'd get from killing a Msha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO 2hders should either have really awesome procs, or an innate proc mod.<br />
<br />
There are lots of good offhanders in GoD, barely need an &quot;aggro&quot; offhander if you have Raex+Clicky+DB/Fleshbiter, high DPS + minor proc + A3 is more then enough. The biggest lack of offhander is a type of offhander that works well w/o a FB/DBoTWL.<br />
<br />
GoD could definatly use a good clicky proc though.<br />
<br />
Murmamite BP and lesser Degree legs definatly need a look at accross the board, I'm told that they will be looked, but dunno when.</div></div><hr />

Qvic is just a side-note supplement almost, on slower nights when lockouts are up, or the jucier mobs in txevu are down or something, it's a nice place to swing through and clean up real quick.</div></div><hr />
