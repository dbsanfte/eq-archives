There's been a problem with melee balance for close to a year now, that much is not up for debate. For most of that time, quite a few months now, we've been told to chill, because &quot;we're working on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
No &quot;this is what we're working on: upgrading warrior agro, or nerfing knightemization a little, or considering putting warriors on another defense table.&quot; Nope. What we got every time was &quot;we're workin on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, there's one thing I have issue with: if you work on any given thing for the better part of 8 months, wouldn't it stand to reason that you'd have some kind of progress report on the thing? Maybe I'm way off base here, but if you work on something for months on end, shouldn't you at least be able to say &quot;look, we've been working on it, and no luck so far. We tried A, B, C and D so far, they all failed like Bob Dole at an orgy... sorry! We've still got E and F to try, wish us luck!&quot; Or maybe, &quot;we haven't done any coding yet for fear of screwing up the code, but we've been tossing ideas around the office. Here are some examples.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anything. Even if it's a string of failures and disappointments, you're bound to have some kind of an update to give, right? I don't know, maybe my idea is way outlandish. But in my world, you can't work on something for 8 months and not move an inch from where you started from. To rip off Forrest Gump, I'm not a smart man, but I know what work is.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course you're not working on it, and &quot;we're working on it&quot; is indeed SOE's version of &quot;please hold.&quot; But honestly, lately, it's been sounding more and more like &quot;fuck off and make a knight, we'll fix you when you actually have an alternative to EQ.&quot;<br />

Kinda like the way they suddenly gave casters crits, focus items, and a raised flowing thought cap about a week before DAoC was released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And not all the caster chagnes you are talking about happened at once. And, I think, we all agree that the changes we are asking for are non-trivial, deep changes that requrie some consideration. We can always reorganize a walk-out.  We got what we wanted because of our credibiltiy, lets not blow it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what if they are trying something it dont work and so they have to scrap it and try something else?<br />
would be a good reason why nothing has been said that is definate. <br />
if nothing is said on the 24th then start the bitching again. if it looks promising and when it goes live and actually works at improving the discrepencies dont forget to give out kudos to them.</div></div><hr />
