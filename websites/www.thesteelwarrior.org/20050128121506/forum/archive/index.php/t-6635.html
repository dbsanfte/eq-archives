<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arralis</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I'd just like to point out that this is my first post, so you'll have to excuse me if I ask something redundant.  Great site, by the way!<br />
<br />
Getting down to business:  Well, I've just recently returned to EQ after two poorly-timed breaks and am currently guildless.  I'm a level 65 Half Elf with 5.3k hp unbuffed, I have ND3, PE, and am one AA point away from getting PD3.  Fortunately, I was able to sell a pre-nerf item for 350k, with which I purchased an Ornate Breastplate Mold, an Ornate Greaves Mold, and a Stonewood Compound Bow, leaving me completely broke.  This windfall was an incredibly uncommon occurance for me, however, as I rarely have any money whatsoever.  I am using an un-augmented SotBS and an un-augmented CHoS and the agro generation isn't very spectacular (after taunting and inciting, a monk was able to pull agro from me immediately with a 2hb that was not proccing).  I'll have about 6k unbuffed hp once I've finished obtaining my hp-increasing AAs.<br />
<br />
So, I have my eyes set upon a Time-level guild that houses a friend of mine.  Unfortunately, they require warriors to have 6.5k hp unbuffed, as well as agro proccing weapons (flags are &quot;preferred&quot;).  Now, it seems to me that, if I want to meet these requirements, I really only have two options:  join a guild until I've upgraded my equipment sufficiently, obtained all of the necessary flags, and then immediately leave or somehow obtain an enormous amount of platinum and get squeezed into flag raids somehow.  Personally, I believe the first option to be extremely rude, but the second option doesn't seem very likely.  Here's my question:  How am I supposed to obtain these upgrades and flags given my current situation?  Should I just forget about the guild and join a lower-end guild in the meantime?  In order to join a high-end raiding guild, it would seem that I would have already needed to have been in a high-end raiding guild to begin with... I'm very confused.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any help.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

don't go guild hopping its lame and only hinders the lower guilds progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you have another option other than you listed.  Do you have to join a Time enabled guild right now?  Why not find a guild that is just entering EP flagging and make friends there and help them progress?  I think you are doing yourself a disservice by skipping all the PoP content and rushing right to Time.  Unless you're only goal in this game is to have the best gear, I think you might find more enjoyment progressing with characters at your level.<br />

When I joined my current guild about a year ago, they were farming Tawro/Radiir in Umbral.  We were barely able to field 14 players at our raids.  We progressed on to Doomshade, Zelnithak, Rumblecrush, Vindicator.  We were fielding 20 players at raids.  We decided to add the Akehva Ruins nameds to our hit list.  Va'Dyn and IV soon fell our growing guild.  The first fight of IV with 24 players avg. lvl. 61 was a complete rush.  We moved on to ToV and ST key dragons with our standard 24 man force.  After a few months we were in Sleeper's Tomb!  The nameds fell to our small force of 15 keyed members.  Avatar of War was always a dream of ours.  About the time we entered ST, we found Statue up and decided to give it a shot.  Much to our surprise, we downed that punk with a couple extra groups of friends.  Soon after, the recruits started rolling in and more baddies fell to our might;  Aaryonar, Tormax, Dain, Shei Vinitaris, Grieg, ST Ancients, THO, Burrower Beast, BoT Towers, Terris Thule.  I'm very impressed with my guild accomplishing all of this with strategy instead of numbers.  Highlights:  ST Ancients w/ 16 players, Aaryonar w/ 19, Terris Thule w/ 29, Burrower Beast w/ 21.<br />

During this past year, some of my friends guild-hopped and skipped content to reach PoTime as fast as possible.  Now they are stuck doing 6-8hour raids in EPs.  They raid with 100 other players they hardly know.  They fight for PoTime content with 6 other guilds on our server.  I send them tells about what we are doing with what little raid force we have.  They usually reply with &quot;Wow, I haven't killed him/ only killed him once =( &quot;.  They may have way better gear, but I have a since of accomplishment and friendship.  Just something to think about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why a guild would have a minimum set level of gear for you to join is beyond me. Gear is easy to get, the AA and skill is whats important. I understand then not wanting you to join in crafted armor and a treeweave, but come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would think 6.5k unbuffed is the bare skinny for even an EP tank.  a warrior with less is no benefit to the guild.  some people dont like to spend all their time gearing up their weakest links before they move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, My advice to you, is to Join a guild with some of your friends(you have to have other ones than the Time ones) and Enjoy your time.<br />
<br />
I was in a guild where we were doing Emperor of SSRA with 45ish people, and every time he was up, we hit him. But, unfortunetly, time constraints caused me to leave the guild on a friendly basis(Didn't have time to farm VT Keys)..<br />
<br />
I just recently started a guild with a few of my friends. I have a great time, at the moment, we can't Kill Emperor of SSRA, but we do other things i never had the chance to do from skipping from a -Can't kill Vindi with 40 people guild- to a -Killed Vindi with 22 unbuffed people guild-.. I missed out on Klandicar,Zlandicar,Sontalak,NToV, etc.. NOw that i joined a guild with 15ish friends, that is what we can do so we do it, and I don't regret dropping from a strong guild, to a weak guild..<br />
Ok, The moral of that was- Don't Join a time guild if you havn't done anything to get there. Currently I am 1 kill away from Elemental Flagging, but I could have joined a Time guild with my friend, and Been Ele flagged along time ago.. But I choose(Sp? =/ ) not to, because I wanted challenge. SO don't join your friends time guild unless you are only in the game to be the best. Work your way up there, and skip the Time guild thing <br />
