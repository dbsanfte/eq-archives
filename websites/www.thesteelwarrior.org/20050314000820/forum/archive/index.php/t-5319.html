We did 3 hard in ruj, won them all and didn't have much trouble. I was pulling, chanty or bard mez adds if any, whoever slows...ya know. How bout the other ones? Would we have to use a monk puller for takish or somewhere where it's hard to get singles? Any ones i should really stay away from without a good group on hard?</div></div><hr />

Lot more crowded rooms in Tak/Guk(sometimes with chanter haste), and Mir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done about 90 hard adventures all with the same group: Pal, Sk, Rog, Rng, Clr, Enc. Our gear is mostly LDoN and high end bazaar, and the average aa of the group is about 300. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would say Ruj, Mistmoore, and Miragul's are all of comparable difficulty. Miragul's seems to have more spots with 3+ pulls, but in general seems easier than the others. If you can do Ruk okay, then Mistmoore or Miragul's shouldn't pose a problem.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Guk and Tak are considerably harder. Guk just has annoying monsters, bad pathing, warping mobs, and 3-4 pulls all over the place. Tak is hit and miss. Sometimes you get a fairly straight forward map with sparse mobs and you can just tear through it. Other times, you get small corridors which lead to rooms with 4+ mobs that when you pull, aggro the 3 mobs in the neighboring room and you have a mess. In my experiences Tak has been the hardest for high risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tak has doors and long narrow halls.  It easeir to pull to a larger room to fight but that usually takes going through atleast two doors... so damned if you do and dmaned if you dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that Rujarkian is generally the easiest setup, although some maps have a few trouble spots.  MM is pretty straighforward as well but Ruj benefits nicely from the long hallways with trivial single or double pulls on a regular basis.  Takish, Miragul's and Guk are a bit of a crapshoot; some maps are wonderful and some of them are horrid.  Of the three I would go Mirag's/Guk/Takish in order of preferance, although Guk/Tak is pretty much a coin flip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strangely, I find Rujark to be the biggest pain in the ass. Though I dont have experience with Mistmoore or Guk on hards, I find tak and miraguls to be the easiest.<br />
<br />
Rujark annoys me because I find them to  just be harder mobs in general. They seem to hurt me more, and damn sowed mobs suck ass from a pulling perspective. I always pull and tank these (bard and war) and Ruj just annoys me.<br />
<br />
Tak on the otherhand is money. I love tak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ruj probably has the highest chance of getting a hasteable enemy but if it is actually a problem just dispel them on incoming.<br />
<br />
Tak/Guk by far the hardest to pull.  Miragul is pretty spread out in general but once a while you get a few nasty rooms.  Some of the levels in Mistmoore can be cramped like the sewer levels.  Guk's difficulty isn't so much as mobs are packed as opposed to having a lot of blind pulls subject to pathing adding more than you expect.  With Tak you can pretty much know what's going to come, unless you're pulling through a door.  Guk you really don't know.  It could be just the one you see or there could be 5 mobs behind that guy and you really have no way of knowing.</div></div><hr />

We collectivly decided that guk wasn't an enjoyable experiance for anyone and will not return.  I think all the other zones are a riot though.  For dificulty I'd order them  mistmore/everfrost/tak/ruj with mm being the least difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Expect every sowed mob to be hasted as well, since Ruj is loaded with shaman mobs.<br />
<br />
Tak is full of druid mobs instead, so it'd probably be easier to have your cleric land a Kings on the mob (I pull with it in ldon-easy; low mana, casts fast, kills DS and is low enough aggro so that a good cleric puller can drop the mob on the bard without taking a single hit) instead of dispel. Either way, a high DS like bracken is just as bad, if not worse than haste, since it either kills all your melees or your group's DPS, while still causing the tank to take damage faster.<br />
<br />
It's just that a mob that hits for 988 gets a much bigger increase in damage output from a 50% haste than a mob that only hits for 380.<br />
<br />
Guk's blind pulls are made a lot easier with a mage/wiz/bard/holgresh beads, once you get used to the fact that Guk mobs have a larger aggro reaction range than any theme (Ruj is close, but ruj has a lot more room for mobs to be spaced out). There's also a wide range of classes spread out, meaning you have to be prepared for mobs with haste, DS, dispel, mez and charm (chanters), DS (necro), sow and haste (shamen), and CH (cleric). If you use lull to pull, remember that all of those classes gate (clerics usually only gate at 70&lt;mana&lt;400, though), and the lull-line was recently nerfed so that its random extension (it used to last anywhere from 42 seconds to indefinitely, but usually closer to 90 seconds) no longer happens. All you get on a cleric/chanter lull spell is 7 ticks now. SCR should work with it, focus effects don't.</div></div><hr />

That makes assloads of sense. Still Tak is the win though! (Maybe Ive just done so many there its comfortable) Golden Wraps of the Compact are money!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakor</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tak seems to be the easiest and EF's been a bitch for my win/loss ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I often use various non-standard groups without crowd control, puller or cleric.  In those groups the real problem is the number of enemies to a pull.<br />
<br />
In my experience Rujark is the easiest to pull with the exception of The Arena of Chance which is a nightmare for puller/cc.  If I have no puller/cc and we get Arena of Chance, I'm taking the loss right away and getting another map.<br />
<br />
Guk isn't bad with eye of zomm or other scouting methods.<br />
<br />
If you have an enchanter, the CoD pets in Miragul's are the worst.</div></div><hr />

I've succeeded in Hard LDoN with a 6500hp buffed warrior as tank and I've seen people with over 11k hp post here that they lost.<br />
<br />
Some can't win without a puller and crowd control.  Some need one or the other.  Some do without either.<br />
<br />
Most requre a cleric, not everyone does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't believe people who say you have to have 9k hps to tank on High Risk.  I did a Miragul hard last night with this group.<br />
<br />
Bard<br />
Bard<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
Ranger<br />
Me<br />
<br />
No one was EP flagged, I was probably the best-equipped person in the group.  The druid was fighting for mana the whole time, but I went in with just 9/kaz/SoT at about 8k hps and before the end symbol wore and I tanked the rest with 7100 hps.  We went probably 82 minutes on it but we won.  Of course on Sunday I lost a Ruj hard with what should have been a better group so you never know.<br />
<br />
A bard really makes a difference.  They pull great, give tons of mana/hp regen, and things are slowed on INC 50%.</div></div><hr />

And I gotta tell ya, when monk lull goes live (hopefully with next patch) ... it's gonna make pulling those easy as pie.</div></div><hr />

Got spanked the last few times in Tak. Haven't done well there since the lull nerf.   Did a hard MM recently, uber chanter charmed a mob, we tore the place up.<br />
<br />
With a good cleric, no problems at 70AA and 7200 HPs.</div></div><hr />

I hate Arena of Chance...  Holy crap what a piece of shit map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got Arena of Chance in my last Ruj map and I could've sworn I was in Guk and Tak combined with all the mobs hiding behind corners and how the whole room aggros at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Ruj seems to have two really nasty maps:  Arena of Chance and Fortified Lair of the Taskmasters.  Getting rescue/assassinate on Lair is pretty much a guaranteed 1 hour deal even on normal and I really don't want to think about hard.  Even collect on Lair seem to take much longer than the usual collect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never had any problems with EF hards; After the lull nerf, guild enc was trying to pull on one but was dying too much so i took over. Only rarely seem to get more than 2.<br />
<br />
Tak has been very hit-and-miss. One night had a very average equipped group with only me in EP gear and had a very skilled bard pull who kept his cool througout. Was done with 30 mins left.<br />
<br />
Tried again today with similar grp, but now an enc replaced bard. After trying 2 pulls that went wrong (lull nerf seems to have made hards.....er hard) enc was about to break down and cry so i tried again. Went ok till I got 4 and disc was down :/ Cleric just couldn' t keep up with my hp dropping. <br />
<br />
I d say you don t need 9k hps if the group overall is fairly well balanced (say in VT gear) and you mitigate well. (aka, good ac at least and def AA s). On an average and/or bardless group, I think the tank needs to be pretty good gear-wise to compensate. (Furious has been a godsend when doing the pulling; just hate the reuse timer)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing monks becoming the new uber LDoN hard pullers with new lull skills as it would give them their edge back.</div></div><hr />
