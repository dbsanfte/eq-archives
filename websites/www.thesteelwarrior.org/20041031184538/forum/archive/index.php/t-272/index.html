<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last few times we have been able to get a respawn without a ptch it has been between 6 to 8 days. But lately there has been a patch between server up kill so not exactly quite sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sadly I don't think yer gonna get an exact answer. Some servers swear up and down it's 1 week. For us he's always been 10-14 days. And we have 30ish kills on em so not like we missed a lot of spawns. No one else started killing him with any regularity til the past month or so. Of course, now after patches he always pops on forking asian primetime dodgammit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rolsdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info guys, guess well have to work this out.<br />
<br />
weve only killed him twice now, and the 2nd time was after a patch.<br />

cheers :)</div></div><hr />
