I've been a barb and it's fun but I wanna check out what it is like to be a tank and not be so nightblind or as big as a house.  If I make one I'll go with RZ as my god.  I just wanna get some thoughts or words of advice from other dark elf warriors who post on this forum.</div></div><hr />

Halfling might be nice, not big, not blind, you can worship RZ, and u can lvl up a little faster and get that experience your looking for quicker *shrug*</div></div><hr />

You'll not be night blind, get like 5 more to each stat than you would as a dark elf, and you won't get lost in your own city cause the person who developed it was watching Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; for 5 days straight will designing the zone.</div></div><hr />

Agnostic to boot and ive still done pretty well overall. There is enough gear out there to overcome any &quot;low starting stat&quot; or the &quot;omg i cant wear fierce heraldic&quot; anxiety. Not to mention dark elf females make sexy as hell warriors :)</div></div><hr />

And the problem with that is ?..??   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Tima. If for some reason I had to restart a warrior I would pick Dark elf all over again.  Any starting stat deficiences can be overcome with prudent collection of the right gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's alot of fun being the underdogs of the warrior bread. Still get mistaken for SKs sometimes, but eh, thats life :P<br />
<br />
Definately put points into Stamina though starting out, the rest you can fill in with gear and AA along the way.</div></div><hr />

I am a dark elf warrior as well and the only problem is people thinking youre a Shaddernite asking you to FD Pull...<br />
<br />
As for stamina and stats - they can all be fixed <br />
i currently have 275 stam unbuffed...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...and the biggest plus is - we get all the dark elf girlies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like my DE warrior. I would probably put 90% sta to start and the rest in str. I follow Inni and have not regretted it at all. Usually I am mistaken as a Rouge until the fighting begins. I am not sure if there are differences in avoidance but it seems like there might be sometimes. Other than that get some regen items or carry a healer in yer pocket. That's the only thing I hated about DE's prior to the AA's. Regen just suxs but at the upper levels it doesn't affect you to much...63 DE Warrior/ Quellious</div></div><hr />

as a vah shir... in Full plate, D.W.ing a hammer and a BoC... I get people asking me for buffs thinking I am a BL... or asking me to make them some poisions thinking I am a rog. Even asking me for Shammy buffs. Oi! (and not just noobies either... I get lvl 62+ peeps in PoV doing the same stuffs) But my guild is littered with barb, human, and HE warrios. We finally got an ogre recently, and then me.. the lone Vah-shir warrior. There is a retired DE warrior I think. No trolls either. Just observations. I don't know any really high level DE warriors on Povar... would be cool to see I think.</div></div><hr />

Not too tall, not blind, great starting stats unlike the weak elven races. Plus we have the cool dwarven roll and the best beards.</div></div><hr />

And yes, put everything in sta. 75 naked sta REALLY HURTS (even if you can fix it after 2 years.. ).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone had said &quot;I'm starting a dark elf warrior&quot; three years ago, I'd have said &quot;You have clearly lost your mind&quot;.  Back then the lower levels were alot tougher (and a lot slower).  The game has been streamlined to make getting to the mid levels easier and faster, and had most faction issues eliminated, since then.  Before, large races had the best starting stats, and barbarians were the only large race that didnt have pretty severe faction problems.   Also gear to compensate for the frailty most smaller races start with was much harder to get.   With the game the way it is now, play what you want,  when you get to 60+, you can stand an ogre, an elf, and a gnome side by side, and there will be little to no difference in their stats.  Only real difference will be who looks better.  And clearly opinions vary on that one.  Personally, I like being a burly, tattooed, kilt wearing oaf that runs around smashing stuff and getting drunk, but that's just me. :)<br />
