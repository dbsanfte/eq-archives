<br />
Do you ever two box for AA's at 65 anywhere if you only got say a half hour to a couple hours of logging in?  Just curious what spots you are capable of with that level of equipment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost never 2-box for exp by myself anymore.  I can do it just about anywhere in PoP except the elemental planes, (I can do first field in fire or the water zone-in, but not the harder stuff very well), as well as the lower (Qinimi, Riwwii, non-named in Barindu, maybe Ferubi) GoD zones.  It's just painfully slow killing though.  Pretty much get all my AA in Vxed/Tipt lately, don't remember the last time I actually 2-boxed alone for experience, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However having War/Cleric available 24/7 is really really powerfull.<br />
Because you need 1-4 &quot;RandomPeople&quot; and you have a grind going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.   Yeah I noticed people always wanna join when I set up two boxing, sometimes surprisingly higher levels (65 rogue joined my combo today, had trouble keeping aggro at times, was lvl 58, using CHoS and SotB, rogue was using some crazy dagger and a flintforged cudgel offhand.<br />
<br />
Found myself running low on stamina, think the damage was fast enough that could have potentially done some harder things, but I don't have a truncheon of doom yet.  Gonna hunt this weekend for a key to seb and try and two box my way up to get a truncheon.  Currently on Brell goes for 25k in bazaar.... for a kunark weapon.. the heck with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shoot that Rogue.  Flintforged is really a horrid offhand choice for any 65 Rogue (or really any damage dealer). Hell, his epic would almost certainly be a better option.</div></div><hr />

Other options have been barindu, but the ammount of garbage that procs nonstop doesn't make it worth the time.</div></div><hr />

Can get exp so much faster in a group in Tipt I don't bother with 2-boxing solo (I 2-box in a group sometimes, but almost never just me and the bot).</div></div><hr />

Hey Private Message, your sig is freakin huge :p.</div></div><hr />

Don't even bother ToD'n. Sol.ro is another option tho if you get the doubles it can hurt till you land tod on both.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent extensive time 2-boxing with a time geared shaman/warrior.  Its really not that bad if you're letting the warrior get solo exp (as opposed to being grouped).  In Tactics I could get an aa about every 1:30 which is a lot better than I'ed be able to do if I was LFG.  Also duoing in Sol Ro was pretty terrible exp but I made good coin doing it.  I never tried doing ele planes but I'm sure I would have had no problem at all with earth or fire first field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but it always felt to me like the mobs in Sol Ro had eighty-two gajillionty hit points, or at least more than the other upper tier PoP zones  :( <br />
<br />
Of course, I could be imagining it, and since I never bothered to parse I can't prove it, but whenever I two box there (also with a cleric, and definately not for experience), it feels like it takes forever and a day to kill those bastards.<br />
<br />
Anyway, got off track &gt;&lt;  This might sound like a crack smokers sort of suggestion, but I've actually found two boxing the Juggs in Seb to be quite good experience (provided you are willing to spend the time getting down there, which probably outweighs any exp bonus you would've recieved going there in the first place, but oh well.)<br />
<br />
You might also try the rats in CoD.  They still have a significant amount of HP (of course) but at least it's less than Sol Ro and the like, and even if you happen to get two on a pull by accident, they're weak enough you can easily handle it with yourself and your boxed companion.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you can try the Guardians of Justice in PoJ.  Like the rats in CoD, they're all level 60, but they give somewhat decent exp per kill (again, with two people, it'll take a while to beat them down.)  The nice thing is, apart from someone in Mauvin's hall training you, it's extremely safe and lazy exp - good to do while you're watchin a movie or what not and don't want to pay much attention.  (Also, use Pacification or you'll get two of them most occasions, which, like the rats, isn't a game ender, but it's annoying.)<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

P.S. Don't neglect tribute bonuses for both your characters.  I've found it makes a huge difference, especially the extra FT for my cleric, and allows me to be lazy and not have to go refresh KEI/VoQ every couple hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zannuk</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a warr &amp; cleric 2box often.  Both have sub-elemental gear but I can still get some decent AA in tier 3 and the sissy Gates zones.  The previous posts about group mods and kill rates are correct tho, if I want real exp for my warr I put the cleric to bed and join a Tipt / Vxed group.  <br />
<br />
But refering to the original posters question about time restraints, i've found it to be extremely convienient to have my own healer as an optional group member.  Basically I just need to round up a slower and then whatever else for dps and I can get a group rolling alot faster than sitting LFG with the 25 other LFG tanks.  Plus its comes in extra-handy when farming shit for keys / quests / whatever.  I reccomend it, just be prepared for twice the carpal tunnel!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since the OoW rush xp has tanked in sol.ro at 66 on both, so it's really not worth my time anymore. Earth is still decent, upside is you get random people joining you fairly quickly and slower is not needed at all. Most fun i've had lately was a 3 tank 2 dps + cleric group, just plowing through mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duskin</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since oow I keep cleric out of group to exp my warrior in Wall of Slaughter.<br />
<br />
About .6% - .9% a kill.<br />
<br />
Takes about 4mins to kill each mob.<br />
<br />
Better than sitting lfg. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got ToD (Truncheon of Doom) this weekend, got a good deal on it.  Tested it out, was able to do the slug looking things in PoV, got about 6 - 7 % of an AA exp per kill.  Not bad, not bad at all, better than I had hoped in fact.</div></div><hr />
