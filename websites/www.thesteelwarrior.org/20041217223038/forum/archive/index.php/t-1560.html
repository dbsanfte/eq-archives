What about a 2hs like Windblade?  I've just started using it and it very much seems to me that I hold aggro much much better than I did dual weilding a centi longsword and snowchipper.  Is this a possibility?  Looking for opinions here on whether it's futile to MT with it regardless of it's power - I love hitting for that much damage in one swing) - or if it will serve me well in that position, maybe a better weapon for a supporting melee position.  I'm level 52 for the moment and the majority of the core of our guild is 50+ so that's who I play with and who I need to keep aggro from.  Thanks<br />

<br />
Both 1hb and 1hs have the exact same skill cap for a warrior.<br />
<br />
So in essence they're interchangable. Depends on the weapon and the proc and all that other stuff. But the POWER behind a blunt is the exact same you'll find behind a comprable slasher.</div></div><hr />

That delay gives the mob time to &quot;forget&quot; about you and focus on the people hitting it more often, even if they're hitting for much less.  I find that when I'm using a 2H weapon, the mob tends to turn towards me for a moment or two when I hit or taunt, then go right back to the poor ranger hitting it 6 or 7 times in row before my gigantic axe comes crashing back at it... <br />
<br />
When I'm MT, I like to make use of dual weild...with 2 single handed procing weapons I almost never lose aggro unless it's to a huge nuke.  When I'm back-up tank, tank-mezzing, or just more dps in a big raid, then I go for the big weapons.  (I like to see those huge numbers to)</div></div><hr />

I use a pure dps 2hander for aggro, and my only problems are at the very beginning (slow), but even that I usually hold aggro through /shrug<br />
<br />
And I very much believe a windblade would hold aggro better than a centi ls and snowchipper.  Centi and snow are both low aggro weapons, whereas windblade is so-so</div></div><hr />

At 65, I  swing less with 2H weapon, but I do about 10 more DPS than with my dual wielding 1Hers. I see a *huge* difference in my ability to get and keep aggro with the 2H vs the x2 1H.<br />

As mentioned above, sometimes it takes a few extra seconds in the beginning of the fight to establish good aggro, but once I have it, it's there to stay.</div></div><hr />

I've even tested it by swapping to my 11/18 and 10/18 combo to see if it was just perception, but ended up swapping back on the next fight. <br />
<br />
I can't explain why, but  the 2hs seems to work better. Then again, there's nothing like seeing a triple attack for 600-900 damage every once in a while either ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true.  More hits equals more aggro.  Faster weapons generate more aggro, when DPS and procs are equal.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm not sure the extra aggro is worth all that much.   I know several warriors that tank with a windblade, and seem to hold aggro OK, particularly if you give them a few second head start.  <br />
<br />
Really, it depends on the weapons you're using.  If you have a Greatstaff of Thunder, you are going to hold aggro better than a lot of dual wielding combos, until you get an enraging blow-type proc on one or both of your weapons.  I had a Windblade for 2HS and a frosty and a spiked velium mallet for dual wielding, and after a bit of experimenting I bagged the dual wielding combo and never took them out again.   They just couldn't hold aggro as well.  Now I switch between the GSoT for aggro and the Windblade for DPS, depending on the situation.  I haven't used a 1H weapon in at least a month.</div></div><hr />

A lot of times when I tank BoT tower bosses I use my two weapons then switch to a two-hander to keep ripostes down. At that point I am pretty sure I will have aggro for the remainder of the fight. That said, switching weapons every exp-group fight could become bothersome, I'd just assume dual wield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 58 I used a Snowchipper (10/20 one effect proc) and Spiked Velium Mallet (10/20 one effect proc), sucked.<br />
<br />
Went to Frostbringer(12/22 two effect proc) and Snowchipper, better but still sucked.<br />
<br />
Went to Frostbringer and Disemboweler, better as my DPS went up.<br />
<br />
At around level 60 was in a group in PoV with a 65 War as MT with CHSD and some non-proccing sword and used my two hander, Frostreaver.  Occasionally towards the end of the fights I would get aggro.  No taunting obviously.<br />
<br />
I began experimenting with the two hander for aggro and I find, without question, it holds better aggro for me when used with effective taunting in almost any group scenario.  I moved spells to a seperate window where I could see them better and, taunting after a slow, a big cast crit, a cripple, or only when I lose aggro I can effectively control it.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, short of a BoC or BF or SoD or CHSD, this bad boy is more effective than any combination of &lt;15k weps I could find...<br />

Hell, i even tanked AoW with it! :D lots of people blow off this weapon because, well, it's not the best ratio in the world, but i looted it as a fun toy back then cause it was gonna rot and i really gotta say, it was a good aggro producer. Worked like a champ in PoV too.</div></div><hr />

Only reason it isn't in the top 10 list is because the people making that list probably never used one. One frostreaver easely outaggro's epic/CHSD/Tuna whip and similar dual wield combo's.<br />
<br />
Only reason I don't use it anymore is that the DPS on my greatstaff is much more useful in PoP....</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the truth is that the 2h-ers out there generate vastly more dps and as people keep repeating ripostes suck. They have been tuned down but still at a riposte rate of 4-5% you save yourself several thousand damage per fight in exp groups.<br />
<br />
I went from a Fleshgrinder/Defender's Lightblade combo to a WindBlade to a Greatstaff of Thunder to a Warmarshall's Bladed Staff to a Norge`Tal to a Greatstaff of the Four Winds and every step along the way my aggro went up.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about the three Staves listed there is the low delays so you don't see the kick-in time of a windblade or other higher delay weapons in getting aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We make it a rule when raiding that, unless your MT, you keep your frostreaver bagged, because the proc rate on it is so crazy, one good round will pull aggro off anything, ANYTHING.  <br />
<br />
hell, im guilty myself, pulled aggro off of dual blow with my frostreaver, without taunting (got yelled at for it too, now i dont ever bring it out, cept to screw around)<br />
<br />
It doesnt have the best ratio, which is why it is overlooked, but by far one of the best aggro 2 handers out there.<br />

Siskel and Ebert give it 2 thumbs up.</div></div><hr />

If I'm hunting in PoS/PoV I usually never have a problem holding agro with it unless two things happen.  1 either the slower slows while mob is inc, or 2 if the freakin mob keeps stunning me off the start.  Once I get agro though I never lose it as long as I have a good haste that is.  Plus I don't know about anyone else but I like seeing those crits for 400's and 500's :)</div></div><hr />

31/30 and procs a stun.  Doesn't get much better than that for droppable weapons.<br />

Id take great caution with the term *vastly.*  1H weapons have had a bad rap ever since the patch that increased 2H damage.  I think many would be shocked, however, how narrow the gap actually is.<br />

I riposte about 3-4 percent of the time, and I enjoyed ripostes for 200 (WB) versus 50 (other stuff). Switched to a WMBS since everyone carries a bloody windblade - still decent damage for ripostes.</div></div><hr />

While that gap may be narrow numerically, the vast majority of warriors do not have access to weapons that can match commonly affordable 2h weapons. You would be hard pressed to get 1 1h weapon that would be required to make 2h-like DPS for the price of a single 2h weapon.<br />
<br />
On my server:<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder - 60k<br />
Windblade - 40k<br />
Warmarshall bladed staff - 30k<br />
<br />
To get anywhere near the kind of DPS any of those 3 weapons you would need to buy 2 weapons with a ratio in the .65-.75 range. To do that you will spend a ton more than just a single 2her. Even the 2 cheapest ones will cost you as more than a WB or WMBS. Keep in mind that the cheaper you get on the list, the lower the agro is going to be.<br />
<br />
Blade of Carnage (15/20) - 350k<br />
Sceptre of Destruction (12/18+proc) - 350k<br />
Split Blade of Destruction (14/19) - 250k<br />
Disembowler (12+3/20) - 30k<br />

Once I hit the 60s and it became obvious that my 1h weapons were not getting any better, I switched totally to 2h.  I have gone through a succession of 2h weapons.  Currently I use Greatstaff of the Four Winds almost constantly.  I use Greatstaff of Thunder when Defensive or raid MT.  In terms of dps, I don't even want to think of what kind of 1h I'd need to match Go4W.  For aggro, until I get Epic/TB/EB weapons I'm not coming close to GoT with any other 1h.<br />
<br />
I had aggro just fine with the Go4W in xp groups, every once in a while a mob will pong all over the place but that is rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two Handers are imo the better dps items warriors can get.  Two handers def outdamage any of my duel wield combos.  I think warriors should try to find a two hander with a proc though.<br />
<br />
Windblade has a nice ratio and the damage it dishes out is incredible.  The problem I ran into was that it didnt get initial aggro well and that I needed a few swings in order to get it consistent.  Try grouping with a rogue backstabbing for 800 crits or a monk with a decent two hander.  You will find that their dps &gt;&gt; your dps and thus you lose aggro.<br />
<br />
GSoT is so great because it has that proc.   It's a nice proc'ing stick that fires off a whole lot during the fight.  Im a big fan of procs because imo that is the only way to get aggro off of those dps monsters.  Double backstabbing rogues are always a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, he's gonna have to keep on top of hte beginning and make sure he uses proximity agro, and all that, but rocksmasher makes his 1h combos look silly in comparison. <br />
<br />
At 65, at max haste cap, max skills/stats, plus 25% bard overcap haste, and no offensive AA's, he is routinely doing 85-95 dps. <br />
 <br />
We often kid that they will eventually either nerf 2h weapons or do something with 1h weapons to rekindle their use.  But, until then...<br />

I have a warrior friend who is just hitting level 55 - would I be incorrect in assuming that the Greatstaff would be better for helping him to hold agro at that level?  His damage bonus isn't high enough at 55, I would guess, to make the War Staff really shine.<br />

<br />
Well what I meant was that with PB3, Ferocity3 and Flurry the dps was more than enough to keep aggro. I bagged the GSoT when I got the Warmarshalls and only pulled it out for mobs that were about to try to gate.<br />
<br />
Then there's the Norge`Tal. More dps than the GSoT, a fraction less than the WMBS, much higher aggro proc tho. I liked that but it was a bit slow and people don't always appreciate the knockback. <br />
<br />
Now I'm fortunate enough to have the GSoFW and at 41/31 and a small aggro dd proc its DPS is utterly insane. I usually outdamage the &quot;dps&quot; classes in my exp groups with it. Monks with less offensive AA's with ease, rangers without AM or unable to use their bows with ease, even some less well equipped rogues. With a good bard along too giving 80-100pt DS there's not much that can rip aggro away.<br />
<br />
Now I hold my breath for a few months while my guild enters VT and gears up for the encounters to gain Elemental Access... there's a BoW out there with my name on it some day!</div></div><hr />

Our problem is two-fold tho, with dual wield we lose potential dps (indirectly argo generation) as well as taking more damage overall due to ripostes. Kind of a double whammy, tho I will aknowledge that at my guild's progression point of things dw tanking is still very much the prefered norm.. when we use warriors that is ;p</div></div><hr />

and all the talk about the gsot  .. epic is better aggro (for me)<br />
<br />
maybe it procs more if you  have 305 dex or somthing but the proc rate seemed less and aggro generation from the procs were not as &quot;lasting&quot; as the proc from the 2hs epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
windblade is ok but the gsot out aggros it.<br />

the wingblade does out aggro the 1hs epic due to the shitty ratio of the 1hs epic and the enimic proc rate.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember my progression through the earliest levels but based on damage cap at low levels and dual wield skill there were stages that one or the other was superior based on skill or level.  <br />

Once you hit 65 it's all about your progression through game content.  A good 2 hander is simply easier to come by than even 1 good 1 hander, let alone 2 of them.  You can't buy 2 1 handers that put out comparable DPS and aggro to a windblade for a comparable price.  So a lot of warriors are stuck at that stage right now.  <br />
<br />
Once you get to Ssra you get 1 handers that surpass that and there's no comparable 2 hander upgrade so then you basically switch to 1 handers until you can get something on a par with a Blade of War.  Then you use that til plane of time.</div></div><hr />
