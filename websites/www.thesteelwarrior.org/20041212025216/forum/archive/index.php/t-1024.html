Would like some info in how to PL the other char up.. please advise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">level them to around 40 or whatever the level is when they can group with 65 and get xp after that group em up with yourself and kill tons of green/low blue. I am not going into details of what zones its best do in again if you 65 you should know it yourself by now.<br />
<br />
As for what class best? There is no best its all about preference. 2 boxing cleric for me is fucking boring thought :)</div></div><hr />

I think slow is an absolute must, particularly if doing so in PoP, so that knocks out druid and cleric.  But you will also need some healing, so enchanter is out.  Only things you are lacking in are snare (which is big, I admit), and DS.  Ports are mostly irrelevant now with PoK, and rezzes are easly to come by at a GY near you.  Plus, the mana efficiency of a shaman is hard to beat... with cannibalize, a good regen, and a good bandaging skill on your warrior, you can minimize downtime a lot.  Heck, now that she has torpor I don't even have to stop in between kills. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2box a druid, and I can say that slow is very important, especially if you are 65, since the only places you go slow is bascially required.  I can 2box the trash in PoI fairly(only place in PoP ive tried so far), but only when im having good luck with my ToD.  If I had to start over again though, i would choose shaman.   I cant get any of my alts past 25 without becoming seriously bored, so I doubt I would be able to do that.  I do have a 18 enchanter I would love to level up on a 3rd account, but EQ stoped working on that machine shortly after LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to consider, a warrior can slow 50% with ToD, or 30% with Vaniki's 1H.<br />
<br />
Lots underestimate the ToD saying it resists too much, but I've used it in BoT, PoTactics, etc. and although it does get resisted, it procs enough to suit the need.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to have trouble 2 boxing with druid in any zone. can do Tactics/Valor/HoH and I am not slowing those mobs. Hear that ppl 2 box in Fire with druid. I have yet to get to that zone but probably soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have a problem with resists on my ToD, its getting the thing to proc when i need it to, which is a crapshoot.   Only time i can get it to proc often enough is with a DEX buff.   Are there any long lasting DEX buff potions I could use while 2boxin?<br />
 I havent heard much about 2boxing war/dru in much of PoP yet, so maybe ill have to try more of it.  But I just really only started on my AAXP, and my gear is nice, but not sure how it compares to other &quot;average joe&quot; lvl 65 wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farghen</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Innorruk worshiping troll shaman can get an engulfing darkness right click necklace from a quest in Neriak.   So lack of snare in shaman can be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sionce you don't have a PLer I would just have your Warrior watching over the Shaman whereever they fight so if it goes bad then he can kick its ass and if it is hard then he can taunt it away while shaman nukes. <br />
<br />
1-5 newbie area<br />
5-10 Blackburrow or Field of Bone<br />
10-24 Paludal Caverns<br />
24-29 Marus Seru<br />
29-39 Dawnshroud Peaks (Not sure if this gonna be duable but if shammy can pick up P9 (if not Aego should work) you would be ok if you just keep it rooted or have warrior taunt..<br />
<br />
My shammy currently sitting at 29 and have been busy so that is it. of course i got a 62 Druid to PL my Shammy. So Warrior can stay in his little hole in PoT LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gerili</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is level 43 that can group with a level 65.  I personally would either choose a Cleric or a Shaman for your needs.  Cleric is very useful in the regards of being able to rez and not lose your camp and having minimul downtime.  Also handy if you decide to duo an and die, dont have to seek out a rez, you already have one.  Shaman is useful due to the fact of slow and buffs.  Both classes play a crucuial role in forming groups.  Also factor in the fact of how good you are at twoboxing, skill wise. If you arn't the most skilled in the art, play a cleric.  They are much easier to two box then a shaman.  A shaman isn't too difficult, but will take a bit of practice, especially if you never played a character similiar.<br />
<br />
As far as how to do it, never pled with a warrior, but if you are able to get your hands on a caster friend to help you all the better.  Get your noob a hp buff of some sort, probably a kei.  Get you a dmg shield potion, pull a group of mobs have your noob cast a nuke or an aoe to do atleast 1pt of dmg to the mob.  Taunt off mobs as necessary, and make sure you are ducking to avoid reposte.  If you accidently deal damage to the mob the noobie must outdamage you for xp.  Best to stick with undead mobs and other mobs that dont run away.<br />
<br />
1-10 (or 1-17) Unrest<br />
1-10 Kurns tower<br />
10-22 or 24 (paludal caverns)  <br />
23-34 (tizmaz and kodiacs are decent xp at that level, in gd)<br />
35-43 kaesora<br />
<br />
Also a thing to keep in mind, although may be tricky, keep in mind how much dmg your noob does, long as you are able to outdamage your warrior it is all good.  W/o a dmg shield potion could deal 51% dmg with noob and kill off rest of mob w/ warrior. Or you can get it to 1% health and zone your warrior and let noob kill it, either works.  Then once you get it to level 43 just group him up with warrior and go farm seb or something till he gets 46 then take em up to the planes, probably poj or whatever you can handle out there.  Good luck to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends what your going to do with your character.  If your doing to keep soloing and working by yourself I would suggest a shaman.  If your going to raid,  go cleric,  nothing like being able to keep Divine Intervention up, fast heal when you get nailed with a good round and res.  <br />
<br />
As far as PLing with your warrior,  buy 4 bags of bandages, and 4 bags of DS potions.  I'm not sure if their is  a limit on /shield but if you both have DS on it could go very very fast.  <br />
<br />
Once you get to lvl 40.  Go to Droga,  check out the quest to get spirit wracked cord.  Will be great exp as well as a nice item for your warrior.  (ring is ok for warrior and cleric also)  This place should be good to lvl 51 if i remember right.  <br />
<br />
At 51 if your warrrior has a key to top floor to TOFS rocks,  maybe velks.  Heard good things regarding POJ also. <br />

Again thanks for all the advice. &lt;3</div></div><hr />
