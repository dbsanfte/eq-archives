Guild is currently working on VT Keys so we will be in with Emperor soon. Not heavy into raiding and would like a nice upgrade for the wrist slot, most of my other slots I have upgrades planned for them, but would appreciate any or all advice you can give. Am working Hard to break the 5k unbuffed 1300 AC mark and I know that gear will improve as I progress. Thanks in Advance for you input.</div></div><hr />

Royal attendants bracer from ldon if on your own.<br />
<br />
There are numerous VT bracers if from raid.<br />
<br />
look here:<br />

<br />
There is a rare drop in Tipt is probably the most uberest of all...but I'm not certain you are at that yet</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tak Bracer w/ 40hp aug does turn out pretty nicely as well.</div></div><hr />

These are as close as it gets to 'free' when you reach Vex Thal.  Not lore either. And at 38ac, it beats out Crystallized Acid Bracer, Honor Guard bracer from Blood Ssra, Mana-Threaded from LDoN, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both are respectable wrist slot items but not as nice as the umbracite bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wrist slots have been bugging me for a while. I have a Bracelet of Fortitude and Silver Chitin Wristband. Gonna buy a Crystalizad acid bracer in the next day or two, need another 10K and I'll have one if I can't get someone to drop it a little lower then normal. For the other I'll either go with N. Ro or maybe try to get a group to go into HoT and get Doz for his quest bracer. <br />
<br />
The HoT bracer, silver braclet of speed, is very nice if you can get one. 41% haste 38AC 100hp 10 str/sta 5 to all svvs. For the difficulty it is awsome. Just hard to get the right drops for it without several runs through HoT. I've killed Doz 3 times and still don't have the tear, grrrrr. There is also a charm there that can go in neck or wrist that is 35AC 100HP. Good stuff if you can go clear hot in a few hours with some buddies.<br />
<br />
I don't care for ornate, decent AC but only 45 HP.</div></div><hr />
