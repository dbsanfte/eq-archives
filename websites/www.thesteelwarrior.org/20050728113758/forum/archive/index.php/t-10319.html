Consistantly staying between 110-200 dps at lvl 42, but my only question is this. Is it more beneficial to stick with the Axe Crit spec. with MS and Sweeping Strikes or go with a Fury Talent Spec for Flurry? Which does more dps. If I went Flurry I would almost constantly be 30% hasted as my crit % is 13% without Axe Spec. , but I don't see that 30% increase in attack speed after a crit would affect a 1.5 speed weapon much. Should I stick with the extra 5% crits, MS and Sweeping Strike? Would make the decision alot easier if Flurry were a tier up in the Talent Tree :) Also whats the best 1 hand weapon enchant for a warrior to get? Right now I have demonslaying because it looks so damn sweet, but I would rather have utility from the enchant now.</div></div><hr />

He tried the damage enchants and found they didn't raise his dps nearly as much. Sorry I have no numbers, my warrior is only 40 and scraping together money for a horse. I have no money to experiment with the high end enchants yet.</div></div><hr />

Dunno about the primary, but my reading so far sez go for a straight damage proc in the offhand at least, as the damage penalty is not applied to the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with flurry builds is lack of abilities to actually spend all the rage you're generating since you won't have enough talent points to get MS.  Well, I mean you can use HS but I just hate that skill heh although with real fast weapons using HS wouldn't be as much of a rage hit as using it on a slow 2hander where not gaining rage from a HS hit is a lot.  You could use all the rage on sundering stuff down but most of the time it's unneccesary on solo xp mobs.  For now if you're dual wielding those flurry axes I'd stick with a MS axe crit/cruelty + whatever fury up to Enrage until you change your weapons which will be a while I'm guessing.</div></div><hr />

Thinking that may be more useful since I solo alot and any healing my short dwarf warrior butt can get is helpful. I don't intend to upgrae weapons again for a long time so I'm looking for high end enchants (Lifestealing, Unholy, or crusader) Only been able to find one enchanter who can do any of those three, but it's quite expensive. Does anyone know how much Lifestealing proc does?</div></div><hr />

One thing you can spend the spare rage: Whirlwind<br />
I love this skill, because it's an instant cast not like HS. I've made 2 macros: one for equip my 2 weapons for flurry, and an other to equip a 2h axe and cast whirlwind. Once the whirlwind is available I hit the macro for WW then immediately switch back to dw and keep hitting still the cooldown on ww wears off. <br />
<br />
In a typical fight I need to use WW 2 times, and after the second ww the execute usually activates so i don't switch back to dw and do the finishing execute with my 2h axe, then the bloothirst activates so I go for another mob still with my 2h equipped because bloodthirst gives better +dmg to a 2h-er than a 1h-er.<br />

This is my fury tactic, hope you liked it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just recently downloaded Weapon Switch and aqcuired a heavy hitting two hander Blade of Titans http://thottbot.com/?i=9958 . My crit percentage with Flurry's is up to 20% and I generate tons of rage very quickly. With weapon swap I can quickly switch to MS/Overpower etc. when it becomes available. I can usually open with charge then a rapid flurry of hits in the 80-200 dmg range then as soon as a fury ability pops bam switch to 2h and I get not just the ability but one swing of the weapon. For example MS I hit for 300-650 then instantly another hit for 170-500 then I quickly switch back to my Flurry's... no break in attacks it virtually negates the extremely slow attack speed of my 2hander. By switching weapons every few seconds its like I'm gaining an additonal MS-ish dmg hit on top of much bigger Fury ability dmg hits. It's also nice to gain an additional 240 health from the Stamina on the 2hander if things get hairy. This works very well in instances with multiple mob pulls when I pop WW/Sweeping Strike/Cleave. Doing this I drop elites faster then rogues around my lvl with comparable gear.</div></div><hr />

Was it parsed, or was it theory?</div></div><hr />
