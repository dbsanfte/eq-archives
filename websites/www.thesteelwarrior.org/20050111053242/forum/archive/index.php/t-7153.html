Often they'll use the data by Thepp to show how &quot;bad&quot; they have it, and make asinine statements such as:<br />
<br />
&quot;A druid with less AC tanks the same as we do&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;A Cleric outtanks us&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
These are flat out idiotic statements, but I know why they're made.   Lesser minds take Thepp's data, and apply only the &quot;Hits landed&quot; chart to their experience in EQ and go &quot;SEE!?!   THAT IS WHAT I MEAN!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
There is CRUCIAL data that is missed out on in the charts from Thepp's data, and I've made a spreadsheet which puts the data back in where it belongs.<br />
<br />
Combat works like this in EQ:   <br />
<br />
Either an attempted hit misses or doesn't miss.   Potential hits that are avoided with special skills like Dodge, Block, Parry, and Riposte need to be calculated not as &quot;missed&quot; but as &quot;Non Miss, Zero hit&quot;.   In other words, there are 21 values on the damage curve, beginning with zero, NOT 20, beginning with 1, and that special avoidance skills are really &quot;100% mitigation&quot; for purposes of displaying tankability and damage taken. <br />
<br />
When the data is presented with this value correctly displayed, the outcome isn't nearly as &quot;outrageous&quot; for monks, and it shows why a monk when taking a hit worse thn others still takes less damage than others.    <br />
<br />
Have a look and you'll see... this is how tanking data should be presented.   I used Thepp's data, and the charts are at the bottom.<br />

<br />
kk, I looked and read and thought a bit and I think I've got it. Monks avoid a LOT of damage. More often than not they aren't hit for damage. Therefore given the reduced chances of being hit and the fact most hits are for low values, the chances of a monk being pulped by a mobs are significantly lower than for a tank. In turn, tanks are significantly less likely to be pulped than the other listed classes.<br />
<br />
Specifically, claims that a Druid with less AC than a tank does a better job tanking are clearly mistaken and you've done a great job showing why.<br />
<br />
While you didn't directly address the claim that Rangers and Monks tank like Knights, I assume that only when (for mobs not studied) mobs have a high DB value (quite rare I assume), have high attack and therefore tend to hit more often for max and/or are hasted do things like mitigation and max HP's become major factors. So, a Monk could have reasonable HP's but vs. such mobs a Knight would out tank him because of a Monk's lower mitigation (?). Assuming Rangers can reach Knight-like HP's, I'm guessing lower AC and therefore lower mitigation would limit their effectiveness (?)<br />
<br />
Appreciate the effort. Thanks a bunch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redcloud</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin, your chart is mainly irrelevant to the problem, let alone your missguided derogatory comments .<br />
<br />
Your chart shows that a similarly geared high end war takes close to no max damage while a monk takes about 13% (counting 500+ hits).<br />
<br />
There lies the problem mainly: <br />
it's a lot easier to kill a monk than any other tank class, because of streakiness. <br />
By the very nature of the RNG, avoidance with no valid mitigation to back it up makes healing a lot worse than on any other melee class. <br />
It boils down to a predictable healing pattern and if you ever had to heal a tanking monk, you should know that as soon as you are actually tanking something on par with the character level of gear (not some trash a caster could tank), the monk is the most inefficient melee class at it.<br />
<br />
Mess with your number as much as you'd like, that won't change the fact.<br />
<br />
If you were in good faith, you'd aknowledge at least that. One can hope...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any other tank class? Since when were monks included in the term 'tank class' ? <br />
<br />
Hey, look on the bright side - at least you have a defensive based discipline that  Knights yearn for so deeply</div></div><hr />

Actually, the &quot;problem&quot; is that monks think there needs to be a change to their mitigation without any alteration to their avoidance, so it's quite relevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I would say that the real problem is that many Monks think of their class as a tank class.  Well, if they were in fact a tank class, then they'd have reason for complaint.  But in as much as most people who aren't Monks think of the class as a DPS/pulling class that shouldn't be tanking, there seems to be a perception problem.  Throw in the fact that the SoE devs have come along and reinforced the majority perception that Monks aren't a tank class, you begin to wonder why those who play Monks are still tied into this blatantly wrong perception.<br />
<br />
Want to be a tank?  Roll up a Warrior, Shadow Knight, or Paladin.  End of story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In reality...based off of reading there...none of them want to be tanks.  They want to pull w/o dying.  I could see how that would be nice.  Remember that this class never could tank like us.  Remember that this class used to be a decent offtank.  Remember that this class used to be the in-between of the warrior and rogue classes of the pure melee.  Certainly have lost their niche.  They arent the best pullers and certainly arent even top 5 dps.  What is their role and dont BS the crowds for your own agenda.  Try being openminded.  Note...This is my 2nd account and Ive been playing since 2000.  Wifey deleted my old warrior.  <br />
<br />
Best to take an average monk....maybe 3500-4k hps unbuffed...that might be high even...1000-1200 ac maybe.  Parse how well he does for us.  Or take an average elemental geared monk vs a time geared monk.  From what I understand of reading that board that the time geared monks are fine.  The elemental geared monks and lower are totally broken.  Hell...some of the time level monks are pissed as well...who can blame them.  They supported us when we couldnt efficiently grab/hold aggro fast enough for our xp groups.  They supported us when we got our mitigation boost...why not do the same for our fellow melee classes instead of whining?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xao</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now I've certaintly seen my moronic statement for the day. Frodlin went to all that work to lay out someone else's parsing, and then went ahead and made some completely useless conclusions.<br />
<br />
You see, when you analyze data, you need to consider all the data, not just the pieces that would allow you to poke fun at people. Say, for example, the sixty points of avoidance that the monk in question had on his gear. Of course, Frodlin conveniently neglected to mention that, or the fact that the warrior had zero points. Never mind the other data that indicates monks do have a single innate avoidance advantage: block fires ~8% of the time, while parry works ~4% of the time.<br />
<br />
Of course, over at Monkly Business people are used to Frodlin pole vaulting to half-assed conclusions. Guess that's why he didn't decide to display his &quot;analysis&quot; there.</div></div><hr />

Their defensive abilities should reflect their roles.  They have massive avoidance, which is what a puller wants.  It also is better than high mitigation when you're trying to do damage and not take any (and not tank).  Monks were Rampage tanks in Luclin, for crying out loud.  They're a leather class with innate abilities that should make them be more like chain, not on par with plate.<br />
<br />
I have no clue where this idea that they should be able to fill the role of a tank in a hard hitting exp group came from.  Oh wait, monks used to be over-powered defensively and could pull it off before; that's where it came from.  Did they get hit too hard with the nerf bat?  Perhaps.  But you can't argue that they weren't over-powered before the nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
They want to pull w/o dying.<br />
<br />
And that's what their high mitigation allows them to do.</div></div><hr />

Oh wait, monks used to be over-powered defensively and could pull it off before; that's where it came from.<br />
Oh you mean when most experience group mobs hit for less than 200, and where basically anyone could tank?  Hi Fungus Grove and Velks.  The release of PoP with the introduction of hard hitting mobs would have fixed any problem in defining the tank classes and also disallow monks for the most part to be viable tanks in exp group without a mitigation nerf ever happening.  (Minus warrior's aggro problem, which was a separate issue.)<br />
<br />
Seriously, anyone who thinks that monks could tank too well pre-PoP needs to pull their head out of their ass and remember back to the content.  The reason monks, and other non-tank classes could tank was because of how weaks the mobs were.  I wonder how many of the people nodding their heads in agreement about the monk nerf were PoP-babies and didnt even play Pre-PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We WERE a tank class. No, not the best tank class but we were capable of tanking most mobs when we had to in exp groups. Yes, some super twinked monks were better at tanking in karnors castle than an equal level, not so twinked warrior, so what? Our whole class was designed originally around being able to stand toe to toe with a mob and beat the ever loving daylights out of it. While being solo. We were the only melee class that could effectively solo past the low levels without being buffed and/or twinked. Gee, I wonder why this was the case? Maybe it was because we were designed to not get hit too often and when we DID get hit it wasnt for max damage every time like we were some sort of silk wearing caster class. I was able to solo at least partially effectively in level appropriate gear right up until I hit 52 pre nerf. I didnt see many warriors or rogues doing that. Now with the same gear a light blue drolvarg gives me a serious run for my money.<br />
<br />
My point? Yes, we used to be a tank. Not as good as a plate tank but good enough to manage if we had to in groups. Good enough to be the off tank on raids in case an unmezzable got loose. We didnt have the ability to gain snap agro like a taunt, that was the main disadvantage, although our sheer damage output was enough to almost make up for that. No, reasonable monks dont want to be the main tank of choice for hard ldon missions or to tank quarm on raids, we just want what we used to have, the ability to take a hit without going splat. The ability to stand toe to toe with a fricking BLUE CON and be able to kill it without blowing a disc + mend while buffed by a bot. BTW, I doubt im remembered on this board but I used to be a  regular poster on the original steel warriors board.<br />

Overpowered?  I think not.  Go to the bard boards hehe.  But I think the problem was itemization which has been fixed now...not their mitigation.  I read the monk boards regularly but just as a lurker and they are right to be angry.  If SoE kept itemization the way it was and nerfed their mitigation then maybe we wouldnt be having this conversation.  But...alas they didnt.  They nerfed their mitigation ...nerfed their gear AND gave them a very low softcap of 1340.  That is where the complaints come from.</div></div><hr />

Yes, at the very high end, due to all that all/all low weight, high ac gear, we could approach warrior ac, which caused complaints. So soe decided, in its infinite wisdom to just nerf the entire class instead of altering those items to be non monk useable. Then, for some reason known only to them, they decided to release monk armor in future expansions with the low ac that we should have been getting in the other expansions, thus hitting us twice. Not only do we get less mitigation per ac point, we now cant REACH a warriors ac with the present gear and even if we did, we were giving a nasty low cap on our ac, negating any reason we might have had to try and max out ac.<br />

Frodlin7th, for your to be right, monks would need to have as much ac and more HPs than wars do. Since it isn't case, your reasonning isn't relevant to the problem, that mobs turn monks into pulp faster than they should. The marginal bonus in avoidance is tied to the RNG that makes healing or surviving in general, be it pulls or otherwise a very unpredictable exercice. If you have healed or played your fellow monks in your guild, you should know if you cared to show the real picture.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leewei</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, this is obviously another visiting monk taking Frodlin's bait.<br />
<br />
Before I get into the topic at hand, I'll make a brief digression and say that while this is my first actual post here, I have lurked here occasionally in the past.  I've found the article here on how mitigation, Defensive and Stonestance worked to be very enlightening.<br />
<br />
What Frodlin is saying about some monks is certainly true to an extent.  His phrasing, however, is both overly generalizing as well as inflammatory.  It also misses the point of a lot of monk discussion.  Here's what we're really looking at:<br />
<br />
1) Monk AC soft cap.  What this means in game terms is that beyond a certain easily-reached point, armor upgrades for monks are entirely meaningless.  Getting that neat new BP with 5 new AC seems nice, but really it is just kicking up the displayed number with no real game effect.  Monks simply want to have more gear upgrade possibilities than just adding HPs.<br />
<br />
2) The relative tanking ability of monks vs. priest classes is a non-issue.  What is an issue is that a druid wearing an identical piece of armor, magic ring, etc. will take less damage on a given hit.  Does it make sense to anyone here that someone who hugs trees and dances widdershins around a poppy field at equinoxes can take a hit better than someone who smashes bricks with his forehead?<br />
<br />
3) As someone else pointed out before, the monk had substantial Time +Avoidance gear to get missed as frequently as he was.<br />
<br />
4) Block / Dodge / Parry / Riposte are all checked prior to hit and miss percentages.  While that 12% Block looks like a huge number, it more realistically represents about 6 in 100 attacks prevented.<br />
<br />
5) As several people have already mentioned, monks aren't looking to replace warriors as MAs.  We are looking for a reason to be invited into groups.  Our damage is currently fairly good post-Time.  Pre-Time, however, we're overshadowed by at least three other classes in bazaar gear.  Our role as puller is largely compromised as well due to changes in game mechanics, content design and new AAxp skills.  Having some ability to offtank in new content would, if properly done, substantially increase our desirability in groups without overshadowing the core tanking classes.<br />
<br />
I don't think the issue is at all unreasonable, nor does it pose any threat to the core role of warriors in EQ.  In short, I believe this thread is largely just someone stirring the muck and trying to start something between two classes which have been getting along fine.<br />

At least, not on  raids to areas that are still fairly new to us. Say an elemental guild wouldnt have an effective monk off tank elemental mobs but if they are back flagging in tactics then yeah, a monk might do allright. If we stayed out of god we might be able to tank in many exp groups, once again, dependant on the location and the level of our gear. The mitigation nerf is just no longer needed. The game has been increased to the point where simply by mob mudflation we would no longer truly be effective tanks on anything resembling a challenging mob.  <br />

First off, your not a tank.<br />
<br />
Second, be happy with what you have. The other pulling class has it much worse than you do. Try mitigating like a bard and thier &lt;cough&gt; &quot;avoidance&quot;. <br />
<br />
Monks avoid so much more damage than other class's. plus they have stonewall and mend. Its a joke to hear them whine about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Care to provide, you know, some data that indicates that monks have an innate avoidance advantage over warriors other than simply having block instead of parry?<br />
<br />
Didn't think so.<br />
<br />
Saying that monks have mend and stonestance to balance their poor mitigation, low AC armor, and ridiculous AC softcap is like saying that warriors don't need Incite because they have AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />

We might have been doing a bit better at tanking than was intended but that was through an itemization flaw, not an unbalanced class. We were given acces to gear that put us on equal ac to plate classes and our better avoidance gave us a slight edge, one that almost negated our hp disadvantage.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirea</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Combat works like this in EQ: <br />
<br />
Either an attempted hit misses or doesn't miss. Potential hits that are avoided with special skills like Dodge, Block, Parry, and Riposte need to be calculated not as &quot;missed&quot; but as &quot;Non Miss, Zero hit&quot;. In other words, there are 21 values on the damage curve, beginning with zero, NOT 20, beginning with 1, and that special avoidance skills are really &quot;100% mitigation&quot; for purposes of displaying tankability and damage taken. <br />
 <br />
<br />
I dont think this is entirely correct.<br />
<br />
If you have Strikethrough (item of AA), you will notice that you can miss after hitting through a mobs parry/riposte/dodge/block. This leads to think that defenses are checked before the base Hit or Miss chance. At least they are for players, but we can assume this works for mobs the same way.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Monk defensive skills and their chance to activate on any attack: Dodge (4%), Riposte (4%), Block (12%). <br />
Total chance of any skill activating = 4 + 4 + 12 = 20%<br />
- Warrior defensive skills and their chance to activate on any attack: <br />
Dodge (4%), Riposte (4%), Parry (6%). <br />
Total chance of any skill activating = 4 + 4 + 6 = 14%<br />
<br />
Now lets take a Mob, and say he has a base 50% to roll a Hit, and thus also 50% to roll a Miss. <br />
This means that a Monk's defensive skills will help him avoid 10% of the attack that would be hits (20% total chance of any skill activating x 50% of the attack being a Hit). The other 50% of the time a Monk's defensive skills kick in, the mob would have missed anyway, so them kicking in doesn't make any difference.<br />
<br />
Same for Warriors: their defensive skills will help him avoid 7% of the attack that would be hits (14% total chance of any skill activating x 50% of the attack being a Hit)<br />
<br />
So actually the defensive skills of any class count only for as much as the base To Hit chance of a mob (50% in my example). <br />
This does mean that the apparent 6% gap  between the 20% of a monk and 14% of a warrior, is actually closer to a 3% gap in Hits being avoided due to defensive skills.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because a monk *can/could* tank in certain situations, that doesn't make them a *tank class*. You were never tanks. You were a class that could tank in certain situations. That's like saying warriors are a soloing class. Sure we can do it with enough twinking and the right situation, but other classes do it considerably better and our strengths lie in other areas.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry to burst your bubble but no matter how much you want to believe otherwise, monks made decent tanks.  We were never raid mt tanks, but we were raid add tanks, we were passable group exp tanks, we could solo and stand toe to toe with a mob and win then go out and pull another while a warrior would be sitting on his butt for the next 20 minutes regenning hp. We were tanks with no taunt and less hp. meaning sub par in the important sections like raids, but good enough for anything else. Thats what we had been built to do, stand toe to toe with a mob, kick its ass and mend before running after another monster to kill. Hmm, stand toe to toe, that sounds like something a TANK does. <br />
<br />
We got nerfed because SOE is run by a bunch of idiots who figured it would be easier to just do a complete class wide nerf of monks than it would be to change the few high level items that were allowing us to close the gap in ac between warriors and monks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aggogg</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the &quot;problem&quot; is that monks think there needs to be a change to their mitigation without any alteration to their avoidance, so it's quite relevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, most monks are asking for a &quot;reverse of the nerf&quot;. That includes the avoidance boost they gave us then, and the mitigation reduction they took away.<br />
<br />
Assuming that the preference would be to not get hit, but if you did get hit, to be hit for min damage I did some calculations. So using your charts and numbers.<br />
<br />
Class____Hits___Miss_Zeros_Mins_Total Atks__Zero/Min %_Max Dam %______Ability<br />
Monk____1429_1641__407___275___3477________19.61%_____11.13%____8.48%<br />
Warrior__1258_1086__229___476___2573________27.40%______2.78%____24.62%<br />
Cleric___1823__919___33___270___2775________10.92%______6.09%____4.83%<br />
Druid___1600__988___31___334___2619________13.94%_____10.75%____3.19%<br />
Paladin__1611_1274__268___579___3153________26.86%______4.53%____22.33%<br />
SK_____1443_1304__204___454___2951________22.30%______5.55%____16.75%<br />
<br />
What this shows is that if you consider the percentage (Zero Hits + Min Hits) and subract the percentage (Max Hits) to show effective tankability.<br />
We see that Monks appear to have about the right percentage of Zero Hits + Min Hits.<br />
We see that Mitigation drives number of Max Hits %.<br />
We see that Druids and Clerics mitigate max hits better than Monks.<br />
We see that effective tanking puts monks way behind the other tank classes. And yes, I did consider my monk a light tank, as per the class description that STILL hasn't changed on the SOE website.<br />
<br />
Increasing our mitigation will reduce the number of Max Hits monks take making our damage taken less streaky, allowing us to be healed easier. I don't care if our avoidance decreases as long as our (Min/Zero Hit) percentage stays the same.<br />

<br />
you take a monk a druid and a Beastlord<br />
<br />
give them the exact same aa's and the Exact same gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
which class SHOULD take less damage?<br />
<br />
<br />
we have a casting class a hybrid of the monk class and a monk<br />
<br />
the way monks say it should work- it is only commonsense after all<br />
<br />
monks should take the least amount of damage<br />
beastlord 2nd<br />
druid 3rd<br />
<br />
the way it currently works is:<br />
<br />
beastlord take the least amount of damage<br />
druid 2nd<br />
monk last (but close to druid)<br />
<br />
that is all we ask for to take the least amount of damage over time vs the other leather classes. we are parent class of the beastlord we SHOULD take less damage over time than they do.  <br />
<br />
<br />
to do that they need to remove the mitigation nerf to monks entirely since the reasons FOR the nerf (SoE's Itemization of ntov and ssra/vex thal) were corrected in planes of power (a monk in full ntov/ssra/vex thal gear LOSES about a hundred ac or so going to FULL pop gear-while the plate classes GAIN about 3-5 hundred ac (or more i have not looked))<br />
<br />
that is also the reason why over 66% of the responses in the poll soe did about the issues for the monk class was mitigation. the next highest was itemization.<br />
<br />
itemization broke monks - itemization in pop WOULD have fixed monks - if they had left it all alone, but soe changed monk mitigation - which THEY ADMIT they did wrong but have not corrected the problem as of yet)</div></div><hr />

Amusingly enough, the druid mitigated better than the MNK or BST, but did take far more damage per second due to a getting hit much more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what were you trying to show, Aggogg?  10.75% for monks and 11.13% max hits on monks is almost the same, easily within the margin of error for ANY parse.  Since both are leather wearers, it would make sense that when they get hit, they take about the same damage.  Of course monks get hit a lot less.<br />
<br />
The parses with some Time geared stuff on the parse linked in this thread are tricky because the players aren't all similarly geared.  Is it reasonable that when the warrior has 15% shielding and no avoidance, the monk with similar level gear can have the 60% avoidance shown?  I don't know.  People who farm Time might know.  If it IS reasonable, then monks are doing extremely well.  Look at that damage over time taken compared to the other classes.  Yes, they can get spiked harder than plate wearers, but the top monk in that parse is still doing DAMN well.  I think buffing up a monk at that level any further would be overpowering.<br />

This  monk tanks a hell of a lot better than a ranger at least.  317 and 316 are the damage per hit numbers.  148.4 and 163.3 are the damage taken per swing.  This monk is mitigating at the same level as the ranger and obviously better avoidance is making a significant difference, roughly 10%.</div></div><hr />

I could care less what they do with monks but...I cant disagree with the monk community being a bit upset.  We have nothing to worry about.  They are going to take our roles.<br />
<br />
The problem with looking at 1300 ac monks is there are still very few out there.  The 1036 monk is about the average at 65.  1300 AC Rangers on the other and due to itemization can reach 1300 fairly easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh man, I love this shit...<br />
<br />
Where to begin....<br />
<br />
<br />
1. There is no monk AC softcap, according to Thepp's parses, monks continue to see mitigation improvement throughout the AC spectrum.    There is no evidence for a monk AC softcap anywhere whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The avoidance gear helped ZERO in terms of &quot;non miss zero hits&quot;... all that the +avoidance gear helped with was misses, and that wasn't shown on the data I pesented.<br />
<br />
3. If Block/Parry/Dodge/Riposte were checked prior to hit/miss, then monks would see the lowest number of &quot;misses&quot; since they were blocking misses at a higher rate than parry classes.  This isn't the case, therefore the statement that block fires prior to the hit/miss calculation is a stretch without evidence.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. The point isn't whether monks will be a threat to warriors, OR is &quot;what monks are looking for&quot; relevant in any way shape or form to this discussion.  I dont' give a rat's ass what monks are looking for.  What I want to know is... what would be the result of adding mitigation to monks without affecting their HUGE block advantage.  The net result would be monks displacing knights AND warriors for a role that they SHOULD NOT HAVE which is tanking.<br />
<br />
5. While all your impassioned please are fine and dandy, nothing refutes the numbers provided, which show BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that monks have a HUGE advantage in taking non miss zero hits, and if they are to get a mitigation &quot;return&quot;, then they NEED to exchange block for parry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea that monks are doing extremely well is... disturbing. The top monk in that parse is getting his ass handed to him, compared to the other melee classes. The only thing that makes him look remotely presentable is the worn effects discrepancy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried to find some reasonable lower end comparisons in the parse.  <br />
<br />
MNK  1331  0%   0    102  22.1  317.4  54.0  2550  46.8  42.1  10.4 4.5  NA   4.4  | 148.4<br />
<br />
RNG  1308  0%   0    102  22.1  316.4  54.2  2026  51.6  40.6  NA   3.6  5.6  4.0  | 163.3<br />

This monk is mitigating at the same level as the ranger and obviously better avoidance is making a significant difference, roughly 10%.<br />
<br />
So, basically what you're saying here is that a monk takes 10% less damage over time than a ranger. Of course, the monk also has an AC advantage. What happens when this goes away? Say, when the Ranger and the Monk both have 1800 AC. The monk still gets hit nearly as hard as he does at 1330 AC. Does the Ranger?<br />
<br />
Of course, this isn't a tanking comparison, this is just a comparison of damage taken/time. I would think that warriors of all people would have some appreciation for just how important snap aggro generation is for tanking. <br />
<br />
Even if monks somehow did getget their mitigation restored, and if they did have the mythical 'avoidance advantage', they still wouldn't compete for tank roles.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I should have been a little more careful using the origional posters numbers.  After looking at the thread he took values from, he used the 1854 AC Monk to compare to the 1565 AC Druid.  Even if the percentages were equal it would imply that Druids mitigate much better than Monks.<br />

Hi, our AC is capped around 1300.  Is plate classes AC capped?  If so, it's extremly high and even after 2k, plate tanks still see significant increases.  So let me get this straight, it's entirely possible for plate tanks to have an AC cap twice that of monks, and you are worried that we somehow might outtank you?  Ridiculous.  I don't think even Sony could manage to make a game system as jacked up as that.  You are really grasping for straws.  Nevermind that monks still do NOT have a reliable method to grab aggro, save for earthwalk which allows them to tank well for 12 seconds in which time a shaman could get a slow off, which recycles every 4 minutes.  Last I checked, mobs are pulled more than once every 4 minutes.  Monk tanking is still extremely inefficient, even in places we can survive, like EP.  GoD, forget it.<br />
<br />
Desite all of this, please tell me how giving us back our mitigation but then nerfing our avoiddance is a much needed upgrade?  It's not, it's trading one ability for another.  Imay make hits on us less streaky, but still won't change monks ability to get hit.  Are certain members of the warrior community really that scared about another class not getting smacked around hardcore every time a mob looks at them?  This is getting ridiculous.  How much tanking supremecy do you need?  To even suggest that ok, give them back part of their tanking ability, which was nerfed into the ground, but nerf part of what they still have!  Lame.</div></div><hr />

4. The point isn't whether monks will be a threat to warriors, OR is &quot;what monks are looking for&quot; relevant in any way shape or form to this discussion.  I dont' give a rat's ass what monks are looking for.  What I want to know is... what would be the result of adding mitigation to monks without affecting their HUGE block advantage.  The net result would be monks displacing knights AND warriors for a role that they SHOULD NOT HAVE which is tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever your smoking (referring to your 'shit' comment), please pass it this way.<br />
<br />
Monk have SIGNIFICANTLY fewer hps than a warrior.  Heck my 52 Warrior has 150 hps MORE THAN my 64 monk does.  My druid bot healer has a much easier time healing my 52 warrior than my 64 monk.<br />
<br />
You want to know what would be the result of adding mitigation to monks without affecting their HUGE block advantage.  Well that is simple.  You would have warriors with  significantly more AC than monks, with significantly more hps than monks, that would allow monks to take less damage over time than a warrior if they matched their AC.  Just because they (monk with equivalent AC) took less damage over time, does NOT mean they would be more mana efficient to heal except in the case where both warrior and monk both had over the 7500 hp CH limit.<br />

Im all for taking away the boost to avoidance if they return our mitigation back to normal.  Im tired of taking max, or near max hits every time a swing connects. Its garbage, we were fine pre nerf, still a little streaky but since our ac actually meant something back then, we werent taking all those max hits all the time so clerics could handle healing us in exp groups. Once again, our lack of hp compared to plate classes and our inability to get snap agro prevented us from being main tank most of the time in groups but when we couldnt find someone better a monk could step in and take it. Now id almost rather have the wizard act as mt in a group than do it myself. <br />
<br />
*EDIT* I missed the last couple of posts while writing mine but be serious for a second Fro, monks were NEVER gods of tanking. That was all hyped up propoganda with zero basis in fact. The only times a monk could be a raid mt was when he was geared from encounters well past that, say a vex thall equipped monk that could tank in ssra raids. Everywhere else, he was able to handle adds till someone could mezz/root/bring another warrior along to take it off his hands. What is so unbalanced about that? A class that was DESIGNED to solo through toe to toe combat actually being able to handle off tanking a trash mob add? /gasp. How horribly overpowering! /shudder a monk being able to main tank trivial raid content? THE HORROR!<br />

And neither will shamans, rogues, rangers, BLs, or anyone else who ever tanked in Luclin.  Because mobs in PoP and GoD DPS has been increased exponentially.  When are going to understand and admit to the difference in mobs from Pre-PoP and post-PoP?  Virtually anyone was a viable tank when exp mobs hit for 200.  Tier 2 exp mobs in PoP hit for 600, triple of previous expansions.  Higher tiers it's 800 and more.  GoD mob DPS is sick, not to mention their casting abilities.  Ask non-plate who have not had a mitigation nerf who could tank in Luclin if they can tank in GoD.  They will say no.  Has their mitigation been changed?  No, it's because mobs were too frickin easy Pre-PoP.  PoP helped define plate tank roles, because beforehand there was not enough of a gap between tank and non-plate.  PoP helped define your class much more than a meaningless nerf to a class that would not have been able to tank effectively in PoP or GoD even without the nerf.<br />

We will never be the &quot;gods&quot; we were in Luclin again (meaning Sony will never make content that's tankable by anyone), even with our mitigation back.</div></div><hr />

Wow, now this is just an outright lie, wonder how many will read it and believe it.  You apparently did not read Thepp's date, or are just pulling lies out of your ass.  The 1800 AC monk and 1300 AC monk tanked very closely.  If that's not the definition of a soft cap, then I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
Do you even know what a softcap is?  Generally it refers to significant decreases for the same amount of numerical increase.  Meaning an 1800 AC monk compared to a 1300 AC monk will not see anywhere near the same amount of increase in tanking compared to a jump from a 1300 AC to 1800 AC warrior.  I mean we arent even talking the same ballpark.  For monks, the increase is negligible.  For warriors, it's profound.<br />
<br />
And to the person who said that monks tank better than rangers.  What is so hard to believe that a pure melee class who is defined as a light tank be able to out tank a hybrid class?</div></div><hr />

Literally speaking, you didnt NEED a warrior, you could SURVIVE with a lesser tank, ie monks. It wasnt optimal but it could be done. Yeah, god forbid we return to a day when warriors werent absolutely required for a group. As someone else already posted, you are talking about an era where practically ANY class could be a tank, hell I used to melee exp mobs with my DRUID just because I didnt feel like root dotting the mobs down. Now, only the best equipped monks could tank anything past teir 1 and 2 planes without a crap ton of healing and just forget abour doing anything past that. Even if the nerf was totally removed today, and the avoidance boost also removed for balance, we STILL wouldnt take your place because A) we have plenty of hp less than a warrior. B) in most cases hundreds of ac less than plate classes. C) STILL no snap agro. You have been reading the lies for so long it has clouded your ability to remember just how EASY the game was back then with exp mob difficulty. You have been reading all the anti monk whines for so long its made you think you can remember days when raid leaders would say, &quot;Sorry Fro, we already have a monk to tank the boss mob.

Oh, you mean the bug where taunt did not work in CT?  Wouldnt surprise me at all that you overlooked this.  Even after taunt did work in CT, it was universally known that warriors had problems with aggro without Enraging Blow weapons.  Other melee classes could tank here, because again, they are slowable mobs, and while I forget how much CT mobs hit for, I'm thinking in the 300 range or so, half of PoP tier 2.  Big deal.  Tell me how this justifies a monk nerf?<br />
<br />
I'll never forget that shit.  I'll never allow it to return, ever as long as there's something I can do about it.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are bitter about monks, and that stops you from seeing things objectively.  You then put your spin on everything, which comes across as lies.  Poor you, other classes made fun of you because warrior taunt was not only broken in revamped CT, but because your class innately had aggro concerns.  Cry me a river.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean like hard ldon, or ldon RAIDS?<br />

How many times do monks tank hard ldons?  How many times do monks tank ldon raids?  Rarely, if ever for hards, and definetly never on raids.<br />
<br />
Sorry that there's an easy mode in ldon that allows any class to tank again.  It just reinforces my point that if you make mobs DPS low, any class can tank.<br />
<br />
And since we're arguing semantics, I could argue that what I meant is that from this day forward, Sony will not make worthwhile content that's tankable by anyone.  LDON would not fit this, since it was made before my statement.  There, now your statement that you highlighted and choose to ignore the rest of my posts is null and void.

Monks are tanking Vex Thall boss mobs! Noone will ever want to group a warrior now!&quot; and whining and whining and whining till eventually everyone else is convinced it must be a fact because &quot;Only the mentally ill would keep on this if it wasnt true.&quot; Then an uneccesary nerf occurs, a class is gutted from what was actually a fairly well balanced class, all over an itemization flaw that let monks get higher ac than they were ever meant to. Yes, when at equal ac a monk could tank as well as a warrior, thats the way ac worked, monks were never SUPPOSED to reach warrior ac, or havent you ever looked at monk only armor? Most of it is fairly low ac. But unfortunately soe decided to release all that drool worthy gear with 0 weight and all/all written on it and the ac balance went out the window.<br />
<br />
As for the softcap, it seems fairly obvious when reading that parse that monks gain only a tiny increase going from 1300 to 1800 ac. Thats the very essence of a softcap. We are effectively stuck at 1300 ac, yeah, if we work hard, raid constanly, and agument our gear we can hit 1800 ac, oh and look! We get a whole 1.5% improvement to our tanking ability over the last 500 ac! YAY! Thats so totally worth it!<br />

In out PoP and LDoN Knights became &quot;the&quot; preferred group tank because Warrior aggro generation was insufficient against the hard hitting, must be slowed now mobs of PoP and the semi-hard hitting, we're running against a deadline and have to kill everything as fast as we can, mobs of LDoN.<br />

And here in lies the problem Monks have with their perceptions of reality.  The reality is that Monks &quot;were&quot; tanks.  The reality is Monks are &quot;not now&quot; tanks.  Whether you argue that that they were intended to be tanks previously or you argue that they weren't intended to be tanks, but became so as a side effect of poor itemization, is really besides the point.  The point is SoE has come out with a decision, Monks are not tanks, and have implimented it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh man, I love this shit...<br />
<br />
Where to begin....<br />
<br />
<br />
1. There is no monk AC softcap, according to Thepp's parses, monks continue to see mitigation improvement throughout the AC spectrum.    There is no evidence for a monk AC softcap anywhere whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss to explain how you could come to this conclusion. Did you not read the initial data or did you just not understand it? There was virtually no difference in monk mitigation going from 1330 AC to 1850 AC. This is the softcap to which Thep referred.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The avoidance gear helped ZERO in terms of &quot;non miss zero hits&quot;... all that the +avoidance gear helped with was misses, and that wasn't shown on the data I pesented.<br />
<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, why did the best equipped monk dodge, block, and riposte more often (14.5% more often) than the monk with 1330 AC? Coincidence? Was it due to having 550 more AC, even though it didn't help his mitigation? Was it due to having 60 more Avoidance?<br />
<br />
<br />
4. The point isn't whether monks will be a threat to warriors, OR is &quot;what monks are looking for&quot; relevant in any way shape or form to this discussion.  I dont' give a rat's ass what monks are looking for.  What I want to know is... what would be the result of adding mitigation to monks without affecting their HUGE block advantage.  The net result would be monks displacing knights AND warriors for a role that they SHOULD NOT HAVE which is tanking.<br />
<br />
Huge? Monks block 12% of the time as opposed to parrying 6% of the time, and that's huge? <br />
<br />
I love how you say that &quot;The point isn't whether monks will be a threat to warriors&quot;, and then three sentences later say &quot;The net result would be monks displacing knights AND warriors&quot;. At least try not to contradict yourself within the same damn paragraph, or is displacement of a class not 'a threat'?<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, the ability to take damage is only one aspect of tanking. Monks still have no ability to generate snap aggro, and I do trust you remember what a key element that is to tanking. <br />
<br />
<br />
5. While all your impassioned please are fine and dandy, nothing refutes the numbers provided, which show BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that monks have a HUGE advantage in taking non miss zero hits, and if they are to get a mitigation &quot;return&quot;, then they NEED to exchange block for parry.<br />
<br />
Monks block 12% of the time, warriors parry 6% of the time. Now look at the mitigation percent numbers: monks mitigate roughly 55%, warriors 71%. If the monks' 6% block advantage is &quot;HUGE&quot;, then the warriors' 16% mitigation advantage is COLOSSAL, GARGANTUAN, and IN ALL OTHER WAYS RIDICULOUSLY PROPORTIONED. <br />
<br />
Way to present only one side of the equation, without bothering to point out the much larger discrepancy on the other end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sounds like a personal problem.....<br />
<br />
Monks got nerfed, (some) warriors rejoiced....until they realized that after the monk nerf nothing had changed for the better for them and they still had all the exact same issues. Wasn't too long after the monk nerf that you could hear some of those same rejoicing warriors stating that all other things being roughly equal, the ability to taunt/snap agg were by far the most important factor in tanking. <br />
<br />
Things aren't roughly equal now....we have significantly less ac and hp, and damn near every class in the game can out taunt a monk *if they put their mind to it*. Fix our mitigation and we won't be taking spots away from plate tanks for their role. As far as pure melee are concerned, monks know they can't be the best tanks...that spot's taken. Ditto on the best dps slot. A mitigation upgrade wouldn't give us the complete package we need for real tanking, but it would help in the only other area we have a role....pulling.<br />
<br />
....CT was broken when it came out.....the actual taunt ability didn't work for anyone in there at first iirc. Not sure why you'd want to base an opinion like that off of fubar'd content. Pretty sure all of the older 'uber content' that monks tanked back then that caused such a ruckus was tanked by chanters shortly thereafter =P. Monks took the bullet but the content that was in contention was cake for more then just us.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't think increasing our mitigation would really improve our desirability much at all. Without something else to go along with it we'd still be stuck in pretty much the same rut. After seeing that comment about you 'never allowing it to return' I'm starting to think I'd like to see it happen anyway just out of spite =P<br />

<br />
Which raises the question of &quot;what the hell are monks now&quot;. If there was a role for them beyond being a light tank class, it's becoming increasingly hard to find. They can't possibly be allowed to tank, because they don't wear plate! They can't approach rogues or wizards in damage. They can't have the tools to be a true pulling class, because that would be overpowering (nevermind if other classes have those tools). <br />

I've seen shaman, enchanters, rangers, and necros tank &quot;hard&quot; LDoNs too. The only way a monk, like these other classes, tanks a hard LDoN is if they have gear from encounters much further down the game progression scale than LDoN.<br />

Then they introduced velious and threw their plan of monks with low ac gear but a high natural avoidance out the window and gave us acess to high ac gear, bringing our mitigation ac up to very close to warrior/knight ac. So now we had equal or nearly mitigation and better avoidance, making the gap in tanking preference become based entirely on total hp and snap agro. Our dps could make up for the snap agro more or less if the rest of the group was careful with agro and the existence of cheal chains meant as long as you could survive a single max round, ANYTHING could tank. The whole problem stemmed soley from our new access to amazingly high ac gear. before then we had lower ac so mitigated worse than tanks but avoided better, causing a parity in tanking but the other downsides kept monks from being big tanks for groups and raids.  Instead of fixing the actual problem they made up some other problem and nerfed an entire class because at the very high end monks had an ac higher than we were supposed to. Now you tell me, you are saying its silly of us to complain about how we used to be tanks, how would YOU react if suddenly soe decided that warriors are meant to be dps only and removed your ac without upping your dps? Thats what happened to us. We lost our ability to tank and got NOTHING in return. No dps increase, no extra utility, nothing. We did the same dps as before but tanked signifacantly worse making us the second best melee dps class and the worst melee class tanking.<br />

This is particularly true since you're granted the bonus of being pullers who begin the aggro cycle.    <br />

1. Fact is, as the first post indicates, you take so much less damage than the two priest classes that it's fucking LAUGHABLE that monks say 'we tank worse than druids/clerics&quot;.<br />

I will not argue whether monks should be one of the top dps classes. IMO, if their offensive damage is not in the top tier for offensive dps, then it needs to be corrected. <br />

Actually he only got us fired up because he FIRST posted this drivel on monklybusiness and trolled us some, THEN posted it again over at SoEs monk boards, potentially harming our chances of getting some fixes done if some from SoE is stupid enough to believe him. Youre the 3rd place i know of that he hit with this bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the people claming that monks were never intended to be tanks, and that SoE decided that monks shouldnt tank, can any of you explain to me why we got the following AAs that REQUIRE us to get hit to use them?:<br />
<br />
Double Riposte<br />
Return Kick<br />
Flash of Steel<br />
<br />
These AAs indicate that were supposed to tank, at least to a degree. As for our uber tanking abilities, yes my level 64 monk CAN tank in PoValor, did it a few nights ago because we had to either do that, or split up group because shammy threatened to quit if we didnt get some mobs pulled, and no tanks were LFG.<br />
I tanked fine, only required 3 cheals pr mob, and shammy required 2 fast heals because my monk were not able to get the mob off him due to his slow aggro, before i had gotten mob to around 75%. And im at 1266 AC and 4K HP at level 64, as highly twinked as i can get (full stonehide apart from 1 bracer and my flayed barby legs). A ordinary monk that dont have the financed to have that gear would get creamed FAST.<br />
<br />
As it is at the moment, 95% of my monks group are guild groups when i waited long enough for someone to leave. XP groups i only get if no other DPS class is LFG (last group i were in i got because the ONLY other 60-65 persons LFG was a warrior, and we had a pally tank (so stop complaining knights :)), and a cleric, which we had 1 of already), or even worse, dont get at all.<br />
Was in PoV at level 63, sat LFG for 90 min with only me and a 5 person group in zone, a warrior, cleric, ranger, shaman (or chanter, cant remember), and rogue. They ignored me for 90 min (although they loose NO XP from taking me for extra PDS, according ot SoE). After those 90 min, a level 61 BST zone in, do a LFG once, and they take him. A TWO level lower hybrid of me, when they dont need his spells, and he STILL get a group spot right away where they ignore the monks.<br />
<br />
Thats our real problems. No group utility (whee, we can pull, 6 other classes can do that faster nowadays), we can DPS, but were like 6th in the line there, depending on situation, we can tank.....oh no, that died with Luclin.<br />
No reason to take a monk, because they dont add something unique, they dont add something that at least 2 other classes can do better (while they will bring some utility too), so why take a monk.</div></div><hr />

If, for the sake of arguement, it is assumed that you had something that you shouldn't have had, the ability to tank pretty darn well, and it was determined by SoE that you shouldn't have it, why do you think you should get something in return?<br />
<br />
Case in point, Enchanters used to be able to use charmed NPCs to take out most of the mini-named in BoT quite easily.  SoE decided that shouldn't be the case.  Viola, they nerfed it and Enchanters got nothing in return.</div></div><hr />

This sounds suspiciously like it was made up to dodge the fact that you couldn't reply to the nicely phrased answers others supplied after you went through points 1-5 to my earlier post.<br />
<br />
On to your two extra points:<br />
<br />
1.  I actually agree with what you say here.  It's when you generalize it and apply it to sound like the monk community as a whole that I have an issue.  Again, most monks would be happy knowing they mitigated better than a druid.  We're not looking for knight-like or warrior-like mitigation here.<br />
<br />
2.  This is again nothing more than silly mischaracterization and huff.  It also supports my conclusion that you're doing this not as a valid warrior balance discussion, but simply to try to start a poo-flinging contest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmm...so the difference between monks and warriors mitigation would be...ummm....what...ginormous? 6% is huge....16% must be...well...cosmic. <br />
<br />
With a cosmic difference already, I don't understand how returning the portion that was taken away to a class with much lower hit points, much lower ac, and a less effective aggro method would in any way threaten knights or warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uglukson</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite line is entirely useless then?  You won't mind giving it up?<br />
<br />
I had my SoT auged with a Ykesha proc, and if I got lucky with early procs I could tank a hard LDoN reasonably effectively, because I have the HPs to do it.  Anyone who has the HPs and can generate agro to do it.  My groupmates didn't like it so much though because if I wasn't lucky with procs early, they'd take agro off me like taking candy from a baby.  Funny, I don't see this happening too often with warriors who use the Incite line (or knights for that matter).  Lucky agro is a pointless argument though!<br />
<br />
As an aside, I ended up taking the Ykesha proc off because in a raid environment it was too much agro.  My AC, with buffs to over 1600, meant nothing in GoD when a 2000+ hitter would turn on me and paste me in a couple of fast-hitting rounds.  I was having to constantly flop and engage late to ensure I didn't steal agro off our main tank.<br />
<br />
The outrageous misinterpretation of Thep's data has been covered ad nauseum above.  The soft cap is known, but on top of that we have the AC nerf to new monk equipment (which doesn't mean anything at the moment with the cap in place, admittedly), the large HP differentiation now between monks and plate tank classes in terms of gear and AA abilities, the fact that mobs hit so hard in the high-end game all conspired to double the effect of the AC soft cap.  Now we come to GoD, where the mobs hit harder again, the items take us over our worn weight limit pretty quickly (again, this doesn't mean anything with the soft cap in place), plus mobs at a raid level just plain hit more often.  The advantage of getting hit less often is not much of an advantage when you get hit for max more often every time you do, and you get hit nearly every time regardless.  A failed FD on a split in some places is instant death, because you just don't avoid enough hits like you would in PoP, or elsewhere.  Another 10 avoidance isn't going to help me avoid death there, but an AC figure that actually means something as my gear improves might.  As warrior AC heads into the mid to high 2000s, monks get no benefit for theirs approaching 2000.  <br />
<br />
The evidence above indicates that the reasons that made monks tanking current content a possibility have been fixed without the AC soft cap being in place.  We just can't do it any more.  You can bring up AO monks tanking Fennin all you like, but the fact is any class that had the HPs and could hold enough agro could tank Fennin with a very good CH rot and BoV.  And before you mention a monk holding agro, riposte discs can only be used once every 45 minutes or so, it's hardly something a monk can do back to back.<br />
<br />
So monks can't tank effectively at raid level or consistently for hard-hitting group content.  That leaves old content, and do you really care about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leewei</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The notion that monks weren't originally intended to tank is something that I think needs to be dispelled to a degree.  We certainly weren't intended to ever be the tanks that warriors or knights are.  All the same, as of the original release, EQ was not intended to have the role of puller.  This basically leaves melee roles of damage and tanking.  While monks were originally very good damage dealers by then-standards of EQ, we also had exceptional defensive abilities making us a decent &quot;jeep&quot; class -- unsuitable for tanking heavy targets, but certainly capable of standing up to blue cons if well-equipped.<br />
<br />
I would say that the core set of monk skills, specifically Block, Dodge, Riposte and Defense and their relative higher caps compared to other fighting classes represent the intended role of monks in EQ to a good degree.  Lower HP total and Mend are a trade-off.  The original generic item AC did work the same across the various classes -- the mitigation profiles introduced in EQ are a fairly recent occurance in the lifetime of the game.  The class's original AC bonus for low weight made up for the inability to wear heavier armors to a degree as well.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced that monks were not intended to tank the early game nasties such as Nagafen, Vox, Phinagel and so on, but all the same, we were intended to be able to go toe-to-to with blue mobs, even solo -- something we cannot do effectively in the EQ endgame as things stand right now.  EQ is increasingly group- and raid-oriented.  If monks are to remain viable, we certainly need more desirability in both situations.</div></div><hr />

Actually, let's take this on one at a time.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Bards get flash of steel and double ripo too.   That mean they were intended to tank?    The only thing you have that they don't is return kick.  That argument is irrelevant.   The existence of AA skills that require you to get hit doesn't mean you were intended to be hit.<br />
<br />
95% of most peoples' groups are guild groups, that's not a valid argument either.   95% of my groups are guild groups as well... does that mean i can't tank?   Of course not, it means that it's orders of magnitude easier finding a group in guild than a pickup group.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other problems you've illustrated with a lack of a unique role will NOT be solved by returning your mitigation.   The fact that monk weapon itemization is so gay is entirely unrelated to mitigation, as is the fact that you dont' have enough quality offensive AA's.   <br />
<br />
You DO have some valid isues, but mitigation is NOT one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who said it was useless?  Certianly not any warrior on this thread, but guess what... I was a warrior before incite... and prior to WA5 and Ykesha procs and melee aggro.    You know and I know that you could've ganked aggro easily from a warrior pre-incite, as a matter of fact, I was told TODAY by a monk that he ganks aggro from warriors alll the time, even WITH incite and taunt.   <br />
<br />
The fact that you don't have tools to generate aggro though.... like incite and taunt, is a CLEAR indication why you arent' intended to be tanks.    Rangers are intended to be tanks before monks, they have a taunt button for god's sake.<br />

<br />
Welcome to my world of 6 months ago, but nonetheless... that's neither here nor there, since the fact that you dont' have tools to take aggro is a good indication that you arent' supposed to be tanking.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I ended up taking the Ykesha proc off because in a raid environment it was too much agro. My AC, with buffs to over 1600, meant nothing in GoD when a 2000+ hitter would turn on me and paste me in a couple of fast-hitting rounds. I was having to constantly flop and engage late to ensure I didn't steal agro off our main tank.<br />
<br />
Welcome to my world of today.... should I scream &quot;unfair&quot; because I don't have a way to &quot;shed&quot; aggro?   Hell no, because I'm designed from the ground up to want to take damage, so I need to alter my playstyle to compensate for it when I don't.   With Raex BP and Symbol, and Auged weapons with WA5, I am damn dangerous to myself on raids unlike you....<br />
<br />
<br />
The outrageous misinterpretation of Thep's data has been covered ad nauseum above.<br />
<br />
If there weren't a constant decline in max damage hits as AC is added, then you'd have a case, but there IS a constant decline.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the &quot;softcap&quot; argument carries with it so many subtleties that it's impossible to make such a declaration based on such limited data, since there's FAR too many questions involved.<br />
<br />
I mean, for many monks, particularly the howlers who claim that druids tank better than them, having to collect and analyze data from different sources prior to reaching a conclusion is a &quot;minor inconvenience, I've already made up my mind&quot;.   The fact that from a single dataset that one can make a widespread argument like &quot;there's an AC softcap&quot; is nonsense.     Yes, the data is great for comparing classes, it's absolutely not enough for making a declaration such as &quot;There is an AC softcap&quot; and applying that gamewide then petitioning for improvements based on that intellectually lazy declaration. <br />
<br />
There's 3 truths.... <br />
<br />
1. The Thepp data is nowhere near enough to make a declaration of a gamewide softcap on, with a single mob in HoH.<br />
<br />
2. Thepp's mitigation data at at least one datapoint is mostly irrelevant since he had the same amount of worn AC and merely added coinage to lower inherent AC.  This is NOT how you determine softcaps.<br />
<br />
2. Even in Thepp's data, there was a continuous increase in mitigation with more AC.   <br />
<br />
<br />
 The soft cap is known<br />
<br />
The &quot;softcap&quot; is guessed.   Monkly business is among the WORST communities in EQ when it comes to gathering and analyzing data.   The existence of a &quot;softcap&quot; gamewide is &quot;accepted&quot; by monks because Thepp provided some numbers, and then said that he thought that based on that, that there was one.    A gamewide &quot;AC Softcap&quot; has HARDLY been shown to be true.<br />
<br />
<br />
 but on top of that we have the AC nerf to new monk equipment (which doesn't mean anything at the moment with the cap in place, admittedly), the large HP differentiation now between monks and plate tank classes in terms of gear and AA abilities, the fact that mobs hit so hard in the high-end game all conspired to double the effect of the AC soft cap. <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually you're incredibly wrong, and it's all based on ill thought out logical assumptions.   <br />
<br />
First:  The hitpoint difference between knights and monks is not that large, it's actually relatively small, less than 10%.  Warriors have a MUCH larger difference in hitpoints since Sturdiness was introduced AND because we have a different hp/sta calculation.    <br />
<br />
Second:  Mobs that hit hard also favor avoidance, since an avoided max hit has more benefit than a mitigated one.<br />
    <br />
<br />
Now we come to GoD, where the mobs hit harder again, the items take us over our worn weight limit pretty quickly (again, this doesn't mean anything with the soft cap in place), plus mobs at a raid level just plain hit more often. The advantage of getting hit less often is not much of an advantage when you get hit for max more often every time you do, and you get hit nearly every time regardless. A failed FD on a split in some places is instant death, because you just don't avoid enough hits like you would in PoP, or elsewhere. Another 10 avoidance isn't going to help me avoid death there, but an AC figure that actually means something as my gear improves might. As warrior AC heads into the mid to high 2000s, monks get no benefit for theirs approaching 2000. <br />
<br />
<br />
HERE is where you and I partially agree.    Accuracy on Kyvs is retardedly overgood, and against Kyvs, monks DO suffer.    For the rest, I dont' really see it as that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
The evidence above indicates that the reasons that made monks tanking current content a possibility have been fixed without the AC soft cap being in place. We just can't do it any more. You can bring up AO monks tanking Fennin all you like, but the fact is any class that had the HPs and could hold enough agro could tank Fennin with a very good CH rot and BoV. And before you mention a monk holding agro, riposte discs can only be used once every 45 minutes or so, it's hardly something a monk can do back to back.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but monks can hold aggro just fine for what they are.   You even said that you had to unaug your SoT because you did it too well.   Certainly snap aggro isn't a strong point, but over time you're just fine.   <br />
<br />
<br />
So monks can't tank effectively at raid level or consistently for hard-hitting group content. That leaves old content, and do you really care about that?<br />
<br />
This is PRECISELY where they should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xao</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This sounds suspiciously like it was made up to dodge the fact that you couldn't reply to the nicely phrased answers others supplied after you went through points 1-5 to my earlier post.<br />
<br />
On to your two extra points:<br />
<br />
1.  I actually agree with what you say here.  It's when you generalize it and apply it to sound like the monk community as a whole that I have an issue.  Again, most monks would be happy knowing they mitigated better than a druid.  We're not looking for knight-like or warrior-like mitigation here.<br />
<br />
2.  This is again nothing more than silly mischaracterization and huff.  It also supports my conclusion that you're doing this not as a valid warrior balance discussion, but simply to try to start a poo-flinging contest.<br />
<br />
Get used to it. This is Frodlin's modus operandi. He sets up a partial dataset, uses it to make wildly inaccurate conclusions, and then ignores all the holes that others shoot in his theory in favor of screaming at the top of his lungs &quot;YOU SHOULDN'T TANK&quot;, usually followed by a repetition of his previous conclusion as though it was gospel fact. He has one of the most sever cases of selective hearing (reading?) that I've encountered in a long time.<br />
<br />
At some point you're also almost guaranteed to see a real life rationalization for why a leather class shouldn't take hits well. I see that in this thread he's skipped that so far and went with the &quot;you're unprepared, so you get hit harder&quot; routine. Apparently he's never actually taken a physics course that would have taught him about things like equal but opposite reactions and inertia.</div></div><hr />

Funny thing is I've never ONCE seen a refutation of the dataset.... it's right there black and white clear as day... don't ignore it, take it on, not by sloughing it off and going &quot;well we avoid more but...&quot;.   No, the block skill makes you take FAR FAR FAR less hits than any other class in EQ.   This isn't a small number, it's ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.   You have more non-miss zero hits by a factor of TEN over priests who you still bitch about, and double over warriors, SK's and Paladins, yet you want to ignore that and focus only on &quot;when you get hit&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Refute it, I BEG you to.   Point to me where I've made a SINGLE inaccurate conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xao</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who said it was useless?  Certianly not any warrior on this thread, but guess what... I was a warrior before incite... and prior to WA5 and Ykesha procs and melee aggro.    You know and I know that you could've ganked aggro easily from a warrior pre-incite, as a matter of fact, I was told TODAY by a monk that he ganks aggro from warriors alll the time, even WITH incite and taunt.   <br />
<br />
The fact that you don't have tools to generate aggro though.... like incite and taunt, is a CLEAR indication why you arent' intended to be tanks.    Rangers are intended to be tanks before monks, they have a taunt button for god's sake.<br />
<br />
So, since hybrids have more aggro generation tools than you do, they should obviously be superior tanks.<br />
<br />
Since Enchanters and Shaman both have obscene aggro generation capability, they should obviously also be tanks.<br />
<br />
This is a ridiculous premise as even a cursory examination would have told you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to my world of 6 months ago, but nonetheless... that's neither here nor there, since the fact that you dont' have tools to take aggro is a good indication that you arent' supposed to be tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, when warriors lacked the tools to properly take aggro, that must have been a good indication that you aren't supposed to be tanking? Ridiculous!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If there weren't a constant decline in max damage hits as AC is added, then you'd have a case, but there IS a constant decline.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the &quot;softcap&quot; argument carries with it so many subtleties that it's impossible to make such a declaration based on such limited data, since there's FAR too many questions involved.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. It may be too complex for you to understand, but for the rest of us, it's trivial. Past a certain point, AC goes up, Mitigation does not. It ain't rocket science here, bubba.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, for many monks, particularly the howlers who claim that druids tank better than them, having to collect and analyze data from different sources prior to reaching a conclusion is a &quot;minor inconvenience, I've already made up my mind&quot;.   The fact that from a single dataset that one can make a widespread argument like &quot;there's an AC softcap&quot; is nonsense.     Yes, the data is great for comparing classes, it's absolutely not enough for making a declaration such as &quot;There is an AC softcap&quot; and applying that gamewide then petitioning for improvements based on that intellectually lazy declaration. <br />
<br />
Right. It's so much better to take other people's data, draw erroneous conclusions from it and ignore all the reasons why your doctrine is wrong. Repeating yourself more loudly doesn't make you right... it just makes you resemble the stereotypical ugly American tourist.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's 3 truths.... <br />
<br />
1. The Thepp data is nowhere near enough to make a declaration of a gamewide softcap on, with a single mob in HoH.<br />
<br />
False. Thep already stated that his damage distribution was comparable on every high end mob he fought. Other monks have confirmed this. Nice try though.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Thepp's mitigation data at at least one datapoint is mostly irrelevant since he had the same amount of worn AC and merely added coinage to lower inherent AC.  This is NOT how you determine softcaps.<br />
<br />
The coinage datapoint was not used in determining the softcap. Again, nice try but entirely irrelevant. It wasn't even a boundary condition test.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Even in Thepp's data, there was a continuous increase in mitigation with more AC.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Incorrect. There were definite diminishing returns, which is the definition of a soft cap as opposed to a hard cap. In this particular case they diminished to the point of virtually no returns. Again, entirely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;softcap&quot; is guessed.   Monkly business is among the WORST communities in EQ when it comes to gathering and analyzing data.   The existence of a &quot;softcap&quot; gamewide is &quot;accepted&quot; by monks because Thepp provided some numbers, and then said that he thought that based on that, that there was one.    A gamewide &quot;AC Softcap&quot; has HARDLY been shown to be true.<br />
<br />
It's funny you mention this as you're using data gathered by a Monkly Business member. Way to repudiate your own data source! It's certaintly much easier to do that than gather any of your own information, though. Hell, if you had to conduct test of your own, you wouldn't have as much time to spread lies and misinformation about monks.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, some of the members of Monkly Business were among the vanguard (along with some of the Shaman's Crucible members) of the parsers who discovered that in old-school EQ stats meant bupkus. Of course, we hung out at Q's place or The Dojo back then. The monks have an impressive history of knowing about the mechanics of the game. <br />
<br />
As mentioned before there has been more evidence gathered in support of the softcap. Thep's evidence is just one excellent proof of its existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually you're incredibly wrong, and it's all based on ill thought out logical assumptions.   <br />
<br />
First:  The hitpoint difference between knights and monks is not that large, it's actually relatively small, less than 10%.  Warriors have a MUCH larger difference in hitpoints since Sturdiness was introduced AND because we have a different hp/sta calculation.    <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what the formula for hp/sta calculation is for monks? How about for hybrids?<br />
<br />
<br />
Second:  Mobs that hit hard also favor avoidance, since an avoided max hit has more benefit than a mitigated one.<br />
    <br />
Of course, mobs that hit harder also favor mitigation, since they bring with them the possibility of one-round deaths. Mitigation is vastly superior to avoidance when it allows a class to survive rounds that would have killed a monk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but monks can hold aggro just fine for what they are.   You even said that you had to unaug your SoT because you did it too well.   Certainly snap aggro isn't a strong point, but over time you're just fine.   <br />
<br />
What a turn around a few short months can make! Not long ago it was warriors being told that their aggro was fine because although &quot;snap aggro isn't a strong point,... over time you're just fine&quot;. The protests from warriors still echo, yet here we have a warrior applying the same argument to another class. This is what we call &quot;hypocracy&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is PRECISELY where they should be.<br />
<br />
Another unsupported claim that monks should suck because they're intended to suck. Fine, here's the counter argument that's precisely as valid as yours:<br />
<br />
Monks need changed because they're not even close to where they should be.<br />
<br />
See how easy it is to make unsupported declarative statements, kids?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh...<br />
<br />
I don't agree with that.<br />
<br />
Avoidance is too streaky to make that assumption true. Sure you COULD avoid a good deal of hits. But at the same time vs mobs that hit hard you could fail to avoid any hits and die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on your statement that monks avoid damage far better than other classes, and that avoidance is better than mitigation vs hard hitting mobs logic would lead one to believe that monks are the best tanks for higher end PoP Gods and GoD encounters... this is most certainly not true.<br />
<br />
Therefor avoidance does not win out over mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which do you use more as a warrior? Defensive or Evasive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xao</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny thing is I've never ONCE seen a refutation of the dataset.... it's right there black and white clear as day... don't ignore it, take it on, not by sloughing it off and going &quot;well we avoid more but...&quot;.

<br />
Refute it, I BEG you to.   Point to me where I've made a SINGLE inaccurate conclusion.<br />
<br />
Do you even understand what these words mean?!<br />
<br />
Error number one: &quot;No, the block skill makes you take FAR FAR FAR less hits than any other class in EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, according to Thep's data that you so gleefully use and denigrate, monks get hit 41.1% of the time. Warriors get hit 48.9% of the time. This means that warriors get hit 1.19 times as often as monks. Basically, they get hit 19% more often when compared to monks. AND THIS IS WITH THE MONK HAVING SIXTY MORE POINTS OF AVOIDANCE. This is not &quot;FAR FAR FAR less (sic) hits&quot;, by any stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
Error number two: &quot;This isn't a small number, it's ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE&quot;<br />
<br />
19% is not &quot;ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE&quot;. In fact, it's not even a single order of magnitude. It's actually less than one-fiftieth of a single order of magnitude.<br />
<br />
Error number 3: &quot;You have more non-miss zero hits by a factor of TEN over priests who you still bitch about, and double over warriors, SK's and Paladins&quot;<br />
<br />
No we don't. Even with the aforementioned gear discrepancy, monks did not defend twice as many hits as warriors did. In fact, even with the additional avoidance, the monk successfully defended against 22.1% of the attacks while the warrior clocked in at 15.4%. For the less mathematically inclined amongst us, that's just under 1.5 times as often, which is less than twice as often.<br />
<br />
There, three erroneous conclusions that you drew in the post claiming that you did no such thing. That's what we call irony.<br />
<br />

Tanks have taunt.  It's this little button they get to push that does almost nothing, but they have it anyway because it makes them feel good.  Non-tanks don't have taunt.  They may sometimes do &quot;okay&quot; at tanking, but that doesn't make them tanks.</div></div><hr />

False. Thep already stated that his damage distribution was comparable on every high end mob he fought. Other monks have confirmed this. Nice try though.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, &quot;Thepp said so&quot; is your rationale?  I'm trying to understand where you actually analyze any DATA... &quot;Thepp said so&quot; isnt' data, it's not trying to gain an understanding of the EQ combat system.<br />
<br />
Here, let me give you a couple of hints:<br />
<br />
1. Go to 3 PoP zones of varying difficulty (I recommend HoH, Reguras in Water, and PoDisease).   <br />
<br />
2. Log incoming damage on a monk at 5 different AC values that range from 1k to 2k in each zone<br />
<br />
3. Go to an LDoN easy<br />
<br />
4. Repeat step 2<br />
<br />
5. Go to an LDoN Hard<br />
<br />
6. Repeat step 2<br />
<br />
7. Go to Riwwi Coliseum<br />
<br />
8. Repeat Step 2<br />
<br />
9. Go to Vxed<br />
<br />
10. Repeat Step 2<br />
<br />
11. Go to Kod Taz<br />
<br />
12. Repeat Step 2.<br />
<br />
13. Present both the raw as well as the analyzed data.   <br />
<br />
14. Allow others to analyze it (note:  without attacking them)<br />
<br />
15. Then you are prepared to make a case for a global AC cap IF there exists one, which there doesn't.<br />
<br />
The coinage datapoint was not used in determining the softcap. Again, nice try but entirely irrelevant. It wasn't even a boundary condition test.<br />
<br />
So you're SERIOUSLY trying to tell me that with TWO samples in a SINGLE zone, you can declare the existence of a global AC softcap?    Then you accuse ME of misrepresenting data?   God the irony is delicious.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's funny you mention this as you're using data gathered by a Monkly Business member. Way to repudiate your own data source! It's certaintly much easier to do that than gather any of your own information, though. Hell, if you had to conduct test of your own, you wouldn't have as much time to spread lies and misinformation about monks.<br />
<br />
Actually, I used Thepp's data specifically because it has widespread acceptance among many classes, as well as the fact that it's relatively comprehensive.   Data can be reliable, even if the collector of such came to some incorrect conclusions in his analysis.    <br />
<br />
Just so you know, some of the members of Monkly Business were among the vanguard (along with some of the Shaman's Crucible members) of the parsers who discovered that in old-school EQ stats meant bupkus. Of course, we hung out at Q's place or The Dojo back then. The monks have an impressive history of knowing about the mechanics of the game. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I remember that, those were absolutely incorrect conclusions as well.   I recal the &quot;strength buffs are meaningless&quot; arguments and how bunk they've been proven to be, since at the time there was NO ONE who was maxed str, and buffing Str increased atk, which we ALL now know has an effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
As mentioned before there has been more evidence gathered in support of the softcap. Thep's evidence is just one excellent proof of its existence.<br />
<br />
Point to me the data that shows this.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   <br />
Of course, mobs that hit harder also favor mitigation, since they bring with them the possibility of one-round deaths. Mitigation is vastly superior to avoidance when it allows a class to survive rounds that would have killed a monk.<br />
<br />
High DI mobs favor mitigation, this is clearly true.   Mobs such as Pixxt Annihilator, Kod Named, etc.   Most mobs that &quot;hit hard&quot; don't have high DI AND particularly post last patch, most mobs do NOT hit for max that often.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What a turn around a few short months can make!

<br />
No, it's what is called &quot;context&quot;.   Warriors were designed to be tanks, they were desgned to be able to gain a mob's attention.  As a matter of fact, it's in the class description, as well as in a number of patch messages.   Monks are not.  it's neither a feature in their class description nor is it found anywhere among SOE writings.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another unsupported claim that monks should suck because they're intended to suck. Fine, here's the counter argument that's precisely as valid as yours:<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
I didn't say monks were intended to suck.   I said monks were intended to be low mitigation.   There's a reason I can say this and it be accurate.    Because SoE looked at your mitigation and lowered it after testing it vs. your avoidance.   They first did it too much, then they undid some of it.</div></div><hr />

15. Then you are prepared to make a case for a global AC cap IF there exists one, which there doesn't.<br />
<br />
Damage distribution is roughly the same for a monk in any of those zones.<br />
<br />
Testing them at 100 AC won't tell us anything. The softcap doesn't occur until the 1300-1350 range.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you're SERIOUSLY trying to tell me that with TWO samples in a SINGLE zone, you can declare the existence of a global AC softcap?    Then you accuse ME of misrepresenting data?   God the irony is delicious.<br />
<br />
No, but again, a valiant attempt to speak for me. If you'll read what I actually wrote, you'll notice that I mention that similar damage distribution has been noted throughout PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I used Thepp's data specifically because it has widespread acceptance among many classes, as well as the fact that it's relatively comprehensive.   Data can be reliable, even if the collector of such came to some incorrect conclusions in his analysis.    <br />
<br />
A point which you've managed to drive home quite effectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I remember that, those were absolutely incorrect conclusions as well.   I recal the &quot;strength buffs are meaningless&quot; arguments and how bunk they've been proven to be, since at the time there was NO ONE who was maxed str, and buffing Str increased atk, which we ALL now know has an effect.<br />
<br />
Nope, at the time those conclusions were entirely accurate. TONS of people maxxed strength. It's fairly clear that you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about in regards to this. <br />
<br />
<br />
Point to me the data that shows this.<br />
<br />
    <br />
I don't have four and five year old data lying around for your convenience. Feel free to run a search for Tudamorf's results, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it's what is called &quot;context&quot;.   Warriors were designed to be tanks, they were desgned to be able to gain a mob's attention.  As a matter of fact, it's in the class description, as well as in a number of patch messages.   Monks are not.  it's neither a feature in their class description nor is it found anywhere among SOE writings.   <br />
<br />
Which is exactly why monks will never be true tanks, even with normal mitigation. Snap aggro does matter. Saying it doesn't flys in the face of months of warrior protests.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't say monks were intended to suck.   I said monks were intended to be low mitigation.   There's a reason I can say this and it be accurate.    Because SoE looked at your mitigation and lowered it after testing it vs. your avoidance.   They first did it too much, then they undid some of it.<br />
<br />
Oh sure, because SOE has never been wrong about class balance issues. Claiming that you must be right because SOE said so is a sure sign that you have no ground to stand on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Error number one: &quot;No, the block skill makes you take FAR FAR FAR less hits than any other class in EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, according to Thep's data that you so gleefully use and denigrate, monks get hit 41.1% of the time. Warriors get hit 48.9% of the time. This means that warriors get hit 1.19 times as often as monks. Basically, they get hit 19% more often when compared to monks. AND THIS IS WITH THE MONK HAVING SIXTY MORE POINTS OF AVOIDANCE. This is not &quot;FAR FAR FAR less (sic) hits&quot;, by any stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, let's see if I got this straight.   11% of the hits that actually land on a monk are for max damage and that's &quot;Terrible mitigation&quot; compared to warriors who have a 3% max damage rate.    On the other hand if you avoid 19% more potential hits, which doesn't mean they hit for less, but for ZERO, it's not a lot.    And you have the gall to call me a hypocrate?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Error number two: &quot;This isn't a small number, it's ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE&quot;<br />
<br />
19% is not &quot;ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE&quot;. In fact, it's not even a single order of magnitude. It's actually less than one-fiftieth of a single order of magnitude.<br />
<br />
Actually, the term &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; was referring to the difference between priests/monks, and 1000% is indeed an &quot;order of magnitude&quot;.   You skillavoid indeed roughly 1000% more than a cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Error number 3: &quot;You have more non-miss zero hits by a factor of TEN over priests who you still bitch about, and double over warriors, SK's and Paladins&quot;<br />
<br />
No we don't. Even with the aforementioned gear discrepancy, monks did not defend twice as many hits as warriors did. In fact, even with the additional avoidance, the monk successfully defended against 22.1% of the attacks while the warrior clocked in at 15.4%. For the less mathematically inclined amongst us, that's just under 1.5 times as often, which is less than twice as often.<br />
<br />
WAY TO GO MR ACCURACY!    You'll note that the quote that you attribute to me talks about priests and not warriors.    It'd be much better to &quot;refute&quot; that which I said rather than that which was not said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the general point is that if you have high avoidance, because of the way the EQ combat system works with DB DI AC etc, unless there is a penalty mitigation, situations can, and do arrise, where the class with better avoidance, and normal mitigation,  &quot;tanks&quot; (the damage asorbtion part) then the clas with better mitigation, and normal avoidance.<br />
<br />
If the system that damage was taken, or even how War Pal SK take damage was different then having superior mitigation could always be superior to superior avoidance, however in EQ its not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, technically, I implied that you're a hypocrite, and that stands. You'll notice that when I did my calculations, warriors took 19% more hits relative to monks. In this case, monks take 267% percent more max damage hits compared to warriors. You have to make equivalent comparisons, not simply pull numbers out of your ass to try and refute a point. If you want to derive percentages relative to the total number of hits, that's fine, but you have to do it in both cases. Similarly, it's valid to derive percentages relative to each class' performance, this is also acceptable, but it must also be done in both cases, an excercise which I performed for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me explain... no, there is too much. Let me sum up:&quot;<br />
You're still wrong.<br />

Here's exactly what you wrote: &quot; No, the block skill makes you take FAR FAR FAR less hits than any other class in EQ. This isn't a small number, it's ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.&quot;<br />

You were not talking about priests. You were talking about &quot;any other class in EQ&quot;. Nice attempt at revisionist history, but it just won't fly. If you meant to talk about priests somewhere in there, that's an issue to take up with your education system. As it stands, this is another of the erroneous conclusions you begged me to point out.<br />

The test ASSUMED that str wasn't maxed, otherwise it would've been irrelevant, and no tests would've needed to be done, since it would've been much easier to say &quot;Str buffs are worthless because people have max str, and it's capped at 255&quot;.

<br />
No, we're not. The data is out there. Check out a monk's mitigation profile against other mobs. The thing is, you're the one trying to prove that monks already take damage the way they should. We've proved to our own satisfaction that there is a softcap on AC for monks. If you wish to demonstrate otherwise, the burden of proof is on you. <br />

<br />
The test did not assume that strength was or wasn't maxxed. Nor was it a single test. The battery of tests ran the gamut from artificially lowered strength right up to 255. The tests for Dex and Agility were done similarly. The results were quite valid when they were obtained.</div></div><hr />

You're arguing in circles AGAIN....<br />
<br />
The &quot;hard data in my hands&quot; is 3 monks, one of which isn't a reliable datapoint in a single zone against the same mob with 1 atk value.    I asked for proof that it exists globally.   You have given two answers so far... the first is 'Thepp said so', and the second is 'That data is all we need' (note; paraphrased).<br />
<br />
I'm telling you that if you want to make the claim that it's global, then it needs to be proven, that one MUST provide data to base it off of, not hearsay or assumptions based on a very limited dataset.    <br />
<br />
The reason you want to do a gamut from below the point in question beyond the point in question is so that you can discern a value that increases, then show how the rate of increase drops off.   This is why you go from 1k to 2k.    <br />
<br />
Regarding the test, it was interesting at the time, but the conclusions about the str part were pretty much completely wrong.   I didn't find the dex/agi to be interesting so i didn't look into it.</div></div><hr />

Pre-PoP, monks were the shit.  They were a top DPS producer, had utility, and could tank damn near anything that didn't require defensive/evasive.  Another indication of their power is how many people had monk twinks because they were so damn easy to level up due to their soloing abilities, tanking mobs toe-to-toe for exp.<br />
<br />
Then came the mitigation nerf (which I thought was appropriate).  Then came PoP itemization (ever look at the AC on elemental monk armor?  pathetic).  Then came the huge DPS of GoD mobs.  Monk mitigation was taken away rightly so, but then over-done somewhat.  What *should* have happened was monks should have kept a damage-dealing edge, which they really didn't.  They had several slides downward in power, none of which alone is cause for a correction, but combined, they certainly gor the short end of the stick.<br />
<br />
Should monks be rampage/add tanks?  No.  They have (some) utility, damage dealing abilities, and are good at avoiding damage through high mitigation/mend/FD, etc.  Did they need a whack from the nerf bat when it hit them?  Yes.  Did it hit them too hard/did they keep getting hit by it for too long?  Probably.<br />
<br />
Stop trying to argue that priest classes come anywhere near monks when it comes to taking damage.  It's simply not true.  You're average damage taken per second is more than fine, even without a mitigation boost.  Spikey, yes, but you're not supposed to be taking sustained damage and it averages itself out.  When you get unlucky and the shit hits the fan, that's what mend/FD is for.  If anything about monks needs tuning, it's their DPS/utility, although I'd argue their utility was simply stolen when bards became the gods of pulling anything and everything.</div></div><hr />

Honestly Frodlin, you're arguing now just because you don't want to be wrong.. and you're making obvious mistakes by exaggerating what you are interpreting to the point of discrediting yourself.  The monk community did it's best to argue their point to the people that matter, Sony.  If you want to go to their boards, SOE's boards, and now here to refute their claims, the burden of proof has always been on you, which you try to provide with MONK data, then tell them it isn't enough and that they need to gather more.<br />
<br />
The burden is still on you.  You gather the data.  You prove them wrong.  It's a given that warriors will never have to fear monks taking over their roles.  I would bother to try to understand why you have a personal vendetta against one class in a video game, but I decided not to get that psychology degree after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact remains that until velious high end gear started hitting the market, there was no problems with monks tanking ability. Thats because as was readily apparent, monks were meant to have a relatively low ac, especially compared to plate tanks. As has been stated NUMEROUS times, anyone could tank in pre pop days. You could put your chanter as mt on a raid in ssra as long as you had the clerics to back it up. Being able to tank decently in pre pop is no indication of being overpowered. It was the GEAR that was overpowered, not the class. We got access to gear that we never should have and it closed the gap between us and warriors to the point where we could conceivably take their place in exp groups. Again, not through monks being too powerful, but through monk wearable gear being too powerful. The monk nerf never should have happened, its proven by the high end gear for monks in pop and beyond. Compare it to say warrior or knight class armor and tell me the difference in ac and hp. Its significant. If that ratio had been adhered to in velious and that all/all gear was rendered unusable by monks, there would have been 0 problem. We didnt tank too well to be balanced, we were effectively twinked an expansion ahead with that all/all gear. It was the equivalent of comparing a warrior in time gear to one in vex thall. Obviously the warrior in time gear is going to do a much better job at tanking than the vex thall warrior, so does that mean that warrior needs a nerf? No, because its an item imbalance, not a class imbalance.  Someone prove me wrong.<br />

<br />
Very simple.  The taunt button does one thing and one thing only.  When successful it moves you to the top of the hate list.  When you're at the top of the hate list, you get hit.  If you're not intended to get hit, there is little point in giving you a taunt button.  Not having a taunt button implies that your primary function is something other than getting hit.  With Monks in particular they have a button, feign death, specifically designed to help them not get hit.<br />
<br />
Taunt button =  Hey, ugly, come hit me you big guerilla!<br />
<br />
Feign death button = Oh, I'm dead already.  No need to hit me any more.  Just go away.<br />
<br />
See the difference?  So, when a class is given a taunt button it's clearly the case that the class is being designed to get hit, at least some of the time.  Without one, it's clearly the case that the class is being designed with something other than being hit as a primary function.  And if you give a class a feign death button instead of a taunt button, it's clear that rather than being a class with a primary function of getting hit you have a  class with a primary objective of not getting hit.</div></div><hr />

Why do people keep saying this?  Because it doesn't even fit in with the discussion.  Yes, incite is useful.  Yes, Warriors use incite to help hold aggro.  Yes, Warriors needed incite.  Now what the hell does that have to do with Monks being or not being a tank class?</div></div><hr />

There is a big difference between being given the option of deciding to be hit or not be hit depending on which of two choices you take and not being given the choice at all.  Rangers can taunt or they can jolt, they get to decide if they'll get hit or not get hit.  Shadow Knights can taunt or they can feign death, they also get to decide.  Monks however, have feign death with no alternative taunt button choice.  Therefore they're, by the very nature of the game, not designed with that being one of the choices they're given as a class.<br />
<br />
Anyone can get hit in this game if they try hard enough, but some classes are specifically designed as tanks.  Monks ain't one of them.</div></div><hr />

Enchanters get agro cause of tash/slow, so they are given the rune line.<br />
Wizards get agro cause of overnuking, so they get the skin line.<br />
Mages/Necros get agro cause of nukes/dots, so they get pets.<br />
etc etc etc<br />
 <br />
Every class gets some way of getting agro and dealing with it.  If your argument is based on the assumption that you are a tank class because you have the taunt button, I would have to disagree.  Taunt is the pure melee answer to other classes being able to generate agro with spells or raw dps.  Ironically spells are far more effective in getting agro than taunt for hybrids, as any stunning paladin or dotting/snaring sk or ranger can testify to.<br />
 <br />
The reason I am here is simple.  The monk nerf was SOE's lazy reaction to select monks in uber gear being selected as rampage tanks in older end game content.  It was a blanket nerf that hurt the entire population, while the intended targets hardly noticed.  A simple change in their code was a lot easier than taking the mnk flag off the gear that was overpowering.  As it stands now, subsequent expansions have played the itemization game and corrected the issue.  The nerf needs to be reversed, as its effects have a much greater impact in todays content and is too harsh.<br />
 <br />
Monks are the only class to have a built in AC bonus, and a built in AC penalty at the same time.  Ain't that a peach?</div></div><hr />

Oh, really? Allow me to refer you to your request for your incorrect conclusions once again, since you did your usual routine and ignored your blatant inaccuracies. I'll quote the text in full so you won't have to look it up:<br />
<br />
<br />
Originally Posted by Frodlin7th<br />

On the other hand if you avoid 19% more potential hits, which doesn't mean they hit for less, but for ZERO, it's not a lot. And you have the gall to call me a hypocrate?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, technically, I implied that you're a hypocrite, and that stands. You'll notice that when I did my calculations, warriors took 19% more hits relative to monks. In this case, monks take 267% percent more max damage hits compared to warriors. You have to make equivalent comparisons, not simply pull numbers out of your ass to try and refute a point. If you want to derive percentages relative to the total number of hits, that's fine, but you have to do it in both cases. Similarly, it's valid to derive percentages relative to each class' performance, this is also acceptable, but it must also be done in both cases, an excercise which I performed for you.<br />
&quot;Let me explain... no, there is too much. Let me sum up:&quot;<br />
You're still wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, the term &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; was referring to the difference between priests/monks, and 1000% is indeed an &quot;order of magnitude&quot;. You skillavoid indeed roughly 1000% more than a cleric or druid. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's exactly what you wrote: &quot; No, the block skill makes you take FAR FAR FAR less hits than any other class in EQ. This isn't a small number, it's ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.&quot;<br />
You were not talking about priests. You were talking about &quot;any other class in EQ&quot;. Nice attempt at revisionist history, but it just won't fly. If you meant to talk about priests somewhere in there, that's an issue to take up with your education system. As it stands, this is another of the erroneous conclusions you begged me to point out.<br />
<br />
<br />
WAY TO GO MR ACCURACY! You'll note that the quote that you attribute to me talks about priests and not warriors. It'd be much better to &quot;refute&quot; that which I said rather than that which was not said. <br />
<br />
<br />
Allow me to repeat what you wrote:&quot;You have more non-miss zero hits by a factor of TEN over priests who you still bitch about, and double over warriors, SK's and Paladins&quot;<br />
Double. Twice as much. When in fact, it's 1.5 times as much. That's a incorrect conclusion on your part. Which is exactly what you begged me to point out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is something most people will have to judge for themselves upon reading this thread.  Honestly, Frodlin, you do raise some good points.  Thep's data is not conclusive about many things due to the fact that it involves one mob in EQ.  All the same, if that is the case, you shouldn't be arguing your case against monk mitigation using what you consider incomplete data as the basis of blanket assertion that monk defense is all that and a bag of chips as it is.<br />
<br />
You also are making a fairly big assumption that average damage per swing translates into good tanking.  Back in the days of Kunark, where mobs had to hit you 20-30 times to kill you, this was certainly the case.  Now, however, a couple seconds' of blast damage and you're toast.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at Block.  We have two forms of evidence here: data and game logic.  First, data:<br />
<br />
In Thep's entire data set, monk trials with lower AC values against the HoH mob seem fairly consistent at 46-47% hits, better than the 48% in the Warrior parse, but not by much.  Block values bounce around from 10.5-12%.  Since we are only talking about avoidance here, which is unaffected by armor AC values, we can then point to Block as the likeliest explanation for the difference in hit percentages.  If you disagree with this, please state why you believe Block is less effective, or else how avoidance was handicapped to offset this skill.<br />
<br />
Second, game logic.  Anyone with Strikethrough skill and focus effects will tell you that they can still miss on a successful strikethrough.  The underlying game mechanism is therefore very likely one where Block / Dodge / Parry / Riposte is first checked, followed by the actual attempt to hit.<br />
<br />
Both items above are very good indicators of the actual game mechanics as well as the effect of Block.  The conclusions you drew regarding Block's effectiveness also happen to be drawn from data including Avoidance: 60 on armor.  I'd suggest that you attribute a good amount of the fairly substantial avoidance advantage the top end monk showed to this effect and seek out your gear appropriately.<br />
<br />
As far as your statement regarding Taunt skill goes, I'd look at it as follows: EQ was originally designed using The Vision.  The ideas behind this may have been stated at some times here and there, but look at the original class design to determine what the roles were supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Monks had extremely high offensive and defensive melee skills.  Monks could not use a wide array of gear, could not be effectively twinked, and had lousy night vision.  Monks had relatively low HPs and could not interrupt casters.  Monks also had Mend and Feign Death as outstanding class features.  Aside from damage aggro, monks could not stop an angry mob from eating a cleric or wizard.<br />
<br />
Warriors had lower (but still high) skill caps, could be twinked and advanced substantially through gear, had a large array of weapons with various procs, and had more HPs than anyone.  Warriors could also Taunt a mob off group members.<br />
<br />
Warriors were obviously intended as main tanks.  Monks, however, had versatility.  A monk could go toe to toe with a mob while the warrior and the rest of the group dogpiled a separate one.  The warrior had the ability to keep the mob's attention so wizards and so on could burn it down.  The monk meanwhile might be somewhat the worse for wear, but had Mend to ease use of mana, and could FD if absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
The big draw Warriors had in groups was their ability to keep the hate going while soaking up large amounts of damage.  Their flaw was that they needed the gear they got, and money to buy more.   Monks had versatility and good sustained damage, and furthermore often did not want loot since they'd lose the AC bonus.  The flip side for monks was, however, that the innate skills were pretty much all they had, and they had some very humble beginnings.<br />
<br />
In short, lack of Taunt skill didn't mean monks had no role as tanks.  It meant they had no role as main tanks.</div></div><hr />

Which is exactly why you don't have to worry about monks ever being considered to replace a warrior: you have snap aggro, they don't. Thus you don't need to fear a repetition of a scenario that occurred for a brief period of time. In one zone. Because Warriors were broken at the time.<br />

As I write this, I realize that you're simply reacting emotionally, and have become fundamentally incapable of viewing the situationally rationally. You refuse to accept hard numbers if they oppose your viewpoint. I am uncertain if it is simple paranoia or lingering bitterness that motivates you, but the end result is the same: your end of the discussion bears more resemblence to a religious crusade than any form of rational discourse. Until you are capable of actually considering the gaping rents in your argument, you are only going to make yourself looklike an irrational zealot, rather than a man with a reasonable case.</div></div><hr />

Ding ding ding we have a winner.  Warriors complained for months about the exact thing that monks do not have, snap aggro.  That is why, whatever our mitigation, we make poor tanks.</div></div><hr />

One thing I can tell you: monks get hit a lot more than enchanters.  Pulling is supposed to be what we do, and with shitty mitigation, we get owned pure and simple.  How often do your pullers die compared to your enchanters?  Guess what, pulling requires more mitigation than mezzing.  Giving us mitigation helps our pulling in case you could not fathom that.  Oh and we are a melee class, we should be better at mitigating than a silk class, so there goes your idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's one facet.  The biggest facet is that we have an incredibly low AC softcap, which no other melee class is currently handicapped by.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'll say it again.  We should mitigate better because our mitigation sucks, mostly due to our incredibly low AC softcap.  Other melee classes can improve their mitigation through gear upgrades.  Monks cannot.  How is that balanced?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought we weren't using real life rationalizations to justify mitigation?  Okay, I guess we are, so how about these?  A chain class should mitigate better than a leather class, so shaman, rogues, beserkers, and rangers should mitigate better than a monk.  As should plate classes such as clerics, bards, shadow knights and paladins.  Oh, I can hear the bitching now, our magic pajamas are better than onther people's magic pajaamas!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny thing Leewi, is I dont' disagree with you that much.   The thing is you're not rabid either and are willing to acknowledge some realities.<br />
<br />
I would disagree with the initial concern you raise about using a single mob to test relative tankability between classes, that's pretty appropriate, although the data is dated now in a world of GoD anyhow, particularly since last patch where mob atk took a nosedive.   The thing is though that to test differences between classes, using a single mob is a good choice, since the damage the mob does is pretty much constant, and going from one class to another gives good indication into the differences between classes when put in front of the same mob.   It doesn't tell all, although it tells some.    The thing is, using data from a single mob is NOT a good method for determining a global AC softcap.   <br />
<br />
Your second point is a little sketchy since it's taking data from old mobs (low atk hoh mobs) and applying that found there to new mobs where AC has been shown to have a demonstrable effect, and again, particularly when mob atk has been drastically lowered since last patch.    <br />
<br />
The issue with Block being pre-miss/hit raises some interesting questions, but still leaves others when it comes to game logic.  I think you're coming to too fast of a conclusion regarding strikethrough, since you're not excluding other possibilities.   There's nothing that states definitively that strikethrough (and TM) doesnt' just give you another attack roll to replace the defended one.<br />
<br />
You've also gotta deal with the fact that you would expect a high avoidance skill class to be missed less often than a non avoidance class, as the blocks or parries would come in prior to the misses, yet this isn't the case.    Misses seem relatively consistent among all archetypes, which argues strongly against the notion that you're trying to argue. <br />
<br />
Coincide those and we begin to come to an idea of what's happenning.  The fact is there's still a LOT we don't know.    <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the monk with 60 avoidance was compared against a warrior with same tier gear.  There's simply a LOT more avoidance gear for monks than there is for warriors.   It's completely fair to compare two classes from the same tier of gear when the stats that make the gear important to each class begin to depart.   Warriors tend to get high AC, +Shielding, + Combat Effects and a small amount of avoidance.   Monks tend to get lower AC, astronomical avoidance, and a small amount of +shielding.   It seems quite consistent with my point of monks being primarily an avoidance class, and not a mitigation one.<br />
<br />
I think you're confusing the way that players played with what was intended.   It's an interesting circle that has come around.   As you're quite aware, Verant hated the concept of FD pulling, yet it persisted.   Recently FD pulling was &quot;Sanctioned&quot; by giving monks the Phantom line.    This isn't necessarily &quot;evidence&quot; that FD pulling was intended by &quot;the vision&quot;, because based on many public statements, it was NOT intended by the &quot;vision&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Regardless what monks were able to do in early EQ, things have changed, but you were still never given a taunt button.   You were still never given any REAL tanking discs, as a matter of fact even a cursory look at all of your skillset shows that your defensive skills are based around shedding or compensating for small bursts of apparently unwanted aggro, not for tanking over the duration.</div></div><hr />

Sony at the moment has no idea what the &quot;vision&quot; was so at this moment monks are not tanks.  But I think Brads idea was to have monks be close to AD&amp;D monks...thus being able to go head-to-head with anything effectively because of a naturally low AC (D&amp;D terms) but low hps.   Which with the mitigation change would bring monks back to where the &quot;vision&quot; had intended them in the first place.

<br />
Here's the short and skinny IMO:<br />
<br />
Equal values of AC should equate to equal damage mitigation regardless of class.<br />
<br />
In today's EQ, this would balance out the melee classes, because Monks now have pathetic AC compared to the plate classes.  This way, with proper itemization and not the clusterfuck that was Velious/Luclin, Warriors and knights would maintain their tanking advantage over the other melee type classes, yet AC would actually mean something for monks, which it currently does not as far as mitigation goes.<br />
<br />
Look at EQRankings, the top monk compared to the top warriors have about a 600-700 AC difference.  Why is the mitigation nerf still needed, honestly?  It's been fixed through itemization, yet the nerf still remains.  Not only do we have much lower AC than the plate classes, we get less from it.<br />
<br />
This is not about tanking.  It's about AC being a meaningless value for Monks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When are you going to get this through your head.... I'm not concerned that monks are gonna outtank warriors.  Certainly it's in the back of my mind, but I'm FAR more concerned about monks being viable enough to replace Knights in their role of offtanking on raids in a world where knights have lost a HUGE amount in terms of raid roles.   As well, I'm quite concerned about the return of the &quot;super ramp tank&quot;, a role that Warriors and Knights should always have.  Always.   Since ramp tanking has ZIP to do with aggro, you can't with a straight face tell me that it's not a completely valid concern.<br />
<br />
As I write this, I realize that you're simply reacting emotionally, and have become fundamentally incapable of viewing the situationally rationally. You refuse to accept hard numbers if they oppose your viewpoint. <br />
<br />
What numbers?   I'm still waiting for some numbers that actually support your position.   I've asked you at least 4 fucking times for some proof of a global AC softcap and you still give me the same non-answers.   &quot;Thepp said so, and others did too&quot;, and &quot;Look at the HoH numbers&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I want real... REAL proof, not &quot;They said so&quot;.   I want the hard numbers you keep talking about, because as it stands, you've got the following working against you:<br />
<br />
- 2nd lowest damage taken in EQ<br />
<br />
- Avoidance that is at least 50% greater than the 2nd best avoidance class in EQ <br />
<br />
- Furthermore, no one has still answered the famous question satisfactorally &quot;If mitigation is of such major importance and of significantly higher value than avoidance, and avoidance irrelevant, then why do I and many other warriors use evasive vs. almost every god in time, when we could mitigate a TREMENDOUS amount more by using defensive/stonewall?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now Xao, the fact that you ripped that Orders of magnitude quote out of context KNOWINGLY and failed to put the very next sentence in there is pretty telling of your trustworthiness with handling simple &quot;proofs&quot;.    Once you learn to analyze things as simple as a statement in it's context honestly, then I'll be willing to talk to you about numbers.   <br />
<br />
Until then, you're building up a pretty terrible track record.  Let's see if your &quot;standards for proofs&quot; are very high.<br />
<br />
1. You are willing to accept a 2 datapoint set of parses from a single mob in a single zone in an old expansion as &quot;proof&quot; of a global AC softcap.<br />
<br />
2. When questioned, you respond with &quot;They say that it's the same elsewhere&quot;<br />
<br />
3. You yank quotes out of context and pretend that the meaning that's CLEAR in the very next sentence was never intended.<br />
<br />
4. You are willing to begin an &quot;ac softcap proof parse&quot; at where the suspected AC softcap is, which shows nothing, since without a clear delineation of what is being capped, showing a 'cap' is meaningless.   You are willing to call something &quot;diminishing returns&quot; without knowing what the &quot;normal' returns are.<br />
<br />
Then you have the unmitigated gall to say that I'm not willing to look at the numbers that dont' exist?   I will call bullshit on this and say that confidently trusting that numbers exist somewhere without having looked at them is poor debate.   <br />
<br />
Show me the numbers man, I'm waiting.  Give some REAL data, I'm not willing to assume that it exists without seeing it.</div></div><hr />

As should plate classes such as clerics, bards, shadow knights and paladins.  Oh, I can hear the bitching now, our magic pajamas are better than onther people's magic pajaamas!<br />
<br />
Wow, you really missed the point here.  I was not giving a real life rationalization.  I'm giving an in-game rationalization.  Hi, monks are fighters, a melee class.  Enchanters are a caster class, they do not melee stuff.  We should be able to melee for more than enchanters.  Which we do.  We should also be able to take less damage when being attacked by mobs.  Which we do.  Enchanters should be able to cast better than monks.  Which they do.  What exactly was your argument again?  Oh, that's right, it's defunct.<br />
<br />
The only person I have seen using real life rationalizations so far is Foddlin.  I believe he talked about the difference between bracing yourself for a blow and getting hit unexpectedly.  Seriously, I really don't see how anyone is stupid enough to give real life rationalizations to anything that happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadd</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy, this is a really awful thread.<br />
<br />
Here's the short and skinny IMO:<br />
<br />
Equal values of AC should equate to equal damage mitigation regardless of class.<br />
<br />
In today's EQ, this would balance out the melee classes, because Monks now have pathetic AC compared to the plate classes.  This way, with proper itemization and not the clusterfuck that was Velious/Luclin, Warriors and knights would maintain their tanking advantage over the other melee type classes, yet AC would actually mean something for monks, which it currently does not as far as mitigation goes.<br />
<br />
Look at EQRankings, the top monk compared to the top warriors have about a 600-700 AC difference.  Why is the mitigation nerf still needed, honestly?  It's been fixed through itemization, yet the nerf still remains.  Not only do we have much lower AC than the plate classes, we get less from it.<br />
<br />
This is not about tanking.  It's about AC being a meaningless value for Monks.<br />
<br />
Sskai hit the nail on the head.  Monks do not get equal gains, if any gains from AC upgrades after the soft cap.  Other classes do.  This is unbalanced.  Period, end of story.  Monks should gain increased mitigation via AC upgrades after the softcap.  There's absolutely no reason that an NToV/VT monk at the softcap should mitigate similarly to a Time/EP/GoD geared monk, considering that for other classes this is not true.  Zero.  We don't want to be gods in EQ, we want to be competitive with other classes.<br />
<br />
Foddlin attempted to &quot;prove&quot; that monk mitigation is fine and that there is not a softcap.  <br />
<br />
He was not able to prove that monk mitigation is fine, as it obviously is under debate, with 99% of the monk community believing the monk nerf was unneccesary and fixed through itemization and new content.<br />
<br />
He was also not able to disprove the softcap, no matter how much he tried to spin and skew Thepp's data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grau</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta laugh, not one monk has &quot;refuted&quot; a damn thing.... you just like to claim that you do.<br />
<br />
I have to laugh at your double standard then.<br />
<br />
You say based on this data (Thepp's parses) monks are fine and that they don't need any fixes to mitigation.<br />
<br />
And yet at the same time you say that the information is not complete and nothing can be drawn from it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So which is it? You can't have it being both conclusive and inconclusive.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be helpful also, if you actually want to give a slightly less unbiased position, to include all the information to left out of Thepp's data. Instead of picking and choosing the information that helps you to prove your point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did I say i had a personal vendetta against monks? No, i said that I have a big issue with them being able to do what they did in CT... and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
If you don't have a vendetta against monks then you certainly have a funny way of showing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very simple. The taunt button does one thing and one thing only. When successful it moves you to the top of the hate list. When you're at the top of the hate list, you get hit. If you're not intended to get hit, there is little point in giving you a taunt button. Not having a taunt button implies that your primary function is something other than getting hit. With Monks in particular they have a button, feign death, specifically designed to help them not get hit.<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; I have a button that does nothing more than taunt a mob at my level of play. It's not a 'taunt' button, but the -only- effect it has is to taunt mobs. It does not do damage, nor cause a proc. So I guess I do have 'non-proc' ways of gaining aggro if need be.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that somehow supports the conclusion that you should mitigate better, because you can't generate snap aggro? So what? Doesn't mean you should mitigate better at all.<br />
<br />
So... uhh... why exactly did warriors get a mitigation boost recently? Oh yeah... because they didn't have snap aggro like Knights did... silly me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the monk with 60 avoidance was compared against a warrior with same tier gear. There's simply a LOT more avoidance gear for monks than there is for warriors.<br />
<br />
At what level of play? Time+?<br />
<br />
I hate to break it to you but a vast, vast majority of people are not, and may never be, in Time+ content. Balancing across the board for (or because of) the end-game players does not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless what monks were able to do in early EQ, things have changed, but you were still never given a taunt button. You were still never given any REAL tanking discs, as a matter of fact even a cursory look at all of your skillset shows that your defensive skills are based around shedding or compensating for small bursts of apparently unwanted aggro, not for tanking over the duration.<br />
<br />
Then by that logic the ONLY tank in EQ is the Warrior. Neither Paladins, SKs, nor Rangers (if you consider them a tank), have tanking discs. In fact, even counting weaponshield, a Monk has MORE 'tanking discs' than any of those 'tank' classes. However, like WS, they are short duration and do not allow us to actually tank a mob for any sustained period of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I could actually care less about actually 'tanking' mobs. I want my mitigation fixed so I don't get the piss beat out of me pulling in higher end PoP, hard LDoN, and GoD encounters where mobs begin to hit for 1200+ damage.<br />
<br />
You seem to believe our mitigation is ok, but your arguments are based on data that is not presented in full. Nor do you include any of the discussion and comments on the data by Thepp. And, your argument is totally based on this data that you have interpreted, and the past action of monks. <br />
<br />
Being that you play a warrior, I find your actual in-game knowledge and experience as a monk questionable. You yourself have posted that your whole reason for presenting this argument is so you can do everything you can to see that monks are not as 'powerful' as they were in 'CT.' I'm sorry, but that stance does not lend a whole lot of credibility to your argument. Instead it makes you look like a whining warrior who is trying desperately to hold on to his spot as 'top tank' and will whine about whatever is needed in order to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, what I really do find laughable is that you somehow believe that SOE actually cares about what you, me, or anyone else posting on either side of this issue has to say about it.</div></div><hr />

God, I wish I could go back in time to all the warrior bitching, complaining, and whining about knights.  At that time if I would have said, &quot;Hey this is how Sony wants classes to be balanced.  You can take hits better, but your snap aggro sucks.  Live with it.  Just because you want better snap agro, a mitigation boost, and better choice of taunt weapons, doesnt mean you'll get it.&quot;<br />

How would that sound back in the days of warriors' incessant whining?  About the same as you saying &quot;Naa naa naaa Sony wants you to mitigate this way, it doesnt mean you'll get it.  Live with it.&quot;<br />

This is not my definition.  I suggest you oh, I dunno learn about the classes before spouting ignorance which makes you look stupid.  Here, conveniently pulled from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp with my bold added:<br />
<br />
Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else. Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone. The monk is a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat and leading groups in their dungeon adventures.<br />
<br />
See that part about adventuring alone?  Well let's see, how can we adventure alone?  Presumably by tanking mobs.  And up until PoP, we could adventure alone.  Now we cannot.  Which I don't mind so much, but I do mind that our mitigation was nerfed needlessly, when itemization and new content fixed it just fine.<br />
<br />
When are some of you going to understand that we don't want to tank?  We know that's a plate class role.  We want to have meaningful upgrades regarding mitigation like every other melee and hybrid class, and we want our mitigation issues back which were fixed with itemization and new content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually if SoE would write us a letter saying YOU ARE NOT TANKS, and then give us some ability to be something else, we would accept that. <br />
If you go over the posts at Monklybusiness and SOEs monk boards, you will notice that one of the things we ask for are a ROLE. Monk do not have a role currently.<br />
Were DPS, sure. Just too bad that rogue, ranger, wizard, some warriors, some druids (hey, my main is a druid, i can keep up a constant 100+ DPS on dots alone, then nuke on top), beastlords (if you include pet, which should be included for pet classes), and possibly mages (depending on how big a boost the pet changed were, im not really sure about that one)<br />
Were pullers, just too bad that bards, clerics, paladins, rangers, druids, SKs do it better that us. <br />
Were tanks, or rather, time+ monks can tank, a 1 million pp+ bazaar geared monk can tank slowed mobs but not get aggro, so lets just drop that ATM.<br />
Were range attackers, oh wait, my record is 51 dmg on a crit shuriken, which means that on ALL AE raid mobs, monks are useless (along with rogues).<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you tell me what monks are supposed to do?<br />
<br />
Before the nerf, monks were decent offtanks, thougth with no way of holding aggro, could solo blue mobs if we choose the right ones, were good  DPS for grouping, and were the main pullers.<br />
After nerf, upgrades to other classes, and 4 expansions later, we got NO role. Give us a role so we got a purpose again. ATM the only role my monk got is the role of a stubborn fool that wont quit the game, while i sit LFG and have lower level chars get the group spots because noone want monks.</div></div><hr />

Oh no, you don't want to tank.  Just mitigate well enough to solo and to out mitigate Rangers and Rogues, which would put you where?  About Knight level of mitigation?  Naw, you don't want to tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No pure melee will mitigate well enough to effectivly solo. Or at least, solo like those with ranged ability can. So soloing is a moot point in my eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why shouldn't I out-mitigate Rogues and Rangers though?  Rogues are the melee dps class with some limited utility, rangers are a good dps class with good utility, aka spells/buffs.<br />
<br />
Monks are a good dps class with very limited utility (pulling mainly). What do I get to make up for the DPS of the rogue or the DPS + Buffs + atk of a ranger?  I get to pull? Whoop-ti-do, how many other classes has that ability been farmed out to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a whole hell of a lot, but improved mitigation wouldn't change that.  You'd still be exactly where you are in the game now, with a limited role.  Your problem isn't that you don't mitigate well enough, but rather that you don't bring anything overly unique or desired to the party.  Pulling classes are pretty common.  DPS classes are pretty common.  Tank classes are pretty common.  Giving you better tanking won't enhance your position at all.  At least not unless they improved it so dramatically you could in fact tank, anything less would be meaningless.<br />
<br />
Try for something else.  What, I have no idea.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  And by the way, much of your pulling competition don't mitigate any better than you and some even mitigate worse, so being a puller alone isn't justification for improved mitigation unless it holds true for all pullers.  And we know that isn't the Monk arguement at all.</div></div><hr />

Kadd, you used this as a justification for why the mitigation nerf was meaningless and that itemization changes were sufficient.  If you're not claiming you should be able to solo, then why bring this up?  You could, now you can't, and therefore your mitigation should be increased.  If that wasn't what you meant, it sure seemed to be what you said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Content changed so that we could not solo.  I never claimed that I should still be able to solo.  The reason that our mitigation should be given back, NOT INCREASED, given back, is because itemization has fixed the supposed problem.  Monks can have more AC in VT gear than in EP gear.  Therefore right now monks are experiencing a double penalty.  The mitigation nerf and lower AC for monk items.<br />
<br />
Why should we have 2 penalties for being able to tank mobs in Luclin that anyone could tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arlos</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite the discussion here. While I happen to believe that  the itemization and mob DPS changes that have been made post SOL are more than sufficient to prevent monks from tanking anything remotely challenging, and the specific mitigation nerf is unwarranted (beastlords mitigate better? wha?), I also don't think that just getting that back would do much towards fixing monks as a class. Even if we tanked better than we do now, current mob DPS output combined with zero snap aggro means that we really will never be sought out for groups as tanks, period. We weren't even back in our heyday in Luclin, to be honest. One of the biggest reasons monks were used as rampage tanks is because of the broken logic in Rampage. If healing of rampage tank didn't keep up with damage output, we could feign, let heals land, then stand up again and immediately be back taking rampage.  So, it wasn't so much that we were SuperTanks, it was because of the bugginess of rampage, and we gave a better healing margin. (at least that was my experience)<br />
<br />
As others have said, the biggest monk issue right now isn't mitigation, it's the fact that the class has no role whatsoever. As a pure melee, and given our discipline/ability set, we really only have 3 even possible options for roles, due to lack of spells or group-effecting abilities. These 3 potential roles are: Pulling, DPS and Tanking.<br />
<br />
1) Tanking: This has been discussed to death. Given that we have no taunt button, no snap aggro, and ultra-low AC softcaps, we are not tanks, even if our mitigation is returned. Nor is this a role we want, really, other than the capability to possibly tank some mobs for short durations until CC classes deal with them.<br />
<br />
2) DPS: At this point, both at middle and high end, we are nowhere near the top of the DPS curve. As others have pointed out, rogues, wizards, rangers and others all beat our DPS quite handily, whether we're discussing bazaar-level or POTime level. Also, every single other one of those classes that surpasses us in DPS also provides significant utility we do not. (not as much with rogues, but trap disarm  &amp; SOS are quite useful, depending on locale.) <br />
<br />
Where once we held a solid DPS edge over most everyone (save rogues, and wizards in very short durations), that gap is long since gone. Modern levels of FT + very long duration mana regen buffs like KEI mean casters really no longer have to worry about going OOM much, especially if the encounter is outdoors where a horse can be used. Also, look at the evolution of skill/weapon gaps from original EQ to now. Pre-kunark, monks had 14/30s, when most others topped out with 8/24s, plus monks had 20-40+ pt skill gaps for many skills. By velious, we saw warrior weapon top out at 14/19, with monks at 16/19. Now, compare that to the gap between the PoTime warrior weapon and the PoTime monk weapon, and notice how far those skill gaps have closed, on top of the closing of the weapon gap.<br />
<br />
3) Pulling: This used to be solidly our niche, and as long as we had at least this one unique role, other issues in the class could be overlooked, as long as pullnig worked. Now, multiple other classes, especially bards, pull as well or better than monks. Oh, and they ALSO offer much more utility, especially bards, who are utility with feet.<br />
<br />
So,  there's our 3 possible roles. In every single case, we're outclassed by other classes, and those classes bring added capabilities and utility that we do not.  What compelling reason exists, therefore, for ANY group to ever take a monk over some other class? Quite obviously, there isn't any such reason. It is this lack of any sort of obvious definite role that monks need to have fixed, far more vitally than the mitigation nerf.<br />
<br />
Oh, as for the softcap, it's very real. From discussions I had with devs at a FF, back earlier in POP (before people got to PoTime), I got some hard numbers, from someone I trusted and had always found to give valid info.  Monk softcap for AC, pre AA modification is roughly 1150. Maxed out CA/CS/PE/LR/ID (and any others they have now) is what got that number up to the mid-1300 range that Thepp found in his testing data. Warrior softcap was about 1850-1950 or so, again pre AA-modification. (it has been a while, so I can't remember what exactly your guys' was.) Now, not only were the softcap numbers different, the curve post-softcap was significantly different. Warriors get 1 real AC per 4 displayed AC points that exceed the softcap. Monks got 1 real AC per 40 points. When the mitigation nerf was partially repealed, that ratio dropped to (I think, at least) 1 per 30. So, a monk that sees displayed 1800 AC will, due to the softcap, function, roughly, as if his real ac was 1350 + (450/30) = 1365.  So yes, still SOME benefit, but roughly negligbible.<br />
<br />
Now, I realize most here don't know me, and probably take the last paragraph with several large grains of salt. That's perfectly understandable. All I can say is that I AM telling the truth, and hopefully some of the better-known other monkly types can stick up for me. *chuckle* While I never did do significant parsing to confirm what I was told, it certainly fit quite well with observational experience, as well as Brodda's results.<br />

<br />
If the Monk class is functioning fine exactly the way it is, then there is no reason to make a change.  If the Monk class isn't functioning fine exactly the way it is, how will &quot;giving&quot; back their mitigation fix it?  If you don't want to tank and you don't want to solo, then how will &quot;giving&quot; back the Monk mitigation change things for the better for the class?  Either you still won't be able to tank and you still won't be able to solo, and therefore the change is effectively meaningless, or you will and then you'll be considered overpowered.<br />
<br />
What I am really getting from you as an arguement is, &quot;they took it from us.  It was unfair.  Now they should give it back.&quot;  That's not a good arguement for making game changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daishan</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whether Brodda's parses alone are enough to prove the existence of a universal softcap, the fact that the other classes involved continued to see meaningful gains while monks did not certainly is suggestive of one. Personally I'd love to see more data just so we could put an end to that part of the discussion once and for all.<br />
<br />
I also believe that mitigation alone won't fix our problems, but it certainly could be a meaningful part of the package. I (and several other people) have said it before....There are 2 main roles for pure melee--DPS and tanking. We can't be the best at either because that belongs to rogues and warriors. Being better at both to some degree certainly wouldn't hurt, but I don't think that would be enough either. <br />
<br />
We've got one other option currently...pulling. I personally would love to see the bulk of our upgrades be in that department. I'd be overjoyed to have monks get the tools to be hands down the fastest and most efficient pullers. The other classes that are currently competing with us would still have their slot because they'd still pull well and bring the other things they have to the table. It would help our desirability a ton though. Mitigation changes would help in this area, but certainly wouldn't be enough by itself.<br />
<br />
This is all my personal preference though. Some monks want DPS, some want tanking, some want pulling, some want all 3. I can't speak for anyone else but myself. All I know is that back in the day I was one of my guilds main pullers. I'd get harrassed as soon as I logged on to hurry up and get to a raid so they could start moving. I took a nice long break (well...2 breaks really =P). While I was gone the world changed around me. I now get the pleasure of sitting on my ass while bards and SK's do all of the work that I used to do. Top that off with the reports of ele/time guilds that currently have zero active monks and aren't bothering to recruit them....not really a fun situation to be in. Getting my mitigation improved isn't going to fix that problem for me on it's own....it'd help some in easier content so I could play SK light and stand up to whatever I pulled for a bit longer though. <br />
<br />
I don't want to be 'required'....I just want to be....well....'wanted' for something other then rogue-lite duty. If that's all I'm good for at the end of the day then they might as well just get more rogues instead.<br />

I just want to know whats so hard to understand here, the monk nerf was not needed, so it should be reversed. We were unbalanced soley by gear that monks shouldnt have had access to. <br />
<br />
Lets put this in simpler terms. Say warriors suddenly got ahold of 90/10 1hs weapons, and armor that that had 700 ac on each peice plus 500 hp. Suddenly they would be killing everything in the game with ease. Raid content would become trivial. Does that mean the warrior class needs to be nerfed? No, it means the gear is too powerful and needs to be nerfed. Thats an exagerated version of what happened to monks. <br />
<br />
We were doing just fine with our tanking, we could do it if we had to but the plate classes did it better because they always had a higher ac and more hp. Then the high end of velious was discovered to be chock full of the best gear in the game, which every melee class wanted, luckily it was all/all so everyone, including monks, got to wear it. This closed the gap between monks and plate classes a great deal, much farther than it should have and gave monks too much power. The itemization flaw was fixed in pop with monk gear that was significantly lower in ac and hp than plate gear bringing us back in line item wise to where we needed to be. Only problem is we were still nerfed as to our mitigation ability so we got hit twice, which has made us unbalanced in the to low direction. Reversing the nerf now wont return you to a day when people were comparing monk and warrior ac in a group to decide who is gonna tank, but it will make us better able to TAKE hits, not avoid them, than a caster class. Regardless about wether you think we are a tank class or not, we are a melee class and as such we need to mitigate better as well as avoid better than any non melee class. Right now we just avoid better. We get hit like a chanter when we get hit and that is something that shouldnt be happening to a pure melee class.<br />
<br />
Now, can anyone please post anything about my comments they disagree with and why?  Im curious to see what, if any, problems people have with the way I look at things. After all, im under the impression that im making good points here. :p<br />

<br />
Okay, as to the use of these parses to compare defensive values of different classes, I must disagree.  Mobs obviously have varying degrees of ability to overcome avoidance factor, so the parses are non-conclusive about overall class defensive profile.<br />
<br />
So far as the other point you bring up, what we have going on here is subtly different than the point you're arguing.  You say that it's fair to compare equivalently geared characters.  However, my comparison was done not to show the relative defensive abilities of monks vs. warriors, but instead to show what appears to be the relative value of Block skill, which is the underpinning of much of your prior debate.  If you wish, feel free to redirect discussion towards the Avoidance focus effect instead.  If you do this, though, please realize that we're then very rapidly going off into the murky territory of class itemization.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arlakisd</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin, I'm going to ask how you came up with your numbers.<br />
<br />
Reason I'm asking is I don't see certain Raw numbers in the format listed.<br />
<br />
And if you do basic addition. you get Hit% + Miss% + parry % + Block % + Riposte % + Dodge %.<br />
<br />
Now in ALL cases this leads to over 100%. <br />
<br />
So recalling part of why this is Brodda did explain the reason for this but it escapes me. <br />
<br />
So let's put in the only number we can know for sure.<br />
<br />
And assume 1000 Attacks.<br />
<br />
That leaves Monk in time gear 411 hits at 311 Damage<br />
Monk in non time gear 468 hits at 317 Damage<br />
<br />
Warrior (time Gear) 489 Hits at 223 damage<br />
Warrior Non time gear 481 hits At 273 damage<br />
<br />
So Monk A has 589 Misses<br />
Monk B has 532 misses<br />
<br />
War A has 511 misses<br />
War B has 519 misses<br />
<br />
since this is over 1000 hits That meana a monk avoids almost 80 extra times in 1000 Attacks. (Assuming they have time gear. Course a Warrior could choose some avoidance gear at a cost of HP's or shielding or effect. But we can discount that for now.  Total monk Avoidance advantage (With 60 Avoidance) is 8%.<br />
<br />
Does that 8% Seem fair To warriors apparently not. <br />
<br />
Now let's go to DPS figures since those are also shown.  the warrior in this example takes 20 DPS less than he did at 1300 AC.<br />
A monk Manages to drop 20 DPS from 1300 AC (Assuming he has time gear and has all the avoidance he can) <br />
<br />
My point here is the Warrior Still could choose some avoidance gear. Could improve further. the monk has NO further options. <br />
The thing is that monks Straight line then Drop once they hit time. It's not a smooth curve not like the warriors. Now true it does require shielding. to achieve these ends so that's reasonably fair between the monk and warrior. <br />
<br />
Now the sadest part is I'd in a heartbeat trade avoidance for mitigation.<br />
<br />
You see the reason for this is the old addage would you rather be lucky or good. <br />
<br />
If I had to do something once I'll take luck. If I had to do it several times I'll take skill. Why? Skill will give you consistant results. Luck well is fickle. <br />
<br />
Example I was duoing in PoW for my Fragment of water. With a cleric. (No slower.) it took 3 bubbles of mana to keep me alive. (I died once.) Why? I was using SL on my 7k frame. I died when I took over 3.5k in 2 rounds. Only happened once but from then on I started healing at below 60%. Why? Because it could happen again.  It was mana inefficent.  Just because it's doable doesn't mean it's a good idea. <br />
<br />
If I took consistant damage. (Far more warrior like) I might have squeaked in CH. <br />
With a warrior it'd be easier he has 2.5k HP's on a monk Similar gear. <br />

<br />
I don't want to take hits as well as a warrior, or a plate tank for that matter.  If I choose to try and tank a mob, I deal with my lack of snap agro issues.  No monk is asking for means of snap agro.  No monk is asking for a Taunt skill.  We don't want it and we should not get it.  Most of your rants about agro and other such things are smoke and mirrors that distract people from the real argument which is strictly mitigation.  It's up there in the subject of your topic, after all.<br />
<br />
Just to spell it out because people seem to be having trouble with what we are asking for - what we want is the little AC number to actually mean something.  Personally, I don't want to out-mitigate rogues, or knights, or rangers in particular.  I don't want to out-mitigate anyone with a higher AC than me.  That AC figure should MEAN something.<br />
<br />
You bring up % difference in HPs, blithely ignoring the fact that of course the % difference decreases as total HPs increases.  A warrior with appropriate AAs in comparison to a monk with appropriate AAs, at my level of the game, has around a 2500HP differential (and more), and about a 1500HP different over a knight.  This is a significant figure, that affects our ability to take repeated hits in comparison to a plate tank.  I am far from &quot;incredibly wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for the soft AC cap, well you can ignore the evidence, ignore the people who actually play the class and keep calling for extensive global parsing before you are convinced.  Fair enough, that is your right.  The rest of us will accept it as the most likely explanation for what was seen in those parses, and what we see in game.<br />
<br />
Also, it is not just Kyv mobs that have juiced-up accuracy in GoD.  Go have a look at how often a lot of trash in Ikkinz hits, particularly in the raids (the level of content I am concerned about here).  Also, as you no doubt know, a mob with a high enough attack rating will hit more consistently for max on a low AC toon.  Thep's parses don't demonstrate this effect because it's all the one XP, blue-con mob, and testing very hard hitting mobs for long enough to gain valid parse data isn't really feasible.  However, would you say it's a reasonable statement to make if I was to say that an increase of 1000 AC would make a difference in such a situation?  Come on, step out on a limb here.<br />
<br />
Monks are never again going to be an effective tank at current expansion raid level, and at best a mildly effective tank at current expansion group level - and then only because they have a better quality gear than the real tanks who were tanking it fine back at the start of the expansion.  They have no snap agro, they don't have enough HPs to take the heavy hits, and when hit they get hit for maximum more often.  The AC difference at high levels of the game is already appreciable.  Why set an artificial upper limit when most of the actions taken already reinforce the move away from monks tanking effectively?<br />
<br />
Sskai said it best:<br />
<br />
Equal values of AC should equate to equal damage mitigation regardless of class.<br />
<br />
In today's EQ, this would balance out the melee classes, because Monks now have pathetic AC compared to the plate classes. This way, with proper itemization and not the clusterfuck that was Velious/Luclin, Warriors and knights would maintain their tanking advantage over the other melee type classes, yet AC would actually mean something for monks, which it currently does not as far as mitigation goes.<br />
<br />
Look at EQRankings, the top monk compared to the top warriors have about a 600-700 AC difference. Why is the mitigation nerf still needed, honestly? It's been fixed through itemization, yet the nerf still remains. Not only do we have much lower AC than the plate classes, we get less from it.<br />
<br />
This is not about tanking. It's about AC being a meaningless value for Monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(The &quot;you&quot; I'm refering to in this post refers to end game players in general.)<br />
<br />
Does anyone ever think of the other 90+% of the players in the game playing the same class when they ask for these upgrades?  Doesn't anyone at the high end of the game realize that there are FAR MORE people at the lower end of the game?  That you're the minority.  That the uber guilds are WAY outnumbered by medium sized guilds, casual guilds, and casual players?  The 4 or 5 uber guilds on your servers don't make up the total population of your server.  Just because you may not be balanced vs. your current content does not mean that the rest of the server is out of balance in the same way vs. the content they're doing currently.<br />
<br />
Repealing the mitigation nerf won't just effect the highest of the high end monks who think they have a problem.  It's gonna let all those other monks, who far outnumber you at earlier stages of the game, be just as overpowered as you were at that same stage of the game when you went through it (and got nerfed for it).<br />
<br />
Just because your guild is at the top end of the game does not mean that the other 90-99% of the players in this game are at that same stage as you and experience the same balance issues.  You can't put a solution in place that fixes 1-10% of the players in the game if it also overpowers the other 90-99% of the players at the same time.<br />
<br />
Itemization hasn't been &quot;fixed&quot;, it's just &quot;different&quot; at the high end vs. the itemization at the lower ends.  Those all/all items that made the monk overpowered back then still drop.  They will just re-overpower every monk at that stage of the game all over again.  It may not overpower you at the high end cause of your itemization being different, but the lower tier players who are still looting these all/all items will become just as overpowered as they once were all over again, if the mitigation nerf is taken back.<br />
<br />
Contrary to any end game characters beliefs, there actually ARE other players at those other stages of the game where the mitigation nerf was needed.  They all didn't just automatically start hunting in these end game zones just because you happened to make it to them.<br />
<br />
It's the same damned thing as the high end knight GoD issue.  Just cause some high end knights are getting to these end game zones and finding they can't tank in them, doesn't mean the knight class as a whole should get defensive or a mitigation boost.  That ability will make the other 90-99%% of the knights in the game (who didn't previously have any problems and aren't at this stage of the game content-wise) WAY overpowered.  The problem was with GoD, not the knight class.  Likewise, the monk problem comes from the high end content as well, not the monk class itself.  It's the new end game content coming out that needs to be adjusted to fix any issues you have, not adjusting the entire monk population.  The rest of the monks, who were already where SOE wanted them, don't need this upgrade.<br />
<br />
You don't flood an entire city just to put out a fire in one or two buildings.<br />
<br />
A few different ways to upgrade the high end monks without screwing up the balance that was already achieved for the other tiers of play:<br />
<br />
Take back the mitigation nerf, but then a retroactive change needs to be made to all those all/all items that overpowered the monks.  The community will never go along with this, as many monks would instantly become completely naked since they can't wear the items anymore.<br />
<br />
Keep the mitigation nerf in place, but Increase the stats on the high end items in the end game for monks where the problem seems to be.  I'm sure no one would complain about this one.<br />
<br />
But, you can't just take the mitigation nerf away AND keep the overpowered items from previous expansions.  Monks from that era will just be overpowered again as they're still looting these items.<br />
<br />
People aren't complaining that you don't need a boost in your small problemed areas, they're complaining cause you're asking for something that's gonna throw the rest of the game out of balance.  You need to look beyond your own nose and realize what it is you're actually asking for.  It's not rocket science to figure out that changing an entire classes mitigation is going to effect much more than just the small percentage of end game players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arlos got his a long time ago, mentioned it, but since most monks weren't hitting that ac it was taken with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Then Thep shows us his stuff and damned if it doesn't come very close to what Arlos got.<br />
<br />
When you have 2 very highly respected monks coming to us at different times with the same information from different sources it tends to make us believe.<br />
<br />
With all defensive aa's we get about a 1 to 30 return on ac over 1350. So a monk with 2000 ac would have an effective ac of about 1370. <br />
<br />
At this point, to actually get an effective ac of 2000 we would have to have a displayed ac value of 20850ac. 1350 initial ac then then and additional 19500ac/30 to make up for that 'softcap'. <br />
<br />
Removing the original nerf has a lot to do with it simply being a huge mistake. If they just remove that, well, we will still have the softcap. <br />
<br />
If they removed both the nerf and the softcap, or just moved the softcap, we still couldn't get our ac as high because they fixed the itemization from POP onward.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit...and to the poster above. The reason given for the nerf from SOE was that the upper 1% of monks were tanking to good due to itemization. So...they nerfed them all. <br />
<br />
All those casual guild you are talking about and all those monks in there ARE the ones bitching. The upper tiers didn't feel the nerf as much at the time, the rest of us did. Us casuals did. :P<br />
<br />
That is why they initially instituted a 30% nerf to mitigation, then came back, said they screwed up, missed their targets, and reduced it to 15% cause they had screwed the average monk population so badly. <br />
<br />
If you need the references, I am sure Wub can link the patch messages from SOE if you need them to know just how mistaken you are in your reasoning.</div></div><hr />

No, no, no.  This is exactly what caused the nerf in the first place.<br />

Fix the itemization, which is the actual problem.<br />

PoP and beyond, the itemization is fine.  The nerf and the softcap are not needed.<br />
<br />
Velious/Luclin is where there are a few specific items that caused the problems in the first place.<br />

<br />
So it was just Velious/Luclin?  I remember the mitigation nerf, and do remember it &quot;seeming&quot; like it would miss their target audience (since it was the superior avoidance combined with the all/alls that allowed a monk to tank Avatar of War was it?).  But I was under the impression that all those solo monks standing toe to toe with mobs everywhere you went, very successfully without the need for a healer at all, was another reason why the mitigation nerf wasn't that bad of an idea for the lower than Velious/Luclin crowd as well.<br />
<br />
Monks before the nerf seemed to be like the beastlord is today:  Everyone's favorite twink... because of how powerfully they could just solo their way up the levels quickly.  I guess if that's how they were &quot;suppose&quot; to be, then yeah, the mitigation nerf hit the wrong people.</div></div><hr />

So you're saying remove the mitigation nerf, but take all of the all/all Velious/Luclin items away from the monks?  That's the only itemization that needed fixing is it not?<br />
<br />
A retroactive nerf would have a lot of monks screaming bloody murder I'd assume, since they'd pretty much become naked one patch.  Nerfing any new drops would be a happier solution, but then there are some overpowered monks again (at least for the duration of their Velious/Luclin days).</div></div><hr />

Woohoo. One more your talking itemization.  <br />

With a cloak of flames they did 176% of their &quot;Normal&quot; DPS Solo.. <br />
Warriors for the most part were limited to 136% and had inferior weapons. (Until Centi Longswords.)<br />
<br />
Wubao once made the point, and I agree with him, that  the nerf was not due to tanking in VT it was due to, get this, Velk's spiders. Mind you I saw Warriors SK's Paladin's, rogues, Bards and Mages, all solo there.  Amazingly the combination of abilties that a monk has. Self heal for 25%. Ability to get out of jail free. (FD) And low HP's (yes LOW hp's) made soloing reasonable with the extra avoidance. (Reason for low HP's BANDAIDS and net effect of Regen.) Everyone was so jealous of the monk. Because it was (Relatively) easy to get Epic Vs. the Lodi Quest mask. <br />
<br />
Have a warrior at 55 with ornate gloves (They give 30% haste?) They too with a fungi can solo effortlessly in Velk's lab.  I didn't care. In luclin Fungus grove I didn't care. I saw all classes soloing there except Quadders. They tended to do ME.. <br />

Aren't you comparing a PoP+ warrior to a Velious/Luclin monk here though?  I mean, my warrior can effortlessly solo in Velks now too, but when I was level 60 during the Velious/Luclin era, in full Myrmidon (ToV HoT armor), wielding a Wavecrasher and Frostbringer, soloing the &quot;smallest&quot; spider in Velks took almost all of my HPs and left me with a 40 minute sit.  While monks in their mid-50's of that age could solo one mob right after the other there, in comparison, however.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sskai</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're saying remove the mitigation nerf, but take all of the all/all Velious/Luclin items away from the monks? That's the only itemization that needed fixing is it not?<br />
<br />
A retroactive nerf would have a lot of monks screaming bloody murder I'd assume, since they'd pretty much become naked one patch. Nerfing any new drops would be a happier solution, but then there are some overpowered monks again (at least for the duration of their Velious/Luclin days).<br />
<br />
The game has progressed beyond that now.  Even with those items still in the game, a monk will still not be what they were back in those days.<br />
<br />
You won't see monks soloing for XP in PoP if they all have Flayed Barb Skin Leggings and Fungi Tunics and Celestial Fists.<br />
<br />
How many monks do you see who have Luclin level gear who only stay in Luclin?  That's right, you don't.  They fight in PoP and GoD now too, where those items no longer make a difference.   In addition, the warriors and knights of today have much more AC and HP even if the monk is decked out in all the gear that caused the nerf in the first place.<br />
<br />
The game has changed, the nerf is no longer justified.</div></div><hr />

There are just a few that had insanely high stats such as the leggings off the aow for instance that never should have been monk wearable because the ac was just too freaking high. Yeah, saying items like that need to have monks taken off the list of classes that can use them just might get me yelled at on MB but if it gets the pointless nerf removed, I think they would forgive me in the end. And yes, I am saying exactly that, the problem didnt develop till end game Velious/Luclin When mobs like the aow started getting farmed relentlessly and the drops started hitting the open market the problem started getting noticed. <br />
<br />
As for monks being huge twink class, duh, but then, so were rogues, necros, druids, wizards, mages, bards, heck pretty much every class was a major twink class at some point. The reason why monks were so popular was because they were the melee class that was already able to solo semi efficiently, toss on a few hundred kpp in gear and you have a solo melee machine. We had high avoidance, high dps, a self heal, and with enough twinkage, high mitigation as well if you bought enough high end velious crap. We were the class that casters chose as an alt when root rotting a mob got boring and they wanted a break from their druid. (I should know, my first char was a druid :D)<br />

<br />
Monks with fungi's, good weapons, epic, and a decent haste item were beasts.<br />
<br />
Even an FBSS put the solo monk at 62% haste. If they were twinks or lucky then your probably talking more like 75% self haste.<br />
<br />
But...that wasn't everyone. I would say it wasn't even most. Sure, most of the twinks that showed up went right for the Tstaff, fungi, COF route but a lot of us old time monks never got that gear for ourselves let alone a twink. <br />
<br />
Look at the cost of twinking a monk with those items and other good gear. 50k on each item is fair if not a bit low and then probably another 50k in misc stuff. Thats 200k.<br />
<br />
I have never had 200k. Hell, I have never had 20k. Look at pre-pop...what could a warrior do with 200k in gear?? Would he have been a beast up to level 55?? Probably. But you didn't see folks doing that cause monks tended to be more 'fun'.<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; Almost all of the things that made monks beasts were items. All/All itemization and select monk items that did NOT have recomended levels on them were the problem.<br />
<br />
No...those items haven't changed. But you can gear any class in pretty damn uber gear from the bazaar now. Damn near everyone is a twink in some shape or form now so the discrepancies aren't very noticeable anymore.<br />
<br />
A warrior now can get much better gear than they could have then. Monks...ehhh...same stuff pretty much. The gap has closed to never be re-opened again.<br />
<br />
For the sake of arguement, lets say monks used to be 20% stronger than anyone else 55 and under due to some items. Would you say warriors can get gear that is much better that we used to be able to get?? Would you say its 10% better? 20%? 30%?? How much better is an average level 50 equipped now than 2 years ago??<br />
<br />
Now...how much better equipped is the monk?? hmmm...well, if he has fungi and stuff then he is about the same. But suck 15% of his mitigation away. Everyone else can find much better stuff in the bazaar than we used to be able to get while monks are looking for pretty much the same things they did 2 years ago while getting hit with that 15% nerf.<br />
<br />
If you look at it in that context you will see that everyone else has moved forward while the monks have remained in the same spot minus the nerf. We can't match the gear from the bazaar of other classes. We can't match the gear in drops from other classes now.<br />
<br />
Soo....well...here we are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin, I'm going to ask how you came up with your numbers.<br />
<br />
Reason I'm asking is I don't see certain Raw numbers in the format listed.<br />
<br />
And if you do basic addition. you get Hit% + Miss% + parry % + Block % + Riposte % + Dodge %.<br />
<br />
Now in ALL cases this leads to over 100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't use the avoidance skill percentages at all, since this occured.   Instead I used a much more simple calculation:<br />
<br />
Total attacks minues total misses minus total hits equals total non-misses that didn't hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So recalling part of why this is Brodda did explain the reason for this but it escapes me. <br />
<br />
So let's put in the only number we can know for sure.<br />
<br />
And assume 1000 Attacks.<br />
<br />
That leaves Monk in time gear 411 hits at 311 Damage<br />
Monk in non time gear 468 hits at 317 Damage<br />
<br />
Warrior (time Gear) 489 Hits at 223 damage<br />
Warrior Non time gear 481 hits At 273 damage<br />
<br />
So Monk A has 589 Misses<br />
Monk B has 532 misses<br />
<br />
War A has 511 misses<br />
War B has 519 misses<br />
<br />
since this is over 1000 hits That meana a monk avoids almost 80 extra times in 1000 Attacks. (Assuming they have time gear. Course a Warrior could choose some avoidance gear at a cost of HP's or shielding or effect. But we can discount that for now.  Total monk Avoidance advantage (With 60 Avoidance) is 8%.<br />
<br />
It isn't possible for a warrior to get 60 avoidance.   That's an interesting thing to think about since avoidance on time+ gear *seems* to be used to create a different paradigm for tanking than AC/HP/shielding for monks and BL's.   <br />
<br />
Does that 8% Seem fair To warriors apparently not. <br />
<br />
Actually, the difference of 8-10% in misses is completely fair so long as there's a &quot;balancing&quot; offset in mitigation to compensate for it, and there is.   That's my point entirely, that a relatively major avoidance advantage is fine as long as there's a corresponding mitigation disadvantage.     If there is to be a &quot;return of mitigation&quot; then it needs to be met with a coresponding decrease in avoidance.<br />
<br />
In other words, this statement seems 'fair&quot; to me:<br />
<br />
Monks get hit harder less often<br />
Warriors, Paladins and Shadowknights get hit less hard more often.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's go to DPS figures since those are also shown.  the warrior in this example takes 20 DPS less than he did at 1300 AC.<br />
A monk Manages to drop 20 DPS from 1300 AC (Assuming he has time gear and has all the avoidance he can) <br />
<br />
Of course, this is a,lso assuming the warrior has time gear and +15 shielding.   <br />
<br />
My point here is the Warrior Still could choose some avoidance gear. Could improve further. the monk has NO further options. <br />
<br />
Were avoidance gear available to warriors that actually improved their characters, you'd have a good solid argument, but that's not the case.  For warriors, different things matter than for monks.  We cannot hit anywhere near the avoidance numbers that a monk can, which is fine, I dont' have a problem with that, but the point is that there are options available to each class that plays upon that class' strengths.<br />
<br />
The thing is that monks Straight line then Drop once they hit time. It's not a smooth curve not like the warriors. Now true it does require shielding. to achieve these ends so that's reasonably fair between the monk and warrior. <br />
<br />
Actually, they benefit more from time gear than warriors do, with three exceptions.   Raex BP, Darkblade of the Warlord and Symbol of the Planemasters improve a warrior's game immensey.   I dont' know if you know this but almost every piece of visible time armor for a warrior makes them take an AC *decrease* as opposed to elemental gear.   Most pieces of visible time armor for warriors is a wash at best from Elemental.    The exceptions being Cazic Legs, and Quarm bracer.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you what you think about the fact that a time geared warrior with one thousand more AC than a monk gets hit more often than that monk who plays in a completely different game than that warrior.   <br />
<br />
Now the sadest part is I'd in a heartbeat trade avoidance for mitigation.<br />
<br />
You see the reason for this is the old addage would you rather be lucky or good. <br />
<br />
If I had to do something once I'll take luck. If I had to do it several times I'll take skill. Why? Skill will give you consistant results. Luck well is fickle. <br />
<br />
Example I was duoing in PoW for my Fragment of water. With a cleric. (No slower.) it took 3 bubbles of mana to keep me alive. (I died once.) Why? I was using SL on my 7k frame. I died when I took over 3.5k in 2 rounds. Only happened once but from then on I started healing at below 60%. Why? Because it could happen again.  It was mana inefficent.  Just because it's doable doesn't mean it's a good idea. <br />
<br />
If I took consistant damage. (Far more warrior like) I might have squeaked in CH. <br />
With a warrior it'd be easier he has 2.5k HP's on a monk Similar gear. <br />

I've got no problem with you sacrificing avoidance for mitigation, as a matter of fact, that's the whole point of my position.  Having both is too much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks WERE given an avoidance boost, by how much i cant recall, its been awhile since I looked at the numbers. The only problem with that is as someone else said, the question of would you rather be lucky or good. With a higher avoidance but lower mitigation, all it takes is a short unlucky streak to get totally pasted by mobs. The rng is so strange I was seeing stuff like this in pre nerf times. I would go solo a dark blue and literally get hit twice during the entire 40 second fight. I once counted 30 hits of mine to one of the mobs. Then the next mob, same level, I would lose 70% of my life or even have to fd/bandage before I could make him run. <br />
<br />
Now its worse, I can still get those times where I dont get touched, rare as they still are, but those times where I get hit, I tend to fd alot because otherwise I will die. I will die because I am taking max hits or at least high hits constantly and this is at the 50 game so im talking mobs that MIGHT hit me for 110 max, not exactly god raid mobs huh? And yet blue cons, with that for a max hit are beating the ever loving tar out of me due to my crippled mitigation and streaky avoidance. This is fairly non twinked, my only real non level appropriate gear is my schw and even they are nearly one groupable at my level, probably not quite yet but fairly close. I have retired my monk and given all his gear to my beastlord, hopefully some day soe will get around to realizing how stupid it is to double and even triple nerf monks at this point in the way of ac and retract the nerf.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, as to the use of these parses to compare defensive values of different classes, I must disagree. Mobs obviously have varying degrees of ability to overcome avoidance factor, so the parses are non-conclusive about overall class defensive profile.<br />
<br />
While I agree in principle that mobs have varying degrees of ability to overcome missing on the hit/miss ratio, (mob level vs PC level + mob type) I haven't seen the same occur on the avoidance skillset (d/p/r/block).   What's even more interesting is that the mitigation curve is also similar, in that mobs with super high atk will hit for max more often than routine mobs, does this also call into question mitigation differences from a single mob?   Probably, but for the most part mobs don't have skillsets that target a class specific skill or quality, with the exception being some raid level mobs with certain AE's.   Perhaps the Executioner in PoJ trial with his &quot;armor crack&quot; proc, but those circumstances are exceedingly rare.   There isn't a mob I am aware of which negates block for instance, or riposte (obviously excepting Enrage).    What I'm getting at is that avoidance based skills are quite consistent, while mob accuracy does fluctuate (see Kyvs vs Anueks).    The thing to consider is though with a known constant, one can tell pretty fairly how each class reacts against said constant by performing a test of this nature.   <br />
<br />
So far as the other point you bring up, what we have going on here is subtly different than the point you're arguing. You say that it's fair to compare equivalently geared characters. However, my comparison was done not to show the relative defensive abilities of monks vs. warriors, but instead to show what appears to be the relative value of Block skill, which is the underpinning of much of your prior debate. If you wish, feel free to redirect discussion towards the Avoidance focus effect instead. If you do this, though, please realize that we're then very rapidly going off into the murky territory of class itemization.<br />
<br />
Actually, what I wrote was in response to specific objections relating to +avoidance on one toon as opposed to on another.   Furthermore I was specifically looking to see if one could try to discern SoE's overall goal for classes by seeing armor effects and how they transform the game for each different class.     Warriors and Knights are primarily affected for instance by aggro mods, procs, combat effects, strikethrough, and shielding as well as the classic AC/HP.   This gives me insight into how they're viewed by SoE as relating their class functionality with the functionality of their gear.   A warrior tends to take a +atk hit, which is reasonable, and gains tanking advantages, taking hits more consistently for less damage without really affecting how often they do.  A monk on the other hand will gain +atk as well as a LOT more avoidance, indicating to me that they will be taking less hits, yet not really affecting the values of those hits.</div></div><hr />

This is the first thing  they did....<br />

** Defensive Changes **<br />
<br />
- Decreased Monks' ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's Update on www.everquestlive.com for more details)<br />
- Improved the ability of Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors and Bards to mitigate damage in some situations<br />
- Upgraded Warrior dodge cap to 190<br />

- Upgraded Ranger and Beastlord dodge to 170 and defense to 240<br />

With the change to Monks have they achieved the result you wanted?<br />
<br />
At this point we dont think that we have achieved what we wanted with Monks. Right now it seems to be having too much of an impact on Monks who arent the top 5%. Well be going back and looking into it some more. <br />
<br />
We were really happy with the projected results our internal testing had for the changes, but that just didnt pan out when it went onto the live servers. <br />
<br />
Monks wont be going back to the uber-tanks they were, but there will be more changes made to try to more accurately reflect our intent.  <br />

I'd like to see the description that specifically refers to Monks as &quot;light tanks&quot;.  Please attach a link so we can all see it, I'm sure we're all interested.  And there is no Jihad against Monks.  Merely an objection to the Monk crusade to get their mitigation upgraded for no other reason then because it was once higher and now it's not.  I imagine that every class that has ever experienced a nerf of any kind would like to have that nerfed power returned to them.  But that isn't happening.  Monks aren't some kind of exception to that, regardless of how long they whine about it.<br />
<br />
And if you expect to have Warriors on the same side as Monks, then perhaps you should target your requests as a class towards things that actually benefit Monks within the niche that has been made for the class.  Tanking is not the Monk niche.  Shadow Knights, Warriors, and Paladins have that niche, and to a much lesser degree Rangers.  Improving Monk mitigation or returning Monk mitigation, or however you want to put it, won't do anything for the class except potentially give it the chance to move into a niche that SoE has clearly said is not the Monk niche.<br />

<br />
2.  Necros and SK's have FD spells that fail FAR LESS OFTEN than our skill.  Bards have fading memories.  Rogues have escape.  It is not even close to a niche ability anymore.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If your best agrument is that monks shouldn't be able to mitigate because they have FD, then WTF is an SK?  Your argument is just piss-poor.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that monks need the mitgation nerf repealed.  With current itemization, we will NEVER reach the AC needed to vie with kinghts and their ability to mitigate damage, nor will we have the snap aggro, nor we will have as much HP's as knights.   These 3 things make a viable tank and knights outclass us at every one.  Rangers will be close on hps, but will have slighty better AC, and their snap aggro is clearly superior (not to mention their utility also) <br />
<br />
Your arguments that monks will be too powerful if it is repealed is not vaild in light of the way classes are balanced at the present time.</div></div><hr />

Monk FD and SK FD are worlds apart, lack of cast time, Rapid Fiegn, and SS make Monk FD a LOT  better then SK... (not to mention new god AA's) in addition to lulls<br />

Sure SK's can pull, and do use FD, but they dont come CLOSE to what a good monk can do.<br />

I guess I just really like the monk class because I've seen the impact that well played monks can have on a success/smoothness of a raid.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes, the fine upstanding Monks are far above having threads about things like nerfing Bards and such.  What, you don't think I read MB?  Please, you guys would nerf your own mothers if you thought it would get you your mitigation back.  Don't try and play sanctimonious here, we know better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mitigation nerf wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
PoP itemization (and beyond) wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
Farming our pulling abilities out to Bards and improving the pacify/lull line wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
Closing the DPS gap between monks and other classes wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am saddened that he has nothing better to do than to ensure that another class is entirely miserable and feels like they have no role in the game.<br />
<br />
Way to go dude, you're my hero<br />
<br />
What's really sad is that from this response it's quite clear that you make a hole lot of assumptions that are without merit.<br />
<br />
1. I actually strongly support a monk DPS increase<br />
<br />
2. I think your pulling is fine<br />
<br />
3. I think that a different method of enabling you to survive pulls rather than the simplistic and fraught with balancing issues &quot;Give us mitigation back&quot; would be healthier for the monk class as well as the whole of EQ.   Things like as follows:<br />
<br />
A.  Natural Run Speed which is greater than other classes, inherent<br />
<br />
B. Feign Death should interrupt mob casts if you have agro, just like a stun does<br />
<br />
C. Greatly improved rear/side avoidance<br />
<br />
4. Killshots similar to Asassinate/Headshot which are reliable since you ARE a DPS melee class.<br />
<br />
<br />
I simply think that doing something as intellectually lazy as simply &quot;returning mitigation&quot; without reviewing avoidance would solve nothing, and would introduce all sorts of alternative issues.    <br />
<br />
Now, if you think that's &quot;Anti monk&quot; then keep believing your fantasy.<br />
<br />
Also, you must have been MAJOR in the dark about the whole &quot;Giving Pallies/SK's mini defensive&quot; because that's a position I supported VERY strongly and VERY vocally over the last couple of months, to the chagrin of many warriors.</div></div><hr />

You're expressing an opinion as though it is fact.  You believe the mitigation nerf was without merit and totally unnecessary.  This is opinion, not established fact.<br />
<br />
The fact that it wouldnt even come close to returning us to the days when groups could be even semi efficient with a monk tank doesnt matter.<br />
<br />
Again, opinion stated as fact.  You don't believe that groups would be semi efficient with a Monk tank if the mitigation nerf was repealed.  But that hasn't been proven.  It's speculation on your part.<br />
<br />
The fact that removing the nerf still wouldnt allow us to come close to plate tanks in ac or hp doesnt matter. <br />
<br />
It matters a lot if you're getting missed more often than a plate tank and when you do get hit, you mitigate like one.  If damages goes, miss, misss, 700, miss, 600, miss for a Monk and for a plate tank it goes, miss, 500, 700, miss 600, 600, who comes out ahead?  How quickly would those additional HP be eaten away?<br />
<br />
But lets cut to the chase.  No one here is denying you a damn thing Dobbanz.  What we think is mainly irrelevant.  It's not us you have to convince, it's SoE.  Arguing in circles with us about how you absolutely believe the mitigation nerf was unneeded won't do squat for Monks.  We don't agree and we're not going to be brought around to agreeing with you no matter how many times you repeat it.  10 more times, 100 more times, 1000 more times, it won't make any difference because you're not offering proof, you're offering opinion.  And most people aren't going to accept one person's opinion over their own just because the other person want's them to.<br />
<br />
Monks feel they've lost ground in their role in the game?  I agree, I firmly believe they have.  Monks feel that something should be done about it?  I agree, I firmly believe that something should be done about it.  Monks feel the best approach is to repeal the mitigation nerf and return Monks to their former mitigation glory?  I stongly disagree, try a different approach.</div></div><hr />

I thought this wasn't about wanting to take tanking spots in groups.... which is it?  Is it about &quot;Returning to the days when monks were semi efficient exp group tanks&quot; or not?  <br />

<br />
Or you could figure out the relative difference in monk weapons from Kunark and create some monk weapons today that are of a similar ratio when compared to other mele weapons, and wham, DPS issue resolved.   Monk weapon rate of growth quality took a nosedive.   Also giving monks back the original 18/20 fists they were supposed to get in PoP would be a step in the right direction.<br />

The problem at the time has actually filtered down to &quot;the masses&quot;, and is even more pronounced in the middle levels of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read my post again, I said even though reversing the nerf completely WOULDNT let us even come close to returning to the days when we could be semi efficient group tanks. Those days are long gone. They would have ended even without the nerf as soon as pop came out and mobs started doing massive damage a shot. Monks just dont have the hp or even the potential ac if the nerf was removed to be a threat to tank classes, it would just make it a little harder to be turned into paste by anything that would give us exp. Its about returning to the days when a monks ac actually meant something, not just a number that becomes worthless once he breaks 1300 ac. Get this through your addled skull, monks are not, nor ever will be a threat to your precious role in groups or raids again. With or without the nerf. Most of us just want to be able to SURVIVE without having to hit fd the second a mob turns towards us. Why is that too much to ask? Let me repeat, WE ARE NO THREAT TO WARRIORS OR KNIGHTS FOR TANK ROLES. We arent a threat now, we wouldnt be a threat if the nerf was removed. We would still have far too few hp and too few ac to be even considered over a warrior or knight as tank. But at least then we wouldnt die quite so easily to mobs, and maybe at the lower levels people like me could solo a blue con occaisionally again. Im not asking to be able to chain pull solo, im asking to be able to do what I was able to do since I created my monk jan 2001, stand toe to toe and NOT come out second best to most blue cons. <br />
<br />
*EDIT* As for the 18/20 fist thing. yeah that would be a neat toy, let me ask you something though. Would you EVER consider getting rid of your weapons that have who knows how many stats on them to use your bare fists? I know I wouldnt unless they were so superior to my weapons in dps that the loss of a couple hundred hp (at the higher end) and tons of stats wouldnt be too bad.<br />

<br />
Equal values of AC should equate to equal damage mitigation regardless of class.<br />
<br />
In today's EQ, this would balance out the melee classes, because Monks now have pathetic AC compared to the plate classes. This way, with proper itemization and not the clusterfuck that was Velious/Luclin, Warriors and knights would maintain their tanking advantage over the other melee type classes, yet AC would actually mean something for monks, which it currently does not as far as mitigation goes.<br />
<br />
Look at EQRankings, the top monk compared to the top warriors have about a 600-700 AC difference. Why is the mitigation nerf still needed, honestly? It's been fixed through itemization, yet the nerf still remains. Not only do we have much lower AC than the plate classes, we get less from it.<br />
<br />
This is not about tanking. It's about AC being a meaningless value for Monks. <br />
<br />
and this:<br />
<br />
It matters a lot if you're getting missed more often than a plate tank and when you do get hit, you mitigate like one. If damages goes, miss, misss, 700, miss, 600, miss for a Monk and for a plate tank it goes, miss, 500, 700, miss 600, 600, who comes out ahead? How quickly would those additional HP be eaten away?<br />
<br />
is a terrible example, since monk mitigation still wouldn't even be close to warrior mitigation even if the nerf was reversed.  The problem has been fixed through itemization.<br />
<br />
Number of warriors over 2k AC - 740ish<br />
Number of people over 2k AC total - 1225ish<br />
Number of monks over 2k AC - 0<br />
<br />
Top warrior AC on EQrankings = 2600-2700<br />
Top monk AC on EQrankings = 1966<br />
<br />
700 AC is a lot.  This isn't anything like Velious where the top monk and top warrior had 1500 ac, and monks would mitigate the same while having better avoidance.  Plate classes get more shielding from their GoD armor as well.  The mitigation nerf isn't necessary in today's game at all.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't think it is a major balancing issue myself.  Personally I would rather see monks fixed through riposte immunity and increased dps.  But seriously, do you honestly think monks would mitigate anywhere close to plate classes if the mitigation nerf were removed, with a 700 AC DIFFERENCE?</div></div><hr />

I agree, that would be a more reasonable approach imo as well.<br />
<br />
But seriously, do you honestly think monks would mitigate anywhere close to plate classes if the mitigation nerf were removed, with a 700 AC DIFFERENCE?<br />
<br />
Who knows?  Maybe not.  Maybe you're right.  But what is accomplished by repealing it other than giving Monks a woody?  Nothing significant.  That alone wouldn't be enough.  And once you start coupling it with reasonable changes, it could throw a whole hell of a lot of things out of whack.</div></div><hr />

No they shouldn't, as long as there's differen rates of avoidance by class, then different rates of mitigation is completely reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the problems some melee's have is arguing who is/is not a tank.<br />
<br />
SoE does not say who is a tank. I'm somewhat arbitrary and am of the opinion that the Warrior Class description is nearly word for word what players mean when they say tank.<br />
<br />
It makes sense that other classes are tanks too. IMO, those classes that are most Warrior-like and have no other meaningful role are most likely to be legitimately called tanks. Rangers, Paladins, and SK's all have taunt buttons (for keeping aggro off less resisliant members of the party), so I believe they have the best claim to be recognized as Tanks.<br />
<br />
IMO, there is a hierarchy. The more versatility, utility, and caster-like a Tank class is, the less focused on tanking it is as a consequence:<br />
<br />
Warriors - the Primary tank, default raid MT's, and offtanks difficult hardest hitting raid mobs requiring Defensive. Able but not called upon to tank most adds.<br />
<br />
SK - a default add tank/the DPS Knight - MT's raid boss mobs only when Warriors are unable to because of special abilities or such mobs become trivial. May tank difficult hard hitting raid mobs and/or Rampage Tank.<br />
<br />
Paladin - a default add tank/the Priest Knight - same raid duties as SK's plus group spot healer.<br />
<br />
Ranger - an auxilary add tank with damage at a distance as a main focus. Often a back up to Knights in add tanking duties.<br />
<br />
Warriors, SK's and Paladins are the most common group tanks with others getting that opprotunity for less than the most challanging group content.<br />
<br />
That's four classes all jockeying for limited raid tanking opprotunites and wanting to preserve their turf. The role is overrun with Tanks, sometime tanks, and those that enjoy tanking when they get the chance :D.<br />
<br />
Others might ocassionally add tank or be a group MT, but that isn't their primary role. They should not be especially well suilted to perform those roles.<br />
<br />
That, for tanks IMO, is the issue. A Rogue might tank an add, or a Monk or Beastlord - but that is not their role and they should not be very proficient at it unless the content is pretty trivial and a Cleric (for an exagerated example) could handle the mob.<br />
<br />
Monk are actually quite good at tanking for not being Tanks. This is a concern for Knights and to a lesser extent Rangers (they aren't entirely reliant on tanking to have a group or raid role) who ARE Tanks and believe they shouldn't have significant &quot;competition&quot; from classes that aren't.<br />

No one's antagonizing anyone, simply attempting to force a little completion into this &quot;debate&quot;.

Frod...quick question...before the nerf would you consider monks to have had the same mitigation as warriors?? Equal ac and stuff. <br />

There is NO possible substantial pick-me-up for monks that WON'T get other classes getting up in arms because they feel their abilities are being threatened. Greater mitigation? I think we've seen the reaction already. Increased DPS?  CRAP, another rogue on my back! Can't shake this one off.  :(  Oh, and is anyone gonna clean up those burning wizard hats in the street? Pulling/utility? Oh $(@#, it's the bards again!!  HEAD FOR THE HEEEEELS!!!<br />
<br />
Advocate Innate Super Run Speed and Riposte Immunity and such as the ultimate solutions as much as you want. It's either going to make so little difference that the time would've been better used fixing more doors in Freeport, or people are going to see it as too much and scream bloody murder. Chances are the players supporting the idea of Riposte Immunity for monks today be the same people the next day making up bullshit logs about monks taking much less damage than tanking_classX because of them being able to tank without worrying about constant riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Thus, the whole problem. Not a lack of DPS, not a lack of pulling skills, not a lack of tanking ability. A lack of a ROLE in EQ. There is just no possible role left for monks to have that won't infringe on the abilities of other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ie...Before the nerf warriors and monks mitigated exactly the same, the only difference was the avoidance. <br />
<br />
Is that true to you?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not whether it's true to me or not, it was true period.   It was tested in-house by SOE and yes, they found EXACTLY that.   This is why you were nerfed.  You were initially nerfed too hard, then part of that nerf was undone, and now you defend well, yet streaky, which is precisely where you should be.   <br />

Again, I need to repeat that I dont' believe that your class is where it should be, but the answer to your class' woes is NOT found in undoing the mitigation &quot;nerf&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Monks feel their primary roles are gone. Other classess pull better, other classess do more dps, other classess FD faster etc. Which one of these issues does repealing the mitigation nerf fix?  I really am failing to see the logic.  I am also failing to see why you wish to move in on an already hotly contested area of tanking. <br />
<br />
   Maybe I'm just blind but I watch my guild use monks to pull almost everything and sometimes in conjunction with Bards. I do hard ldons and normale ones and never does the sk pull over the monk. Maybe I hallucinated monks getting the lull like ability. Your class is not gimp nor is it ultra mega god mode. That mode is reserved for beastlords and necros only.  Now if you want more dps then I would agree with you and say you need to be fixed. If you were asking for a no fail FD I would agree with you.  If you asked for a rogue like sneak ability I would agree with you. But not on the tanking issue. So perhaps figure out your classess roles and then find results that will restore that role. Package them up intelligently and present yer case. Maybe you'll get somewhere kid.<br />

Yes, when we had equal ac to warriors, we were superior to them in all ways but snap agro. The problem is, we were never supposed to equal warrior ac, itemization flaws allowed us to do it. Now, even without the nerf, we will still average several hundred ac, and many hundreds of hp less than a plate tank, so what does it matter if our ac number means the same as yours? In other words, why shouldnt we have the same mitigation at 1500 ac as you would have? After all, by the time we reach 1500 warriors and other plate classes will be at 1800+, maintaining superior mitigation to us whenever we are in equal level gear to you. What is so hard to understand here? When in equal level gear, monks have far less hp and ac than the plate classes, THATS the gap that keeps us from being tanks now. Repealing the nerf will just allow us to get a real benifit from increasing our ac to its top level, as it stands right now, we might as well stop bothering looking for upgrades once we hit 1350 because after that, we will only see improvements through stat increases on upgrades, the higher ac is meaningless to us.<br />

<br />
<br />
hmmm...see thats where I have a problem. They did not find that we mitigated the same as warriors. <br />
<br />
They found that a very small percentage of the high end monks were able to attain the same ac values that some warriors had and due to a combination of avoidance and mitigation were 'to close' to warrior incoming dps.<br />
<br />
Soo...they applied some fixes to the existing game before POP came out.<br />
<br />
They increased warrior mitigation and avoidance.<br />
The decreased monk mitigation.<br />
<br />
If the game had never changed from that point...I think most of us would have agreed it was a good fix after they fixed the fix.<br />
<br />
But POP came out and more fixes came to light.<br />
<br />
Itemization was the problem in the old game...so they fixed it in POP. Monks could no longer attain the same ac values. Fix.<br />
<br />
They added a touch more mitigation to warriors after what....6 months or so? Fix.<br />
<br />
The initial nerf as stated was because monks could attain the same ac values as warriors and due to a combination of avoidance and mitigation they could take the same damage over time in the long run.<br />
<br />
Well....if that was the problem...then that was fixed with POP alone wasn't it??<br />
Heck...just the values that mobs were hitting for fixed a lot of that too.<br />
<br />
Even if our original mitigation was returned, warriors have moved ahead in not only their personal avoidance and mitigation but also in ac values. The nerf went into effect to fix a problem that didn't exist in POP.<br />
<br />
Like I said...if POP had never come out, the vast majority of us would have been fine with it.<br />
<br />
They math modeled it in the office. They didn't go from parses...they didn't test it in game. They ran a math model and said DAMN...lets fix it. <br />
<br />
They fixed it to the tune of 50% to much and MISSED who they were aiming at. So they came back and reduced it and added some funky stuff behind the scenes, probably the softcap, to take care of that 1% they were aiming for.<br />
<br />
If they came to us now and said that after extensive testing the monk nerf is good and here are the reasons why, most of us would go ok.<br />
<br />
But they have repeatedly said they screwed up, monks need some loving, monks aren't where we want them. Soooo...if we aren't where you want us please tell us where that is. Talk to us. Explain whats wrong and whats right and where you would like to see us.<br />
<br />
They don't do that. So we attempt to get them to do it. We haven't had any discourse at all really. Most of us don't think they have any idea what to do with us or how we work. So yes...:) we fixate on the nerf because they have said it didn't work right. Well...talk to us. If its right or wrong...talk to us. If you need help figuring it out...talk to us.<br />
<br />
When the pally slay undead was gonna get nerfed they talked to them and it didn't.<br />
<br />
When knights couldn't tank in some of god they talked to them and things got changed.<br />
<br />
When there was a problem with monks....ummm....model it and nerf em. Hell...all of us agree that itemization was the problem, why not fix that??<br />
<br />
This is why we are still on it Frod. Not because its the fix to end all fixes, but because its where they started to go wrong. Lets start with a clean slate, a statement on the nerf and its right and wrong and why....then move on to fixing the other stuff.<br />
<br />
Something needs to get fixed even if its only the discourse between monks and Sony. We have offered other solutions and other fixes, but as you can see from the very response you are getting here, the mitigation thing is a problem even if its not. Even if its exactly what they want, its a huge problem to their player base because of how they handled it. Its been bungled and screwed and they have admitted monks need love. <br />
<br />
Well...ok. Lets talk guys. If we want love....and you say we need love...umm..why don't we get together and fix it??? Up until this point they haven't done that at all. Soo...yeah...we are a bit pissed.<br />
<br />
Lets say that  tomorrow they came out and said they were increasing knight mitigation because they are to far away from a warrior.<br />
<br />
Then....in OOW they include a mini defensive for knights.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you think that would be a double fix???<br />

Monk have SIGNIFICANTLY fewer hps than a warrior.  Heck my 52 Warrior has 150 hps MORE THAN my 64 monk does.  My druid bot healer has a much easier time healing my 52 warrior than my 64 monk.<br />
<br />
You want to know what would be the result of adding mitigation to monks without affecting their HUGE block advantage.  Well that is simple.  You would have warriors with  significantly more AC than monks, with significantly more hps than monks, that would allow monks to take less damage over time than a warrior if they matched their AC.  Just because they (monk with equivalent AC) took less damage over time, does NOT mean they would be more mana efficient to heal except in the case where both warrior and monk both had over the 7500 hp CH limit.<br />

<br />
<br />
Big HUGE difference in a guild that is clearing Time or even the elementals and the vast majority of folks.<br />

The average monk is running 3k-4k unbuffed. Average meaning casual guild, non elemental, non time, non twinked. Thats the vast majority of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is completely 100% incorrect.   They had known that AC values would be attainable.  There was no great discovery.  According to Moorgard, they spent hours and hours and hours testing mitigation differences between warrior and monk against theoretical mobs, and found that they mitigated identically, yet the monk took significantly less damage since he avoided significantly better.   This wasn't about &quot;finding out they were able to atain high AC&quot;, it was &quot;Monks took less damage than warriors when in gear from the same neighborhoods&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Itemization was part of the problem in the pre-PoP game.   The other part of the problem was the relative mitigation of monks (the ability to gain itemization to such a degree that it allowed this to happen in the first place) to other classes in relation to the relative avoidance of monks to &quot;tank classes&quot;.    <br />
<br />
<br />
The initial nerf as stated was because monks could attain the same ac values as warriors and due to a combination of avoidance and mitigation they could take the same damage over time in the long run.<br />
<br />
It was less damage, and it wasn't because of the ability to attain gear, it was because monks mitigated too well.<br />
<br />
Well....if that was the problem...then that was fixed with POP alone wasn't it??<br />
Heck...just the values that mobs were hitting for fixed a lot of that too.<br />

Like I said...if POP had never come out, the vast majority of us would have been fine with it.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Our personal avoidance was raised a whole 10 dodge points.    That equals... are you sitting down?   5 additional dodges out of 1000 swings.<br />
<br />
They math modeled it in the office. They didn't go from parses...they didn't test it in game. They ran a math model and said DAMN...lets fix it. <br />
<br />
The only difference between a math model in their office and &quot;in game&quot; is the existence of graphics.   This game is one of math models, it's all a big behind the scene math equation with pretty graphics.     There's nothing &quot;improper&quot; about removing the graphics when running a test.<br />
<br />
They fixed it to the tune of 50% to much and MISSED who they were aiming at. So they came back and reduced it and added some funky stuff behind the scenes, probably the softcap, to take care of that 1% they were aiming for.<br />

<br />
I've already said where I think you should be headed, and it has nothing to do with tanking.  The Phantom line has finally given credibility to your roles as pullers, and has given the official &quot;stamp of approval&quot; on FD pulling.    You are pullers.  You are also melee DPS, and weapons/skills should be given that codify those roles.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They don't do that. So we attempt to get them to do it. We haven't had any discourse at all really. Most of us don't think they have any idea what to do with us or how we work.

<br />
<br />
So get pissed, but getting your old mitigation back isn't going to help the game as a whole.   What monks REALLY have been clamoring for is a role, but they continue to seek a role which is already taken by three different classes... not a role which stacks, but one which only ONE person can fill at a time.    <br />
<br />
Even if they claim to not want to tank, which is asinine, since every time something alternative is offerred which doesnt' have anything to do with mitigation which would solve many issues, it's shot down because it's not mitigation.     <br />
<br />
I repeat, as long as monks have a huge avoidance advantage, then a mitigation return isnt' justified.</div></div><hr />

That case no longer exists. The best gear that warriors can wear, and the best gear that monks can wear is leagues apart in terms of ac. Even if our ac number meant exactly the same as yours, it wouldnt make a difference because our ac is now, and hopefully forever, several hundred points LOWER than yours. We wont be tanks if the mitigation nerf and the softcap is removed, we will just be able to survive a bit better than we can now. <br />
<br />
Have you left velious yet? Are you aware that there is better gear out there now for your warrior? From the way you are surgically grafted to this idea that somehow monks will be the supreme tank if the nerf is reversed and all warriors will be obsolete, im thinking you are stuck 3-4 expansions in the past. It is simply not possible for monks to ever be better at tanking than a plate class, nerf or not. You seem to think that monks want the mitigation nerf removed, 500 bonus ac added onto every monk, and an extra 3k hp for good measure at 65. Thats what it would take for us to be an actual threat to your precious role.  <br />

Glad you noticed.  However when most of our Warriors have hp from 10-11k Knights have 9-9.8k and Monks are around 9k thats not a HUGE difference.  Now if your 53 Warrior has compareable HP to a 64 Monk your Monk is a PoS Monk.<br />

And removing the mitigation nerf wont change that. Removing that and the ridiculously low softcap will just let us return to a point where we arent garenteed to die almost instantly if a high level mob looks at us. Yeah yeah yeah, if we are lucky and the rng loves us, we can avoid getting hit, but when it isnt loving us, we get turned into a quivering pile of goo in short order. MAX HIT MAX HIT NEAR MAX MAX HIT! (end of round 1) NEAR MAX MAX HIT NEAR MAX MAX HIT (dead by the first shot of the second round) We are melee classes, we are supposed to be able to take hits because we have to be in melee range to do damage. As it stands we CANT take hits. Yes we can fd, so can an sk, does that mean HE isnt a tank? Noone wants to take hits like a warrior and avoid them like a monk.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* I just looked at fro's parse setup a little closer. Am I the only one who saw that the monks mitigation % is LOWER than the druids who has 300 ac LESS than the monk? Even being in the window of error that cant seem right that we mitigate the same as a caster class with 300 less ac than us. Also, our superior avoidance works out to 5% more misses than a warrior, with all that avoidance gear added on. Go uber monks, we mitgate equally to a druid with 300 less ac than use but HEY! We also get missed 5% more often than a warrior does so its all good!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arlakisd</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main issue I see is that Monk AC Doesn't do anything basically post 1330 (Or so.<br />
<br />
Example using given parse.<br />
<br />
Monk 1854 has 2% Shielding that decreases damage by 2 per hit. <br />
<br />
So The real gain from 1330 to 1800 AC is About 4 damage per hit<br />
<br />
Ok Warrior at 2271 has 15% shielding decreases damage per hit by 15.<br />
<br />
So the real gain from 1380 to 2271 is 7 DPS.. Amazingly considering they had twice the gain in AC that makes sense. <br />
Let's see how rangers did.<br />
Ranger 1728 has 2% shielding lost 2 from from every hit.<br />
So the real gain from 1308 to 1728 is 18 DPS.. Well now this violates the previously expected pattern. <br />
<br />
Now for Battleblade LEt's just asssume your right and PoT Everyone is where they are supposed to be. Rangers vs monks for instance. The problem is going down 1 level to Elemental it breaks. Go down another level to Sol ro max And it's Horribly broken. Why? Rangers get Better tanking Better aggro, Better DPS,(Thanks to buyable items) and Better hit points. For this level outside of Crypt of decay (and LDoN) a ranger is a better puller. In addition they have their &quot;Useless&quot; buffs. This is where the majority of these monks are coming from.. <br />
<br />
At this level Monks are hideously broken.  Woot eventually maybe I can get fixed, But I can't get to that spot. But why should they have to wait? See this is why there's is so much animosity to this idea. <br />
<br />
See I realize that adding 2k HP's to my character will be a huge power gain. And I can actually likely realize that. However, Warriors championed to get fixed from this EXACT same problem. They got help. They aren't as good at aggro (to begin with) as knights, but they are reasonably effective. Maybe monks are barking up the wrong tree. (I'm not claiming that they might not be.) The top end monks are fine the TOP end warriors were fine. <br />

 Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br />
<br />
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br />
<br />
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  <br />
<br />
Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br />
<br />
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br />
<br />
We still took more damage, just not appreciably more due to the equipment and our avoidance.  But from Sony's own mouth the equipment was the main problem. <br />
<br />
We did not mitigate identically, the combination of avoidance and gear made us to damn close to warriors. <br />
<br />
Lets put it this way...if they did hours and hours and hours of testing...and they perfected it on their math models...why didn't it work in game??? From your point of view it should have....but it didn't did it.<br />
<br />
You do have valid points Frod...but you couch them in base assumptions that do you no credit at all.<br />
<br />
If you notice, they even said they wouldn't be increasing the plate classes defense....but damned if they didn't do that too. :)<br />
<br />
Thats why we are frustrated, because they say one thing and do another way to often.</div></div><hr />

That case no longer exists. The best gear that warriors can wear, and the best gear that monks can wear is leagues apart in terms of ac.<br />
<br />
This is what irritates me about this discussion, all the jumping back and forth to portray your position in the most sympathetic light.<br />
<br />
The best that I can wear vs. the best that you can wear isn't the &quot;hotbutton&quot; among most monks.   The continual mantra I see is that &quot;The nerf hit non high end monks the hardest&quot;.   That has actually changed a bit.   You see, all that crazy gear is still around, yet it's no longer &quot;high end&quot;, most of it is acquirable with 3 people or so, and the famous &quot;Magic Pajamas&quot; are droppable and have plummetted in value as AoW continues to be an easy ass target for a group or two.   What this means is that the &quot;High End Monk Gear&quot; is now really &quot;mid range monk gear&quot;.   That which caused monks to take a hit now exists EXACTLY where the non high end monks are playing.   Ancient Wyvern Hide still exists, and still drops and still takes a whopping 3 people to get.   <br />
<br />
In other words, all that crap that was imbalanced is still out there and not only that, it's not &quot;high end&quot; any more, and it's all plenty augable.   The thing is, monks at the mid levels of the game are (or can be with a MINISCULE effort) FAR closer to their warrior counterparts than high end monks are.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Even if our ac number meant exactly the same as yours, it wouldnt make a difference because our ac is now, and hopefully forever, several hundred points LOWER than yours. We wont be tanks if the mitigation nerf and the softcap is removed, we will just be able to survive a bit better than we can now. <br />
<br />
What you are saying can only really be applied at the high end.   It's funny, I *finally*, almost four fucking years after Velious got pants better than AoW pants, that can be bought in the bazaar for the same price as a god damned horse, and I'm in a Time+ guild.  <br />
<br />
Have you left velious yet? Are you aware that there is better gear out there now for your warrior? From the way you are surgically grafted to this idea that somehow monks will be the supreme tank if the nerf is reversed and all warriors will be obsolete, im thinking you are stuck 3-4 expansions in the past. It is simply not possible for monks to ever be better at tanking than a plate class, nerf or not. You seem to think that monks want the mitigation nerf removed, 500 bonus ac added onto every monk, and an extra 3k hp for good measure at 65. Thats what it would take for us to be an actual threat to your precious role. <br />
<br />
You act as though those &quot;imbalanced items&quot; no longer exist or are dropped or sold.   That's such a load of horsecrap it's not even funny.   <br />
<br />
Let's say for one god damned minute that all of a sudden mitigation were reversed, and AC became a big stat for you once again.   Do you think for one second that high AC gear wouldn't be used because some pile of shit Ornate crap has a little vengeance effect on it or regen?    Hell fucking no, every non-raiding monk level 46 or higher would be 3 boxing in NToV and piling on the AC.    Would it affect me in GoD?  Not a bit, but would it affect my warrior and knight bretheren who are still at 1300ish AC trying to get pickup groups in PoValor?  You bet your ass it would, they don't have my 2300AC, they get hosed on a regular basis, and the last thing they need is some Velious geared monk to be tanking like them, and yes you're god damned right they'd be tanking like them.    As I've said at least on 4 different occasions, Knights would be hurt even moreso than warriors and this is complete bullshit.   <br />
<br />
In a world of continuous mana thanks to VoQ/KEI and CH, along with slow, total hitpoint pool doesn't mean a fucking thing as long as the 'tank&quot; can survive for a CH.</div></div><hr />

Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness. This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game. Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.</div></div><hr />

And removing the mitigation nerf wont change that. Removing that and the ridiculously low softcap will just let us return to a point where we arent garenteed to die almost instantly if a high level mob looks at us. Yeah yeah yeah, if we are lucky and the rng loves us, we can avoid getting hit, but when it isnt loving us, we get turned into a quivering pile of goo in short order. MAX HIT MAX HIT NEAR MAX MAX HIT! (end of round 1) NEAR MAX MAX HIT NEAR MAX MAX HIT (dead by the first shot of the second round) We are melee classes, we are supposed to be able to take hits because we have to be in melee range to do damage. As it stands we CANT take hits. Yes we can fd, so can an sk, does that mean HE isnt a tank? Noone wants to take hits like a warrior and avoid them like a monk.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* I just looked at fro's parse setup a little closer. Am I the only one who saw that the monks mitigation % is LOWER than the druids who has 300 ac LESS than the monk? Even being in the window of error that cant seem right that we mitigate the same as a caster class with 300 less ac than us.<br />

Have to say I get a chuckle out of a lvl 52 Monk talking how he knows all the answers.  If you die that fast you have to be the worst monk around.   At 52 nobody dies that fast unless its vs a raid lvl mob then any class is in trouble if they don't have a dedicated healer watching them.  Heck I can't take the 3k hits TZ (Time) hit me with last night nor could the Warrior that didn't get heals fast enough.  Heck we have used a Monk to OT some stuff whene we were short on Knights.  So basicly if supported properly a Monk can do jsut fine and if any class is unsupported they die like a bitch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who cares if the Druid Mitigates more than you do.  You should have more HP and you avoid FAR better.</div></div><hr />

Thats ok though, feel free to ignore that part. As for ornate versus high end velious gear, I dont know, ive never worn ornate gear so I am unaware of the stats but id assume it has better hp, resists, and other stats on it than items like the aow pants and other similar gear. Ac isnt everything to us, hp, and getting our stats maxxed out is pretty nice to have as well, not too mention the effects, once again, i dont know what effects ornate monk gear has, im only 52 so I doubt id be able to use it even if I could afford the several hundred kpp it would take to buy it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sile</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already said where I think you should be headed, and it has nothing to do with tanking. The Phantom line has finally given credibility to your roles as pullers, and has given the official &quot;stamp of approval&quot; on FD pulling. You are pullers. You are also melee DPS, and weapons/skills should be given that codify those roles. <br />
<br />
Lovely. Too bad no role is listed there that another class couldn't easily take on at a pre-Time level, sometimes at even greater efficiency.<br />
<br />
The only settings in which monks have a substantial  advantage in pulling over bards and pet pulling necros is LDoN hard and LDoN raids. When dealing with unlullable mobs on raids, Highsun + FM makes FD splitting a joke. And FD splitting can just as easily be done by pet pulling necros.<br />
<br />
I agree that pre-Time monks should have greater DPS, whether it be through more skills, reitemization, or just a standard innate DPS bonus, but let's face it - there aint a snowball's chance in hell for that. If a DPS upgrade for monks ONLY even TOUCHES Time monks, people will start getting the torches and pitchforks out again. And as SoE has proven countless times, they CAN'T itemize properly, let alone use itemization as a decent form of class balance.<br />
<br />
Still, what I find most ironic in this thread is that most of the people screaming &quot;MASSACRE! MASSACRE!!!&quot; at the idea of monks having their mitigation nerf repealed are the same ones who have eventually turned around and said &quot;even if you got your mitigation back, it wouldn't help you&quot;.</div></div><hr />

hmmm...see thats where I have a problem. They did not find that we mitigated the same as warriors. <br />
<br />
They found that a very small percentage of the high end monks were able to attain the same ac values that some warriors had and due to a combination of avoidance and mitigation were 'to close' to warrior incoming dps.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That is completely 100% incorrect. They had known that AC values would be attainable. There was no great discovery. According to Moorgard, they spent hours and hours and hours testing mitigation differences between warrior and monk against theoretical mobs, and found that they mitigated identically, yet the monk took significantly less damage since he avoided significantly better. This wasn't about &quot;finding out they were able to atain high AC&quot;, it was &quot;Monks took less damage than warriors when in gear from the same neighborhoods&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Frod...like I said...you do make good points....but you said I was 100% wrong and gave the above reasons why I was wrong. I came back with the official post where they said it was both gear and defense and that we didn't take apprecialbly more damage. Thats more damage, just not where they wanted it to be. <br />
<br />
They never ever said a monk took LESS damage than a warrior, thats your own creation. They said we never took appreciably more....look up appreciably if ya need to, it might help ya.<br />
<br />
You also said they did hours and hours of work in the office on models that are exactly the same as the game but without the graphics. If they did all this work on those models...why were they so horribly wrong that they had to reduce their initial fix by 50%?? Frankly...Moorgard may be a nice guy, but he was a mouthpiece looking for a job, which he got. It doesn't actually mean he knows what he is talking about.<br />
<br />
Yes...we all agree monks shouldn't take hits like a plate class. But, the game world isn't the same place it was 2 years ago. Your reacting like many of the warriors did at the time of the nerf itself. Warriors are much, much better off than they were before not only in gear, but also in innate defensive skills. <br />
<br />
Monks aren't. Our innate skills are down and our gear is down as well. <br />
<br />
If monks and warriors were equal before....well...they aren't now. They won't ever be again because of multiple fixes from everything to innate defensive skills to gear.<br />
<br />
If the mitigation was returned we would still be behind warriors.<br />
<br />
Here...lets use your logic- <br />
<br />
MONKS WERE THE SAME AS WARRIORS!!! LOOLLLALOOLLALOOO<br />
<br />
Now...are warriors now the same or better than they were when the monk nerf happened??? You should be able to answer this one...but just in case your conflicted....BETTER. Much better.<br />
<br />
Better gear, better innate defensive skills.<br />
<br />
Monks, if they had their mitigation returned would be equal to the old warriors...BUT...here it is for the fans out there....they would be LESS than the warriors.<br />
<br />
hmmm...lets use math. Maybe you can add. You premise was that monks and warriors were the same. Lets just work with innate defense for a moment, maybe narrowing it down piece by piece will help ya out.<br />
<br />
Monk=2<br />
Warrior=2<br />
<br />
Now...Monk=Warrior ...2=2....ummm...you got that??<br />
<br />
Now....here comes the nerf... Monk=(Previous monk) - .3<br />
<br />
Or Monk=1.7<br />
<br />
Lets add a bit to warriors...you know..their new skill caps and mitigation.<br />
Warrior=(previous warrior) + .3 <br />
or<br />
Warrior=2.3<br />
<br />
Wait...lets add a bit more. Warriors aren't quite where we want them...lets tack another 5% on...So..<br />
Warrior=(very recently changed warrior) + .5<br />
or<br />
warrior=2.8<br />
<br />
We good on the math so far??? Monk=1.7  and Warrior=2.8<br />
<br />
Lets now, for the sake of fun only, give the monks BACK their mitigation.<br />
Soo...Monk=2<br />
<br />
Lets review.<br />
<br />
Monk=2<br />
Warrior=2.8<br />
<br />
Wow...your right!!!! They are the same, how could I have missed that....we have proved a new mathematic constant.<br />
<br />
2=2.8 <br />
<br />
&lt;golf clap&gt; Damn...submit this theorum someplace man. You are awesome.<br />
<br />
Lets see...lets try gear. Is the warrior bazaarable gear better than it was before??? HELL YEAH!!!<br />
<br />
Is monk bazaarable gear better than it was before??? Ummm...well..monks still wear the same uber stuff your complaining about or they can get better stats but less ac from the newest stuff. Ummm....I guess we would have to so not really.<br />
<br />
Soo....our gear at best has remained mostly the same or it has gotten worse in the ac department. This is bazaar stuff mind you...things any asshat with a credit card and the mysupersales link can get in a day.<br />
<br />
hmmm...your right. We would be uber gods just like we were in CT when that monk stole your camp, or your lunch, or whatever. :) Right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give monks immunity to riposte/dodge/parry when not tanking, and beable to block/dodge/riposte from behind + DPS boost and then I think they'd be pretty balanced.</div></div><hr />

Even with it back, we won't change our utility position.<br />
<br />
I think many of us look at it like alchemy is working as intended. No really, its working just fine. Umm...maybe its broke. Damn...you guys are right...its broke.<br />
<br />
If mitigation is fine, and they truly believe and want it like that, then why don't they come out and say that?? Bad news is better than no news at all.<br />
<br />
What many of us wonder about is that they screwed it up the first time, they have never EVER talked to us about it, and they haven't made a pro or con statement about it ever since.<br />
<br />
We need some clarification, finalization, comments, thoughts whatever on the issue as a whole. From SOE. Once that is done then we can move towards other things. They can't keep saying we need love, then not talking to us about it, that makes it seem like they don't have a clue about what they are doing. &lt;shrug&gt; who knows, maybe they don't, but at this point anything would be better than nothing.<br />
<br />
If the return of the mitigation wouldn't change anything...well...then its kinda clear the nerf wasn't needed in the first place isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Oh god never  start anything with 'according to Moorgard' anything that FOOL says is either incorrect or blatent propaganda.<br />

It was getting a little silly for a while there with him, then he got  the job with SoE and it ALL  suddenly became very, very CLEAR.  :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The alledged  reason (one of SEVERAL  they trotted out and tried for 'traction' over the past 18 months) was that given pre-PoP mob mitigation AC soft caps a monk with enough  AC could mitigate the same as a warrior, but have superior avoidance (but of course with sub par hit points and agro control etc.).<br />
<br />
This was only really an issue at the very, VERY top end of monk gear and only to those with more AC than they knew what to do with and was mostly due to bad itemisation (barb legs and all/all gear).<br />
<br />
PoP mobs, the increase in soft caps and the re-itemisation of monk items in PoP and beyond solved   this.<br />
<br />
However it was ALSO  solved by the mitigation nerf AND it seems by class based soft caps and new mitigation types.<br />
<br />
Unfortuantely all of the 'fixes' hit the same place (effectively the monk mitigation nerf probably hit monk soloing harder than it hit anything else - it perhaps should have been called the monk soloing nerf).</div></div><hr />
