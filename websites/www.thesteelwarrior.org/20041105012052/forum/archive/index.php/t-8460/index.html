<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, I've finally achieved enough points to earn my first piece of royal attendant armor, and i cant decide what i need more, I'm wearing for<br />
Wrists - Kizrak's Bracer of Battle - 45hp<br />
Feet - Kingly boots of Splendor - 65hp<br />
Now at first i was definately going for boots but now i think about it the bracers would give me a better hp boost, but different bracers are much easier to come by such as, Crystallized Acid Bracer/Bracer of the Heartstriker/Raex Bracer etc whereas boots the only other decent ones i can think of are Boots of the Storm (which are pricely) Bloodied Boots of Dark rites, or Raex which i think is rarer than bracer molds.. I really appreciate if you can help me with this as i want to get either on asap :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found the ldon boots very lacking.  Cultural armor is not that far behind and the Boots of the Storm are imo superior minus the augs.  For that many pts, I would definately go the tak bracer.  I dont know your play schedule or how many ldon pts you rack up in a short time but the EF armor was a better deal for me.  Not far behind the Tak armor, I could get a 2:1 ratio with the points.  I cant play 40 hrs a week on EQ so I have to use my pts when I can...so I did.<br />

Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">had to make a similar choice myself not long ago. i decided teh boots were the bigger upgrade due to teh large ac increase over the kingly boots and their potential once augd. remember all we read is that in the high end game ac &gt; hp<br />
<br />
i cant see getting the EF stuff, you really end up with stuff thats not that much better than ornate or cultural when you could have had stuff a good bit better. its like deciding to get anger2 or anger3, in the end it is better to suck it up and wait for anger3<br />
<br />
if a crystalized acid bracer is easy to get on your servfer then /rude :P<br />
<br />
elemental molds will depend on your guild but for the most part yes the bracers are much much more common than boots (in my guild plate molds still command premium dkp prices tho, whereas the leather and chain are going for minimum bids at times sigh)<br />
<br />
in the end, once augd, the boots or the bracer will serve til you get the EP molds or something equally nice(41 haste bracer from POE for example)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The LDoN bracers with 40 hp augs are a very big upgrade to the Kizrak bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bloody boots of dark rites ... buy them in baz or win in ldon<br />
<br />
Royal Attendant bracers ... but them in ldon<br />
<br />
Bracers are the bane of my existance ... i've found it is much easier to upgrade pretty much all other slots.  If i were you i'd buy 2 RA bracers and 2 40hp augs to go on them.  110hp bracers will last you practically forever.  There are other viable options for feet ... and imo BBoDR are much nicer than RA boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id go bracer just because you have 2 bracer slots. So it would take 2 bracer upgrades before you would have to sell your RA bracer back, but it would only take one boot upgrade before you would have to sell the RA boots back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're in elementals i wouldn't buy ANY LDON armour simply because there is soo much good stuff that will rot in elementals very soon for you. For example if you can't be bothered waiting for raex bracers I'm sure Band of Fortitude from mini named in air is close to rotting for yours guild? Has an added bonus that i can do on your waists as well.<br />
<br />
If you absolutely possitively have to spend the points now I would get boots.<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness i would spend the majority of my point on 10AC augs and 40HP augs once you have A3'd your agro weapons. This makes the most sense specially with reusable augs these days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're in an elemental raiding guild, then get the boots and augments first.  Bracers are stupidly common.  FurryCrew is right on.  What we see because we do earth rings A LOT is veggie:  ele bracer molds all the time.  And the Rock Ring drops the haste bracer (I think...)  Haste bracer is like 38AC and 135hp + 41% haste, lets you free up another slot.  Both are VERY common for us.  3-4 haste bracers and ass loads of elemental bracers.  Boots are much harder to come by if you have a lot of competition in elementals (as we do).<br />
<br />
If you're not raiding elementals, then get the RA bracers and aug them.  I bought an EF bracer just to get rid of my BoB!!  Good bracers are really hard to come by, so get them while you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hey thanks for the replies, anyone else have any opinions? Im somehow still wanting to buy the boots, but if i got bracer what would i replace the kingly boots with? cos they really suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">go for the boots id say....14 ac is way too low =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">raex bracer , crystallized acid bracer, haste bracer from earth<br />
<br />
tormax boots are also still nice. may sound sad but they were an upgrade for me when we killed KT last night, and i'm our guild's MT :P<br />
