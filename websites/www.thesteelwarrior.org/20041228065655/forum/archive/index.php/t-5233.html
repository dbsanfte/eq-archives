Got rampage the other day and wanted to test this somewhere.  Also is it possible to do this to get xp on my clr(57) and enc(57)? Mobs can be green to me as long as they give xp to the two lvl 57s.  Tried to pull a train in PoD but got snared and HTed down and havent had time to try again.<br />

If you do want to try rampage then you could try it in Seb, pull everything you can with your warrior and then hide just around a conner and have ytour chanter casting chain stuns while faceing the conner it will bunch all the mobs up in the direction he is faceing. after they are step in and ramp, of course your cleric can do just as good a job if not better.<br />
<br />
I was ramping trains in guk for faction once when a chanter (65)mage (38) and wizzy (37) came along and decided to AoE some. I pulled all the dead frogs for them (way too many for me) and the wizzy / mage easily AoEed em all down easily your cleric has a similarly usefull AoE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Closest thing I've come to PL'ing characters close to 60 is the mauvin hall in PoJ. Had to use furious on all the mobs then rampage which took em all down to 65-69%, then the cleric/wiz finished em off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda a bummer, since Kunark has some great outdoor zones this would work well in =)<br />

<br />
That was sweet xp for the lowbies.</div></div><hr />
