<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've heard a couple of mentions so far today about Chardok B, one of the new areas with the patch.  Curious if anyone could give me some more info on this, such as how do i get there? what lvls should hunt there?  any good loot?  Thanks a bunch<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went there last night.  It is Chardok part 2.  Mobs seemed same as mobs near herb hut/dog pound.  Lvls around 55-58 max hit I got all night was 170.   Loot seemed geared to 52-60 folks.  Some focus 3 items.   Now Krokust is a different story and I believe the zone centers around him and everythign else is fluff.   Theres also a quest skeleton and a room that talks about four sarnaks who &quot;chant&quot; something... /shrug<br />
<br />
Krokust has some nice loot and is supposedly do able with 8-12 folks 61+<br />
<br />
The zone in to Chardok B is located near herb hub to the far side of the back enterance to the dog pound.  Little lever on the wall.  If you've never been to Chardok well now is a good time to go.  Chardok is and has been one of my fav dungeons and ChardokB is a nice compliment.   You can get to herb hut by leving up to the &quot;cave&quot; to the right of the front fort down from zone out.  Go all the way down the 'cave&quot; past the bridge keeper, at the T left is bank, right then left is herb hut.<br />
<br />
Lotta no drop quest stuff.  Only 12 people were in the zone the whole 4 hrs I was there last night with a group.<br />
<br />
Again, don;t think its an &quot;exp&quot; zone, re pops were 18-20 minutes.  I think its centered around two &quot;rings&quot; and Krokust battle being the highlight.</div></div><hr />

Did you take neg upper chardok faction hits in chardok B?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You gain +Brood of DiZok in ChardokB</div></div><hr />

Not doable with 2 groups anymore ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">+Brood of Dizok from undead stuff, -Brood of Dizok from live stuff, huge +Brood of Dizok from Koro, who was a gimp till upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The faction messages on those live mobs are just bugged. They say they give +Betrayers of Di`zok, -Betrayers of Di`zok, -Brood of Di`zok, and -Followers of Korocust (Not posative on last hit.) I am certain the -Brood is actually just a text error and should be +Brood, since I have spent 15hours in the zone clearing it from end to end and still max ally to Brood.</div></div><hr />
