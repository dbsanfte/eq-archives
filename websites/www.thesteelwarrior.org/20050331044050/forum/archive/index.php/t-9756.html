You can stay in the instance with just 2. Make sure the third is about your level though because the level of the mobs are set from the lowest members level. <br />
    The Dranik's hollow instance giver is in front of the 3 caves, static spawn dragorn with a noc static spawn beside him. Ask him about the caves to start an instance. The sewers and catacombs instance giver is in Ruined city he is to the left by a tree once you leave the zoneline tunnel. He  is also a dragorn. you can invis to him. I have never had a wanderer aggro me while talking to him but I cannot say for sure if it is safe to stand by him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeb answered some of your questions; I'd use the search function to find discussions on other questions. <br />
<br />
Safehouse used to be a good place for information, but it's fallen behind in recent months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I'd at least like some website that would have a summation of the lore in OoW so far.   I used to actually like the lore in EQ (right up till Velious, quit with the coming of Luclin so fell behind on lore there)  When I came back, the lore in PoP was pretty neat.  Lost sight of all lore in GoD and now OoW :(<br />
<br />
GoD doesn't seem to have much of a solid foundation in storyline (from what I've gathered so far) so it doesn't interest me near as much, but I would love to know more of the story of the Dragorns, the loyalists, and how it all relates to the Riftseekers (Not to mention how they got there and what their seperation is about) and Mata Muram himself.</div></div><hr />

From the lowest level? That's odd... when I was 65 a 68 requested the instance and we fought mobs that were ALL above my level. Now I'm 68 and when I request (all 68+) the mobs are blue, etc., etc. I believe that only the requesting member's level is counted unless this has been changed.</div></div><hr />

A site I  use often for OoW info, although it is not the information you were specifically looking for and was answered already, is<br />
<br />
http://www.misgnomer.org/omens/oowquests.html<br />
<br />
links to all the epic 1.5 quests along with most of the armor and other quests that have been found to date in OoW. Hope this provides you with any other info you may be searching for on OoW stuff.</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly partial to this one myself, but they all have lots of useful information in between all the whining.</div></div><hr />
