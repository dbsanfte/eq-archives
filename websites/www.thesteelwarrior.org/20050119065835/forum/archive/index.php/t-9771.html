<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marckus</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up a Longblade of Khetus (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70103) last night. I have a Greatstaff of Thunder I've been hanging on to for an aggro 2hander once I hit 55, but I got a good price on the Longblade and bought it. Before I ditch the GSoT, I had a couple of questions about the relative procs on the two weapons.<br />
<br />
First; the Ykesha proc's stun works on mobs up to 55, correct? And the Planar Stun works on mobs up to what, 65? If anyone can point out to me how to find this in Lucy or Allakhazam spell data I'd appreciate that.<br />
<br />
Second; a stun still generates the same aggro on a mob that is too high level for the stun to land, am I understanding that right? I'm not talking about resisted, I'm talking about flat out too high level to be affected.<br />
<br />
As long as the Ykesha proc will generate the same aggro as the GSoT whether the stun lands or not, I'm going to keep using the Longblade. The ratio isn't quite as good, but the 75dd helps make up a little, and the extra stats (str/dex/sta/agi on the blade, only dex/agi on the staff) are great as well. However, if the Ykesha proc will only stun up to level 55, and the GSoT will stun up to 65, I may keep the staff in my bag for higher level caster mobs.<br />
<br />
For now the Longblade is great, held aggro like a doll in PoI with a 56 rogue, 56 ranger, and 56 berserker; the ranger was using Wind-Worn Handblade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22995) and Mace of Focused Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=54065) and the berserker has Edge of Envelopment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70228). I'm just wondering if that's going to change as I move on to Tier 2 and mobs are immune to the stun portion of the proc.<br />
<br />
I do wish the sword was something like 32/30 instead of 30/32 though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sell the sword when you hit 55 and stick with the GSoT.  The 75dd portion of the yak proc won't make up for the +1 damage and -2 delay on the staff.  Stats are roughly equal.<br />
<br />
Aggro and dps will be stronger on the GSoT.   You're effectively trading off dps and aggro for more stats ... bad idea imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally i would have used the gsot cos of better ratio, dps and proc. stats are fairly marginal between the two.  but your right that resisted proc generates the same amount of hate.<br />
<br />
Edit- heh apo u posted same time as me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did we already have this conversation a while back /ponders=). The longblade is nice if you have it but for 100pp I can grab a GSoT how much this guy sell for like 5k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, GSoT is a better weapon.  Better ratio and better proc.  As you get up in levels the proc on GSoT will actually stun mobs, which is useful when fighting casters, and I think is just as important as the 75dd.  I would take a planar stun proc over an ykesha proc with 75dd anyday.  The better ratio will more than make up for the dps from the 75dd proc, and you'll get better dps output from the GSoT.  I understand about wanting the extra stats that the Longblade gives you, but sell the Longblade and use that plat towards another gear upgrade which will give you stats.  If you just hate the look of the GSoT, and just prefer using the sword, well they are close enough that I think you'd be justified in doing so.  There is not much of a difference between the two weapons...  but you could use the money from the sword towards other upgrades.  You're better off using the SoTB and CHoS anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got it cheap enough reselling it for a profit won't be a problem. I've seen it sell for 4x what I paid.<br />
<br />
Aesthetically I like the Longblade better, and 2hs over 2hb in general. The main reason I bought the blade even though I had the GSoT was because I don't really like 2hb. I knew before buying it that I was trading off a small bit of raw dps due to the ratio for a middling improvement to a couple of stats and for looks. What I wanted to be absolutely sure of was that I wouldn't be gimping myself and consequently the friends that I group with regularly of the main thing I'm there for, aggro. <br />

SoTB and CHoS are still my main setup. I used the Longblade last night in PoI to test it out firsthand. The group I play with likes to tread on the edge of our capabilities, so sometimes using 2h instead of dw does make a difference for our cleric, esp on GoD/OoW mobs with the Chaos Claws proc, where I can't afford to dip into the 15-20% range before a heal lands due to the potential spike damage of the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Makes sense.  There should be no aggro difference between the GSoT vs the Longblade, so if you prefer the Longblade then go for it.  I understand about using dual-wield primarily but then switching to two handers when fighting mobs on the edge of your ability.  I used to do that on occasion, and honestly had kind of forgotten about that as an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to some degree this is always the test: if the weapon holds aggro in your regular group, it's usable. So, test it and see. When it stops holding aggro you'll know it, your group will know it, and few things will convince a tank that his formerly okay weapon is no longer cutting the mustard than looking at grey-out incite buttons, greyed-out taunt buttons, the back of a mob and the plunging hitpoints of other members of your group.<br />
But, until that happens, weapon X will work.<br />
When I'm trying out some weapon I do try to check with groupmates I know well. I want to make sure that I'm not standing there tanking, thinking, &quot;heh, this weapon holds aggro okay&quot; while what's really going on is that my groupmates are having to throttle back what they do *because* I'm using some new weapon.<br />
You can also sort of ninja test a weapon if you notice that you're in a pick-up group with folks who are better geared/more advanced than you are. If you hold aggro okay with your &quot;regular&quot; set up, you can switch in your test weapon; if they gank your aggro when you're using weapon X, it's a good bet your regular group is going to be giving you the same problems once they get to that gear/power level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marckus</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, had already spent a couple of hours in PoI using the blade before original post. Everyone in the group had capped melee stats from shaman buffs, between me the berserker and the ranger we were proccing on mobs constantly (I put my 75dd aug from EF on the Longblade temporarily as well).<br />
<br />
So I know that it works fine for now, I was concerned about the level difference on the stuns (Ykesha - 55/Planar Stun - 65) and whether or not that would make a big difference down the road. I should have guessed it wouldn't, the level on the Guk Ykesha augs is 55 also and they still work well for aggro on higher level mobs.<br />

Haven't had to worry about that yet, it's generally the other way around so far. Most likely that's going to start changing though, figuring people in ornate+ gear will be pretty common past level 55.</div></div><hr />

This creature is Immune to stun still generates all the hate you would get in either case. So basicaly if you have no need for the pp then might as well keep it if you just like look. But the GSoT will do pretty much the same job and I always liked the horn look=).</div></div><hr />
