<br />
anyone else know if this kind of this is common, to have the SA drop so fast with no heals.  a druid in guild said that they recovered rahter quickly to the MA dying.  but i dont think waiting till the 3rd tank stepps in to get healed is quick.  am i wrong on this?<br />

[edit, added the blurb below] <br />
oh, and what is a good tactic for the dragon.  he ended up taking the pillar ride before the raid wiped.</div></div><hr />

R'D is a Sontalak type fight: Get max MR on your tanks, clerics/druids going full out spam heal, and generally be a bigger badass than him - Rangers and mana DPS are a godsend here, since they don't have to turn around and run back after getting feared. <br />
<br />
If the MT goes down, it's gonna be 2-4 seconds before the first Supernal Remedies start coming in: clerics have to interrupt the old cast, acquire target, and cast fresh. Against an opponent who can and will produce a large number of 5k+ melee rounds, changing tanks is as much a matter of your avoidance luck(or furious) as it is a reflection of the clerics.</div></div><hr />

I might have the pause wrong.  Try it on some exp mobs to get the timing right on your PC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I explained it to them after the raid how it should work.  If you have any questions let me know bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mithlani</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">furious is great when going against a mob like RD.  Firstly once you hit furious you are building steady aggro while riposting everything.  When you fight RD in the corner your back is not to him so you are able to use furious as opposed to fortitude.  <br />
<br />
Either will really work in this situation but I use furious.  Now if the fight was in the middle of the room I would go with fortitude instead.  Just depends on the situation.</div></div><hr />

I have a question for those who have downed him: do you bother trying to slow him? He ate all our shamans and they never got him slowed anyway :(. Wouldn't it be better to have them nuking/DoTing from the get go?</div></div><hr />

We just have a Warrior tank the White Armor guy when RD pops uses AE Taunt and Furious while Warrior riposting have everyone debuff/slow during that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, MB did that to me last time...I had furious up and I backed up to reposition him (he had the silence AE and was in range of the clerics) and he summoned me and killed me from behind.  :mad:   <br />
<br />
As to the original post...I usually SA and 90% of the time we don't have a problem with tank switches (MB being the only recent exception I can think of.)  If the MA goes down I immediately hit furious, then AE taunt.  At the same time the RL yells the MA is down and everyone stops attacking for a few seconds.  When furious runs out I go defensive and call for assists.  <br />
<br />
Of course, after the MB experience I'll make sure to use fortitude if I need to reposition the mob when I take over. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a hard time beleiving that riposte will build you up much aggro at all, lots of times when you riposte you just basically parry it and dont counter attack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you use Furious you riposte (counter-attack) every swing sent at you (minus Flurries and Rampages); you don't just parry it.  Every swing you take adds more aggro, whether you hit the mob or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding your original questions about the healers switching to the SA, as a 65 cleric main I'll give you my take on this. The biggest problem I've found as a healer is switching targets from the MA to the SA, etc...we all know how to make /target MA and /target SA keys, but the stinkin &quot;/target&quot; command has a range about as long as a gnome's pecker. End result is, MA dies, hit your /target SA key, and you get this lovely message that you cannot see the player. So some will try to /assist the mob to get the SA, but typically the SA doesn't have the aggro right away so you get a wizzie or ranger instead. Others will try to mouse target the SA, through the video lag and giant tigers...too late...SA dead!<br />
<br />
The best tank-switch advice I can give is for the dedicated tank healers to pre-target the MA an SA  in succession before the fight, and then use the &quot;toggle two targets&quot; hotkeyed to a key. Thus, they can have the MA targeted...if he goes down, immediately hit your toggle key to target the SA. The range on the toggle is the same as the range of mouse targeting someone in your group window.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, healers can use the raid window to target the next tank, as this range is also the same as the group window. Takes up some screen real estate however, but better than a wipe.<br />
<br />
Just my take on this...good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is to have a dedicated &quot;tank selector&quot;, such as a bard next to the clerics.  The bard will have the next tank in line on target, and when the main tank dies, all the healers assist the bard who is in range for /assist to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bargran</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">do you bother trying to slow him? <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
Slow disease (magic will not work), and it is mitigated, but it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another easy way to get a target for the SA is to make sure he is grouped with a cleric on the rotation. When MA goes down that cleric simply targets him using Fkey and all other clerics have a hotkey set /assist  that cleric. Usually works well as long as the cleric hasn't died or wondered off from the other clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shaiel i know what furious is supposed to do, but lots of times whenever i do it sometimes it will say i riposted but doesnt report a swing against the mob<br />
<br />
and why would a bard be the assist selector? paladin makes infinately more sense as they can fire off a LH if the cheals dont land fast enough,</div></div><hr />

You're looking at it wrong.  When you riposte, it goes in the order of:<br />
You attack!<br />
Mob attacks, but you riposte!<br />
<br />
not:<br />
Mob attacks, but you riposte!<br />
You attack!<br />
<br />
Bards are used because they often times are singing AE resists next to the healers and the paladins should be in the fray attacking stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Debbin</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we ended up dropping the dragon tonight, thank god.  i think the clerics had 2 on the SA, 1 on rampage and the rest on MA.  it worked pretty good i guess, as we killed it.  but the dragon still ate through the whole tank rotation before getting dropped.  he dropped the ranger only bow, it rotted :o , and he dropped the grandmasters cudgel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the easiest way to do him is to pull some mobs from outside the room and charm them for added DPS, since the ones in the room despawn when he is spawned. This is basically a zerg encounter kinda like Trakanon, if you dont kill him fast, you wont kill him.<br />
<br />
As for tank switching for healers, we just have the healers /assist RD, you can go through tanks pretty quick so the easiest way is to have a key set to assist the dragon and get his target, if your tanks are doing their job, they should pull the agro pretty quick with AE Taunt, Taunt and Incite.</div></div><hr />
