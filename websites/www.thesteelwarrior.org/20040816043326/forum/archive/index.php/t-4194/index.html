<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When PoP released, bards were given an odd little AA that was mostly used for pulling.<br />
<br />
I'd like to suggest Boastful Bellow (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3282&amp;source=Live) as a model for a potential range aggro fix; albeit its current range is too high. Bards receive it for 2aa, requiring Level 61 and Combat Fury. I know that Furor et al have previously stated that any fix that costs time is unacceptable, but an extra skill should come with an associated extra cost. It's by no means a complete fix to the imbalance warriors face, but it is a dependable form of range/snap aggro. Its 18-second recast allows it to be used on inc as well as during the fight if a bit of sudden aggro is needed.<br />
<br />
The only change required as it is, would be Bellow's range: 250. Such a range-aggro skill should have a decent range, yes, but it should not entirely replace the bow for pulling. 100 would be appropriate; anything over 150 would be unbalanced.<br />
<br />
The other change that might be required would be its stun component. If the change to stun that's been proposed here were to actually happen, that is stuns generate no aggro on mobs immune (by ability, or by level) to stun, then a new Warrior_Bellow's stun component should be replaced with 100-200 straight hate.<br />
<br />
Now I don't play a warrior, but as a full-time cleric I've seen the imbalances between warriors and knights. I feel this ability would be a simplistic way to help an area where warriors severely lack; this would not be the complete fix to the warrior class. Its concept, a loud shout, seems to fit well with what a warrior should be. Its resistability means that it would be less useful on raids, and more useful for groups, where such help is most needed.</div></div><hr />

Hail, A_Warrior_guildmaster_07.<br />
<br />
You say, gimme range agro stuff.<br />
<br />
--You recieve shimmering stone of blowing stuff--<br />
<br />
<br />
MAGIC ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: ANY<br />
Charges: Unlimited<br />
Required level of 35.<br />
Effect: Small Stun DD / Pure Hate (Casting Time: 1.5/1.0/2.0)<br />
WT: 0.0 Size: TINY<br />
Class: WAR<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
<br />
Make different versions for different lvls or so. Make it a 300 / 700 / 1500 adv point item from ldon. Put 10 / 30 / whatever charges on it if needed. Casttime would make it virtually impossible to cast it while tanking. I don't think that would be too powerfull but it would prevent expmobs from jumping can't-afford-8k-horse-and-sitting-dr00d or allow the debuffer to cast slow / tash / stuff some secs earlier. That would be soooooo easy to implent.... or just give us a quest like staff of temperate flux for the wizards... ;p</div></div><hr />
