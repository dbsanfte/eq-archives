<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy all.  Sorry, I've looked for the old sticky on warrior aggro weps, and I can't seem to find it, and it probably answered my question :/.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, my question is this.  I have a BoC in main hand, and currently use red epic off-hand.  I have a chance to obtain a SoD, which along with the BoC were always my dream weapons.  However, a fairly experienced warrior advised me against it, saying that the SoD isn't as good as I seem to think it is.  Apparently, in the higher tier planes *tier 3 and up*, it's not as effective ??<br />
<br />
 For what I would have to pay for the SoD, I could easily buy an ornate BP mold, and have a good chunk of change left over .  Should I splurge for the SoD ??  Or, should I camp a CHoS/Sword of the Bloodsworn from droga, and use 1 of those offhand ?  Or, as the other warrior told me, and which I think was a good idea... Wait to see what LDoN brings with it for new weapons.<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated.<br />

<br />
I've had horrible luck with my boc in the way of procs goes though, so I'm probably just an oddball...<br />
<br />
Good offhander would be copper hammer, bloodsword, a lot of good choices really. Red epic would suit you good for awhile still as well.</div></div><hr />

Sure it's still a great weapon, but for a night getting exp in Droga you can get a weapon that is 95% of an SoD and get some AA to boot. BoC + copper hammer or bloodsworn will be a superb agro combo. Screw buying an SoD, spend that money elsewhere and get some good upgrades.<br />

Considering you can just be lazy and buy either droga weapon for under 20k, it sure seems like 200k+ is a lot to spend for a negligible difference in weapons. Ratio is near identical, Droga weapons have more HP, SoD has more STA and SoD has more damage per proc. If you where to price an SoD soley on its merits when compared to these weapons, I would value it at around 25-30k. If it still dropped, I would probably not be worth much more than the hammer or sword.<br />
<br />
Plus, the biggest benefit of all is not having to swing a lame ass looking sceptre when you can swing a hammer or a sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just another option, the only real reason I bring it up, is because since they re-did Droga, Warrior's have no diversity anymore, it's all CHoS+SoBS or a GSoT.<br />
<br />
Just thoght I'd throw the CHSD out there too, although getting a CHoS or a SoBS would be easier than a CHSD.  Any of them would work fine for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to answer a couple of comments/questions...<br />
<br />
First off, pp really isn't an issue for me Wandor.  If it's a good upgrade, I'll get the pp for it.<br />
<br />
Also, Xanamech isn't an option for our guild yet Caeden.   At the present time, until we grow a fair bit more as a guild, I'm limited to basically what I can buy in the bazaar, as well as the new CHoS/SoBs.  <br />
<br />
I guess I'll rephrase my question.  Is it worth it to purchase an SoD instead of using CHoS or SoBs ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buy a Heavy Rubicite Girdle, Stonewood Compound Bow, and I suppose a CHoS or SoBS (although Red Blade is just fine).<br />
<br />
Also, any Ornate Molds you could find would help, although Ornate will continue to drop drastically in price unless they slow down the drop rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing your friend is referring to the fact that the stun portion of the sod proc doesn't land on 55+ mobs.  This has no effect on the aggro generated, but a lot of people don't realize this.  SoD is a fine aggro weapon in any tier.  It's still the 2nd best droppable tanking weapon in the game.  Is it worth 200k?  I guess that depends on how much plat you have, but you could certainly get more bang for your buck by picking up a copper hammer and spending the other 180k on other upgrades.  I don't think you will see a very large difference in aggro or DPS using the SoD over the Droga weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the info and replies everyone.  As it stands, I think I'll hold off on the SoD for now, unless the bazaar is VERY nice to me in the next couple days.  <br />
<br />
As for the other upgrades mentioned.  On ornate molds, I'm waiting for the price to drop on them a bit more before I purchase them.  The heavy rubicite girdle is a very nice piece, but that's my haste slot; or at least it is until I can maybe get something from HoT/NToV etc.  I could go with a Cloak of Flames in my back slot I guess, but really don't want to lose 24 AC to gain 35 HP.  As for the stonewood bow, I'm waiting on that as well.  I'm still 2 lvls away from the minimum required level, and at the rate I lvl at, that's a helluva long time :p   I keep meaning to camp the transient idol from ME for my range slot, but I just never seem to be able to get around to getting a group of guildies to do it.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for all the replies and information !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's the deal on the SoD. I currently use BoC/SoD for raid shit, but for XP groups, I bag the BoC, swap the SoD over to main and pull out the ol copper hammer for more DPS.  The other warrior in my guild uses Copper Hammer/Sword of the Bloodsworn, and I have VERY little aggro trouble.  I keep aggro over him probably 95% of the time (maybe 1 in 20 mobs he ends up tanking), altho he is a very close number 2 (ahead of everyone else, if something happens to me, mobs turn right to him).<br />
<br />
I think the sword of the bloodsworn proc is slightly less taunt than Force Shock or Anarchy.  One Anarchy or Force Shock proc will keep aggro thru a slow from my shaman, one planar strike proc doesn't always keep aggro after a slow.  I've seen it happen twice now where his Bloodsworn procced right away and then the mob turned to the shaman after the slow.  I've never seen that happen after Anarchy from me or a Force Shock from either of us.<br />
<br />
So, is the SoD an upgrade to the 2 droga weapons?  Absolutely.  Is it a 200k upgrade?  For your average joe, probably not.   There's not a lot of things left that I could buy that would be real upgrades for me.  Spending 200k on a weapon that gives me a little bit more aggro was a good investment based upon my gear and the returns that droppable upgrades would give.  For a lot of other people, that's probably not the case, in which case buying an SoD would be foolhardy at best.  The Sceptre of Destruction is still top of the line....but if you don't have top of the line gear in every slot, then it's not a worthy purchase anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fantasybadboy</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoD does worth the 350kpp price tag ( I paid 425k for mine.)  Even without stun effect, It still hold solid agro.  BoC is long term agro, SoD is snap agro.  I have all Greatblade of the storm, boc, and sod.  Through a long time using them, I think that BoC=SoD both better than Greatblade of the Storm.<br />
One more thing I like about SoD is that it lets me proc crit blast like a wizard.  576 dd crit blast owns while great blade of the storm only crit blast at 358 dd max.  There isnt a weapon that i know of would crit blast anywhere near that high like the SoD untill plan of time.<br />
<br />
It's just my personal thoughts, corect me if i am wrong :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on this:<br />
<br />
Take a group and go camp the King dronan in Droga for a Copper Hammer of Striking. Dont buy it as the camp is rather easy to get too. Unfortunately it is somewhat permacamped ( because it is so easy ).<br />
Save your PP for Ornate purchases or haste upgrades and hit point earrings and such to upgrade your wearable armor. BoC and Copper hammer is good enough. To be honest BoC and red epic is good enough IMHO. I use BoC and a Bone bladed Battle-Hammer which is a 122DD +stun proc similar to the other weapons mentioned and I have no trouble maintaining agro once they do proc. <br />

In your case I would try to get the following before an SoD:<br />
<br />
Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle<br />
Kizrak's Greaves of Battle<br />
2x Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />
2x Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
Stonewood/Featherwood compound bow<br />
Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates<br />
Black Plated Collar<br />
2x Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
Boots of the Storm<br />
Amygdalan's Chain Mask<br />
<br />
These items would be a upgrade of 37ac, 42sta, and 370hp.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it to purchase an SoD instead of using CHoS or SoBs ? Not IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle- aye, will upgrade to this, but not at 250k *current price in bazaar*... waiting till prices drop some.<br />
<br />
Kizrak's Greaves of Battle- see above<br />
<br />
2x Crystallized Acid Bracer- haven't found any for sale in bazaar, or in auction chat channel, for several months now.<br />
<br />
2x Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience- have only seen 1 for sale in bazaar, didn't have 150k pp at the time, don't know if I would spend it if I did have it.  Think this is 1 of those pieces that I am going to wait until the price drops.<br />
<br />
Stonewood/Featherwood compound bow- again, back to the whole required level thing.<br />
<br />
Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates- again, just being tough to find,  but looking for them.<br />
<br />
Black Plated Collar- see above<br />
<br />
2x Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement-no. I prefer the 1 AC and +7 to disease on mosquito leg earrings over the 5hp<br />
<br />
Boots of the Storm-is such a minor upgrade, it'll be among the last I do<br />
<br />
Amygdalan's Chain Mask-no, lose too much AC and saves.</div></div><hr />

re:waiting on Ornate prices to drop:<br />
<br />
Just thopught I would inform you that Ornate mold drops have calmed down alot in SolRo.<br />
Dont expect prices to come down much more than they already are. Yup. On my server prices are going back up. Ornate drops where reeled in with the last patch, as they should have been. About the only ornate that will be dropping in price is the BPs because they still drop pretty often from the tower named.<br />
<br />
Many of the other tradeable items I listed will come down in price as more guilds get into the EPs on your server. The acid bracers will start hitting the bazaar as Raex's find their way to more and more warriors. Bows, rings, and earring prices drop like a rock as the competition gets harder from a dozen traders selling the items instead of just 1.</div></div><hr />

I borrowed it for a VT raid and have a few things to add about it.<br />
<br />
Notes: 65 warrior 60 aa. No offensive AA yet except Ingenuity 1. No Flurry. No ambi. I have the following wpns I can use :<br />
Boc, CHSD that I typically use for my DW setup. If I want 2hs or 2hb I have either BBB or the GSoT.<br />
Using those I can hold aggro decently well. I put the SoD in primary and 2ndary and noticed some things:<br />
<br />
1.) It's highly overrated.<br />
<br />
2.) It doesn't proc a whole lot. I had 1600 attack with 280 in all stats. When it does, it doesn't generate aggro very well. I did get aggro when BoC proc'd. I didn't when anarchy proc'd.<br />
<br />
3.) this could have been just VT.<br />
<br />
Overall, Don't waste your pp on the SoD.</div></div><hr />

In my guild we have a ton of SoD (sleeper is still asleep on RZ) and GBoS and only the warriors that don't have GBoS use a SoD.</div></div><hr />

HOWEVER, for other people reading this who may have guilds a bit further along, a much better option, and what I personally use, is Great Blade of Storms, same 179dd + stun proc and its 14-18, with better stats as well.  Drops off Icestorm lord (I think, maybe Hailstorm) in BoT towers.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I find it works very well for aggro.  BoC in mainhand for me, GBoS in offhand.</div></div><hr />
