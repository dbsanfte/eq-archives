<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering: for a warrior that started at a base 85 STA, will 10 pts of Stamina from Innate Stamina AA (level 5) have a substantial effect on the Improved Natural Durability AA ?<br />
<br />
Or is it not worth the effort ?</div></div><hr />

This usually happens with buffs and gear relatively quickly. On the other hand, if you're usually running around below your max stamina, then dumping points into innate stamina might be worth it. More directly toward your question, take the points in stamina gained, use that chart someone posted here about actual hp effects per stamina point, and do the math from there.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this helps :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get my STA buffed most of the time, so might not be worth it.<br />
<br />
I'm just so gutted to see that I got 39hp from level 53 to 54.. I cant believe it :(</div></div><hr />

Start looking to replace items with ones that have raw HPs, or even finding some items that have Stamina would be a bonus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Doobi said, if you are already max stam with buffs, there really is no point in getting innate stam. It doesn't give any benefit.<br />
<br />
Only reason i could see to get it is if you want to avoid getting stam buff to save a buff slot, but that's pretty petty and i wouldn't do that until you had tons of aa's and just wanted to spend some on something you didn't need. Spend those points elsewhere into something more useful. I put 3 points into stam with a base of 80 and although i don't regret it, it was sort of a waste, and innate regen woulda been somewhat more useful heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your magelo you have 117 stamina, no buff on earth will let you reach to cap of 255 (or higher once ya get planar power). Until 255 and with natural durability 3 you get about 7hps per stamina (at lvl 60 that is, not sure at lvl 54), so that's 14hps per AA point. I did it back in the Luclin days, raised my base stamina from 75 to 85. I don't need it anymore but I did need it back then to be able to max out my stamina with buffs. If you expect to get decent gear in a raiding guild at some point you will probably reach 305 stamina unbuffed at a certain point anyway. So, just gotta ask yourself if 14hps is worth an AA at this point. Might want to focus on combat stability/agility first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks much for suggestions,<br />
<br />
I was effectively trying to get to 1k AC around level 46 and since I am now in lower planes most of time I am hesitant to  sacrifice too much AC for HP.<br />
<br />
For example I was able to roll on Cloak of Maelstrom in Kael.. but didn't, thinking the AC was too low (compared to 19 in back slot)... maybe an error on my part. :(<br />
<br />
What would be the minimum AC I should keep at level 55 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some one posted a really simple formula that I loved.  Don't remember exactly who it was to give them credit, but the formula was:<br />
<br />
1 AC = 10 hp's<br />
1 STA = 7 hp's<br />
1 hp = 1 hp<br />
<br />
Using that formula for the cloak of Maelstrom gives (11 AC *10) + (6 STA * 7) + 55 hp's = 207 hp's.  Compare that to Chetari Bonecrafted Shield 19 AC * 10 = 190.  Based on that formula, the cloak would have been a slight upgrade, but not a huge one.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as minimum AC, I think as long as you have a decent AC, I would not even worry about it.  I have heard the number 1200 thrown about some, and try and keep mine over that, but am not sure if I would sweat it if you are under it.  At 54, you still will be gaining AC as your you level up, so I would not worry too much.<br />
<br />
Edit:  actually looked at your magelo, and added the compare for your current back item to Maelstrom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks much for the suggestions, but as I was considering this question again, I realised that maybe I did not phrase my question properly enough.<br />
<br />
In fact I will do a guess here, and reply to it myself :<br />
<br />
I was wondering if the Innate Stamina would affect the total BASE HP at my current level, as if it was STAmina that was added AT CREATION.<br />
<br />
So reading in between the lines of your replies, I am guessing this does not work like that and the INNATE stamina (AA) will have the same effect as gear added STA.<br />
<br />
Which , effectively, is pretty much useless.<br />
<br />
Sadly so :/<br />
<br />
I know there are tons of super warriors out there that started at 85 STA but honestly when you see a difference of 300+ hp arounds at level 60ish due to CREATION time sta, and you lookup the price of item upgrades to cope for this HP difference, you cry &gt; &lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no difference between how much hitpoints base stamina, worn stamina or buffed stamina gives. An ogre and a halfling with the exact same gear and exact same stamina (through buffs or whatever) have the same hps.</div></div><hr />
