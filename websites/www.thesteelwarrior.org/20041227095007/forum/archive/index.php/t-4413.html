<br />
I just hit level 55 Today, and am hearing rumors of KICK being a skill that stuns now.  Is this true, and if so do I need to train anything to do it??<br />
<br />
Also on a sidenote.  Anyone know of any good spots that I can duo at level 55 with a cleric friend??<br />
<br />
I hear that 55 is a mini &quot;Hell Level&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Kick will automatically have a chance to stun at 55 just like at 60 you will automatically have a chance to triple attack.<br />
<br />
Velks would probably be a good spot to duo with a cleric with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Velk's is good to duo with a healer, just get to know the pathing and aggro habits of the spiders, they can be tricky pulls if someone is fighting near their pathing.<br />
<br />
As far as the mini hell level thing, 55 wasn't so bad. Get a steady flow of pull-n-kill and it'll fly by.</div></div><hr />

The cleric could just root every pull, but, in my experience anyway, caster root is notoriously and predictably short-lived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a great deal of things you fight, the kick stun works 100% of the time if the kick connects.  The stun is short enough that you probably won't notice it unless it's a caster.  Some stuff just appears to outright resist kick stun 100% of the time though.  I haven't been able to find any good indicator of why kick would stun something or not at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XugXug</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your buddy is a dark elf cleric you can help them get the snare neclace from the Neriak cleric guild quest (it's at most a level 35 quest, the last part of it, and quite easy, should take maybe an hour to do all 3 steps).  You have to slaugher some level 7 halflings, then kill some level 10 halfling in Neriak, then some other simple stuff and finally, my favorite step, you have to kill a level 35 paladin in steamfont; I really enjoyed killing that paladin... I kept asking him: &quot;So where's your tanking ability now?!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a Regent Symbol of Innoruuk and a 5 second clickie of Clinging Darkness and really helps in dungeons when you don't have a snarer.  It lasts 60 seonds which is usually enough to kill a runner or recast dark after 4 ticks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does work in PoP for sure.  The razorfiends in PoV run at about 17% health.  If you chase them and kick, you can stop them dead in their tracks for about a second.  I have done this hundreds of times, its not coincidence, it does work.</div></div><hr />
