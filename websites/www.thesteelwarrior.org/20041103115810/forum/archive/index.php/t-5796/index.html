<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok this is not a please look at my gear and tell me what to upgrade thread. This is what should I be shooting for in regards to unbuffed HP's/AC<br />
I am in a casual family guild, not looking to get into Ele's or Time, just looking to be able to step up and tank in BoT and the likes of that. What do I need ( please understand Need as not what I should have but what are the bare essentials) in order to do this effectivly.<br />
Working now on getting the AA's up to date for all my defensives then working on getting to 65.<br />
Thanks again for information and help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">somewhere around 5k unbuffed and neighborhood of 1300 AC should be plenty to tank BoT stuff. Heck you probably can even do bosses in vel, low luclin, bot towers etc with that kind of HP provided you have maxed defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sakryn's info is good to go by.<br />
<br />
However, anyone you know that's been there can tell ya... watch your back.<br />
<br />
Trains (like seeing named at the zone in) and other crazy shit can make for an interesting time.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend having invis item, gate item, and as much run speed as ya can get. Better safe then sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slyson Dycson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5k unbuffed at your current lvl would be a stretch.  I was doing BoT with 4500 and never had a problem.  One suggestion would be to get 65 before you go all out defensive AA's.  The benefits of being 65 out weigh lvl 62 with full defensive.  You also won't get many groups in BoT at 62 even though you could do it easily.  People just don't like lower lvls.<br />
<br />
What you could do is hang out in PoV for a while.  Once I hit 60, I stopped and got myself ND3 because at the time, my HP were lacking.  And PoV is not bad exp either.  I'm not saying you should get ND3 right now, but it is a path that may help you out a bit.  The better choice IMO would be grind out to 65 and then check your HP.  You get a nice HP boost in that range I believe.  Your gear looks on par for a nonraid guild.<br />
<br />
Change up you magelo a bit.  Make yourself 65 and give yourself ND3 and PE.  I would be willing to bet you would be happy with the results.  Just a matter of getting the lvls and a few important AA, but you are in the same boat I was.  Your AC is right where it should be.  If you can break 1200 then you are doing good.  1300 is a bit harder untill you start getting more ornate.</div></div><hr />
