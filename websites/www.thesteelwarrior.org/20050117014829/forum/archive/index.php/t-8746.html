<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molane</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for some recommendations on DPS weaps.  I currently use the typical CHoS/SotB for agro but alot of the time due to my level and lack of AA's I'm just there as a secondary tank or DPS.  I've been gone from game for over a year and just came back recently so I haven't kept up with what's what...  Is it still a general consensus that a 2 hander will out dps dual weilding?  Would Windblade, or Velium Gemmed 2hander be good or would 2 gemmed 1 handers be better?  Is there other weaps I'm not thinking of that are about the same as those for &quot;bang for pp&quot;?  I could also camp some 2 groupable stuff if there's a camped mob to do.  I really can't play my warrior during any kind of raid due to having a different main.  I've tried searching the forum and just can't seem to find the answers I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you can give me.</div></div><hr />

Velium gemmed 2hander a little better and a lot more pp.  wmbs will beat a windblade out of the box from what i have read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on the quality of the weapons.  I'm gonna guess that 2 Velium Gemmed 1 handers are gonna be out a WMBS, but they gonna cost you a pretty penny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already have the WMBS, I was looking for something with a little higher DPS.  I'm not really affraid of cost for 2 Velium Gemmed weaps if it would be a significant DPS upgrade, but just want to make sure that it is better than the 2 hander and the best option for dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eborg</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im suprised no one has mentioned this combo for dps as well as agro<br />
Ive been using CHoS with the 75point EF aug primary, and DFFC in secondary.  <br />
Most people overlook the Flintforge Cudgle i think cause of the delay, but with haste that 27 delay is cut down quite a bit, and the damage it puts out is nice.  I get crits around 190 with it at lvl 58.<br />
   <br />
The hate and the damage output that comes with the 625 point DD proc is amazing.   I often get 3 to 8 procs a mob in PoV, and usually 2 or more on LDoN hards.  ...conservitively thats 1250 to 2500 hps a mob in nukes (2 to 4 procs).  lotta agro, lotta dmg.<br />
warning tho..even as 2ndary tank, no taunting, no disc, i have REPEATEDLY stolen agro at max melee range from CHoS/SBoD wars..if you do this, expect to become the MT.<br />
Get a Fo7 or hos, Haste an yer a mini wizzy.   can get a DFFC pretty common in the bazaar on Luclin<br />

I may have to try one of those high damage procing weapons myself and parseing it. 3 to 8 procs of that magnitude with max ingenuity and WA5 might do some interisting stuff.<br />
<br />
I dont know the hate value of a DD proc, but its supposed to be minimal. But after weapon swapping, charging a room of mobs, shakerpaging, and swapping back, I can hold aggro on everything through the first 3 heals.<br />
<br />
Although skeptical, it may have merit.<br />
Dont think I would tank a raid with a DD setup, but for something like LDoN where no one cares if someone takes a lump or two that extra DPS might be worth it. A 625 DD might make a difference in a 30 min parse</div></div><hr />
