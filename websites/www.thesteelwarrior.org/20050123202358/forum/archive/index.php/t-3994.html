1) weapons thats what im currently using any suggestions for upgrades or a better setup? (dont have money for a boc) also was thinking what augment can i put in whip for more agro snice it seems a big upgrade over my old combo of the cohs and sword from droga. I was leaning more towards a dps/stun aug instead of anger proc I want agro but want to put out whatdps i can. so any suggestion or ideas will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
2) gear overall what are some possible upgrades i should go for or save up for? or whats my suckiest slots or best upgrades i should shoot for or save for ?<br />
