<br />
Seems like it isn't working on mezzed mobs.  Normally, when breaking mez I taunt until I see a successful taunt message and then break mez with kick followed by auto attack and an incite once I am sure I have the mobs attention.  Since the patch I am noticing that even if I taunt successfuklly several times before breaking mez, the mob still tries to eat the enchanter as soon  as mez is broken.  I'm finidng myself better off to break mez and THEN taunt, which is completely backwards from the way I should be doing things.</div></div><hr />

First I taunt the mob, use provoke, and taunt it again. Works most of the time but not a given that it'll work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retsin</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope he's not sitting.  Grouped with this enchanter tons in the past and I've never had this issue before.  In the past I have noticed that if I break mez too quickly after I taunt that the mob may still try to beat on the chanter for a second, but then would pop onto me., which I believe is lag related.  But that''s not what is happening here at all.  Just about no matter how much I taunt a mezzed mob, it seems to go rught for chanter once mez is broken.</div></div><hr />

If you're fighting in OoW a lot lately, it could be because the mobs are higher level than your used to. Higher level mobs resist taunt a lot more, I'm pretty sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dabell</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had some problems last night in Noble's Causeway, and I think I figured out what it is.<br />
<br />
The first chanter that was in our group would only slow the mezzed mobs, no other debuffs while it was sleeping.  I would get a successful taunt, /rude, then slam and attack to wake the mob.  Never once did it chase after that chanter.<br />
<br />
The chanter that replaced the first would Tash and slow the mezzed mobs.  I would do my normal routine to wake the mobs, and they would go smack the chanter.  I had to wait for taunt to refresh before I would wake the mob and hope the second taunt did not fail.  I didn't have the patience for 2 successful taunts on a mezzed mob before I woke it.  If the second taunt failed,  one proc from my BoC would pull the mob off the chanter.  <br />
<br />
That was the only recurring aggro problem of the night, and the only other time I had problems keeping aggro with my normal routine was when the chanter would sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragan</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im having exactly the same problem.<br />
Its the same in both oow and god.<br />
Taunting until i wont get fail message on taunt before breaking mez and half the time the mob goes for the chanter.<br />
<br />
Think I had it before last patch too tho, but not sure when it started.<br />
<br />
AE Taunt seem not to work particularly well either, atleast its not 100%<br />
<br />
Annoying as hell to not know if you have aggro or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">really to keep agro on a mez break you need 1 successful taunt and an incite, that will hold the agro from the chanter 99.9% of the time. If a chanter is tashing thats where your gonna have a tab bit of an issue. Tashing = a pain in the ass. But most of the time you will be able to hold the initial agro on a mez break and pray for a proc to maintain the agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arganax</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't know they ever fixed taunt...But seriously, my only issue is that several times (more than 2) I have ae taunted and it has not even slowed the mobs down, and they were chasing a cleric the last 2 occasions so it's not like they were dotted or something, and he didn't heal after I taunted.  This was at one particular camp, so I just chalked it up to pathing/collision issues in the expansion and figured it would take care of itself eventually.  After all, the first month (or 6) of an EQ expansion is a beta test right?!</div></div><hr />
