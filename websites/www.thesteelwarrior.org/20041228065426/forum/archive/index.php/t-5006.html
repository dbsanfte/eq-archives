<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bonefrost</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, as you guys are the weapons experts; please let me throw out a specific example and see a response.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24982<br />
<br />
newbie quest weapon, 2blunt, 10dam, 29delay.<br />
<br />
does that weapon overstep the damage cap before lvl 20?  or is it the best newbie quest weapon in the game, because it has the best ratio of 2.9?<br />
<br />
as an example, the warrior quest weapon from Halas is <br />
5dam, 29delay, ratio of 5.8<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22109<br />
<br />
or the Frog warrior quest of exact same stats<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20396<br />
<br />
or the human Qeynos quest of <br />
7dam, 29delay, ratio of 4.142<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=14048<br />
<br />
or even the Troll 2hand slash quest<br />
12dam, 43delay ratio of 3.583<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22699<br />
<br />
Alla is not letting my pull up the Ogres currently for some reason<br />
<br />
or the woody/half elf quest 1slash of<br />
7dam, 29delay, ratio of 4.142<br />
crap, no link, closed that window already.  trust me<br />
<br />
now the DE warrior one is only of interest because it is not limited to DE's (on servers that do not have no-drop)<br />
7dam. 40delay, ratio of 5.714<br />
<br />
ok, this is getting old, i will skip the others, but a pattern is forming here.<br />
<br />
is the Erudite Cleric weapon the best newbie quest weapon in the game (class/race specific)?  or do they get hosed because of some damage cap thingy that i am missing?<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bonefrost</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as a side note.  i find it interesting that the Halfling warrior newbie quested weapon appears to be best of all<br />
7dam, 25delay, ratio of 3.571 AND +10 STA<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11498<br />
lvl to attain of 8<br />
<br />
that still beats the old Langseax<br />
6dam, 23delay, ratio of 3.833 with no stat boost<br />
lvl to attain listed at 20<br />
<br />
so far, the Langseax of the Wolves is the best , but rarer<br />
19dam, 44delay, 2slash ratio of 2.315; 5str 5dex<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=411<br />
lvl to attain of 20, but 20 is no longer exactly newbie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bonefrost</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at least on the shaman board someone would say &quot;search is your friend&quot;, or some nonsense.  (and i tried under serveral combinations of damage, damage cap, damage bonus.  no decent results)<br />
<br />
so does anyone not have a frickin' clue?<br />
<br />
i didn't post this to be rude or put down tanks, i play a shaman and all the cleric weapons have 1/2 the ratio ours do.  i was posting for a few thoughts on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage cap pre-20 used to be 19 for 1handers and 33 for 2handers. (That may have changed.)  But a 10 or higher damage weapon will hit for 19 more often than a 9 damage weapon.<br />
10/29 is pretty good for a newbie weapon, same ratio as the Blackened Alloy Longsword that was so popular in its' day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When ever i twink i use the lowest possible delay. I usually dont even look at damage or ratios untill I am at least past lvl 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bonefrost</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, twink is not exactly it.  Discord server pvp, knowing that i will not live much past lvl 10 is.<br />
<br />
and then you are still kind of correct, if it was just low lvl pvp.  the Kerra fishing pole 3dam, 17delay is a fabulous low lvl caster smacker.  but you need to be about lvl 16 to solo that.<br />
<br />
so i was looking at ratio.  but the 29 delay of the Erudite cleric 2blunt still puts it above most newbie weapons.</div></div><hr />
