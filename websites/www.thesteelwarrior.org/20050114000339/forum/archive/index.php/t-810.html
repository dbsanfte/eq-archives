Both have same delay but grinder procs and SSoL has a point higher damage and better stats.<br />
<br />
Also, is there any advantage to using both?  As I understand Dual-Wield; when using primary hand dual wield has a percent chance to allow off-hand weapon to strike.  Off hand weapon can be used if within normal delay restriction.  It seems optimum to have 2 weapons with the same delay for max damage (assuming 2 weapons above are used).  I ask now before trying to invest in them both.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

You secondary hand swings completely independent of your primary hand. The only thing that determines when your off hand swings is your dual wield skill. You can equip a lightstone in primary and your secondary will still swing at its normal rate.<br />
<br />
That being said, the Shortblade will do more damage consitantly. If you fight mobs that are suseptible to fire attacks, then the FG should do more damage due to procs. Ironically, FG proc is almost worthless in the zone it drops in.</div></div><hr />

With either weapon, your minimum hit is going to be 1, or 1+ your damage bonus depending on what hand it's in, and your maximum hit isn't going to be a whole lot different, so you might as well get a chance to add 160dd on top of it.  Fleshgrinder is a really fun weapon, and I never could bear to sell mine.</div></div><hr />

Plus think about it, a fleshgrinder would look like some nasty jagged axe that smells like human feces and intestines, on the othe hand, the shortblade would look like a sword of pure electricity :P</div></div><hr />
