Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

If it was near instant ala. aten gloves .5sec it would be much more valued. 10 seconds with 10 min duration kind of bites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahulk Keras</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got BoW and Orb of Sky. I can say that the orb helps A LOT since the BoW procs very rarely. I usually proc CallOfSky twice as much as Enraging Blow.<br />
<br />
Was using Gaudralek for weeks before I got BoW and I was able to tank with Orb (very very difficult without it).<br />
<br />
P.S. Yes the cast time SUCKS.</div></div><hr />

How big is the knockback? knockback is evil in raid and the MT just hates it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try and keep Call of Sky up all the time. I usually cast it right before tanking a boss to keep it fresh. The knock back is 1, so it's not a huge issue. If I'm not mistaken, you can't get a proc with it when you miss, only on a hit, unlike innate weapon procs. Again, not a huge issue. <br />

I was happy when the stun component was added; Giwin almost got a new toy.</div></div><hr />

It's probably about the same as adding Ykesha to your weapon, though I don't have an ykesha proc to compare. It procs at LEAST once a minute and more like two times a minute.</div></div><hr />
