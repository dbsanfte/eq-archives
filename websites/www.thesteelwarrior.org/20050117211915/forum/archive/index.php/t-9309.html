<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlordbarreck</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">saw this guy up tonight, had no info so didn't bother at first.  Everything I see says to kill all the red mobs around him but I couldn't even attack them.  Eventually, while looking around, one of the blue mobs aggroed me and after we killed that one another became killable, etc.  never finished as we wiped cause I forgot about respawn ... but how do you get the red mobs to attack?</div></div><hr />

2nd time, he was Red to 67, and didnt become targetable after killing the guards...<br />

Clear all the red colored dragorns then pull him, he will start screaming for help and the others won't help.  Atleast they never did with me since I pulled him up so far or maybe they don't at all.  Hes not that hard, just need a good healer and some dps this guy has some hp.<br />
<br />
The 5 times I've killed him we got 2 x 69 runes and a mantle that wasn't to shabby each time.<br />

I thought that was kinda cool considering the &quot;give me liberty or give me death&quot; speech he is always spamming the zone with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this became more of an 'event' with the last patch.  If I attacked any of the red dragorns, they fought back for a few seconds, then ran over to the named and sat there for a while.  I assume there's some sequence you have to kill them in now, probably based on their names, which seem to indicate how much they believe him (forget them all, but were like heckler, sympathizer, etc).  Hopefully I'll get a chance to mess around with this script some more sometime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lesiter</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I one grouped him before the patch on the 13th by just killing the red guards around him.  Tried again last night, but couldn't get him to become attackable.  Tried killing all the red dragorns around him, and managed to get all killed but one, who wasn't attackable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarrasis</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does this event eventually despawn after a certain amount of time?  <br />
<br />
I was in an exp group at statue last night and this thing popped on us.  It was getting late and most had to leave anyway so we didn't get a chance to try it or wait for it to depop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried this on Wed? Patch day this week. None of the red mobs were attackable. Each time he asked for &quot;help&quot; a blue mob would answer and each time the blue mob that answered became attackable so we'd kill it. All blue mobs dead, no red mobs attackable. Next day still no blue mobs up still no red mobs attackable. And now when he zone shouts he doesn't receive a reply most times since the blue mobs are dead.<br />
<br />
Any advice on how you start this would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm not an expert on this encounter, but in my experience its all the red mobs you have to kill, before you can pull/harm him.<br />
<br />
Also be very carefull where you pull the red guards.. First time we tried we were chickens and pulled them up to the catacombs expedition entrance, but one of them went invulnerable and tried to run back to tornwing, but got stuck inside a wall.<br />
<br />
This totally bugged the script for a day or so, because one of the red mobs were now stuck in a wall, and spells would not take hold and we could not push it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Timmok, did you kill all the red colored dragorn mobs around him? or were you killing all the red ones in the zone itself? Because when we tried it, we just killed the red ones that were in sight of him. I was looking around the zone earlier and I found a bunch of ones up on a walkway above us that conned white to me at 68 and was wondering if we had to kill them maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgias</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a go at this with some folks in my guild yesterday, and here's what we did.  We set up behind the statue and started killing the red dragorns.  When we kept them firmly on the ground near the statue, they stayed on their tank (didn't do the run away and clear agro thing).  If we got them even a little up the hill, they tended to bolt, which makes me think this may be a z-axis bug.  The whole time, we were fighting right next to the blue mobs (hecklers and whatnot) and they didn't agro, so I don't think you really have to worry about them.<br />
<br />
Once we dropped the last red guy, Tiorpat shouted something about being ready, and we pulled him.  He hit for about 1100 on me without defensive and seemed to hit near max fairly often.  During the fight, he would shout for help and a blue dragorn would assist him.  We wiped when he was at about 3% when the clerics' mana ran out.  We fought behind the statue, which was probably our big mistake, since we had to divert people to dropping the hecklers as they added.  I'd advise finding a more or less safe spot to pull him to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giorg, how did you get the hecklers to spawn? is there a mob to kill that gets them to appear or is that a function of the reset on boss? Or does killing all the red colored dragorns get them to appear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgias</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They were there when we started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, thanks a lot :) if its a 24 hour reset I'll just have to hope they're there when we go back again.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that they were triggered by killing the other red dragorns though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">athos</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed 1 red dragon, then nothing was attackable. then after a couple mins 1 heckler attacked us. Now nothing.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that the script is bugged, because I went back there again today and he was up...but none of the other dragorns (hecklers, and what not) were. Going to try killing the dragorns around him + one I found named turncoat in the zone to see if that might reset, but I doubt it will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">athos</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">turncoat = ph for signit mob. not related</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">then I guess its bugged...unless tiorpat the mob is on a different timer than his goons are. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgias</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should point out that we did it shortly after a server crash, could be the respawn that's buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">athos</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did sunday evening, RCoD had come down Saturday during the day i believe (which btw i believe nerfed being able to start Catacombs/Sewers with signit mob up). There were 2 reds and 5 or something blues up. I assumed we jsut killed the reds like has been posted. We went down killed a red on spot, but after it died nothing else was attackable. Then every so  often a mob would become attackable, but not the other red. Since we were confused we jsut killed whatever attacked us. It seemed the emotes were getting further apart too. Anyway we waited a while killed everything but the last red, and nothing. After 45 mins or so it still wasnt attackable. So we left.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what we did wrong would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt anyone is doing anything wrong.<br />
<br />
The event is totally and utterly borked.  On Povar, in fact, the same unattackable mobs have been up for the past week or so.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, the clueless tend never to camp in the statue camp because they don't understand that Sony broke the entire event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I thought it was something we were doing. I have gone back there periodically the past couple of days just to look when I have the time, and I did see Tiorpat...but none of his goons each time. I may check today after I patch and what not to check, but I doubt it will be any different from the last time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried this thing tonight.  We arrived at RCD and I'd say 7-8 reds were up and maybe 5-6 blues.  So, we killed the only killable red, next one became killable, and so on until the very last one, the last one never became killable.  I had to log about 45 minutes later, but when I logged he still was not killable.  Pretty sure they were all up because of the server reset last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Attempted the event again last night since it was broken, and am very disappointed.  Not surprised at all, I always had a feeling it never worked as intended from day 1.  Why are the blue mobs there?  Why does he call for them and they dont assist?  Sounded bugged to me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, pulled all the red mobs, Tornwing became targettable and attacked.  A few new changes:<br />
<br />
- you now have to fight inside the circle of mobs, you cant pull them out of the circle else they just run off and go back to their spawn spot.  meaningless really until Tornwing becomes active<br />
<br />
- each time he calls for help, a blue npc wakes up and assists him (probably how it was supposed to work since the beginning)<br />
<br />
- We never got his HP's below 97%, he'd regen to full in a matter of seconds.  Neat, another raid mob now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very very very lame on the last point.  They took the single group aspect right out of the equation.  If somehow his loot was a whole lot better, I could accept this change to 'raid only', but for now it's just simply unjustified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did you only have one group when you went at it Moruk? And if so...what was the makeup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did you only have one group when you went at it Moruk? And if so...what was the makeup?<br />
<br />
Aye one group. 70 war, 70 clr, 70 ench, 70 necro, 70 mage, 70 shm.  <br />
<br />
We had done this event before, and were able to get Tornwing to about 8% before i screwed up on a heal and we wiped ( I box the cleric).  This last time we'd get his hp to about 97% then it would just jump to 98, 100, and we'd repeat the process ad nauseum.  We finally just gave up and wiped after we couldnt get his hp past 97.<br />
<br />
Maybe killing the blue ones as he calls for them reduces his regen rate.  Dont know, dont care anymore.  Not worth the effort for one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same problem here as moruk. I also box the cleric. First time we did this, Think I posted before, something was bugged reds not attackable every so often TT would say help a blue would answer we'd kill. Killed all blues and nada. Next time event was fully popped bunch of red bunch of blue. However for us all the red are attackable so we have to be careful with pulls so we don't get more then one, mez is a total pain to land.<br />
<br />
Anyways, get them all dead. Prep, charge TT. got him to 77 and I borked a heal (wee group elixer nice waste of time) and we wiped. 2-3 days later it's back up we go again clear everything, engage, he never moved from 99. We had 8 or 9 peeps with including a 70 ranger with just under 900aa, she has all her offensive aa's through god and I dunno what from oow plus a wizzie and other assorted dps. Next time same deal clear engage, never leaves 99, he never makes it to 100 either. Our second attempt (1 group) I parsed and our dps was 38,000 ish before I was pissed and i blew a heal.<br />
<br />
Unless he has around 20 million hp and decent regen, somethings wrong here. I can't see him being a raid mob except dps wise. 1 cleric can heal the fight fairly well the only reason to have more then one is length of fight, TT's dps isn't that high.<br />
<br />
I was chatting with a gm the other night and he hadn't heard of any problem but put in a bug report regarding it. I've also submitted several reports regarding it.<br />
<br />
Regular group: me (67 first time 69 last time) war, 68 Cleric, 70 Ranger, 69 Bard, 68 Enc, and last member varies Had 70 BL, 68 necro, 70 bard, etc.</div></div><hr />
