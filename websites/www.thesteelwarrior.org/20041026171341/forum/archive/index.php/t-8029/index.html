<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can we get this changed from &quot;..whine about paladins&quot; <br />
<br />
to jsut a place to vent warrior frustrations.<br />
<br />
Tired of seeing paladins say &quot;Go say this etc in tsw forum dedicated to paladin bashing!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not our fault the fuckers have no sense of humor. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Says the man who whines about paladins the most?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just cause I might whine about them more then anything doesn't mean I don't think the forum name should be named differently.<br />
<br />
It hurts any warrior argument because paladins see that and jsut assume it's a us vs them thing in all situations (the stupid ones that is)</div></div><hr />

Here here! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i do consider the title humorous but i think im going to place my vote for changing it too since im getting pretty burned out on the whole warrior/paladin controversy myself and the title does encourage it. i never put two and two together until now but i wondered why paladins constituted 9/10 of the non-warrior whiners on this board and it just suddenly occures to me that this title might be why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">leave it so the they can carry it like a badge of honor like they do kunark. that and it keeps pally issues out of the important areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The title was put there because at the time the majority of rant-type posts were about paladins.<br />
<br />
I can change it pretty easily, but I find it hard to believe that it's the sole reason for the existance of trolls. I'm not married to it though, and  I'll think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...for the existance of trolls. I'm not married to it though, ....<br />
<br />
I hope you don't. being married to a troll must be an every moment  pain :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I do Agree that it should now be called somthing like &quot;Where whinners come squize our balls&quot; if it's not too offendish, this would calm them down a bit. But unfortunately they camp the balance class forum too :(<br />

You had better remember that next time you start spewing retarded anti paladin shit, because I will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Are you just gonna bust on him for retarded shit, anti paladin shit, or both?  Just so we know what to look for and all.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well normally it would just be retarded shit, but since he had to start this thread bitching about the description of this forum, knowing full well that he's been leading the anti paladin crusade lately, both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">But I LIKE to whine about paladins!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bah I haven't led a anti-paladin crusade, mainly pointing out some of the retarded paladins I &lt;3 paladins!</div></div><hr />

OMG it must have been very young on the pic to have this face (less than a month, isn't it?).<br />
<br />
we can't see his teeth for now (like rat), and the view angle make its ears almost invisible (like cat), and the flash makes its eyes fully black (like rat), ...<br />
<br />
sorry for the error.<br />
BTW, which race is it?</div></div><hr />
