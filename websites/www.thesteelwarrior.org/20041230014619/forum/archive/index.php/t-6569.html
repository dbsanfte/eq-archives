So everybody knows about haste, haste stacking, DI/DB, procrates and hate generation. But what is attack? I did a search and came up dry, if it's been covered please forgive me and just link the good stuff. <br />
<br />
Has anybody parsed the difference between 1200 and 1400 atk? 1600 attack? How much of an improvement is SoP, FA or NDT good for? How many dps is that Vengeance II (now attack +10) item good for? <br />
<br />
I've heard of an attack cap.. what is it? Does haste play into attack, or is it only offense + weapon skill + weapon ratio + bonusses? Is there a correlation between your attack and a mobs AC? What about strikethrough and all those other new uber skills?<br />
<br />
Inquiring minds want to know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vegence 2 would be such a minor increase that it is non-parsable<br />
Attack cap is 250<br />
that is the cap for +attack that you can get from worn items and there are no attack stacking issues as far as I know (like 2 AoB items dont give you double regen)<br />
<br />
as far as actual dps increase between no attack bonus and +250 attack I am not sure, plus it would greatly depend on your weapon combo and if you really care that much you can parse, but I wouldnt expect more then 10 dps inrease and I am being generous here. As far as I understand +attack slightly effects your hit rate not max hit. Only strength does that.</div></div><hr />

No, attack has nothing to do with your hit rate.  At 65 with all skills capped and no accuracy gear, you'll generally have a hit rate of 59.5-60.0%.  Having 0 worn attack or 250 worn attack will have no effect on the hit rate.  <br />
<br />
I have some parses comparing 1300 atk vs 1561 atk I can go through and see the differences in average hits, when I get a chance.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that it has an affect of hit %, as Derrict said, and I know that it has nothing to do with the max obtainable hit. In an overly simplistic way, it makes you hit higher in your range more often than you would otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a certain point in attack you need to reach otherwise you won't hit for max.  There was some testing done on the beastlord forum and I did a few parses for it.  With an 18 damage weapon (battle fists), normal punch is 120 but my bst couldn't do that amount until 1285 attack.  With ~ 1130 attack, he was only punching for 98.  Beastlord.org has an attack thread with the formulas and calculations to show why the 1285 atk was the breakpoint to reach max hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's some data from a parse setup I did a few months back on the rogue forum, sans the backstab data.<br />
<br />
Using a Gold runed mithril knife (16-19 +1 fire) primary and Sharp gem formation (16-21) secondary, 1306 atk, no buffs, 41pct worn haste, lvl 61 parse mob:<br />
Duration 11,433 seconds<br />
Total pierces 14,828<br />
Total damage 843,735<br />
Average pierce 56.90 damage<br />
Pierce dps 73.79<br />
<br />
Same weapons and setup except with 1561 attack (255 more attack than setup 1):<br />
Duration 33,084 seconds<br />
Total pierces 42,907<br />
Total damage 2,869,008<br />
Average pierce 66.86<br />
Pierce dps 86.71<br />
<br />
17.51% increase in average pierce<br />
17.51% increase in pierce dps<br />
<br />
So with those numbers, every 14 attack = 1% dps increase on this particular mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a lot of illusions increase ATK. a lot of illusions that you dont think increase ATK actually do .. like wolf form. there is a maximum dps you will do even against a level 1 mob so when fighting low con mobs there is a diminishing return on ATK boosts. id love an answer to the question &quot;does increased ATK improve agro generation?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's an offhand attack value but only the primary attack value is displayed on the UIs.  I could post parses but it's not really relevant to the thread, but it's obvious if you put a stein or any junk item in primary that will make your attack dismal.  Your offhand weapon will still hit for the same frequency and intensity as before even though your UI might show 1000 attack rather than 1500 attack.<br />
<br />

Sure, why wouldn't it?  More attack results in more dps.  DPS is one of various ways of aggro generation.  If more dps didn't generate aggro, rogues/wizards/necros would have a field day on mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awhile back I'd heard roughly 1% more dps per 10 atk.  That may be possible on some mobs despite the rogue parse above showing 1% dps per 14 atk.  Obviously there's diminishing returns.  As you get higher on the hit chart and have more and more hits at or near your max dmg, there's less room for improvement.  So in the above example, maybe it really was as high as 1% for 10 atk from 1306 to 1406, but after that it averaged somewhat less.  <br />
<br />
For me, my attack at times seems somewhat low for the mobs I'm fighting, so I'd bet I'm getting close to that 1% when I add 10 atk.</div></div><hr />

Whoa there...let's not get carried away ;). A &quot;few&quot; illusions, which are actually ATK/aggro/DS buffs, with the illusion being a secondary effect of getting the buff, help your attack rating. These are commonly known as wolf (from druids and rangers), werewolf and imp (from enchanter) forms. They are the only easily acessible ones I know of. All the other illusions, including the racial ones,  skeletons, trees and random item illusions (like the &quot;dead&quot; beds you used to see in EC early on), do nothing for you attack-wise.</div></div><hr />

The 10 atk for 1% dps parses were done during Luclin era with higher mitigating mobs.  With current expansion and mobs mitigating less, attack doesn't have the same effect.  I parsed in PoP 17 attack for a 1% dps increase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a while back some one did a phrase that showed that the potential damage from attacks is actually what generates agro and not the total damage you inflict. so basicly, if you miss you still generate the same agro as if you hit for full.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure that the difference between 10 atk and 200 atk is the same as the difference between 2010 atk and 2210 atk.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, as a warrior, all I need to know is that atk buffs give more dps and if I have enough room for them I'll get em.  I'll let the rogues, monks, and rangers work out the details 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on the expansion.  In PoP, the diminishing returns is beyond 1900 attack, at least for a rogue.  Most GoD stuff hits too hard with too few hp so there's not much available for sustained parsing.<br />
<br />
I've never bought in on the idea of just potential damage // aggro.  I see it as a combination of current damage along with potential damage, plus any +hate or -hate procs.  When I'm doing an LDoN and a tank pulls 3-4 mobs and they'll all on him, I'll lead off the fight with Kyv Strike most of the times - since it's a 100% guaranteed backstab to land, usually 1 or 2 mobs will turn and start hitting on me since he hasn't built up aggro on them.  I've tested the same thing w/o using a disc and when I've whiffed on a backstab, the same mobs won't turn.  If the potential damage was the same as actual damage, this situation would have the mobs on me both times.  So either it's a combination of both or the potential damage for aggro theory doesn't fly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: With luclin mobs having crazy high AC, it negated the simple viewpoint I stated earlier in my post. I'm not sure about Discord mobs, or even some high-end PoP ones, but I've noticed max hits are few and far between now that I'm 64 and fighting mobs that double and triple me for 900's.<br />

<br />
More attack is always better, but probably not worth giving up too much tanking stats for, though I try to keep a good balance of both (60 attack of augments!).  Remember that DPS is a form of tanking.  If something dies faster, it doesn't need to be tanked as long.  Even on raids, a warrior's damage isn't insignificant (especially if not tanking).  In the healing intensive situations such as Ikkinz 1 group trials, DPS is arguably the best form of tanking.  I've got 90 second and 180 second PA kills with different groups.  The diference in tanking in those two situation is not remotely comparable even though my equipment is exactly the same.  The 90 second kill was a cakewalk.  The 180 second kill seemed like a small miracle.</div></div><hr />
