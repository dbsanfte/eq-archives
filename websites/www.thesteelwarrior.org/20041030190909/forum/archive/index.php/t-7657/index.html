please note i do not have a BoC...i was just messing around w/ magelo and i cant change it back cause there website doesnt load properly on the computer im useing. I use Sword of the Bloodsworn in primary.<br />
<br />
Would it be worth ditching the decent stats on my offhand weapon for either the sotbs or the willsapper. Im sure i will get one eventually since they are so easy to get when the rat is up....I just want to know if I should use it for aggro or just have it around when no slower is there. I have seen some tanks wield them full time and they seem to hold aggro very well. I hold aggro pretty well with the setup i have now and am not complaining at all....but ya can never have to much aggo =)<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />
<br />
(ps. i did search but didnt find what i was looking for)</div></div><hr />

But u have a BoC! JK. I'd stick with Bloodsworn for the better stats, both are probably close in aggro, and WS is better as a utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>HamkChai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JFYI, willsaper is primary only  :rolleyes: <br />
also, it is a piercing weapon, which means it will lower ur ATK on mainhand. <br />
<br />
anyhow it is a good aggro weapon for mid-level warriors. good utility value too.<br />
so if u trying to grab it, remember, fight vikini at where it spawns... i learnt this in the hard way  :)</div></div><hr />

argh forgot all about it being primary only...yea i had that rat gate on me once from the entrance where you first enter the tunnel....bad bad site. <br />
<br />
Guess I will pick one up and play around with it =) Thanks for info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i used it mainhand for a long time, its fine agro-wise. slows are nice. it really is best for utility, sword of the bloodsworn/chos is for everyone who wants cheap agro. yeah the rat fight is fun, i did fight him at the entrance.</div></div><hr />
