<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wondering if anyone knows if a weapon (copper hammer of striking for example) with a stun proc will still move a mob if the stun part of the proc is resisted.  <br />
<br />
We have a big problem with mobs moving around on raids in our guild and the guild leader thinks (just from watching the fight) it is from all the monks and rangers with CHoS and the force shock proc moving the mobs.  With all the other things going on at raids it is very hard to tell if this is the reason and I know the animations don't always follow the actual hits and procs very well.  This was happening lat night in BoT and I know the giants are imune to the stun component of the proc.  Is the knockback separate from the stun or does the stun have to take for the mob to move?<br />
<br />
Also, someone said blunt weapons move mobs more than slashing weapons.  This was the first I heard of this so is it true?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I looked for this in previous posts but I couldn't find anything on it.  Just wondering if anyone has done any testing on this and if there might be other factors like pets bashing that might be the real problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've also heard that blunt weapons create more push than slashing weapons which in turn create more push than piercing weapons. I'm not sure if it's true or not really. Part of where it may come from though is monks do seem to generate quite a bit of melee push (usually more than other melees). Monks obviously can only use blunt weapons. However, monks have higher dual wield / double attack skill caps and max them out quicker than any other class (monks max out dual wield at like level 35, hehe). <br />
<br />
I'll also include as a note that more attacks definetly causes more push (try a weighted axe then switch to dual wielding sub 20 delay weapons if you need to convince yourself).</div></div><hr />

Am thinking for reasons other than push though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does not have to take for the mob to move. In BoT, the stun component is always resisted when the proc lands, and yet the mob is pushbacked.</div></div><hr />

At most, it might push a mob back as much as a kick or a bash.  I think the difference between using fast 1h's to a 2h is more significant to pushback than having a 1foot pushback proc.<br />
<br />
On raids, the biggest thing you have ot be wary of is like paladin and other stuns.  Monks also have some kindof push back ability they can activate when they like.</div></div><hr />
