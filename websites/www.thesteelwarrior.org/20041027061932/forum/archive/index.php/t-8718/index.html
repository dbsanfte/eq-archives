I have a regular group of similar gear and level friends I play with and am in a very small family guild.  I'm looking for single groupable mobs or quests mostly, but open to two groupable mobs.<br />
<br />
Things I'm looking at doing are amy mask in CT, buying another steel ring, camping tear of rainmaker in BoT or buying bloodmetal (which would you rec?), doing the loyalist quest, and camping ornate legs in BoT (or buying them, I hear the drop rate in BoT is sad, is it better somewhere else pre-elem?).<br />
<br />
I do have a few LDoN augs, not listed, but am not a big LDoN'er.  I won't be doing enough LDoN to get Tak armor, at least not in the near future.  I'm looking at saving for an A2 or A3 aug, and that's going to take me a long time, but am open to other aug recommendations, but don't really see saving up for Tak armor.  If I'm still playing EQ by the time I have that many points I better be wearing elemental armor....<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Strength of the Elements quest for shoulders. Rather easy, I'm almost done. Just need the piece in The Hole. GotS also drops a nice earring too if you go to get the ore. He'll probably take a raid.<br />
<br />
Go with camping all the pieces you can, ornate is overpriced. I've never tried camping the tear but it's probably better than paying 30-50k for it.<br />
<br />
You have neck piece from Xana, could you possibly camp him for his hammer?<br />
<br />
Oh, ldon 10ac augs. 510 points in BB. Get em, love em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as Ornate legs go, I have never seen em drop there. Not saying they can't or don't, but have never seen them (maybe others can share their exp with legs in BoT).  I have seen 2 drop, including the ones i wear, in Tactics off Anival the Blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The legs drop off Gaukr, but they are super rare. I'd say 1 in 20 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1  in 20 for ornate legs off gaukr seems about right. I've killed him tons, and was beginning to believe they didn't drop. But then they did, and i lost the roll to an ele flagged pally. Grr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1  in 20 for ornate legs off gaukr seems about right. I've killed him tons, and was beginning to believe they didn't drop. But then they did, and i lost the roll to an ele flagged pally. Grr.<br />
<br />
I lost my roll to an enchanter but she kindly gave them to me after the roll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen the legs drop off Gaukr, but that was when playing my wiz, long time ago.  Will probably try to camp them a few times and then might buy them if I get bored of the camp.<br />

I'm thinking about the bracer in the hard LDoN's, forget the name.  What I'm wondering is, am I ready to tank hard LDoN's yet?  I usually play with a group of four, similar quality gear to mine (maybe a tad bit less), shaman, cleric, enchanter and me.  We can do normal LDoN fine, no problems really with pulls or dying, although we don't have a ton of time to spare usually.  I'm thinking if I add a bit more AC and HP's and the casters add a bit more FT we will be ready....  but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Oh, I have the 5AC aug from EF for my Xana neck, was only 150 points.  I'll look up the 10AC aug and see what slots it is for.  Considering how infrequently I do LDoN's I may be better off loading up on the 5AC augs, but I don't know how long I'll be playing this game so I'd hate to waste points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm thinking about the bracer in the hard LDoN's, forget the name.  Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is, am I ready to tank hard LDoN's yet? You need defensive aa's to tank 65 hard adv's. I never had agro on my druid doing hard adv's around 63-64 so I don't know how hard they hit and I usually group with my friend's time flagged guildies.<br />
<br />
I'll look up the 10AC aug and see what slots it is for. Same slots as 5ac augs.</div></div><hr />

Since you're playing with friends you could always give it a shot and see what happens. I tanked my first one with about your stats, and we won, but we had a bit more stacked group than it sounds like you do. Get some FT on your cleric friend, and make friends with a good monk to pull and some good dps and you should be able to do it. Stick to EC and EF at first too, they're generally easiest to single. Plus, the bracer you want drops from EF.<br />
<br />
Max hit on a warrior in hard ldon is 1018 or thereabouts, and they'll hit you 3-4x a round pretty commonly without defensive AA's or good AC, so you need wicked healing if they don't get slowed. Run DI, and have a HoT on for the pulls. Dispell pulls and EARLY slows are your friends too. Get some augs for your weapons ASAP too (yaks from lguk are a good fit imo) so you can get and hold aggro off those early slows more reliably.<br />
<br />
If you don't like a challenge, don't try until you're done with luclin hp and defensive AA, and your cleric has ft7 or so.<br />
<br />
Edit: I notice you said you don't have a lot of time to spare usually on normal LDoN's. If thats with your group of 4, you'll probably have the DPS for a hard with two others. If thats including 2 extra dps, you'll never kill enough in a hard unless you pick up some better DPS or start running a CoD pet. Once you get past the basics (staying alive) hard ldons are all about the dps, just because of the timer.</div></div><hr />
