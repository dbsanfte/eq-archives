This happened to us 3 weeks ago. Everything I've read and everyone I've talked to (not saying they were experts, that's why I am here) points to the Ancient Blade being an &quot;always drops&quot; item.<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The blade used to not drop every time, heck the blade used to be a pretty rare drop off of her back in the Kunark days when epics were new. Royal raids would go hours long killing the Queen two or three times hopin she'd drop that blade just once. The drop rate was increased as one of the &quot;make epics easier&quot; changes, Ive seen it drop pretty consistently since then, but I couldnt tell ya if its an &quot;always drop&quot; item. I wouldnt be suprised if it still had a small chance to not drop off a kill.</div></div><hr />

Most of these raids killed the Queen more than once.  Queen always droped the blade though I would not be surprised if it did not drop everytime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty strange though if it didnt now.</div></div><hr />
