<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thargorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have any experience completing Vxed or Tipt with a non-elemental geared level 70 warrior-tanked group? My standard 6 toon group is warrior, cleric, enchanter, druid, bard, and either a ranger or mage, all with close to 400AA except the mage. While we could try the hasted DW charmed pet method, I'd prefer to do it the old-fashioned way. What HP/AC would be needed?<br />

I 5-box, and I tried at 65 with my current gear, and while doable, it gets rough on the cleric's mana. Still doable if you had a cleric and slower that wasn't being botted.</div></div><hr />

Unless you just can't deal with runners I'd say finding an area in say Ruined City of the Dranik or anywhere else in OoW is a far better idea than tanking straight up in Vxed/Tipt.</div></div><hr />

I did it with a similar group to yours at 65 with 9300hp/ 1740 AC buffed without using a pet including Jhiru before they tuned him down. So that's the number I'll spit out. <br />
<br />
Looking through your magelo, I'd say you will be fine in there now if you guys play well together. At 70 with your current gear, if your group is similarly geared, you shouldn't have any problems.</div></div><hr />

We would be doing it mainly for progression, but it does bother me a little to use a strategy for beating the trials which probably wasn't intended and contributed to the drastic change in charm in OoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well.. I just tried tipt at level 69. My magelo's mostly up to date. I hadn't tried since finishing defensive aa or being level 65, plus a few gear upgrades. It still puts a royal beatdown on, but I'm certainly not impossible to keep up, even over 3 minute(!!!!) long fights. The cleric liked her CH, and we had no DPS without the pet, so when the pet broke and ended having to be put down,  things didn't go so well. <br />
<br />
Tanking mobs while the pet eviscerates them is obviously not much of an issue, but our group just wasn't really up to the challenge of actually managing the pet, and didn't have the dps to be effective without it.<br />
<br />
Most fights seemed to be 350-400 dps taken against me, undiscced with late chanter slows.</div></div><hr />

pretty sure that if charming wasnt intended in trials it would have been nerfed there. it really only adds an alternative for dps light or crappy tank groups. you can still complete them without charmed pets, but it takes better geared folks, and i do believe KT+ was intended for time+ geared players based on the loot quality that drops there. im guessing the charm nerf in oow is due to the charm farming of pop zones like bot where inconsiderate people with charmed pets pretty much ruined the zone for a lot of folks. ksing and training groups with charmed pets or just charming, buffing and equipping a mob, then parking it and zoning so a group gets to deal with an ubermob unexpectedly. picture wall of slaughter if folks could charm there. its already a shithole as far as campstealing, ksing, training, etc go, they really didnt need to add chamred pets there. plus with all the named spawning right out in the open a charmed pet would totally trivialize farming runes.</div></div><hr />

I'm not trying to harp on this point, but if KT+ were intended only for Time+ geared folks, and pet charming allows dps light or crappy tank groups to pass (i.e. folks who aren't Time+ geared), that seems a lot like an unintended loophole.<br />

I don't have OoW yet but I haven't read anything about buffs being stripped from a broken charm mob. This kind of griefing would still be possible in the new zones.<br />

Back to the original topic, I'll try trials with and without charm. Given that my group isn't elemental geared, it's likely that it'll be worth our time to do the trials several times for the potential drops.<br />

<br />
That being said, my group didn't use charm at first, then we began using a pet in tipt for the final sections just because it gets really old after doing it over and over and over trying to get the drops.<br />
<br />
For Tipt, better than a charmed pet is making good use of invis. You can get to the top by killing very few mobs if you leave the key on a corpse out front. I did it with a bazaar group in 45 minutes with only using a pet for the top most section and making good use of invis.</div></div><hr />

once inside KT, the dps is similar to vxed/tipt and tehre is no charming period. if you gimped your way into KT it doesnt really matter since you wont be able to tank anything tehre anyway. also the first 4 trials cant be charm gimped(at least ive never seen it done) so you either tanked them honestly or you got drug along by a friend which happens less than you think since it does require a well balanced group for most of the trials (ie cleric healer, GOOD tank, slower, snarer and dps and sometimes evac or a good pulling class). maybe soe was thinking of knights when they made stuff charmable. a knight cant go defensive or furious/fortitude so keeping one up for any lenght of time on teh boss mobs has got to be a bitch. the loot in KT is 135hp stuff, thats equal to elemental raid loot. you cant seriously believe that it was intended that i should get the same quality loot whether i go and play with 60 of my guildies or with just 6. it was intended for time+ geared people when GoD came out, since then nerfs, god aa, and god farming have made it more of a low elemental gear type zone. from raiding standpoint isnt it a little insane that 200+hp gear drops in the ikkinz trials and you dont even need to be in plane of time to kill the mobs that drop loot in ikkinz trials? i mean the increase in quality agasint the elemental loot you normally get is HUGE. im positive such a disparity in loot quality was NOT intended and was nerfed to what it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mashor Dabashor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have recently been farming trial 6 with my regular group for bracer drops and helping to flag guildmates for trial 6.  We never use charm pets.  Group consists of 70 warrior ( me ), 70 cleric, 70 bard, 70 shaman, 70 ranger, and 70 druid. The druid is the one we drop when we invite guildmates for flag.  Only the warrior, cleric and bard have any EP gear as the druid, ranger and shaman are boxed.  Cleric and shaman are enough to keep me healed for the one minute 30 seconds it takes us to kill the Archer.  First time we tried and won we were all 70 but didn't have an OoW spells yet.  Our healer did have all of their GoD heals though. Now that we are working with OoW buffs this is even easier.<br />
<br />
I have 2 pieces of elemental gear, but the rest has been gained through dilligent progression through LDoN, Ferubi, Vxed and farming Cragbeast Mother.  We were scared for the longest time of wasting our time on trying to win 6 with no charm pet.  Once we hit 70 we thought we'd try it out.  Well... I wish we'd of tried it long ago now because really it was a joke.  <br />
<br />
Moral of the story is, with proper progression Tipt is do-able for a group of 70's without charmed pet DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The pet is simply to cut down on the time spent doing the trials. Doesn't really make them easier imo due to the pet breaking at all the wrong moments. A full group of 65s with decent gear and AAs can do it, but when you have to do it over and over and over and over cutting an hour or so off the time is nice. <br />
<br />
Tipt never bothered me all that much it's a fun trial but vxed used to be a total pain killing 100 mobs. Even with 50 it can get quite boring. If you're just doing it for yourself do it however you feel comfortable. The pet isn't going to make or break you. Just remember God &gt; oow. The only zone in oow that compares with God mobs is Mpg and beyond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">An occasional pet break or two is definitely worth cutting 75% off the time spent fighting anything, especially Jihru.<br />
<br />
Do you think people just charm stuff for fun even though there is no apparent advantage gained by it?<br />
<br />
You don't have to use charm but it'd be pretty stupid to not charm if you have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kukoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jhiru is the only hard part about tipt.  Vxed the only hard part is splitting at the top.  I have done both many times at levels 65-70 and it is the same as it was before.  Jhiru still pumps out dps, luckily he won't be hasted when ya run into him :)</div></div><hr />
