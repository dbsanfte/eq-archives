<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my and a few others decided to check out this new Hate. <br />
<br />
<br />
We zone up and nothing attacks us.  sigh oh well guess this is for the better. then I start to look around. The Hate I remember was dark with dark colors and had a Brothers Grimm sort of thing going. It had that Aura about it that realy bad things where going to happen. This zone is all Pretty Pastel Colors. makes you feal like your stroling through Freeport and Qeynos.<br />
<br />
Then I see a mob like 20 feet from me just standing there. what happen to the half zone agro radius they use to have?<br />
<br />
so we casual walk around pulling and killing stuff for like 20-30 minutes when we decide to head back and go look for Maestro. WTF stuff at the zone in repoped. yes stuff that droped armor repoped. OK was this a bug or is the New Hate on a 30min repop timer now?<br />
<br />
sigh &quot;It all started with Lore Pending&quot; things just went downhill from there&quot; I thought to myself. Pastel colors /shakes his head saddly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol.<br />
<br />
I think the new zone is fun, the encounters are alot more challenging that previously. Alot of low guilds will probably be upset ;/<br />
<br />
This zone is all Pretty Pastel Colors. makes you feal like your stroling through Freeport and Qeynos.<br />
<br />
lol, I love you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They beefed up Maestro and Inny enough to make up for how much easier the zone itself has become.  I can not speak about Inny other than to say he is supposed to be 4x harder than AoW.  Maestro seems to be about 2x AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ladiiesman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yup hate is on a much faster repop now<br />
<br />
and the only time i was there there were a few groups of us and we wiped the first time on maestro so bad we didnt even try again.<br />
<br />
I got all buffed up, he quadded me for 1050, kicked me once and i was down.  ouch.<br />
<br />
i was one of the last ones to go down, i watched him tear the raid to pieces in about 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">...so they've made the warrior epic ... harder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, the epic is not harder at all.  Hand of the Maestro spawns in the front of the building with maestro in it.  Weak hitter, 175pt lifetap proc I think.  Hardest thing about him is his annoyingly small hitbox.  You don't have to deal with the actual Maestro at all to get the epic piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nah the Hand you need drops off the hand of maestro. he is there before the maestro. we pulled him solo and killed him. only hits for like 400. so isnt to much of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ah sweet, thanks.</div></div><hr />
