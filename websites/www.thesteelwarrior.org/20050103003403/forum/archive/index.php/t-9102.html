<br />
i would think it HAS to be in MPG from the descriptions, possessed being, in a labrynth.  i just dont' understand how we are suppose to fight it.<br />
<br />
My guess was is this mob was like some of the SK epic mobs where they wouldn't fight you unless you were at that point of the epic.  <br />
<br />
I guess it is possible that it is broke, but i hate to speculate that everytime we get to a point in this quest and it isn't figured out right away we start crying it is broken.  <br />
<br />
Though it is frusterating not being able to continue on w/ the quest b/c we can't figure this part out &gt;,&lt;<br />

The last two don't work. Tried it, he was basically unattackable.<br />
The second one doesn't seem right, it would require a nodrop item imo to trigger him in an &quot;epic&quot; quest such as this. Handing in epic is frisky, haven't tried that, haven't tried handing him some random item though, either to see if he eats it or not. Next time i'm clearing around him and he doesn't eat random items, I'll try epic 1.5 turnin.</div></div><hr />

Anyone do much killing in the north part of the zone? Seems most people shy away from there so there could be unfound ground spawn items drops or NPC's.<br />

I'd say someone try to find an enemy that raises your dragorn faction, get it to ally (con by checking these npc's that are kos but you cannot attack) and hopefully we'll have some more insight as to what to do.</div></div><hr />

Lore is &quot;Drema's Soul encased in a delicate prison&quot;.  One of the soulstone shards used to make it, I believe, is a groundspawn in Dranik's.  This got added to Lucy at about the same time that Endo was finishing his epic 1.5, and was added by his guildmate much the same as the other epic bits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think we should concentrate on figuring out the Possessed Brute at this point. Possible quests given by the factioned Dragorns sound like a good place to start looking. I'm almots ally now, once I am I'll start talking to them. Now that I'm epic'd with 1.5 I may get a different response from one of them than other ally people would get. One of them may tie into the Possessed Brute.</div></div><hr />

 Korbuk Brimblade says 'This one is of da completed sword. It's not too shabby, but it's not great either. It looks like there will be more dat needs to be done than just what we have so far. In any case, I know how to get da sword put back together. It'll involve a trip to see my brother, [Krekk].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'krekk'<br />
<br />
 Korbuk Brimblade says 'He's become one of da finest sword makers I've ever known. He'll know just how to put da hilt and da sword together to make a finely balanced weapon. He had come with me to this place, but went ahead to find new and precious metals he could use to make new blades. I think he mentioned visiting a ruined city somewhere, but I'm not certain.'<br />
<br />
You tell your raid, 'okay handing in'<br />
<br />
 Krekk Brimblade says 'You've been working very closely with my brother, I see. No doubt he wants my help to finish da sword for you. I'll put da sword together, you can rest assured of that. But I won't be giving it back to you. Oh no, I think I'll keep it for myself. I'll be da one to continue da Brimblade legacy and strike fear into da hearts of men! Not him!'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
Krekk Brimblade says 'You are too weak for me! Die now by my hand!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Korbuk Brimblade'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade looks saddened. 'Dat sword, there's something wrong with it. Was it my brother? This is terrible news. I had no idea he had been so corrupted by this place. I had no idea he'd turn into a monster and try to steal away dat which we have been charged to protect! Luckily you were able to stop him and recover da sword. You should keep it in your possession. I have a feeling you're da [one] I've been waiting for.<br />
<br />
You have gained an ability point!  You now have 6 ability points.<br />
<br />
You say, 'one'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Only da one who had da power to combine da sword could have come so far. You have it in you to make dat sword great! Right now, its power is minor. With some time and effort, you might be able to bring it into da light and make it da most powerful sword ever known! When I touched da sword, I sensed a [presence] within it.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'presence'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I can't explain it really. It's as if da sword was part of a being at one time. Perhaps da sword was a being but was changed into a sword by some terrible means. All I know is dat it keeps calling to me, leading me... and you... to da next step of da puzzle. Right now it's telling me dat da next step of da puzzle resides in da labryinth. We've already been there, I wonder what more we could find from [going back].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'going back'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Well, if you want to continue, you'll go back. Da vision I had showed a beast possessed by an evil spirit. It almost seemed like dat spirit was part of da presence dat I've felt from da sword. You should find da beast and destroy it, then see if you can recapture whatever spirit is trapped in its body.'</div></div><hr />

Perhapes it's a phrase you say to the possesed brute.. Maybe something about Krekks Presence or Something.. The Effect on the Sword is Krekks Presence . So in some way it seems by reading the lore and the effect on the Sword .. we are in effect trying to release Krekks Soul.  I don't know.. maybe im just grasping at straws.</div></div><hr />

That sort of implies that we need to return to an area where we allready did part of the quest. Apparently it is a labyrinth. Of the zones where parts of the quest have allready unfolded that might qualify, we have (a) Vexd [the blackfall borer beast]; (b) Nobles [groundspawn]; and (c) Proving grounds [groundspawn]. It seems to me that the zone which best meets the criteria of having us &quot;go back&quot; is Vexd. And it did have a beast we had to kill, which the other two did not. Perhaps someone who is up to this point in the quest could go and check out Vexd, and see if the Nihil gives out a new special instance?<br />

The zone that most closely resembles a labyrinth is Muramite Proving Grounds. And it also happens to have a &quot;possessed&quot; monster, the Possessed Brute. I'm 100% positive this is our next step, so I think we should concentrate on how to engage this beast instead of more wild speculation about radical possibilities. Just my opinion tho, as I think his text is fairly clear about the next step.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spirit of Garudon says,<br />
<br />
'Traveler, you must help me. I have been tortured in this city for generations. The mark of the Kylong adorns the walls of the theater that houses my remains. These markings are preventing me from passing into the theater and rejoining with my body so that I may pass on in peace. If you can reclaim four samples and return them to me, it may be enough to draw power from. With this power I will pass into the theater and rejoin my body and rest in peace. You must do this for me, the torture of eternal capture is more than I can bear.'<br />
<br />
It's in a zone previously visited for 1.5 and has, well, more of a response than the possessed brute. Has anyone tried killing this recently? Maybe the dragon form will drop a new piece for our quest.</div></div><hr />

I think is the key phrase, we need something to catch the spirit in befroe we kill him. Find the right container and we may be able to start the fight with it as well.</div></div><hr />

Possessed Brute is unattackable, so nobody has been able to kill him.<br />
<br />
Regarding Sanctus Seru, Korbuk didn't send us there, the dwarf did.  The only places he sent us to that fits the description of a labrynth is something he referred to previously as a labrynth.  The next step HAS to be in MPG.<br />
<br />
It may not have anything to do with possessed brute, though...what's the verdict from people who tried turning in that ring to either the brute or korbuk?</div></div><hr />

It can't be riftseekers we never went there.  it can't be any other zone than a zone we already went to.  You dont' have to go through sanctum to get to ssru.  <br />
<br />
It has to be the possessed brute.  now how to make him fight you i dont' know but people should stop posting i went to this zone or that zone.  <br />
<br />
probably it is broke or something stupid like that. or it works just fine, but as far as i can read there are no clues hinting at some step we must complete before trying to release his spirit<br />

I think it CAN be Seru .... the guy only says we have been there..... it doesn't say HE had allready sent us there.  We had to go to ss to buy the gemmold, so we HAVE been there.   <br />
<br />
The labrynth statement DEFENITELY is the key as there are very few zones with a labrynth(or something that can be viewd as such) in it.   Factor in that we have to have been there while doing 1.5 ... and we are left with very few possabilites.  To me SS is still viable, and I would be interested to see if we can find anythng there.   <br />
<br />
Fact is we have to keep our options open right now since none of us know for sure.  It likely is teh brute IMO .. but if it isn't working, time to start looking at other areas that match the description.</div></div><hr />

I was able to fight the vampyre's right next to him without him assisting, he &quot;did&quot; assist when I pulled a vampyre directly through him.

Handing his epic (ballsy!)<br />
Handing &quot;Ring of Possession&quot; and &quot;Words of Possession&quot;<br />
Hailing him.<br />
Attacking him.<br />

Without success. Things I would like to see attempted; Dispelling him, or attempting to charm him, to see if it starts some kind of script.<br />

Only thing that hasn't been addressed from this post and others is what if the mob is Faction based.  This is highly possible since SOE like to mess with everyone's MINDS with stuff like Faction and Riddles.  <br />

I have seen a couple of new factions in OOW so far:<br />

        A.  Dragorn Based<br />
        B.  GoD type mobs<br />

seems that these are the 2 main types of faction in OOW.  Once I get to this point I will be trying to do faction if that does matter.  <br />

(PB is doable easily with 2 groups, but can be done with one); I was able to turn in the page that he drops to brimblade in dranik scar, I then went to the ... WAYYYY out location in IceClad Ocean to talk to the gnome... of course he states that he want a pestle.  You can find it at the location mentioned above... then run ALL the way back to him... then hand him pestle and he give you text with [map] in it.. you say...<br />
<br />
&quot;what map&quot;<br />
<br />
he gives you the map and then tells you to hold on to it tight (it works only at night according to the text.  <br />
<br />
I had about 18 guildies with me for the fight with the Luarek person that is supposed to spawn ... to get TO him you hold the map on your cursor during the night time hours and you will get a yellow message stating the direction to run and locate him (aka spawn him).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I was unable to get him to spawn even though i STOOD directly over his spawn point... it may be bugged currently.  <br />
<br />
Another point is that the map is NO RENT... This means if you log off you must... chug a chug to the pestle spawn ... loot the bag run to him .. hand in ... get new map..<br />
<br />
Hope this helps... i am stuck on this part of the Epic 2.0 part the quest currently<br />

I too had two groups waiting a few hours, I have submitted a bugreport as well as a petition regarding this matter.<br />
<br />
Also, the Pestle is like the Pages/Cover. If you log off, You will still get the Energy Receptor apon login and hailing Korbuk, same with Map and Fazzle. Tried &quot;Map&quot;, map, still directed me to same bugged spot (Below Kael, to the left of Icefang). Tried with a normal hail, still lead me to the bugged spot.<br />

<br />
As for map, once you have done the pestle part, you only need to go back to Fazzle and say, &quot;what map&quot; and you will get a new one, its just a pain in the butt run all the way to him, with no boat and translocator dropping you on dock :/<br />

So hopefully they fix this spawn soon as it seems to be a hold up for a few of us.<br />

All too easy. For you, I mean. You did well. I'm..I'm getting unclear visions fromt his essence. I can't seem to understand what it's trying to tell me. This essence is impure and needs to be purified. I happen to know of a [purification expert] dat can help us clear this mystery up. <br />
<br />
You're going to need to travel to da frozen underbelly of Norrath to find a gnome I've not seen in a long time. I coudln't begin to tell you where to find him, but you might try da frozen ocean as a starting point. If you can't find him, you may be able to find someone else who knows where he is.<br />

so far 1.5 -&gt; 2.0 has been very annoying i have done 3 steps and 2 of the 3 have been broken.  The only thing that worked for me is the pestal, but i hear other warriors having problems w/ the pestal not respawning. <br />

very annoying for progression on these, though i am sure soon we will run into parts that we will need full guild support to do fights, since 2.0 is suppose to be for top end players only.  I am just waiting to see these encounters b/c everythig so far i have done has been one groupable<br />

<br />
First time he took off was at 90%, maybe hes supposed to say oh no pls dont hurt me any more like the ranger epic dudes and give a flag or something at that point which hes not doing.<br />
<br />
The spot the map lead me to was just a small distance NE of the ramp going down to Kael, Larnik spawned somewhere (not where map took me to, but he did spawn in the zone somewhere) and ran towards kael. I just happened to see him while I was following the map directions after about 3min<br />
<br />
edit went back to korbuk and tried larnik the recluse and fazzle keywords to make sure I didnt get an invis flag of some sort, turned in Muddled Rage again also incase it was ninja purified, nothing. Also of note on larnik I turned in the muddled rage after he lost agro and ran at 90% and he just gave it back with the normal 'I dont need this item Paen, you can have it back' message<br />

Going to go try and spawn him again and hit the 'great purification' hotkey more often to see if I can kill him</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been here for 3 in-game nights now trying to spawn him again and every time I get to where the map takes me it bugs out and says it took me to the wrong location. Maybe you can only spawn him once per server and I screwed up my chance when I did spawn him  :(<br />

Map has taken me to about 6 different places now also which is weird, never taken me anywhere south of the kael ramp tho its always been northern or just east of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Finish up Epic 1.5, Hail Brimblade in DS, you receive 5 AAXP.  <br />
<br />
2) Then follow the new text the last of which mentions killing the possessed... which is Possessed Brute in Muramite Proving Grounds, when he is killed you loot the Krejinok's Muddled Rage (Magic Item, Lore Item, No drop), return to Brimblade and turn it in get &quot;You have gained Experience&quot; and the text regarding a contact in Iceclad.<br />
<br />
3) You the then head to Fazzle Thumpkin at 4200,  neg 20000 in  Iceclad (this island is in the FAR upper right corner of zone and even SOE'd is a LONG run across the water.), he then tells you of needing a pestle to continue. (This can be obtained next to a statue at 1068, 5220).  You then return to him .. give him pestle you get experience then he puts [map] in text... you say &quot;what map&quot;, he then gives you - Fazzle's Map of East Wastes (NO RENT).. so you log and you are hoofing it again for a map to try and spawn next step. - NOTE: You do NOT have to regather pestle just hail Fazzle again and say &quot;what map&quot; to obtain another NO RENT map.<br />
<br />
4) At this point, with Fazzle's Map of East Wastes on cursor and the EQ time between 7PM and 6AM... you will get a Yellow blurb with the direction to go and spawn Larnik the Recluse. .. it is at this point i am stuck... I cannot get him to spawn and have tried several times.<br />

My poor, poor pestle. Where have you gone? I thought I'd lost it around here somewhere, but maybe I left it near one of those statues during my surveying of the islands. Drat and double drat! Where did I leave you? Woe...'<br />
<br />
4 - Find frozen pestle at pos 1068 pos 5225 in iceclad<br />
<br />
5 - Give frozen pestle to Fazzle Thumpkin get no rent map. You can hail him again and again and say &quot;what map&quot; to get the map for later tries.<br />
<br />
6 - Go to EW with the map. Use the map to guide you to a spot. 8pm game the map starts working. Hold it on your cursor. Larnik the Recluse spawns and starts a run to Kael. Hail him as he runs.<br />
<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'Ahh! I've been found out! Who are you and where did you come from? How did you find me? It was that bothersome Fazzle, wasn't it? I knew he couldn't be trusted with the map! I knew it! Leave me alone, I don't want to be bothered! Away, away!'<br />
You say, korbuk sent me. At this point he stops<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'What? What did you say? Who sent you? Korbuk sent you? That's impossible. I told him to be gone long ago. I told him never to speak of me or send anyone my way ever again! That fool! Why would he send you here?'<br />
You say, 'great purification'<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'Raaaa! I'm out of that business! I'll never help him or anyone else purify another thing so long as I live! Get away from me!'<br />
Larnik the Recluse says 'I'll not be hunted any more! Begone with you!'<br />
Larnik the Recluse tries to punch YOU, but misses!<br />
Larnik the Recluse punches YOU for 1630 points of damage.<br />
kill Larnik the Recluse, he drops a locked chest<br />
<br />
7 - Give locked chest to Korbuk he turns it into a container and returns it to you. Telling you to use it to combine the Kertjnok's Muddled Rage in it.<br />
<br />
8 - Combine Kertjnok's Muddled Rage in Korbuk's returned container to get Kreljnok's Focused Rage (no drop potion)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
then it seems the quest is bugged after that, because if you try to turn in the new item, he doesnt take it saying you need to turn in all quest items to complete the quest, and he doesnt give you any new information on going further with the quest... Stuck</div></div><hr />

totally agree, fairly new to these boards and liking it so far. But for someone like me who enjoys reading the progression as this quest is solved it is kind of frustrating to see so many posts that were answered 2 or 3 pages back and in some cases by the developers even.... been said a million times and will continue to be said long after im gone i think but ... read before you post. Keep up the good work guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alkorin</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EW was taken down for a patch last night/this morning... went to get the map (and found the pestle up on the way, I didn't need it) and noticed that it wasn't giving me any message in EW now.  I'm guessing that this means the gnome is actually down?  Can anyone else confirm that the map doesn't say anything when the mob isn't actually up now?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Never mind, the map started to lead me places shortly after I posted (around 7 PM game time).  I spawned him and died at 10% with me and a cleric.  =/  Afterwards, I get &quot;The map doesn't appear to be leading you anywhere&quot;.<br />
<br />
My experience with this guy:  Hits approximately 2k max, but has low ATK.  He has a 4k dd + stun proc, which seems to happen at the worst moments (of course).  I don't know the resists on it but it sounds like it would be a cold resist.  I took half or less than half damage a few times during the fight.  The dd+stun only hit me so I can confirm that it is not an AE of any sort.  The cleric was untouched during the entire fight except, of course, when I died.<br />
<br />
Another edit:  The map stopped working at 7 AM game time.  So it appears the map only works from 7PM to 7AM.  After I spawned him once today, the cycle of the map leading to the wrong place began again -- so I guess the zone being taken down yesterday didn't fix this.</div></div><hr />

Just tried it, he talks about the devourer still with that key phrase, tried handing him epic with rage and still said turn in all items, epic alone and rage alone give same message. 'Kit' is the last keyword he will respond to.</div></div><hr />

This step still bugged for me and another warrior on my server. The map leads me to a spot near the Kael ramp, but then never gives me anything other than directions to move. I've nailed it down to a specific spot, but no mater how small of a movement I make I continue to get the &quot;directly behind&quot; or &quot;straight ahead&quot; messages. This is starting to get silly... didn't we JUST have a patch to fix this very issue as well as the pestle?</div></div><hr />

heh, well some of us aren't far from being in anguish and at the speed they seem to be going fixing this stuff it would be nice to have it fixed.<br />
<br />
and it is even more annoying if you finished epic 1.5 and had to wait for them to fix the possessed brute for a week or so and then had to wait for the EW part.  and wait for the turn in to get fixed..it just gets old. i don't think it is much to expect these quests be working properly before the expansion goes live. especially since they were a big selling point of the expansion.<br />

<br />
Right like i said i am one of those that are close to anguish as i am sure others are.  I guesstimate 2 weeks or less before we are in anguish.  We have beaten 3 trials, 1 on our first attempt and 2 on our 2nd attempt. 3 more to go and it would be nice if this quest would work.  Regardless if people aren't in there for months if they are not proactive in making sure things are working than once you finally get into anguish then you get to wait for them to fix that part too.<br />
<br />
Point is the quest should not be bugged every step of the way. i really don't think it is asking to much for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Korbuk tells you to find a possessed brute for some reason. Go to Muramite Proving grounds, download a map you lazy fucks, kill him, loot his item. Something to do with rage. Turn into Korbuk. <br />
<br />
Korbuk now tells you to find a gnome. <br />
<br />
All too easy. For you, I mean. You did well. I'm..I'm getting unclear visions fromt his essence. I can't seem to understand what it's trying to tell me. This essence is impure and needs to be purified. I happen to know of a [purification expert] dat can help us clear this mystery up. <br />
<br />
You're going to need to travel to da frozen underbelly of Norrath to find a gnome I've not seen in a long time. I coudln't begin to tell you where to find him, but you might try da frozen ocean as a starting point. If you can't find him, you may be able to find someone else who knows where he is.<br />
<br />
Yes this is live...<br />
<br />
<br />
He tells you to find a gnome name is Fazzle Thumpkin in Iceclad Ocean or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fri Oct 01 22:11:47 2004] Fazzle Thumpkin says 'Damnable interruptions! Can't you see I'm looking for my pestle?! I lost that blasted thing months ago and haven't been able to find it! What will I do without my pestle?! My poor, poor pestle. Where have you gone? I thought I'd lost it around here somewhere, but maybe I left it near one of those statues during my surveying of the islands. Drat and double drat! Where did I leave you? Woe...'<br />
<br />
checking statues for his pestle now, not sure if he is for us or not he seems to be a surveyor not a purification expert.<br />
<br />
frozen pestle found at pos 1068 pos 5225 in iceclad, checking to see if this is us..<br />
<br />
the map so far is a wild guess chase i went to the location with the map he gave me and nothing happening yet.<br />
<br />
Ok you run back to gnome he gives you a no rent map which he says to run to ew with to find a special location.<br />
<br />
<br />
find pestle yadda yadda yadda he gives you a map used to find another dude in EW with (probably bugged atm).<br />
<br />
Find guy in EW, hail him do whatever you need to do and he'll end up attacking you. Dont be a pussy like dima and die to him. Kill him loot what he drops (a locked chest). You then turn the chest in to Korbuk. He turns it into a container. Put the piece from Possessed brute in it and hit combine and you get Kreljnok's Focused Rage. <br />
<br />
Hail or Turn into Korbuk (i dont know) and he tells you that he needs something from anguish. he doesnt know what it is, what it looks like, what has it, or any hints as to what it is but it drops in Anguish. <br />
<br />

<br />
Korbuk did sent me to Anguish, so there should happen something<br />
<br />
Well. Anguish. There are alot non-aggro NPC's (all Level 70)<br />
<br />
I did hail all of them. Not even one did responce.<br />
<br />
And we moved full thru Anguish (reached the other End = locked Seal)<br />
<br />
So maybe this Part isn't live yet...<br />
<br />
Something to the Gnome in East Wastes:<br />
<br />
He is hell fast (Run Speed 4??), i could get him with Run Speed 5.<br />
<br />
And as soon you say the Keyphrases, you have Aggro. And you don't loose it.<br />
<br />
I did him with one cleric and one Necro. Necro killed the Gnome in Fact. I did only turn circles around Cleric...<br />
<br />
Of course you can fight him the normal Way, but than you need a normal Group Setup, i mean Slower, some (or alot) Heal Power and such. And since the Gnome is either hard to find, you may have Problems to get those People to EW, waiting...</div></div><hr />

As expected they did insane kneejerk reactions to players complaining about the bosses being too easy.  I hope some of you are still eating your foot.  Like Sony's history has ever proven different.<br />
<br />
Harrier - AE every 25 seconds 3k hatelist, random spawns, bugged weakening triggers with said spawns (anyone that's done it knows what I'm talking about).<br />
<br />
Ture - Multiple AE's, which includes Wanton Destruction every 6 seconds, compiled with multiple dispell and damage AE's (these aren't too bad, it's WD that's the killer).<br />
<br />
These are just the first two bosses, only one that seems remotely doable is the Warden and he's the third one in.  But there's a couple bugs involving that encounter as well.  <br />
<br />
Probably need to fix pulling the Archmagus through the sealed door too!  You can do alot of fun things with that tid bit, given a little imagination.  All of this of course is still compounded by the buggy pathing in some areas, mobs that warp and bring buddies, as well as the summoning and attacking the last person to zone in when they get within proximity (this is a slight annoyance, but how the hell was that pulled off?).<br />
<br />
In closing, don't expect any new info on epic 2.0s until the announcement that these were tuned for lvl75.  Silly us.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  Oh and I think I'm going to bind on the IC dock, and gate back from Fazzle's place.  That run even with FOE is less than fun!  Or bind in POK and use GD book.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
