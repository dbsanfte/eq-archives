<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started playing again after a long break and have been trying to finish up my levels.  Im 64 atm, about 6% into the level.  I have tanked in BoT before, but my HPs and skills are subpar compared to other tanks with mostly defensive AA's.  I have also found that exp dried up a bit in PoV groups once I dinged 64.<br />
<br />
My question is should I just bare through 64 and try to get 65 first in BoT.  Or should I spend some time now to gain some AA's in PoV so I can become a better tank in BoT later?  I dont want to make a bad name for myself and be known as a paper tank.  I have successfully done names in BoT before but my last few trips ended up with me dying.  Does exp come faster at 65 in BoT, 64 in PoV, or 65 in PoV?  Sorry for all the questions.</div></div><hr />

So if you can get into a cave group, grind out 65 and then get your HP AA's then your defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">get 65..and if you're Drunder, fOrtress of Zek flagged go there instead and get some aa's . :D</div></div><hr />

after getting 20 AA i wished i had got 65 first...<br />
<br />
Caves in PoV are as good as BoT at 64<br />
I Expd in both and got about 1% exp per 2 mobs from 64-65.<br />
A good DPS BoT group or A Good balanced IC PoV group would make your bar actually move pretty quick.<br />
The WW and EW camps in PoV give less exp and you have to contend with the Bards swarm kiting.<br />
EXP at 65 hasnt changed much for me in either zones...now all i have to worry about is AA...much easier to get AA<br />
I found that PoV groups LOVED a 64 tank while BoT pick up groups usually took the 65 tank lfg.<br />
Get 65 however you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will do just fine in BoT. Get 65 and go cause trouble!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get 65 however you can.  If you do pick up groups alot, people are more inclined to take the 65 than a 64.  Take this from someone who took her sweet time getting to 65... (I spent the better part of a year at 60 doing nothing but aa's, wishing I had gotten 65 instead.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If i got a good group, i get zero chance for a breather... chain pull bonanza. If i got a poor group, kills will drag on and slow exp... make me want to be elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I can't win either way. :/<br />
<br />
The Armorer and Supplier circuit in PoTactics is awesome though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try for either. BoT is far better for XP imo. Your chanes of getting a group in PoV may be a little better.</div></div><hr />

   You will be fine in BOT with that armor my friend.  You have the same amount of HP that I have and better AC than me and I have no problems.  The only problems I have are with the named and some kreigors (hate those bastards).  Here is my magelo so can judge for yourself.<br />

Oh you are no paper tank my friend I should know I am a papertank.  I will never break 7k hps buffed even with ND3</div></div><hr />

Get a FE group in BoT. None of the mobs there and you should rocket to 65. Besides a lot of good clerics pass through BoT, find one and it wont matter much how many HPs/AAs you got.<br />
