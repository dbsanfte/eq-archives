<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up one of these the other day, Its pretty good dps, And decent agro with call of fire proc added to it. I went right away after getting this and started grinding out Guk for Anger 3..I have noticed the delay of 22 though im thinking that its not worth my time to anger 3 it and try to use it to Tank high end mobs with it due to the Riposte factor. My Ac tops just over 2100 raid buffed. Anyone else tried to use on of these to tank with. (imo) after thinking for a while it may not be worth the points to anger 3 it if im going to get eaten alive from Riposte. Any thoughts from someone else that uses it ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) It has less HP than a two one hander combo, it has less AC than a two one hander combo<br />
<br />
2) it has less HP and AC than a one hander plus + shield combo<br />
<br />
3) potentially less aggro than one handers with anger 3<br />
<br />
imo, two handers are not good weapons to tank with..SOE needs to totally rethink the two hander atm for warriors imo..I would just use DBOTW + Shield if you have that combo to tank...use two hander for dps..if it has decent aggro..maybe for groups too.<br />
<br />
But after looking at your magelo, I noticed that you didnt have any one handers(or they are at least not shown) So I would anger 3 the SJAoV..until you got some.<br />
<br />
O btw, I think your SEWS might actually have better dps b/c of the damage bonus..but dont quote me on that pls!!! :P  I would still use the SJAOV for tanking though b/c its quicker and would pick up aggro faster and maybe proc more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's our best DPS 2Her along with Great Maul of Mighty, but has less aggro (I put it along with obsidian greatblade or Votal's Ornate Blade) and the gard3 proc won't help that much to reduce the domage from ripost per minute you will eat with a 22DL weapon. Actually its aggro should less than SEWS (weaker version of rune3 and a poor DB that gimp is DPS aggro).<br />
but for now, this weapon, with A3 and Call of Fire should be better aggro than DBotW (+A3 +Call of Fire) and a shield (FB is shit aggro), because even if the DB is almost identical, and the proc's hate far from each other, the ratio difference is enougth at 130%  haste to draw more aggro.<br />
<br />
So my opinion is this weapon should be focused on DPS not on aggro because its 22DL make it as deadly as DW combo (expect around 64 swing per minute with it, and 65 swing per minute with DBotW and EoE) but for far less aggro (aroung 80% of the DBotW+EoE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure its the best DPS two hander? I would like to see some parses, I could easily see that getting low 80-90dmg hits.  It has no damage bonus what so ever, just b/c it has 44dmg and 22dly doesnt mean a thing...thats like saying the Ornate greatblade from POFire was the best dpsing two hander during POP..when of course it wasnt b/c it avged 80dmg hits a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on the 2 hander.  Blade of War was godly when we were getting them during the early elementals and well into plane of time.  They did the blade of war nearly perfect really.  If they have a BoW clone in Tacvi, suped up to be current and stuff id definitely wield a 2 hander again.</div></div><hr />

Personally i'd use that as a dps weapon. High atk and offensive aa's DPS is pretty huge on it.</div></div><hr />

With good attack, actually the ornate greatblade did very very good DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting, thanks for that info...*wishes his attack didnt suck* =/  Btw do any of you have opinions on wether the HP/AC of a two hander is fine as is..or SOE should up it and try to match same hp/ac as a one hander combo?</div></div><hr />

because 70% of aggro is dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have way too much faith in Damage Bonus.  The difference in DPS between the best 2H damage bonus (damage 35 delay 28) and Jade Axe (damage 14 delay 22) is (35/2.8 - 14/2.2) = 6.14 DPS.  We'll be generous to say you never missed and you always hit at least twice per round, then that's 12.28 DPS there.  When people can pull 200 DPS with ease, the damage lost due to damage bonus accounts for barely 5% of the total damage.  <br />
<br />
As for tanking with 2Hander, I have tanked with Vanazir for the longest time.  Yes it's no DBoW but a good 2H with a good proc is quite serviceable, and usually you get okay DPS out of it with an added bonus of not having to worry about ripostes.  Now, I don't think Jade Axe would be good for tanking due to not having a good proc but it's certainly a good DPS weapon.  Like Aspit says most of aggro is DPS, and the game certainly favors DPS on 2H more.  A Great Maul of the Mighty can occasionally pull aggro off DBoW users in yard trash clearing and ratio is the only possible explanation for this to happen.  <br />
<br />
You don't need crazy attack buffs for a weapon with a ratio of 2 to beat a weapon with a ratio of 1.5.  The only difference at most is 12.28 DPS between any 2Hander to a typical delay ~20 2hander in terms of damage bonus.  Having good attack just makes the better ratio weapon that much better.</div></div><hr />

If you want to test this, tank one of the twins in uqua with an ae blocker, then without.  The aggro difference in 500ish attack is huge.  I didnt used to pick up a blocker, but i do now based on the difference in pure aggro, reduces risk on these 2 fags immensly</div></div><hr />

Meh, I doubt this, since Brodda parses showed pretty conclusively that aggro is dependent on potential damage, not actually damage.<br />
<br />
A swing is the same aggro regardless of how much damage it deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if atk matters on aggro it'd be very inconceivable for anyone to hold aggro on Primal Arachnid due to Aura of Fatigue.  I've never noticed any difficulty in holding aggro on Primal Arachnid compare to any other uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i remember the parse but it was with different weapons but same attack i think<br />
<br />
so what that outher guy is insinuating i think is ,, attack is a part or the tottal potential dps formula,,<br />
<br />
as i would imagiane ther are outher influencing variablees that all contribute to the final dps/potental aggro generation calculation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You pretty much hit for min damage under the effect of Aura of Fatigue.  There isn't even enough attack to let the full -1000 attack part of Aura of Fatigue to take place (you end up with about 600ish which is attack that comes from weapon skill + offense).  And even then, there's no noticeable difference in aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The parses we have so far from this board are pretty conclusive. ATK had no bearing at all on agro. This is easily observable on similarly weaponed warriors with vastly different ATK ratings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian Silverthorn</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One possible reason your aggro seems bad in uqua when under effects of the AE is the lowered Dex which will effect your proc rate.<br />
The actual aggro per swing does not vary from 1 attack to 2700 attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lil up date here on it, I went ahead and put anger 3 on it to check to see if it would atleast hold up when im needed to step up or something, Glad we can remove augs ill continue to hold my breath for a HoeP.</div></div><hr />
