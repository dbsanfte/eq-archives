<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm back, been off the boards a couple days, but I had to relate how proud I was of my guild last night. My wife and I logged in and I started my usual nightly, &quot;who wants to group with Deeliah and I and go somewhere strange?&quot; routine. I got a couple of responses (one from the guild leader) saying, &quot;where are we going&quot; So I think, all right, lets try this idea out. So I window out and check EQ atlas for ideas, and come up with ToFS. At first everyone was a little hesitant, but we managed to gather up a Chanter and Shaman, Two Druids, the GL's Monk, myself, and a Ranger. The GL's wifes Druid dropped us off in Iceclad, and we headed toward the tower. We got inside and set up groups (Since there were more then 6 of us we got the raid set up). I then started pulling stuff from the first floor. I must say I was impressed by the way our gguild worked together! We quickly got a few extra keys (I got one and the two Druids each got one, the Monk already had one), alot of Gnome Skin stuff, and alot of cash it seemed. We headed up to the second floor, and the first kill there, we got Ro's Fiery Sundering for one of our Druids! We started making our way around the bookcases, moving the group as we went, and got to the back right corner when guess what dropped? Teacher's Syllabus! A rarer drop I am told. Things are looking good for us. We continue around and complete the circuit, and start again. We get halfway down the left row when guess what drops again? Teacher's Syllabus!<br />
<br />
I won't bore you with any of the other little details, but all in all we had a great time. This was the first &quot;raid&quot; I had ever been on, and I think our guild really proved to itself that it (at least these particular members) could work together to get something done.<br />
<br />
Very promising when you consider our average level is 40. Good practice anyway!<br />
<br />
Well, that's my story!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tower of Frozen Shadow is fun :D I liked that zone and always had a fun time there. It's a good beginning level raid-type zone and if your guild is a natural progressed ( no PL'd alts and whatnot )...the drops there are pretty decent the farther up you go. My favorite floor was the wedding floor though I have to admit; was always good bustin' up a weddin between zombies and vampires and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can remember back in the day when me and a group I was with went to ToFS as a regular thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
On this day there was a Monk, a Cleric, and myself.<br />
<br />
On this day Tserrina Syl'Tor was on a rampage. :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
We entered her tower killing off a few skellies and whatnot then suddenly we turned around and there she was, in-between us and the zone out!<br />
<br />
She made short work of the cleric and then charmed me and made me kill the monk.<br />
<br />
I barely made it to the zone with a sliver of hps left only to die at the hands of the shadow guardians outside.<br />
<br />
She also killed all of the other groups in the zone ( three at the time including a higher level group that was trying to camp her.)<br />
<br />
God I hate that vampire b!tch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i wub ToFS i went from like 38 to 48 just screwin around with higher lvl friends, was a blast. Some hard core dungeon crawling =P<br />
<br />
since this seems to be a &quot;Favorite ToFS Encounter&quot; type thread here's mine<br />
<br />
The time we actually took down Tsernia.<br />
<br />
I think i was like 46 or 47, was with my 52 druid friend, 51 shammy, and the druid's husband a 54 ranger, and 2 51 knights, (one pally, one SK) so it was one full group.<br />
<br />
we crawled through all floors even though i had all the keys up to the next-to-the-last floor. Picked up a couple of students homeworks, embalmers skinning knife, no drop range melee item, no drop helmet etc.etc.<br />
<br />
we made it up to the spectre floor (7a?) we cleared our way to the other side (7b?) and cleared the 2 bats there. Then left the ranger/sk/druid there.<br />
<br />
Me the shaman and the pally went a cleared spectres til that genie lookin chanter mob spawned, about the time he spawned the pally had to leave, so he hit his thurg gate potion,<br />
<br />
we BARELY got wiped by mr genie guy, because we didnt clear the bats first, but there was luckily a 61ish epic cleric there, he rezzed us all and offered to help us if he got mr genie's key, i really wanted the key but it was a fair trade<br />
<br />
so we wiped my genie guy out like grass stain in a barrel of acid, and we were on tsernia's floor (8?) killed random crap there til we killed that randomly special bat, and there she was, all nasty lookin. So we rushed her, i got charmed and started beating on the cleric, so he ran to the back of the hall and slapped a root on me, when charm broke i jumped back in, and she went down, slowly but surely, i still carry around her master key, its my most prized possesssion<br />
<br />
btw im pretty sure they fixed the pathing and stuff in ToFS, because one time we were clearing spectres on (7a?) and we had to bail for the mirror to (7b?) and we sat there instead of evacing, and not once in 2 and a half hours did we see a spectre on (7b) so perhaps its fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ToFS has been my favorite zone ever in EQ. Awesome awesome design for a zone, i can walk through there blind now :p 5th floor (wedding) was the best floor imo, if you havent done it its something you need to do! very fun, especially if you do it when the stuff isnt trivial to you and you actually get exp for it. Decent loot for the levels required drops on every floor. Fun no-drop toys too (dagger that procs &quot;distraction&quot; which is a True North spell :p so about 3 times every fight it would point ya north, good fun.)<br />
but this, howling stones, and dalnirs are some the best dungeons in EQ imo. <br />
oh yeah, and taking out Tserrina Syl'tor when you are level 47, and her being ~52ish, charming everyone and doing the normal chanter havoc, fun fight. <br />
