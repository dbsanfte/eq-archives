<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zrod</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i &quot;thought&quot; i read somewhere that warriors get the ability to stun with their kick at some point.  This may have just been wishful thinking/dream/delusion.  I &quot;thought&quot; this was something we got at around level 55.  Unfortuntaly i can't find anything about it anywere now, so i come to you folks to straighten my arse out.  <br />
1. Do warrior's kicks get a stun componant at any time,<br />
2. if so when?<br />
3. and does it just have the chance of happening when kicking or is there another skill to use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we can stun with our kicks at lvl 55, and no, you don't need to do anything special, just use that kick hotkey.  Be advised, I've noticed that it won't always stun, but it works often enough.  And it still won't stun &quot;unstunnable&quot; mobs like Kael giants, ToV dragons/drakes/wurms/wyverns, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or ghetto bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ghetto bash.  /nod</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone validate that?<br />
<br />
ghetto bash. /nod <br />
<br />
Pardon my n00bness (made me a new word) but what exactly is ghetto bash? Is it Slam but being called ghetto cause you dont need a shield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ghetto bash is when you swap in a shield inbetween weapon swings as needed then putting your sword back in right afterwards.<br />
<br />
Slam has a higher skill cap than kick does and uses the bash skill which makes it better if your a large race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My kick skill is 201</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you fighting, first of all?  Some things can't be stunned, like Kael giants, or dragons.  The easiest way to see it, is to go fight a stunnable, caster-type mob.  Necros in Chardok are a good example.  Wait til the mob starts to cast, hit the kick button; if the kick connects, and it stuns (I've seen it connect and NOT stun as well), then you'll immediately see that your target's spell was interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty sure this stun is almost instant if not actually instant.. the only purpose it serves is interrupting casters (iirc)...<br />
<br />
As far as those people that know slam ownz (like I know :) )<br />
<br />
I found myself the other day in a peculiar situation that made me start training kick again as well as bash... <br />
<br />
Druid turns all into wolves cause we are taking reds and we need all the ATK we can get ... I find that my slam key does not work under that illusion (and some others I imagine.. boon?)  anyways.. make sure you big mofos keep kick up... if nothing else for when you get buffed with a spell that has an illusion as well..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to see kick stun at work is to solo something that runs when it gets to low health.  When it runs, kick it.  If you get a successful stun, the mob stops for several seconds.  I've been using this since 55 as a last resort method of slowing down fleeing mobs when the group snarer/rooter is asleep at the switch.</div></div><hr />
