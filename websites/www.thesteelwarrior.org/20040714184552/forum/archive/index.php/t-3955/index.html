<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not really looking for gear suggestions, but I am looking for confirmation of something I have been noticing. Other than EP molds, are there as few upgrades to VT loot as I seem to be finding? I've scoured some databases, and I just can't seem to find them.<br />
<br />
  Example 1: Cord of Midnight (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28890) <br />
<br />
VT minis loot. Other than the EP gods, is there a better belt for warriors? <br />
<br />
  Example 2: Cloak of Icy Shadows (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28887) <br />
<br />
VT minis loot. 30ac 125hp 1 second cast self DS/cha... I couldn't really find something to beat that. Some stuff had more hp, but all had lower ac, most by around half.<br />
<br />
  Example 3: Orb of Satisfaction (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26758) <br />
<br />
35ac 100hp in the range slot... damn. <br />
<br />
  In addition, my neck and legs seem to be nearly irreplacable. Anyways, ya'll get the picture I'm sure. Are these VT items going to last until PoTime? I'm currently working on some 10ac augments and putting them into some of these items. Am I missing some chunk of EP items somewhere along the line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For belts alot of guys will try and grab a Girdle of Earthen Stability from Rock ring in plane of Earth.I can't tell the stats offhand but it is a nice belt.<br />
<br />
For cloaks,There is a number of them however AC wise few are more than 15-20 AC.Leaf Jointed cloak from I think dust ring in PoE is pretty decent.There is also another cloak from there that I also remember being not so bad.<br />
<br />
As for Ranged items,There isn't really much of anything pre Time worth picking up that would be a good upgrade to a 35 ac 100 hp ranger.You could grab a Char mof Defense from pof xp named, with slighty lower AC but with some extra stats and a parry mod depending on what your opinion of mods are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem is that Girdle of Earthen Stability (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16154) is a 17ac hit for 55hp  (~3hp per ac). If you count ac as worth much at all, it's a bad tradeoff.<br />
<br />
  Leaf-jointed Cloak (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16637) is a 5ac hit for 15hp (3hp per ac), and you'd lose the clicky. <br />
<br />
What I'm finding is that with a reasonable ac to hp conversion formula, VT loots still beat out most non-EP mold EP items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drape of the Agile (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=15864) but yeah I agree there isnt much for accessories as I call them (items outside of the original SoV type quest armor slots) rings, cloaks, shoulders, earrings, belts, mask, neck are all a bit weak in the EP's and seems theres not much to rival VT gear there. and god forbid if you want to replace you Haste slot item before you get a 2nd, theres maybe 1 decent item per zone, and they're wearable by every other class out there, including those CLR's who like to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Drape of the Agile? It's a straight 12ac hit and a clicky DS for an 8% dodge mod... not worth it imo. Rings don't seem to be too bad, at least there are a handful of options out there. There is definitely does seem to be a poor selection for most non-visible slots though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are these VT items going to last until PoTime? <br />
<br />
Yes they can.<br />
<br />
Raex will be your biggest upgrade aside from earrings from Earth B or Air.</div></div><hr />

Makes me glad my guild isn't skipping VT in the rush to do PoP.<br />
<br />
Example 1: Cord of Midnight (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28890) <br />
<br />
VT minis loot. Other than the EP gods, is there a better belt for warriors?<br />
Personally, I went with Belt of Mastery (http://www.criesofinsurrection.com/item_view.php?itemnum=26761) for my waist, and use Gorget of Superiority (http://www.criesofinsurrection.com/item_view.php?itemnum=28885) for Haste.<br />
<br />
Example 2: Cloak of Icy Shadows (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28887) <br />
<br />
VT minis loot. 30ac 125hp 1 second cast self DS/cha... I couldn't really find something to beat that. Some stuff had more hp, but all had lower ac, most by around half.<br />
I actually decided to stick with my Cloak of Thorns (http://www.criesofinsurrection.com/item_view.php?itemnum=31366) from NToV over the cloak you list.<br />
<br />
Example 3: Orb of Satisfaction (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26758) <br />
<br />
35ac 100hp in the range slot... damn.<br />
I'm going for Bow of Shadows (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28989) off of TXD for my dream Range item.  Only 10 ac, but 125 hp and it's a bow, and I HATE switching out my range just to tag off the puller :)  As an added benefit, all my guild's rangers got impatient waiting for this to drop and spent PP on Elemental tradeskill bows, so none of them want it!<br />
<br />
Again, I'm very happy my guild is spending as much time farming VT as we are.  Everyone is getting very nicely equiped, and it's making PoP fights sooo much easier for us than for the guilds who tried to &quot;skip&quot; VT and jump straight into PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I enjoy having my attack cap'd, so i would switch out belt for earthen and probably cloak for leaf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cloak of Combustion, Exquisite Phoenix Feather Mantle are also two good cloak for war.<br />
But well, yes some VT loot are not worth being upgraded before time. You'll be glad to not have skip VT when you'll make it to time, where resist are actualy usefull, especialy if you are playing on a crowded server where you won't be full elem geared in the next 6 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cloak of Combustion (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12082) is 7ac for 15hp and 5% dodge. Possibly worth it, though it depends on the weight you use for dodge and the cloak's clicky. Exquisite Phoenix Feather Mantle  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13672) is 10ac and the clicky for 30hp, 8% dodge and V6. Probably better, but still a marginal upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Neck ? Necklage of the reflected flame is a good upgrade, 50 hp and V6 for 7 AC. Legs, well elemental legs are a huge upgrade to umbracite, but beside those yeah.<br />
Earthen Bile is an ok range, but barely qualify as elemental loot.<br />
Same for cord of invigoration. Last 2 items dropping off TRC, so they taste like time items.<br />
I would not say it's a broken itemization, the very best Luclin loot are about equivalent to mid-end PoP loot, why should it be other way ? There's like 5-10 decent items dropping every week from VT vs 150 in E-Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, the belt, cloak and neck I have drop off the 2 VT minis. They spawn every 3 days and drop 4 items a piece for a 3ish hour raid. And VT drops a hell of a lot more good loot than 5-10 weekly, not even counting the minis. <br />
<br />
That neck is actually a 10ac hit for 50hp and V6, but has been something I've looked at. It's mostly been going to rogues, monks and rangers so far though. Is that the only possible neck upgrade in the EPs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your best bet for a neck upgrade is Fire Marked Rune (20ac 125hp).<br />
<br />
And you can get a Girdle of Earthen Stability and aug it with 10ac or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Danadur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Enscorrcelled Metalcloth Cape is also nice shoulder / back usuable drops off Avatar of Wind in PoA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grongl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Puresteel Mantle is nice - if you farm air to any extent, it's going to be a gimme eventually, and it's a hefty chunk of AC and HP with a nice effect if you don't have Icicle Aura.  <br />
<br />
Moss Encrusted Band, Whispering Air Bangle (though weak on AC, cha is a bonus), Clawed Earthcrafter's Hoop, a few decent things hiding here and there.<br />
<br />
Short of Time, necks are weak, cloaks you have to eat AC, same with belts, legs are nonexistent 'cept plate molds from gods, but worst of all is haste.  Haste itemization short of Time is a travesty.  MM's belt is a myth, and who bothers with him after the initial 2-3 kills?  Band of Swirling Air is less AC than a Dain Ring ffs.  Coir belt/etc., again, a god drop, and questionable AC.  Earth bracer is inferior to Raex bracer stats, but still hotly contested due to classes and focus.<br />
<br />
In short, you're going to be doing a lot of heming and hawing and bargaining AC vs. HP vs. Atk with 95% of the non-Time, non-Raex PoP drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm going for Bow of Shadows off of TXD for my dream Range item. <br />
<br />
I love the proc on mine, it has -1000 to resist and adds 32 disease counters :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On necks, I'd hafta say outside time AHR neck is still easily the best there is for us. 35ac 15all stats 20 all saves and 125hp, nothing is better. Not to mention 20atk 8pt innate DS UV and 8 regen. Even Magma neck you give up 20ac just for 10hp and 10atk. Even ignoring the saves/stats.<br />
<br />
 I'm looking at AHR mask too over FR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rikkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Id try and go with a belt of mastery from blob in vt or girdle of earthen stability from poearth. Imo belt of mastery  &gt; than girdle though (not sure how much you raid vt still though ). To replace haste Id go for the haste bracer from earth or flowing moss mantle, also from earth.  <br />
<br />
Im using the flowing moss mantle at the moment though idealy, Id prefer to have the haste bracer and a puresteel mantle from air in my shoulder slot, but we just dont ever raid air so its doubtful that is going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild is done with VT and into the EPs, so what I have from VT is all I'm ever going to get from there. It just boggles my mind a little that I have these items that I got from mini VT raids that I'm going to keep until Time. Not only because there's not enough drops for everyone to upgrade, but because I just don't want the EP items. There were even tons of better items in VT that I still wanted, and if I just got the non-visible pieces I'd basically only ever ask for EP molds. I understand that VT is the highest end Luclin zone and the drops should be very good, but EPs are FAR more difficult to get into.<br />
<br />
 The surprising thing for me has been the huge ac hit for all these items. Any upgrade has simply overwhelmed the ac loss with hp and atk gain. This seems especially surprising considering the increased ac soft cap in PoP. Anyhow, thanks for the answers, you've confirmed what I thought. I'll be augmenting my current gear and trying for molds, rings and earrings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">By the time everyone in your guild is pretty set on molds you should be hitting the plane of time though. The few non-mold items that do drop are hardly a factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stikka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since entering Time I have replaced 5 VT items including legs, it is true that some slots are poorly itemised in Elemental planes, but I assume this was deliberate to give us a reason to see PoTime as worth while.</div></div><hr />

Well you never know. My guild just went into VT on Friday on a off day with 25 people and cleared all of floor 2, got me an aten neck to replace a 10ac 100hp neck, some pally got the BP and mage the robe. And we're farming EP gods...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A good number of slots ends up having roughly the same stats as VT counterparts when you factor in the less AC.  But just like you won't have everything you ever wanted in EP you won't have everything you wanted from VT either.  Since EP isn't the end zone of PoP, it make sense that not all choices are clearly better than the previous endzone before.</div></div><hr />
