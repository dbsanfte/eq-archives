<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a bad expierience w/a pally and a cleric both in 1 group today.  My ranger friend got me a spot in his PoD group so I come along and he reccomends that I tank.  He likes me to tank cuz we work well together and I'm one of the few people who can keep aggro off his twinked ass lol.  <br />
     Well after he reccomends I tank the cleric says, &quot;Sure Akamek can tank, just let me find a replacement cleric real fast.&quot;  Yeah that hurt and I'll admit I was pissed but, my ranger friend and I decided to have fun w/the uber pally that was supposed to hold aggro so great and just took turns stealing aggro from him just to piss everyone off.  <br />
     Yes I know not always a smart thing to do but I was frusterated and it was fun.  So if they slap ya in the face show 'em whos the boss and make the pally look like a fool like we did lol cuz honestly Apothes is about the only pally I can stand anymore.  <br />
 Later all, Akamek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and what did the pally do wrong to deserve that? and how do youknow the cleric didnt have to go afk for other reasons?<br />
<br />
the fact of the matter is, we all have to accept our limitations. whenever i group with a decent pally, ill always ask whether they want to tank. whether we like it or not, the casters and slowers  prefer it and its the sensible thing to do. <br />
<br />
so next time, drop the ego and think whats best for the group.</div></div><hr />

And best for the group? Warrior tank I'd say as there were mostly melees doing the damage anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cuz that's no fun gulug lololol!!!11!1!!!! fuxx0ring with the uber pally iz mroe fun..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, well the Paladin got a little taste of what it's like being a Warrior.  So, maybe he didn't deserve it, but why do we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry guys, didn't have my contacts in so I accidentally hit the new post button instead of the post reply.  I was trying to reply to something where they were talkin about pally's and crap... Sorry bout that, but anyways I was just mad cuz the pally and cleric were talkin crap on me when id just sit there attacking and take aggro from the pally that was supposed to be so uber.  <br />
     <br />
     Oh well like I said sorry, this was supposed to be a reply not a new thread.  <br />
Later all Akamek</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;WTF are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm using my special abilities!  I'm /shielding you!  /shielding you, I say!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't, I can tank it myself, okay?  Just attack it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next mob is pulled.../shield paladin<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Hmm.../shield only does melee damage, right?  or does it do spell damage too? (think not, but might be wrong)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevis</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I hear you.  Paladins really make me angry. <br />
<br />
First off, I'm a cleric.  I registered because this is the only place I know where I can complain and you all seem like really nice, cool people (my fiance told me you've helped him a lot!).<br />
<br />
About 95% of the time I'm with a paladin they ninjaloot.  I don't understand what their problem is.<br />
<br />
Most of them have no idea how to pull either.  Almost everytime we have a paladin for a main puller he pulls five and I'm dead once I heal.<br />
<br />
Some paladins think they can be a healer.  They can't be!<br />
<br />
And I absolutely hate it when people yell &quot;HEAL! HEAL!&quot; when I've all ready said I'm OOM or have all ready started to heal.  Then they run out of range.  Grrr....<br />
<br />
Whenever a paladin searches for a group I always hope that we don't take them unless it's someone I know.  Of course, the groups I'm in usually do because &quot;pallys r col.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ranting space.<br />

I joined one of the semi-uber guilds for a while, but when returning from a break I found that I was deguilded without notice. :(<br />

Went guildless for a while before settling in with some friends in Knights of Lore.</div></div><hr />
