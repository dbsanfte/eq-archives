<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets look at the issue from SoE point of view.<br />
<br />
First, they expect players to use the tools at their disposal.<br />
<br />
Two scenarios:<br />
<br />
Group with warrior tanking<br />
-Rogues can evade to lose aggro back to warrior<br />
-Monks can FD to lose aggro back to warrior<br />
-Rangers can jolt to lose aggro back to warrior<br />
-Wizards can jolt to lose aggro back to warrior<br />
-Enchanters can root before slowing, and can boggle afterwards<br />
-Shamans can root before slowing<br />
<br />
-Upside of this group? Warriors have better ac/hp/dps, better dodge/parry/riposte skill caps = less healing/downtime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights tanking<br />
No need to worry about aggro<br />
<br />
-Downside of this group? Knights have lower hps/ac/dps making an issue over downtime<br />
<br />
<br />
This was the convential wisdom, and for the 'right' setup its true. However, as we know humans take the path of least resistance.<br />
<br />
Why should a group have to jolt, FD, evade, Root, Boggle to kill a mob when they can sub in a knight and watch TV?<br />
<br />
Cruicially, knights were upgraded in defensive/offensive abilities to an extent they are close enough to a warrior that it makes no difference when you factor in the guaranteed taunt.<br />
<br />
Also with the FT items, C5, BST crack, Druid Crack, horses, mana regen isnt an issue as it once was.<br />
<br />
So taunt is balanced according to SoE view. Pity they live in this idealistic world where eveyone accomodates their playstyle depending on who is in the group, rather than the real world of least resistance.<br />
<br />
If I group with guildies (which is almost always now) I dont have an issue with slow aggro, they know what to do and we do just fine. If I group with pickups, they all just wanna grind and press 1 button a night (slow, CH, nuke, BS, autoattack depending on the class)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having a group that hunts together on a regular basis is different than starting in a pick up group every night. When I hunt with my regular group, my shamans, enchanters, rangers, druids all know when to do there thing and it doesn't include Boggle, Jolts, or even Root (except when i bring more than 1 friend to the party).  <br />
<br />
And i have been in pick upgroups where i cry all night for the slows to land before the mob gets to 20% life, rogues hitting backstab as im running the mob to camp, rangers are snaring on inc, wizards nuke lands the moment i turn to face the mob and taunt.... these things happen, these are the reasons warriors get replaced by knights.... not because how gimped we are... our tools are so plain and simple no bells or whistles.<br />
<br />
People are creatures of habbit, and they think since they aren't on a raid they can have just blast away with thier skills... because I know on my raids, if anything happens before &quot;All In&quot; is called they are getting a tongue-lashing or even TL'ed out.... which makes our hair go grey... and makes a few more GY corpses to lag the zones... I don't expect players to wait for agro in pick upgroups, but i expect them to wait till i have the mob in camp and i am facing them and my Maul is mauling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One small thing, as you fight the higher level stuff a whole bunch of it summons.  So you can't root the thing to keep aggro off of you (ie that shammy is gonna get plastered doing that)<br />
<br />
Also I think the point about Knights that people like to make is that:<br />
Rogue evading == lower dps<br />
Monks FD'ing == lower dps<br />
Rangers Jolting == lower dps<br />
Wizards Jolting == lower dps<br />
<br />
That's because the time they're spending doing that could be used to get in more attacks/spells, which means you can raise your dps higher with a paladin because you can blast/hit much harder and not worry about the consequences.  Higher dps=more kills per hour=more xp per hour<br />
<br />
Although I really don't see many paladins tanking so the theory seems to just be a theory.  Others have made this observation also.</div></div><hr />

But a point on summoning mobs, you can tash root and slow without being summoned )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that quote makes a point very clearly.  Warriors are not  broken, all the tools are there for us to do our job and do it successfully.  All it takes is players from other classes using our ability.<br />
<br />
Knights on the other hand are broken, in that they are overpowered in terms of agro generation, and allow other classes to get away with not using their agro avoidance tools.  To raise warrior agro enough to be close to knight agro further dumbs down the game.  Agro managment is not a difficult thing, let's not reward those people who can not be bothered with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily.  If the ranger has slower weapons, he can jolt in between attack refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt is not balanced. Get a grip with reality.<br />
<br />
I &quot;feel&quot; that taunt is at most 50% success rate on even mobs.<br />
Thats for even mobs in Plane of Fire. Let me just ask you. <br />
<br />
Do the 600 extra hp i have over Knight01 balance the fact :<br />
* His taunt is 100% reliable, with zero refresh (hi 4 stuns up)<br />
* He has group heals, group buffs, LoH, Root<br />
<br />
I dish 170dps, but slow down the entire group for 30% of the fight, and offer nothing.<br />
The knight does 120, gets instant agro, and offers heals/CC.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for 100% reliable agro. Thats stupid.<br />
I'm asking for something that will make a VIABLE alternative to a knight.<br />
<br />
Something that will make the group think :<br />
A) 170dps, great hp, no extra imput, good agro<br />
B) 120dps, good hp, extra input, great agro<br />
<br />
dps / hp / extra imput are PERFECT.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Only&quot; detail is i dont have that good agro.<br />
The 'Barely decent agro&quot; i have isnt even reliable (Proc WRU)<br />
<br />
Taunt IS BALANCED FOR RAIDING, its FUBAR BIGTIME for xp.<br />
<br />
That for me in elemental plane. Imagine the poor war0674 in PoV xp.<br />
Taunt is fucked up for XP groups. But on scale for raiding.<br />
Raids dont need snap agro (hi AE taunt). <br />
XP groups are all about snap agro (and we SUCK BIGTIME at it)<br />
<br />
Ps: Dps include DS/MoR</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realise that during the first 20% of the fight everyone<br />
will be watching the war fighting cleric will be wasting mana ?<br />
And that later in the fight, everyone will have to &quot;hold back&quot;<br />
because the warrior in unable to agro.<br />
<br />
Guess what ? With the paladin/sk everyone can full burn at inc.<br />
<br />
Try the test, i'm willing to bet you'll see the pal/sk group kills faster.<br />
<br />
Why ? Because it reaches OPTIMAL FIGHTING CONDITIONS almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Were as the warrior group has to wait for the mob to be at 80%<br />
And is forced to hold back because of the same agro issues.</div></div><hr />

But yea, seriously, taunt could use a little working in exp groups - especially if you don't have access to Enraging Blow weapons, etc. It's fine on raids, but in exp group, it's eh... at best.</div></div><hr />

I don't lose much noticable DPS at all using my evade hotkey.<br />
<br />
It's one button to push. Does the whole sequence. If I'm using my 2hander I don't miss ANY attack rounds. If I'm dual wielding, it's probably better I'm not drawing ripostes now that I've evaded.<br />

I think very few people think that the disparity between warrior agro and the statement above do not see the situation as broken.  It would be hard to see it as anything else.  What I do not understand is why any class should be that overpowering.  As &quot;poor war0674 in PoV xp&quot;, with average at best gear, I know I can succesfully tank, if the group has any ability, and a desire to use that ability.  When I have the most trouble is when they either have not learned to manage their agro, or do not want to be bothered to.  I do not want to change the game to make it easier for those people.  Knights in my mind should not get instant agro, or at least not without having to cast so much they are lom after a few pulls.  Note I don't have a good solution on how to make that happen, but I do feel that to improve warior agro enough to balance out group desirablility among the 3 tank classes would seriously dumb down the game.<br />
<br />
If you can succesfully group, gaining reasonable experience, with reasonably skilled players, then I feel warriors are not broken.  That is how it should be.  If knights can generate so much agro that any fool caster can succeed, then knights are to my mind broken(tho in a good way for them).  Dumbing down the game for people who do not want to be bothered to manage agro is to me not a good move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt is balanced  <br />
<br />
That statement is simply wrong.<br />
<br />
Come up with all you want, taunt is 100% broken.   The REASON that it's 100% broken is because of the *MINIMAL* difference in tankability between warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
There is *NO* additional downtime with knights tanking... none at all.    What's worse, there's many guild who are using Paladins almost EXCLUSIVELY as raid level tanks, because... you guessed it.. aggro.     Not on wuss mobs, on elemental bosses, because... you guessed it, the aggro gap is FLAT OUT busted.    There is a mere handful of mobs that a warrior tanks better than a Paladin because of aggro control.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you... what's harder to maintain... a 1 second shorter complete heal rotation, or sustained losses of people, or even the fear that it'll happen?    <br />
<br />
SoE has destroyed the warrior class by beefing up Knights' ability to tank *without noticeable cost*... because of a number of different factors:<br />
<br />
- Voice of Quellious (Or KEI if you're lower)<br />
- Flowing Thought<br />
- Knight gear with almost identical AC/Hitpoints as Warrior only armor, but with a HUGE increase in mana pools to go along with it.<br />
- The addition of multiple high aggro spells into the game with no corresponding increase in warrior's ability to generate aggro on their own.<br />
<br />
Yes, I used to say &quot;taunt sucks&quot;, but it's FAR worse than that now... it's unworkable.   SOE has ignored warriors for FAR too long, they have let us sink into oblivion, and quite frankly, they speak of &quot;giving melee a DPS upgrade&quot;... they can take that DPS upgrade and shove it up their behinds if they're not going to fix what's totally broken.<br />
<br />
The only solution at this point is to have a SERIOUS look at Knights and their ability to take damage or our ability to generate aggro.<br />
<br />
There MUST be a tradeoff, and there currently isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pal / SK (and BST) are perfectly balanced classes.<br />
<br />
Warrior is a perfectly balanced class exept in ONE DEPARTMENT.<br />
TAUNT (thats snap agro capacity).<br />
<br />
WE DONT HAVE ANY. NONE. NADA. NOTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree with Redhenna that warriors dont have an agro problem in good groups.<br />
Thats because groups with warriors ARE ARTIFICALLY SLOWED DOWN.<br />
Slowed down by the warriors incapacity to have some decent snap agro.<br />
<br />
A good group with a war MT will do 1 aa per hour.<br />
A good group with a Pal/SK MT will do uner 1 hour per AA.<br />
<br />
Why ? Because they reach the optimal fighting mode much sooner.<br />
(slow dot debuff nuke pet etc etc) as soon as the mob is at camp.<br />
They dont have to wait for the mob to be at 90%.<br />
<br />
Taunt is not broken. Its SOOOOOO underpowered.<br />
It makes warriors unreliable as XP tanks.<br />
<br />
I DONT want to be an agro god. I want to agro decently.<br />
So that when a group has the choice between me &amp; a paladin.<br />
(with similar gear &amp; aa)<br />
<br />
They DO make A M_THERF_CKING CHOICE !<br />
Atm there si no choice... Its grab the paladin , ignore the war.<br />
ITS A FACT.<br />
<br />
If you ignore that, your both clueless and dont care what happens to your brethen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the problem is with taunt specifically so much as with three issues:<br />
<br />
1)  Getting a sufficient hate lead before slow hits at the start of a fight.<br />
<br />
2)  Ensuring mezzed and slowed mobs don't turn on the chanter when you start hitting them.<br />
<br />
3)  Doing the above in such a way that it doesn't hugely upgrade hate generation capabilities for warriors with endgame gear and unbalance high level raid encounters.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to give warriors kick/bash a new hate generation equivalent to a resisted slow, effective only the first time it's used on a mob.<br />
<br />
Maybe letting taunt be 100% effective but only the first time it's used on a mob might work too, not sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the more correct statement would be: &quot;As long as everyone goes out of their way to accommodate me, I rarely have a problem holding aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact is, people don't have to go out of their way to out aggro a Warrior.  They in fact have to go out of their way to NOT out aggro a Warrior.  Some people think this is fine, it keeps some challenge in the game.  Which I wouldn't argue with, if it was a universal challenge.  It isn't.  Two classes completely do not deal with a significant portion of this problem while Warriors do.  And there is no current game reason for people to WANT to deal with this challenge the Warrior represents because they can get the same returns or better using a Knight and not have to work at avoiding aggro.<br />
<br />
It's like a baseball team where you have a really powerful hitter who can't play the field.  The whole team has to compensate for this guy's inability to field the ball.  While there's another guy who hits almost as well but is also a great fielder.  Yeah, he might not hit quite as few home runs per season, but he fields far better than the power hitter.  Now, who might the team prefer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, try tanking 600 hitter in BoT for exemple... the 100% aggro advantage is a lot more important than 500 more hp and 50 more ac.<br />
<br />
I agree in tier 1 ou in pre-pop dongeons we tank very well, but casters and healers always prefer not being hit, especially if they die in 2 rounds when it happen.</div></div><hr />

I have a retired warrior and now play shaman. I sometimes 2box in pit in tactics groups, guild group 99% of the time, with little aggro problems. The key is timing taunt, first malos which is next to zero aggro, then slow and the split second slow hits, press taunt. Works great.<br />
<br />
A pally's abillity to lock down a mob, via stun and subsequent aggro, is broken tho as it trivialises xp groups. But I also prefer a knight in PoV pick up groups but as a former warrior that doesn't make me happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not that warriors in and of themselves are broken, it is the disparity between warriors and knights that is where all the issues are from.  Warriors and knights need to be brought into balance, I think we all agree on this.<br />
<br />
My fear is that most people are calling for ways to increase warrior agro, which I feel will make already boring exp grinding and just make it more boring, and reward those non tanks who are too lazy or unskilled to manage agro.  Nerfing knight agro would fix the disparity, keep some challenge in exp grinding, and reward skill players(unskilled/lazy/non agro managing players will have a hard time after such a change).  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, if SoE comes up with a solution to fix this problem, whether up warrior agro, lower knight agro, or some combination of both, I will still be all smiles for a very long time(provided it works).  Any  solution/fix is better than what we have now.</div></div><hr />

Uh. SoE devs themselves have admitted that it *is* broken. Or, to be more specific, it's not working like they want it to. I quote: &quot;We gave warriors taunt for a reason. We need to make it do something.&quot;<br />

Yeah, sure, it works great. When it succeeds. You tryin to say taunt succeeds 100% of the time or what? Because it sure as hell doesn't.</div></div><hr />

hah you bastard I was going to say this exact same thing.  &quot;when it works&quot; yes, thats how you do it....also I save a taunt for a CH or other big aggro pulling spell that i am aware is coming.  but since taunt isnt 100%, you still lose a mob from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kvak: I also 2 box a shammy/warrior combo in the planes and I agree with you that war taunt is NOT broken. <br />
<br />
Are there times when my timed taunt fails and the mob goes for the shammy? Absolutely.  And therefore, I malo on inc mob and then slow cautiously after war engages until I get a feel for when I can safely slow and dot. Sometimes the mob gets to my shammy and then I taunt it off - one taunt usually suffices, sometimes it's two - sometimes more. Sometimes - omg! - sometimes my shammy dies because I can't peel the mob off of him in time!<br />
<br />
Now, is this an example of *broken* taunt? Hell NO!! After all, it all depends on how you define broken doesn't it? I don't define broken as ' not 100% reliable', or 90% or 80% or whatever.<br />
<br />
So let's do a little thought experiment. Imagine I was 2 boxing a shammy/knight combo. I pull a mob, malo it on the way in, knight engages. Since I know my pally can stun/blind for very little mana and gain snap aggro, my shammy has no need to hold off - he casts slow, dots, whatever without consequences. Same would go for chanter, cleric, any caster.<br />
<br />
What are the pros and cons of this latter combo?<br />
<br />
pros: <br />
- xp flows like mad - I'm stacking up AA's like there's no tomorrow woo-hoo!<br />
<br />
cons: <br />
- shammy (or &lt;insert caster here&gt;) never learns how to manage aggro against high end mobs - does not get a feel for what can and cannot be 'gotten away with' and when<br />
- pally never learns how important it is to watch for 'mob_01 yawns' messages and the like, doesn't need to pay attention to proximity or any of the other little details/tricks of how to hold aggro that warriors do<br />
- game gets boring as hell - everything is an xp grind - lotsa easy xp leads to lotsa lvl 65 toons with tons of AA's and no real understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their class or how to play them most effectively - does not stop them from running around everywhere shouting 'i am teh ub3r!!!' <br />
<br />
So it's pretty simple - if you are in favor of easy, low cost, low risk xps, then you are in favor of the current system. Only maybe you're a warrior, and so you want in on this sweet deal - in which case you would say, yeah, taunt is *broken*! Fix it so we can be more like the knights! Give us new AA's, new discs, add a bunch of hate to the stuff we do so we can close that gap with pallies! <br />
<br />
[And it would be no huge surprise if the SOE dev's chose to go this route - after all, they're the ones who totally unbalanced the high end game to begin with by giving knights the current (dis)advantages they 'enjoy' in terms of holding aggro - when it should have been immediately obvious that this would lead precisely to the imbalance we are now facing.]<br />
<br />
If, however, you are in favor of a more challenging gaming experience, where when you wind up at 65 with all of those cool AAs, you can actually have a justified sense of pride in what you have accomplished, and can be counted on in a high end raid to effectively play your toon with skill and nuance, born of long experience, then you will see that the way to rebalance the game, and to close the gap with the pallies, is to get rid of the near guaranteed, non-RNG based aggro control that they currently 'enjoy'.<br />

Redhenna is dead on in her assessment, in my view. It's not war taunt that's broken - it's pally aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladiiesman</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, is this an example of *broken* taunt? Hell NO!! After all, it all depends on how you define broken doesn't it? I don't define broken as ' not 100% reliable', or 90% or 80% or whatever.<br />
 <br />
&quot;broken&quot;, &quot;unbalanced&quot;, &quot;toe-may-toe&quot;, &quot;toe-mah-toe&quot;.  thats just semantics.<br />
<br />
<br />
So it's pretty simple - if you are in favor of easy, low cost, low risk xps, then you are in favor of the current system.<br />
<br />
this is most of the casual gaming community.<br />
<br />
Saying taunt is broken is misleading and maybe untrue.  BUT our defining class ability is keeping the mob on us and tanking it!  why should other classes be able to do our job better than us??<br />
<br />
Pallies can stun, heal, buff, root, invis(to undead), etc...SKs can dot, snare, FD, buff, etc...  AND they get taunt!! (is our skill cap higher? not sure what it is for a pally, but even if it is, SO WHAT)...why is it balanced that these classes can do all this stuff AND tank almost as good as us while all we get that is unique is dual wield?  higer AC and hps? innate magic resistance?  berzerker?  is this balanced??  no it isnt.  <br />
<br />
Knights have an INNATE ability to do our job better than us.  at the very least we'd like to be on even footing.  right now we are not.<br />
<br />
I do agree that it would be better for a skilled gamer to nerf pallies rather than beef up warr aggro.  tell the truth, how about if we dont lower pally aggro from stun....but pull a monk-nerf on em and make then even worse at mitigating damage?!?! ahahahahaha that'll show em!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two, well really three, options.  Nerf the crap out of Knight aggro control until it's just a bit better than a Warrior's.  Let me tell you right now, this is going to be REALLY unpopular with the Knights.  And who do you think they will blame if it actually comes to pass?  You got it, Warriors.<br />
<br />
The second option would be to load some HP and/or AC advantages onto the Warrior so that you can obviously see that the Warrior tanks better.  And I'm not talking just uber Warriors with the best gear the game has to offer and a couple of hundred AAXP.  I'm talking Joe Smoe Warrior when compared to Joe Smoe Paladin, suddenly you see, without defensive mind you, that the Warrior tanks enough better that it's a tough choice to go aggro control or greater tankability.  Well this is NOT going to happen, imo.  It would impact the raid level game even more dramatically than an aggro change.<br />
<br />
The final option would be to increase Warrior aggro control to be just a bit less than a Knight's.  This might make Knight's somewhat unhappy, because Warriors will actually be competition for them in groups again, but it won't generate the bitter resentfulness of nerfing them.  This might impact the raid game somewhat, but then again most good guilds have already figured out how to keep aggro on the Warrior when it's time to do that.  Making it a little easier will just make it a little easier.  And maybe it won't be so clear cut a choice for guilds to use Paladins to tank trash mobs and some boss mobs.<br />
<br />
No matter what is done, someone somewhere isn't going to be happy.  They can either make the greatest number of people unhappy or the least amount of people unhappy.  It really is SOE's call.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
*Pal/SK  offer INSANE agro, but lower dps, lower tankability, and versatility<br />
*War offer ZERO agro, higher dos, higher tankability and zero versatility.<br />
(i hope you agree with me on this)<br />
<br />
The problem is not pal/sk insane agro. Its the warrios ZERO agro.<br />
(Zero snap agro exept AE taunt once in a while).<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you, that people have to be skilled to handle agro with a warrior.<br />
But why does that imply SLOWING down the group ? To a point where a Pal/SK tank will be better ?<br />
<br />
I xp in fire with a Paladin that has gear barely better than ToV armor.<br />
With him tanking :<br />
* The shaman can slow at inc<br />
* The necro dot at inc<br />
* The nukers can nuke at inc.<br />
This can not be done with me, i just dont agro enough.<br />
Imagine if he had my gear ? (He needs 4 CH while i barely need 2)<br />
I would be a waste of group space. My higher DPS/Hp wouldnt help.<br />
<br />
Compare a war &amp; paladin/sk in : Tanking capacity / DPS / Versatility<br />
You will see that there is a balance. We give up versatily for tanking &amp; DPS.<br />
<br />
Compare war &amp; paladin/sk in : Snap agro<br />
We dont have any. <br />
<br />
Asking to nerf hybrids is stupid. Nerfing pal/sk wont HELP us.<br />
We will still be unable so save an ench/shaman/cleric getting beaten up.<br />
And we will still slow down our groups due to agro issues.<br />
Pal/SK are just fine. The problem is our agro on xp mobs (blue &amp; even con)<br />
<br />
Ps: Redhenna i totally agree with you that skills are needed. But.<br />
- With a lower skill group Pal/SK tanking will bring more xp (and less deaths)<br />
- With a high skill group Pal/SK tanking will STILL bring more xp.<br />
<br />
Thats the problem. That whichever will be the skills of the group.<br />
The horrid warrior capacity for snap agro will make him less efficient.</div></div><hr />

Its not a good thing, i will agree on that but we can live with that <br />
Since the trivial agro, wont help in some situations like :<br />
<br />
When the cleric is a &quot;bit late&quot; on the CH ....<br />
When the clerics has a bad fizzle ....<br />
When you get a bad round of hits ....<br />
When the quad800 non slowable named shows up.....<br />
When there's 2 3 adds, AE taunt Disc &amp; Evac or Mez ....<br />
<br />
A warrior will shine, while a hybrid will be in trouble.<br />
<br />
I firmly believe that if u ignore the incredible agro difference.<br />
Pal/SK and a warrior will offer the same things to a group.<br />
Both will contribue, but a bit differently.<br />
<br />
Nerfing pal/sk wont solve the agro issue, it will just be &quot;less obvious&quot;<br />

then<br />
Xp with a pal/sk is so trivial  <br />
<br />
Umm....thats a contradiction in my book. If xp is triv with these perfectly balanced classes, how are you defining perfectly balanced?? I guess from this, I can logically infer that you think trivial xping represents the perfect balance. I do not.<br />
<br />
I disagree for all the reasons I noted in my last post - none of which have been challenged. Makes the game less challenging, does not make casters and pallies learn the strengths and weaknesses of their classes. You can say fastest xp is what you want - that's fine - but what I am saying is that there are costs, as I've listed. And my opinion, without resorting to 36 font type, is that the game would be more fun if it were more balanced - for ALL classes not just a subset of classes as it is now.<br />
<br />
Quoting corner cases which happen once in a great while where:<br />
<br />
A warrior will shine, while a hybrid will be in trouble. <br />
<br />
doesn't cut it if 99% of the time it never comes into play. And if a hybrid has 500 fewer HPs and 50 less AC, which is pretty typical, I could easily argue that this corner case is so rare as to be closer to 99.999% - meaning it carries no weight whatsoever - it's negligible.<br />
<br />
*Pal/SK offer INSANE agro, but lower dps, lower tankability, and versatility<br />
*War offer ZERO agro, higher dps, higher tankability and zero versatility.<br />
(i hope you agree with me on this)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Actually, no I don't agree at all. There is nothing insane about pally aggro, nor is war aggro zero. Pally snap aggro is 'near guaranteed'. SK snap aggro somewhat less so. Warrior snap aggro is NOT zero, but rather random. The difference between zero and randomly occurring is enormous. <br />
<br />
The snap aggro from pallies in practical terms is VASTLY more of a key criteria for groups in tier 2+ planes choosing MTs than the small diff's in tankability and DPS, both of which are largely negligible.<br />
<br />
So this straw man argument does not fly. You are describing a situation that does not actually exist as you describe it. And therefore the conclusions that you draw from it do not reflect the reality of the situation and are not correct.<br />
<br />
I firmly believe that if u ignore the incredible agro difference. Pal/SK and a warrior will offer the same things to a group. <br />
<br />
Well, I firmly believe that if you ignore the price and quality difference between a Yugo and a BMW, both will get you where you're going. But that's neither here nor there since these differences DO exist and DO impact people's choices when it comes to purchasing cars.<br />
<br />
So this is just a tautology - another irrelevant straw man - and does nothing to address the issue, which is that people in the game are NOT ignoring the aggro differential between warriors and hybrids! And this failure to ignore this &quot;incredible aggro difference&quot; is exactly the problem. <br />
<br />
Redhenna said it exquisitely well:<br />
<br />
Why is this good? I am sorry, but I do not want to see the game balanced to the convienence of lazy people. I want a little challenge.

<br />
It is just as simple as this - some people want the fast xp regardless of the consequences. It's all that counts to them. They do not see any value in having to work for something - they want it given to them. That's just laziness.<br />
<br />
As for me, I want a challenge, because if I don't feel I earned it, then I don't want any part of it. <br />
<br />
If not a challenge to attain, 600 AAs mean nothing. EQ means nothing - it might as well be a PC game that you play for 2 weeks, learn how to beat, and then proceed to feel all wonderful about how clever and powerful you are. It's worthless bullshit. <br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, there is no question that EQ would be a much better game for serious gamers after a pally aggro nerf.  It would make better players of us all, and (Rallos Zek willing) it would drive the lazy ones to some other game universe where they can xp for free to their heart's content, strutting about with chests puffed out in a pathetic and mistaken display of self importance. We get enough of that now in EQ - we sure as hell don't need policies that would yield lots more.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be under the impression that people want this additional challenge.  You seem to think that people want these additional skills.  You seem to think that the way you want to play the game is the way the majority of players want to play the game.  I would offer this up, if all this was true, as you theorize, then in fact people would still be using Warriors and not Knights as tanks, because it's important to them that they learn these valuable skills. <br />
<br />
They don't care.  The majority will take the easiest path possible.  This is human nature.  You can't change human nature.  If they need other skills for raiding, they'll learn them while raiding.  It may be more painful, but they will learn.  And you seem to be justifying a case for nerfing the Knights.  Not a popular course of action.  They like their abilities just the way they are.  And I can't say I blame them.<br />
<br />
Actually, no I don't agree at all. There is nothing insane about pally aggro, nor is war aggro zero. Pally snap aggro is 'near guaranteed'. SK snap aggro somewhat less so. Warrior snap aggro is NOT zero, but rather random. The difference between zero and randomly occurring is enormous. <br />
<br />
Actually the difference between randomly occuring and zero is NOT enormous as you claim.  If you don't get a proc very quickly, you have effectively ZERO aggro.  And then you only have a CHANCE of regaining it.  I'll agree it's not quite zero, but it's so damn close as to be next to zero.  People aren't thrilled with the idea that they will randomly get the crap beat out of them doing exactly the same thing on this mob as they did on the last one.  Now, you can try and convince everyone about how this is really a good thing and how it improves player skills, but you're not going to convince the majority of the player base that this is FUN.  And without fun, everything else is completely irrelevant.  Because the player base can be challenged to hell and back, and if they're not enjoying it, they'll take their money someplace where they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are my opinions about what I want my gaming experience to be. Will some people feel the same? Sure. Will some people feel differently? You betcha. Do I think there are more of the former or of the latter? Beats the hell outta me dude. Do I care? Not particularly.<br />
<br />
You seem to be under the impression that people want this additional challenge. You seem to think that people want these additional skills.  <br />
<br />
The fairest response here is: some do. some don't. Your generalizations imply that no significant percentage of ppl wants the game to be more challenging, that no significant percentage of ppl wants these additional skills. Because, you know, they're human and human nature dictates that the majority of humans invariably will follow the path of least resistance. So your point is what - the majority of ppl don't give a shit, so I should stop beating my head against the wall? It's not gonna work, we're all gonna die? Sorry but I ain't buyin' it.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, I could be all alone in the universe on this point, but I will continue to express what I think makes the most sense. And that's because I understand something you seem to be confused about on a fundamental level: the difference between human nature and human behavior.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has children knows a lot more than they want to about human nature. Do we say then, oh well, these little humans have their own nature and we may as well bow to it and let them do as they will - after all you can't change human nature! <br />
<br />
Of course not - because you can't change human nature - but you CAN and DO work to change human behavior. Confusing the one with the other is just a way to avoid responsibility.<br />
<br />
My point is that you structure things so that you incentivize certain behaviors and disincentivize others. This has nothing to do with altering the fundamentals of human nature and it puzzles me that you should not see this as self evident.<br />
<br />
SOE puts a policy in place that incentivizes people to xp-for-free, in essence, by choosing hybrids over warriors. This takes away from the challenge of the game for folks like me, whether I am a warrior or not. Your implication is that people who think as I do  are in the minority. OK, I see no proof of this provided by you, but you're welcome to believe whatever you wish. I will not, however, allow you to postulate an opinion that dismisses some significant percentage of people without challenging it.<br />
<br />
I suggest that a policy that would make the game more challenging, would tend to attract more serious gamers, who tend to be people who prefer a challenge. I don't see this as violating the tenets of human nature, I see it as relying on them.<br />
<br />
As for being a *popular* course of action, I dont give a rat's ass if it's not popular with lazy gamers. I do think it would be popular with serious gamers. Are serious gamers a minority in the universe of all gamers? I would guess so. Does not change my opinion in any way.<br />
<br />
And as for a randomly occurring event being 'so damn close as to be next to zero' - well, frankly my game experience utterly belies this. As stated in an earlier thread, I 2 box a shammy/war combo. When I slow a mob after I've engaged it, 9 times outta 10, my warrior keeps the mob - and I don't have EB weapons. So I am relying on taunt, and on dmg aggro, and on proximity, and on timing. That tells me that my aggro holding ability is not zero and it ain't 'damn close' to zero. <br />
<br />
Logically, if my aggro holding ability were as 'damn close' to zero as you and Emilia suggest, then I would expect a death in my xps groups on virtually every pull. That is what the ZERO aggro would cause - isn't that correct? So the fact that I rarely get a death, and in fact normally don't even have a serious problem occur due to lack of aggro, means that warrior aggro holding ability is way the hell far away from ZERO. <br />
<br />
The fact that casters know that a death is more likely with a warrior as MT than with a pally, especially if they don't know how or else don't choose to manage their aggro, is the problem. And suggesting that warriors having zero aggro is the problem completely misses the point and is wrong to boot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During normal exp runs, PoV/PoS/PoN wtf ever. I rarely if ever cast to taunt. I'll cast once on incoming with a clinging darkness. After that I just melee, and if someone starts getting upidy with their agro I just hit the taunt button and 9 times out of 10 I get the mob back on me and continue on. So, why is it so different for warriors to do the same thing, if not better. Warriors have a higher taunt skill then SKs do certainly. The only time I ever chain cast agro spells is when a certain gnome wizard decides he wants to be eaten by a golem.<br />
<br />
So again, what's the real difference between SK/Pal and Warrior agro abilities (Snap and build) if all I have to do to get a mob's attention once it runs toward a caster/ranger is hit the taunt button, just like you guys. Just trying to get some info here, not meanin to be a dick or anything.</div></div><hr />

This is the difference. We hold aggro very well if we proc early on the mob. but unlike stuns and snare/dot knight use, we cannot &quot;cast&quot; on command.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kaldanm has hit the nail on the head here.  Knights have the ability to make a significant impact on a mob at range before it even enters your camp.  As a warrior I don't have the ability to demand a mobs attention at range unless I get lucky with a bow proc or perhaps spend too much of  my time shopping for snare items or pumice stones.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps just giving warriors the ability &quot;Warrior_01 reaches down and throws a handful of dust in Mob_02's eyes&quot; on incoming.  A  blind with a hate equivilant of clinging darkness or a lower level paladin stun.  Put it on a timer so it's not overpowering during the fight, but available in time for the next pull.</div></div><hr />

Where we differ is in how we think that should be done(tho any change would be better than nothing).  My point is that if knight agro was lowered, to the point that our edge in tankability(what little there is) makes all 3 classes even in desirability for exp groups, that is the best solution for the game.  Yes, at times chanters/shaman will die, and exp will be a little slower, but exp will still come in fast and furious.  PoP meant much faster exp than we had before, and more challenges to get that exp.  Upping warrior agro to the point where we are viable in exp groups just inflates that exp rate(as it is now for knights).<br />
<br />
I have many good friends who are knights, and the classes bring a wealth of good things to a group.  I hate to suggest nerfing them, because nerfs do suck.  But further taking the challenge out of an already basically easy game(at least exping) is not to me a good solution.  I do not say this is the best solution, just that it is the one most acceptable to me.  Again tho, at this point, just having SoE do something  will make me a lot happier.</div></div><hr />

If you remember how bad SKs were with Disease Cloud, what they can do now is nothing by comparison. Personally I think causing an extreme amount of hate with a bow on incoming or some other ranged attack (Toss a dagger in their eye o.&lt;) would be a bit better then nerfing the knight classes all over again. Hell alot of people STILL bitch to this day about Disease Cloud, and that wasn't even an intentional nerf.<br />
<br />
On the flip side I completely understand the warrior's position and would also understand if Sony decided to smash ranged agro for both SKs and Paladins. Leaving Paladins with only Flash of Light and SKs their terror line, which still give us more of an edge of agro then warriors but doesn't give us the overbearing power that Clinging Darkness and Stuns do now...of course that's just my idea of what I would do, but hey I'm just a player, not a dev.<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot this part heh.<br />
<br />
Everyone says that SKs and Paladins have MUCH more ranged agro then Warriors do (duh) but even when Im get out agroed by a chanter after a tash+slow I just hit taunt and Im back in the hot seat, to stay 99% of the time. Even though Warriors can't get the jump on agro like us, something like a Tash+Slow/Malo+Slow and then a taunt to jump onto the top of the list would most certainly garuntee you agro for the rest of the fight just as much as me, the only difference is the chanter/shaman can get a debuff off before their slow (The mobs sometimes will chase em after the slow but only when used in tandem with a debuff) which Warriors would have to out taunt and then wait for recycle while the casters med...I guess it just doesn't make sense to me, I'll prolly find out the entire thing soon with my own Warrior.</div></div><hr />

IMO knight aggro must not be nerfed. they can lock aggro and it's ok for them. The problem is with warrior aggro only : it's RANDOM and long to establish. <br />
SOE need to give us some device to control aggro at will and to create initial aggro, while not as good as knight mecanisms and not random like today our taunt/procs we rely on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure a Pal/Sk will make tanking in valor Trivial.<br />
But go hunt somewhere you need : Tash / Malo / Mala  to slow.<br />
You're gonna be HAPPY you have a warrior. <br />
Those extra 500hp 100ac will show, i wont even mention if there is a named.<br />
(Btw warrior are much easier to equip than hyrbids)<br />
<br />
Two of the Three tank classes have got insane snap agro capacity.<br />
Its been like that since day 1.<br />
The third class has ZERO snap agro (ok AE taunt once in a while).<br />
<br />
That wasnt a problem for a long time.<br />
<br />
Because of Mudflation, the 2 &quot;lesser tanks&quot; tank almost as good as Warrior.<br />
With incredibly superior agro.  This creates problems.<br />
<br />
Nerfing the 2 &quot;lesser tanks&quot; will only get them pissed.<br />
Thats why i dont want VI nerf them. It helps us, but doesnt FIX us.<br />
Nerfing Pal/SK is like taking care of half the symptons and ignoring the illness.<br />
<br />
You cant stop mudflation. Nerfing is sucks. So whats the solution ?<br />
Beef up out Taunt.  (or give us a good snap agro skill for xp grinds)</div></div><hr />

I do agree that pal/sk agro is incredible (wont say overpowered caus i hate nerfs) <br />
<br />
I hate nerfs too.  Honest.  I just, in this case, think that it is justified.  You are right, a totally clueless newb slower/debuffer/nuker is going to die no matter what class is tanking.  I goof around with a shaman alt, now 52, and I know that I can pull agro off any class(except possibly a ranger if he really  wants it).  Something I do take pride in when I play my little shaman alt is that I make life easer for the tank.  Stand nest to them when I slow, learn how soon I can slow, when I can add a DoT without getting agro, and not panicking and running around if I do get it.  With a knight tanking(more pally by far than SK), that little bit of skill that I have built is mostly wasted.  I have to try(or so it seems) to get agro.<br />
<br />
You cant stop mudflation. <br />
<br />
True, more levels, newer, better gear etc. make it inevitable.  I just think it should be limited as best as possible.  Nerfing does suck, and the game will never have the challenge it did when I was level 20 wearing banded and playing around in sarnak fort in LOIO.  I also hate to see more mudflation added than maybe is needed. <br />
<br />
I am not saying that nerfing knights is the right answer and increasing warrior agro is the wrong answer.  I do not know if there is a really good answer to the problem now(possibly that is why SoE has been so slow fixing what can only be an undeniable problem...or maybe they just do not care).  Every one here does want one thing, and we all agree on this...the disparity in agro must be fixed, and fixed soon.</div></div><hr />

By definition we are TANKS. Why couldn't we do our job as easilly as a cleric, or a Wizard, or a ranger do ? a cleric do need to pay attention for aggro at the start, then healing is trivial for exemple. So you said we must be the ONLY class or category of class that is not trivialised in xp groups.<br />
Today the warriior is the only that is almost forced to use awful tricks to grab every tiny little bit of aggro. Some of us even BEG for aggro (imagine a warrior fighting and suddently he stop attaking, saying &quot;can u spare sume aggro plz kthx !!1!&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glatius - I make no assumptions about what some generic set of 'people' wants from this game, as you seem to do.<br />
<br />
I have very strong evidence to support my view.  The very fact that Warriors are finding it much more difficult to find a group over the Knights.  This is ample evidence that the MAJORITY of players don't want the additional challenge you speak of.  What more evidence is necessary?  This should be pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
And that's because I understand something you seem to be confused about on a fundamental level: the difference between human nature and human behavior.<br />
<br />
Oh really, do tell.  Gosh, I'm just awed at your genius.  You've got it all figured out huh? <br />
<br />
I suggest that a policy that would make the game more challenging, would tend to attract more serious gamers, who tend to be people who prefer a challenge. I don't see this as violating the tenets of human nature, I see it as relying on them.<br />
<br />
/yawn.  For all your vaunted intellect you completely disregard one significant point.  That is SOE is not in business to simply provide more challenge to that minority of the player base who desires it.  If you'll look at the recent changes to the low level game, SOE is going out of their way to reduce the challenges.  This is in hopes of attracting more players.  Players who don't consider certain things as fun challenges.  Losing all your gear, as an example, as a low level player, is not a fun challenge.<br />
<br />
SOE's business is to attract and retain the largest customer base possible.  If they can do that by making the game more challenging, they will.  If they can do that by making the game less challenging, they will.  Yes, they will pander to the majority, more so than the minority.  Although they will still try to offer something to the minority to keep their interest.  They are paying customers after all.  But not at the cost of losing the business of the majority.<br />
<br />
One of the most popular and profitable online activities in the world today is online gambling.  People spend hours and hours playing Blackjack and various other gambling games.  How challenging are these games really?  Not very.  Yet people play them.  Given your thought process, these games should be complete duds, no one should play because of the lack of challenge.  It doesn't work that way.<br />
<br />
As for being a *popular* course of action, I dont give a rat's ass if it's not popular with lazy gamers. I do think it would be popular with serious gamers. Are serious gamers a minority in the universe of all gamers? I would guess so. Does not change my opinion in any way.<br />
<br />
You're certainly entitled to your opinion.  Don't expect it to carry much weight just because you consider yourself a 'serious' gamer who doesn't care if the 'non-serious' gamer feels shafted by changes you endorse.<br />
<br />
And as for a randomly occurring event being 'so damn close as to be next to zero' - well, frankly my game experience utterly belies this. As stated in an earlier thread, I 2 box a shammy/war combo. When I slow a mob after I've engaged it, 9 times outta 10, my warrior keeps the mob - and I don't have EB weapons. So I am relying on taunt, and on dmg aggro, and on proximity, and on timing. That tells me that my aggro holding ability is not zero and it ain't 'damn close' to zero. <br />
<br />
That's nice and all.  But if your Warrior has built up 100 hate and your Shaman slows generating 300 hate, the mob will beat on the Shaman, correct?  Your 100 hate is therefore meaningless on its own, since it's insufficient to keep the mob's attention.  It in fact is just as effective as having no hate at all.  You'll still need to go over and taunt the mob off your Shaman, thereby gaining a tad more hate than the Shaman.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand you've had a proc go off or you've allowed enough time for your Warrior to generate substantial hate with DPS, then no, the hate he has isn't effectively zero because it's sufficient to keep the mob's attention.  However, allow me to point out that the majority of players aren't double boxing the Warrior and the Shaman like you are, and therefore have a much more difficult time judging when they can or can't do certain things.  I double box a fair amount myself, and it is a pretty big advantage in timing things correctly.  It doesn't really hold much value for most people though, because they lack that advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: taunt is based on a random number generator. we dont know what formula taunt uses to check for success so we have no idea if its a 1 in 2 chance or a 1 in 2 million chance. sony is not likely to give us this info since that would allow us to beat them over the head with numbers.<br />
<br />
2:warriors cannot compete with the spellbased aggro of knights and sk's. they are not to blame for our shortcommings. again sony is not going to change this as it would lead to strife.<br />
<br />
3: stupid people that dont know how to play their class. this is the biggest problem of all. the list can go on and on but we all know when we have a group member that cant get it right, usually cause we are having to scoop them in to a ziploc with a spatchula.<br />
<br />
there is only one of these problems we can fix so i'd say its time to get sonys attention. How we do that I dont know.<br />
<br />
best way might be to get a good email address for someone important and fill their mailbox till they respond.  <br />
<br />
bottom line is we can bitch and argue amongst ourselves and even come up with good ideas to fix the problem but until sony decides to fix us we gonna stay broke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a pull from a ranger, monk, whoever, I shoot a few arrows at the mob.  When the mob gets into camp I hit attack, disarm, slam.  I'm going to say 90% of the time I have agro at that point - assuming no one blasted him on the way into camp.  Once he snaps to me, everyone starts up at once, INCLUDING the slower.  Provided the slower is close enough to the mob that the mob doesn't have to move, once slow lands the mob turns to the slower, I hit taunt, the mob looks back at me.<br />
<br />
Very rarely do I need to hit taunt a second time to pull off the slower, and its once in a blue moon that I have to hit it a third time (MAYBE 4 times a night max).  Better yet, once I get agro off the slower I've got that agro for most if not all of the fight.<br />
<br />
If the mob turns away from me for a second, hit taunt, its back on me.<br />
<br />
If you're having issues with taunt, check to see if someone is full burning spells.  Check to see if you're not hasted.  Check to see if the caster is using a level 65 nuke and doesn't have any casting subtlety AA. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree agro generation is broken on knights, but I disagree that we slow exp down in a group.  If you know how to use the taunt button effectively you'll never have a problem holding agro well.<br />
<br />
Btw, I use a 12/17 and 15/20 at level 63 with TM2, neither are EB type weapons.  Your mileage may vary depending on gear, levels and AA...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.  I've taunted 3 and 4 times in a row and had it fail.  I've had shamans and enchanters die as a result.  If you claim never to have anyone die because taunt failed, then you're either consistantly finding very good groups that can compensate with fast heals on slowers, you've been very lucky indeed, or you're not completely accurate in your perceptions.<br />
<br />
I don't consider it a reasonable or even a fun challenge to have the decision of whether or not someone lives or dies based, not on my skill as a player or my ability to make the correct decisions, but rather on whether or not the taunt happens to get a string of bad rolls.  When was the last time you've seen a Paladin fail 4 casts of a stun in a row?  Why should Warriors failing taunt 3 or 4 times in a row be 'okay', particularly when we don't get to try again immediately, but have to wait 6 seconds for the button to refresh?  How many spells have a 6 second refresh time?  Some, but not that many.  How many spells have a 6 second refresh time when they fizzle?  None to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Skill doesnt make a difference. It requires no skill for a pally/sk to cast a spell and get aggro. So it shouldnt require us to have the skill some of you have eluded to in this thread.<br />

<br />
Broken knight aggro is already a major source of game imbalance. Breaking warrior taunt intentionally only compounds the problem, even it it appears to be in our favor initially. And it is not fair to knights to make warriors much preferred in high end xps groups (rememer that this scenario was what brought us to where we are in the first place!). Pallies can have that great aggro - it should just cost a lot of mana so that downtime for medding becomes the tradeoff that groups are faced with.<br />
<br />
And since when is knight 'whining' a reason for not rebalancing the game by either increasing the cost of near guaranteed knight aggro, or reducing it so it is not near guaranteed. The criteria is now who whines the loudest? I think it should be game balance.<br />
<br />
I don't consider it a reasonable or even a fun challenge to have the decision of whether or not someone lives or dies based, not on my skill as a player or my ability to make the correct decisions... <br />
<br />
I think it eminently reasonable that the casters in the group should make their own decisions as to whether they live or die based on *their* skill as a player and *their* ability to make the correct decisions- it's called aggro management.<br />
<br />
Make knights pay a price for that stellar snap aggro, and then the tradeoff is a reasonable and a clear one - groups can choose knights and endure the associated med downtime, or they can choose warriors and go all day long as long as they practice aggro management.<br />
<br />
I see this as a reasonable and effective solution, and a much more easily implementable one than new/modified discs, skills, AAs, etc.</div></div><hr />

Exp grouping is by nature boring, and no challenge.  People don't want challenging exp, and what should be challenging about pulling the same blue cons over and over and over again?  It's simple boring mechanics.<br />
<br />
People don't want to work hard for exp, it takes too long, and challenge gets annoying, especially for those who exp for relaxation.  Just because you want a challenge, doesn't mean everyone does.  And all those &quot;serious gamers&quot; usually do raiding for their challenges.  Exp is about the path of least resistance, getting the most exp as fast or easy as you can, and challenges usually slow down exp.  How many people exp in tactics pit compared to how many exp up and down the side paths to tallon and vallon?  Those are much more of a challenge.  People keep in the pit because it's easy.<br />
<br />
If you want a challenge, thats your right, and you can go do challenging places.  But that doesn't mean that the rest of us who want in easy exp groups have to be left lfg because knights can make the groups lives much easier.  We need a boost to aggro, so we can compete.<br />
<br />
Theres so much more to the game than exping, but we deserve the right to be in a group without knowing that we're slowing them down because everyone has to watch themselves.  Though I agree it is a difficult thing to balance, so as to not become overpowered for raiding.<br />
<br />
And yes, he who whines loudest gets the most attention, it's the way SOE operates, because they want the most money they can get, and they get more money by listening to the ones who cry the most.</div></div><hr />

the only way to affect warrior and not knights would be skills they dont have. kick, dualweild, ect, but this would increase ranger rogue monk agro as well.<br />

the biggest problem is spell agro vs. melee agro. i cant think of any way to fix it witout makeing it no risk to cast a spell.<br />

they could give is the proc rates of cleric hammers though that should fix things. without effect any other classes. ofcorse the other side will say we want it to and the circle will continue till the last server is shut down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough. If my suggestion is implemented, then the problem of groups seeing knights making their lives much easier goes away. If my suggestion is implemented, then warriors can compete without a boost to warrior aggro. So both your problems would be solved except for your desire for an easy (read: free) xps group. Another benefit is, if my suggestion is implemented, then people actually learn how to more effectively play their toons.<br />
<br />
After all, if you &quot;don't want to work hard for exp, [because] it takes too long, and challenge gets annoying, especially for those who exp for relaxation&quot; (and BTW, who the hell xps for relaxation??), then why not just ask SOE to *give* us AAs? Or to increase the xp we get from 1 mob to what we currently need to kill 1000 mobs for? How about if we just ask SOE to give us a level or an AA for every mob we kill? Why, we'll be positively &quot;swimming&quot; in AAs! <br />
<br />
And so will everybody else, and the value of being lvl 65 with lots of AAs will be exactly zero. And if we're lucky, 5% of those uber toons might actually know how to play their class.<br />
<br />
You are right about one thing - people always want something for free without having had to earn it or work hard for it. And once they get it, funny how they don't seem to attach much if any value to it. (Driven through any public housing projects lately?) But hell, we are entitled to easy xps without having to &quot;work hard&quot;!! Someone call a lawyer!<br />
<br />
OK, OK, let's ask for easy and free xps. Oh, and those raid mobs drop some really nice gear, only our clerics and chanters and pallies never learned how to really play their toons effectively cuz they never had to practice aggro management, which makes it kinda tough, so we'd like those mobs nerfed if ya don't mind. In fact, just hand over the good stuff - we're entitled to that too. That lawyer still on the phone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">easy and free are not the same.  Who here exps for a fucking challenge?  Exp is not a challenge.  If the idea of exp was for a challenge, then raid exp would be extremely higher, and it would be worthwhile to do hard mobs.  Exp is a time sink.  Like the majority of what we have to deal with.  No, it's not supposed to be free, you put your time in, everyone does.  God, your assumptions are pathetic.  Oh yes, I'm going to ask for free loot, just because I recognize exp as a time sink and not a challenge.  I'm sorry, exp mobs don't challenge me.  As for most of the things I mentioned (boost to warrior taunt so we can get groups) that doesn't effect me.  I'm 65, I only group with people who know what they're doing, I know what I'm doing.  But I happen to think about OTHER people, something you seem to not understand.  Most people see exp as the timesink it is, you don't learn much from exping, if knight taunt got nerfed, you still wouldn't learn much from exping.  Raiding is where you learn the majority of things.  Of course, I might as well be talking to a wall for all the intelligent replies I get back /shrug</div></div><hr />

But then again lets see it from a paladin SKs point of wiev. At my lvl NToV/ssra stage. We don't use paladins or SKs at tanks on raids. So let them shine a tiny bit more in groups. Well just like wizards shine the most on raids and not as often in groups so does warriors.<br />

This does not work though.  At least with your wizzy, if you have a hard time finding a group, you can solo to kill time.  When I lfg...well, swimming maxed now, fishing maxed...read message boards far to much...Warriors have no other means to get exp other than to group(soloing may be slightly possible, but is not really a viable option).  So to get the levels and AA needed for raiding, we are slightly screwed.  If you do not raid, you are screwed.</div></div><hr />

I've seen slowers die before - everyone has - but compentent healers make that rare.  If 1 out of 20 pulls results in a failed taunt, that just keeps the slowers and healers on their toes. :)<br />

About 95% of the times that the mob doesnt stick on incomming is because of the slower.  A good shamen or enchanter will be rdy for that though.  Shamen usually buff themselves (well group buffs) enough to withstand a few hits.  In exp groups, ench's can chain stun long enough for you to regain aggro if taunt doesnt work the first time.  They only need a small amount of time till you regain that mob's attention.<br />
<br />
My issue is the initial aggro is the problem.  When and if I proc on inc, the mob usually is on me till the end of the fight.  The difference here is that paly's/sk's can proc 100% on incomming (spells) and we have only a small percentage to proc.  I shoot arrows at the mob but it isnt enough to counter that first slow.<br />
<br />
I dont lose aggro in the middle of a fight unless a) Im not paying attention, b) nukers are bored and overcast a bit, or c) other people are hitting taunt.  It is a pain in the butt that first 30 secs of a fight because you dont really want to wait too long to cast slow (tank needs more heals thus use more mana).  <br />
<br />
But seriously, 90% of the time I hit taunt to get it of the slower, I regain aggro.  On raids, its a bit different and people are on point more.  Tanks are given a bit of time to gain that initial aggro and then the mob is slowed.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect.  Everyone has problems using taunt.  Some people are just more accepting of the problems and consider it a challenging part of the game.  Others see it as a basic inequity between the tank classes and something that adds a completely random element to the situation that other tank classes don't have to deal with.<br />
<br />
With a Warrior tank everyone has to be that much more on top of their game.  They have to be that much more aware and attentive.  Some consider this good.  Some consider it bad.  I can show that more consider it bad than good because of the numbers of Knights getting groups over Warriors.  People don't want randomness added to their day just for experience.  They want to be able to do the exact same thing mob after mob and not have much in the way of a different reaction.  They certainly don't want to go through 3 mobs doing things the exact same way to suddenly have the 4th mob turn on them with a vengence and not have the Warrior able to get it off them.  This, for most people, the evidence clearly shows, is not 'fun'.<br />
<br />
Nerfing Knights will just make more people unhappy.  Warriors won't be happy because those who think taunt sucks will still believe it.  Knights won't be happy because they'll go from having reliable and predictable aggro control to having random and unpredictable aggro control which will reduce their attractiveness to a group.  Slowers won't be happy because now they'll have to work harder and even still they'll take more deaths.  Clerics won't be happy because now they'll have to pay a lot more attention all the time and still sometimes won't be able to keep a slower alive.  Basically no one wins, everyone loses.<br />
<br />
And to those who are endorsing the idea of a Knight nerf, would you care to list your email addresses so we can know where to direct the hate mail if the idea actually gets implemented? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe instead of improving taunt they could improve shield?  What they could do is:<br />
<br />
1) Take away reuse time, ie you can use it again and again, that way if people wanna bounce the mob from person to person you just follow that mob and shield the next person.  Or at least bump it down to something very short 10 seconds maybe<br />
<br />
2) Redistribute the damage taken from 75pct tank 50pct shieldee to 100pct tank 25pct shieldee, this would keep those aggro hogs alive much more reliably and yet still end up costing the same hp.<br />
<br />
3) Bump up the default amount of time it lasts, 20-30 seconds rather than 10<br />
<br />
<br />
That would probably be enough to keep casters alive while allowing them to pretty much act the same with a paly as with a warrior.  There would be a slight penalty still for using a warrior (since you are still healing 125pct damage while doing that) but with casters not nearly as worried about dieing as they are now.  It would also allow for more activity for the warrior, which imo is a good thing.<br />
<br />
It could easily be added as aa's or something to allow for this, but the aa's should be rather cheap and not have a bunch of pre-requisites, and should probably be available if not at lvl 51 at least by 55.</div></div><hr />

For exp groups, which is where I spend 90% of my time in EQ incidentally, a warrior tanking (me) means waiting for significant  period of time before casting slows so as not to take aggro from warrior-tank.  If Pally or SK is tanking (using spell aggro too), chanter/shammy can slow right away with little worry about taking aggro = less heals = which is more efficient  manna vs exp.   <br />
<br />
Glatius2 is right on, no one loves grinding period.  Most people don't mind it if the exp is flowing and they just want continual pulls with little interruption. I call those groups a well-oiled machine.  No one wants the &quot;whoops got to peel the mob of the shammy&quot; interruptions for a challenge BS.  And as a tank I don't enjoy that either especially when we loose the chanter from a ping, it's like I've failed.<br />
<br />
More importantly to the point, I'm not frustrated with other players its Sony I'm frustrated with for turning the Warrior class into something that needs to be handled with kid gloves.  That is frickin' anathema from the RP perspective.  Do any of the developers actually play the warrior class?  Seriously?</div></div><hr />

OMG, you are telling someone that their *opinion* is incorrect?? Wrongheaded, maybe, different from yours, clearly - but flat out wrong? I guess that poster just has a problem with taunt but does not realize it and even went so far as to expain why - geez he must be an utter moron. <br />
<br />
What arrogance! LOL!<br />
<br />
Glatius, *IMO*, your analysis is oversimplified in that most of the relevant issues have been conveniently abstracted away. You've established a chain of logic which does not hold together in terms of cause and effect, and cited flimsy 'evidence' which does not prove what you go on to state it proves. In short, your arguments are specious and your conclusions are erroneous, IN MY OPINION. <br />
<br />
Your argument is based on classic tyranny of the majority garbage. Goes something like: the majority of ppl want easy xps, and these ppl don't like challenges or being forced to actually pay attention to what they are doing when xping, or to learn annoying things like how to manage aggro (it's just not *fun*), and since SOE is all about the dollars, they will per force give the majority of ppl what they are whining for in order to keep those dollars flowing. <br />
<br />
So you pick a subset of folks with which you identify, refer to them as 'the people' (an implicit majority) and presume to speak for them, implying that 'the people' (= the majority of players) have expressed their satisfaction with the current status quo (instead of simply reacting to the conditions in which they find themselve - big surprise there!), and make the argument that SOE should change things to suit this subset. And then you paint this as 'the people's will'. <br />
<br />
How noble. I believe that this was a technique used to great effect by the Bolsheviks. And hey - 100% of Iraqis voted for Saddam Hussein to retain power a year or so ago - the people have spoken! I don't mean to get overly sarcastic here, but the fact is that people adapt remarkably well to whatever the circumstances in which they find themselves, by figuring out how best to leverage these circumstances to their own self interest, often short sighted, generally at the expense of other groups. To assume that under a different set of circumstances they would be less happy or have less fun is not provable as you seem to think.  <br />
<br />
Simply stated, the way I see this is: I am looking for a solution that provides a win for all players and for the game as a whole. You appear to be as well, with your talk of 'the people' - but 'the people' for whom you speak are a distinct minority in the universe of players. And even if they are a majority in the relevant subset of higher end players, that's no reason to simply accede to the tyranny of that majority. This ain't a democracy, which is a good thing because that way the overall game balance can be the criteria instead of squabbling camps of 'victim classes' competing against each other for goodies, which is exactly where your path leads. As James Madison pointed out, &quot;democracies...have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths&quot;.<br />
<br />
You go on to state that:<br />
<br />
Nerfing Knights will just make more people unhappy. ...Basically no one wins, everyone loses <br />
<br />
LOL - if everyone loses then why are there people on the other side of the debate from you? Or do those of us over here simply not know what's best for us, and you do? This statement is absurd on its face, and insulting to boot.<br />
<br />
IMO, the key criteria SOE should use to examine any changes to be made should be the overall impact to the entire universe of players of the game and the dynamic balance that exists between the levels and classes, with special attention paid to players who SOE perceives to be 'better' customers - that is, customers who pay more (multiple accounts, all expansions), pay further ahead (future revenue stream visibility), and are more likely to remain 'loyal' (mostly due to time/effort/money invested). Of course they are also free to implement easy changes for the noob levels in an attempt to capture the low hanging fruit, as we've seen them do quite recently. <br />
<br />
As for the 'give-warriors-the-same-aggro-as-pallies' crowd, that view seems to be rather popular here on the warrior's forum (big surprise), would imagine it somewhat less so on pally pages. <br />
<br />
And is making pallies pay a price in downtime medding for that kick ass aggro a 'nerf'?? Note I am not suggesting we take the pally snap aggro ability away - just that a clear cost be attached to it so that everybody then can see the tradeoff, and so that the playing field between war and knight will be more level.<br />
<br />
Why does it not make more sense to find a win for everyone, instead of a win only for warriors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I didn't call him a moron or anything of the kind.  It's more a definition issue than anything.  He doesn't deny that taunt doesn't work sometimes.  He doesn't deny that people die as a consequence from time to time.  He doesn't deny that it is completely random and out of our control.  He defines this as 'working as intended'.  I define it as 'broken all to hell'.  There is nothing wrong with my having the opinion that his definition is WRONG.  Yeah, I guess I'm arrogant for having a different definition of what 'working as intended' should be.    <br />
<br />
You go on to rant and rave about how flawed my arguements are and drawing some comparisons, which are completely meaningless, to the Iraqis voting for Suddam.  Nice, wonderful, so what?<br />
<br />
Do your arguements represent the majority more so than mine?  Seemingly not, since you characterize yourself as a 'serious' gamer and anyone who disagrees with you must therefore be a 'non-serious' gamer.  Sorry, but the 'serious' gamers are not the majority of players.  No, I can't produce facts and figures to support this after having done a poll of all the players on all the servers, but neither can you.  And common sense combined with every day logic supports my position much better than yours. <br />
<br />
You want aggro control to be random and unprerdictable.  You think this adds challenge.  I disagree.  I believe that it adds randomness and unpredictableness.  If all we wanted was randomness and unpredictableness why not just have one person in every zone, selected at random, recieve a death touch from no where once every 60 minutes, this would be challenge along the lines of what you discuss, wouldn't it?  I mean, it would be outside of our control and impossible to do much about, pretty much like a string of failed taunts.  And this way no one would blame the Warrior for not doing his 'job' when he hasn't been given the proper tools to do his 'job'.  Seems like a nice solution.<br />
<br />
And there in lies the problem.  With a Warrior a slower can effectively recieve a death touch.  The Warrior can be doing everything right.  He can be working his ass off to pull the mob off the slower.  And taunt just doesn't work.  Cleric is a little off his game, and down goes the slower.  You want this to be a part of everyone's game huh?  You believe this to be 'challenge'?  I believe it to be bullshit.  I'm glad I'm not playing in a game YOU designed, because if this is your idea of fun, I wouldn't want to play there.<br />
<br />
Why does it not make more sense to find a win for everyone, instead of a win only for warriors?<br />
<br />
Probably because no one but you and perhaps a couple of others consider your suggestions a 'win'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.. I painfully read thru yet another argument over warrior vs. pally taunt. I fall on the side of feeling that warrior taunt could use some improvement, but I know that I am pretty good at holding taunt and it isn't all about the /taunt hotkey.<br />
<br />
I do believe that the warrior is the hardest class to play. It requires skill that you can only build through gametime. Skill that isn't measured in points or some mathematical percentage.<br />
<br />
Some things that have happened recently have helped warriors a little bit. Increased agro from bowshots, and I've noticed some increased agro from damage.<br />
<br />
This is what I try to do...<br />
<br />
1) Get as many bowshots in on the mob as it is coming in.<br />
2) get directly between the mob and the puller.<br />
3) Time my attack so I do my first strike just as the mob gets to me <br />
4) Time my taunts as to when they make sense.. that is...<br />
Taunt right off the bat, or if I am in a group with a quick slower, then taunt right after the slow.<br />
Taunt whenever the mob turns<br />
Taunt right as my health bar starts moving from a CH or right after a small heal<br />
Taunt right after a major caster strike<br />
<br />
I may Taunt too much, but with the lag factor, I feel is makes more sense<br />
5) I have kick and disarm on the same key, I do that as often as I can.. helps DPS, chance to disarm the mob--lowering his DPS on me<br />
6) I also Beg on a hotkey.. some folks have added sit/stand to that... not sure I want to do that.<br />
7) Change weapons during the fight IF the weapon I am using does not seem to be having the effect I want.<br />
8) If another group member does pull agro, then I /shield and Taunt and position myself.<br />
9) And Position is always important.<br />
<br />
Maybe Beg and Disarm don't have any effect, but I don't know so I do it anyway. <br />
I have to pay attention to all the messages coming thru so I know what is going on in the group and when to taunt.<br />
<br />
One time, I was grouped with a guild candidate.. a pally the same level as me. He was playing the &quot;stud&quot; and kept trying to take agro with me being tank in the group. I could hold agro 75% of the time in some cases. But I also was using a 37/32 2HP, no proc, but the DPS pisses off the mobs.<br />
<br />
I had to leave, and he did hold agro better than I normally do in the group.  <br />
<br />
I can often take agro from Pallies, but one thing I have noticed is that Pallies do have to med from time to time. I don't try to take the agro from Pallies when they are &quot;tank&quot; but I have hit taunt by accident and taken it. <br />
<br />
A lot depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
I would like to see better ratio, low delay, war only weapons available sooner; higher AC/STR/STA/DEX/AGI war-only armor available sooner; and I'd like to see some +WIS or +INT line of items, war only, for tradeskilling, so warriors can make some of the items that come so easily for casters. OR, they make STR work for all tradeskills, like WIS/INT does.<br />
<br />
I don't expect Sony to fix Taunt. Honestly... they seem afraid to. Afraid that it would throw everything else totally out of balance.<br />
<br />
Bottomline. I am a Warrior. I accept what I am given to deal with. And I do the best I can with what I have.<br />

<br />
What needs to be done? Hell if I know, but something needs to give. They are aware of it, and haven't made a decision yet.<br />
<br />
My job as a warrior is to tank mobs if I understand the roll correctly. Prior to the insane DPS of PoP mobs this roll was well defined and worked as intended. Since the release of the expansion things have turned 180 degrees. <br />
<br />
Generally I find myself in the support role because I can't get a mobs attention in the time frame allowed. There is the golden 10 seconds at the start of a fight where the aggro is assigned and the hate list is generated. If I have a failed taunt it takes a couple of rounds to re-gain it, and alot of damage has been inflicted on the thin skin folks in the interum.<br />
<br />
Asking people to hold off until I have aggro works ok in a raid situation, but in an experience grind its a little tougher. Why bother waiting when another class fits the tank roll better in this situation?<br />
<br />
We give up everything to be able to be a formidable foe to our enemies. All that is for not when we can't get them pissed off enough to swing at us. <br />
<br />
The line between Knights and warriors has been blurred so much that the benefits we once had have been erroded to the point of being sub-standard for anything that doesn't require /disc defensive. The number of experience grind level mobs that need this 1 trick can be counted on less than five fingers I bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having said that,<br />
<br />
The real truth is that what is broken is the &quot;aggro gap&quot; between warriors and Knights, much moreso than anything else.   <br />
<br />
There seems to be almost universal agreement with this, that there's this gap which hurts warriors.  <br />
<br />
Some like to think that the solution is to bring warriors up to a level near the paladin and SK, ot bring the paladin/SK down near the level of the warrior. <br />
<br />
Those who favor bringing warriors up to the level of the warrior cite the overwhelming favoring of knights to tank in PoP as evidence that the playerbase favors Paladin/SK like aggro, and interpreting this to mean that the playerbase as a whole desires this type of aggro generation.   They also cite the grief that would or could be expressed by Knights if their aggro generation went away.<br />
<br />
Those who favor bringing Paladin/SK aggro generation down a few notches, or implementing a downtime &quot;cost&quot; to it, feel that a &quot;challenge&quot; makes the game interesting, and making warriors aggro machines would remove the challnege, and therefore the fun, and skill required to play.<br />
<br />
I happen to agree the most with the latter, but would also like to see a more substantial defensive difference between warriors and knights so that one is CLEARLY better at melee than the sub-groups.<br />
<br />
KEI being castable on lower level toons... it's really really popular, you can go into PoK and see lines of people with platinum pieces in hand waiting for their turn in the KEI line.<br />
<br />
KEI being castable on anyone happens to be one of the worst things about the game, because it removes the challenge, it makes it a 2 week journey to level 60 if you're a caster, and the only &quot;challenge&quot; is the time between when KEI runs out and when you can get back to POK.   <br />
<br />
It's popular... but it's terrible at the same time.   <br />
<br />
I feel the same way about Knight aggro, it's popular, but being popular doesn't necessarily make it good.   People should not be necessarily humored in their gluttony, it's bad for them.   There's currently a gluttony in EQ, which is &quot;The path of least resistance&quot;, things that are &quot;hard&quot; are viewed as necessarily bad, which is terrible for EQ as a whole.   Taunt is the one thing that they've stood their ground on, and while it sucks for us, it would be FAR better for the game to have the tank classes all have it a bit harder rather than mindless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really on topic, but sitting isn't a good way to get aggro.  Sitting is good for positioning a mob, but for total aggro, sitting might get the mob to hit you once, but the instant that you stand up, whatever sit aggro you had is gone, and you are lower on the aggro list than if you had just stood there meleeing.  <br />
<br />
The only effective use of sit aggro other than positioning the mob that I can think of is sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where you are above another char in aggro sitting but not standing, so you can buy a little time by sitting down a ways from the aggro person, pulling the mob over to you, standing when it gets to you, and then sitting when it is almost to the other person and making it run back to you like a yo-yo.  <br />
<br />
Sitting during regular melee though would be counterproductive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can make an arguement for this, that I don't deny.  But look at the tendency of the game over all.  Has it been a steady increasing of challenges outside of a raid environment?  Has it been a steady holding of the level of challenges outside of a raid environment?  The answer to both questions is no.  PoP zones are designed for the most part with mindless grinding in mind.  Much more uber Dreadlands than Chardok or Sebilis, wouldn't you agree? <br />
<br />
The only classes that have maintained the same level of challenge has been the Warrior and the other pure melee.  Everyone else pretty much has gotten bells and whistles that make it easier.   You're saying that maybe some of these bells and whistles really shouldn't be there.  Okay, maybe so.  But they are.  And taking them away at this point is going to cause a hell of lot bigger stir than not letting low level characters have KEI.<br />
<br />
Something does have to give.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because with a knight tanking, the slower can slow earlier. therefore taking less damage.  This alone offests the improved tanking of a warrior, not to mention with a warrior tanking healing is going to others in the group in addition to the warrior at times.  When mana is an issue(which is rarely), knights make a group more mana efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raznor</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a Paladin and from what I've observed out side of PoP warriors are still as efficent as they have always been.  It's when your fighting mobs that hit for 300+ a shot that there's a problem, the damage can cut through even a warrior pretty quick and often shamans and enchanters have to debuff on top of slow sooner then they would like.  It's a problem of snap aggro, as some of you have mentioned, in most of the groups I've been in after some ping ponging of the mob the warrior is fine.  The simpliest solution to this is to just give the warrior class some sort of snap agro skill with a modest refresh, nothing huge but at least something to give them some leeway if a chanter or shaman have to slow quickly.  <br />
<br />
As for Paladin agro I will say that an adjustment isn't out of  the question.  For example, I usually use stun, holy might and force  to chain stun, in order to use that combination, in an exp. group, I need at least c2 on top of an earring of solstice and it helps if someone else pulls. In that case I'm paying a price for agro and the stun time those spells provide but, I can load cease (level 9 stun) and desist (level 15 stun) and hold agro with those without any mana regen other than one flowing thought and my natural regen (no AA in it yet).  That shouldn't be possible 50 some levels after I got those spells.  In my opinion our lower level stuns need their agro output adjusted so they can't be used to hold agro in the higher levels, even though you may give up a chain stun to use them it makes holding agro easy and close to cost free.<br />
<br />
    Other than that though I don't see the SK and Paladin classes as needing any nerf.  First of all, in order to close the agro gap between the warrior and knight class would take a huge nerf, you could eliminate all but two of my stuns, double the mana cost and half the agro output and I could still hold agro well in exp. groups.  Also, SK's and paladins work as secondary tanks and part of being a second tank is gaining fast agro, helping a warrior with his agro by piggybacking it etc. Not to mention, even if you nerfed knights, warriors would still be in the same boat, not able to get agro fast enough in PoP zones.  <br />
<br />
Anyways to close this out I was grouping in PoN tonight along with a warrior in my guild.  Now he's well equip., knows how to play and he still had some trouble with agro slipping over to the chanter.  I offered to boost his agro with stuns by building up my agro then letting him take it and that work well, I usually didn't take more damage than I could heal and the group was secure.  During this I got into tells with the druid in the group, he mentioned how if he needed me to boost like that he should get weapons with some hate proc.  I said that a warrior shouldn't have to depend so heavily on weapon proc in order to play his class well.  I'd say that's the core of this topic, once it gets to a point that a warrior, well equiped, grouping with similar level players who know how to manage agro can't keep it in check effectivly there needs to be a change.  Just improve warrior agro. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menon</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a shadowknight, so I'm very interested in this subject.  Warrior taunt will be rebalanced, and how it is rebalanced will affect my viability in xp groups and on raids.  Although I love being the #1 preferred tank in xp groups, it is obviously unfair to warriors and poor game design.<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion for a fix.  Add a new ability for warriors, available from level one.  This ability allows warriors to dramatically increase their aggro generation for a short burst of time.  During this time, the warrior would take slightly more damage than normal.  This ability would not work while a warrior is in defensive mode.<br />
<br />
By having a trade-off for the aggro generation, its use is strategic instead of just another button to mash.<br />
<br />
I'm not sold on the exact implementation details yet, but something like this.  Every minute, a warrior could push a button that would increase their aggro generation by 1%/level for 15 seconds.  During this 15 seconds, no dodge/parry/riposte checks would be made for hits against the warrior.<br />
<br />
Essentially, this allows the warrior to grab some aggro at the beginning of a fight (like a knight stunning/snaring on inc) while negating the hp/ac advantage of being a warrior during that time.  Ideally the amount of additional aggro an average-equipped warrior would generate (without procs) would be enough to offset a slow.  <br />
<br />
This would be a much-needed boost for warriors in xp groups, and shouldn't affect raid encounters at all.<br />

after struggling through 60+ levels of /lfg on (and there are still those who dont think we are tanks /sigh), i had countless occurences of just wasting hours trying to get a group.  And countless times ive had to go through the &quot;/tell lamini oh, sorry, a warrior is lfg now, and the group doesnt want a paladin, bye&quot;, or &quot;/ooc paladin lfg&quot;, &quot;xxx shouts group seeks TANK!&quot;, /ooc paladin lfg, .... then there was the old if i was /role or /anon with /lfg tag &quot;Are you a tank?&quot;, &quot;yes, a paladin&quot;, &quot;nm&quot;.<br />
I got sick of the &quot;level 60 TANK 1300AC 5000hp unbuffed LFG!&quot; message in old seb or velks, specially when i was sitting around 2500hp unbuffed though i could buff up to 3khp and 900AC+ with a symbol and brells.<br />
PoP comes out...<br />
<br />
Paladins get Force of Akilae (5 second stun), and Qellious Words of Tranquility (~10sec stun).<br />
<br />
Im level 62 in Plane of Nightmares doing consorts group and the warrior steps down from tanking for me... and i say, you crazy?  i dont even raid, you probably got twice my hps (was currently 2500hp unbuffed, and i didnt even know what virtue/focus was).  Next thing you know, im stunning level 60-64 mobs with FoA... long enough for the malos/slow/CH to land and me keep ALL agro.  I come back at level 64 for memories sake now at 3000hp unbuffed with a little bit better gear, with my new QWoT stun... im stunning the same mobs a whole lot longer... though my mana pool gets low faster (was like 133wis with KEI).  <br />
<br />
At 65 in PoS pickup minis raid (with 3500hp unbuffed), a uber guilded 9300hp+ warrior joins, and im no longer MA (talk about a biatch to heal during downtimes).  After about 1hr cleric says &quot;im using more mana on this warrior than on you!&quot;, me and warrior were friends, and im drooling at all his uber armor from elemental plains... then tells me that hes gonna step down because i managed agro better.  All went well, he liked doing damaged and was tired of tanking (like me).  And if I was to go down, im sure he wouldve easily taken my spot.<br />
<br />
THere were problems of course, like the giants that procced instant oom.  oom paladin=gimped warrior.  Warriors will always be THE tank.  Its just these days, as someone mentioned, people cast snare on mobs as soon as INC, slow as soon as mob is INC, nuking as soon as mob is INC (literally, dang Ebay)... even knights can have problems with these (yes we do).  You want to really see something?  put a group in PoTactics, with the constant adds there and only having 1 tank paladin, ive come close to oom, as we rely HEAVILY on mana, granted with KEI+ we can do ok, but after gruop heals, fast heals, stuns, stuns, stuns, self buffs... ive went oom before and had nothing to do but mash taunt, thus being in a warriors shoes.  The exp group has slackened and depended on the knights agro capabilities.  <br />
Warriors have a buttload of high end non no drop weapons WITH procs (proc=no mana agro spell), while we do not (/sigh old windblade), and im sure that procs do a lot as far as agro goes (no taunting, i can keep undead agro with slay undead3 and undead slaying weapons, vs undead mobs anyday).<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights tanking<br />
No need to worry about aggro<br />
-Downside of this group? Knights have lower hps/ac/dps making an issue over downtime&quot;<br />
<br />
sorry to tell you, but paladins would disagree, and even the knowledgable warriors.  Paladins dont need hps in EXP groups .  We have stuns, cast FoA and QWoT=14+ second stun.  On adds i can out live a 9khp warrior anyday (without using divine aura or lay hands P).  However we will alwas have the lower dps, since we're not true warriors... Though i believe you'll NEED all those hit points due to the fact the you get riposted a lot more with your dual wielding weapons.  I dont know about the 120-130dps for knights ive seen here, i highly doubt it.  Id be lucky to do 80-90dps tanking in BoT/PoT, heck 70dps (prismatic lance+windblade ... parsed by Yalp 2.0).  Thats ok, i can live with being the lowest dps in Everquest, next to clerics anyway.  IMO i have no problems stepping down from MA just because a warrior logs on, i think warriors are too well suited for tanking, you'll have to pay me to log on AAs for tanking, heck no, im after that much sought after dps so the wannabe-paladin clerics stop pulling agro from me :(... i also solo a lot, for farming gems, faction, quests... bla bla bla<br />
<br />
We  all got our special moments from what ive been through ive learned that:<br />
warriors=THE tank<br />
paladins=THE undead slayer, and tank (when there are no other warriors online)<br />
*ps* some of you guys are better than you think you are, warriors will always be the best tanks, and knights will always be the best support tanks with our instant agro getting abilities.   if i wait the usual ~10 sec to attack in a exp group, the warrior will keep agro the entire fight with no problem.  Until the other tanks get a real discipline (ya right), i dont think you guys have nothing to worry about as far as exp groups... i just hate grouping with warriors with non proccing weapons (sigh).<br />
also, whats with all the hate that hybrids can instantly get and keep?  its been like this since day 1, any caster can do this. Tell your gruop/raid to back the )@#$ up on INCS, no one touches mob but you for 10+ sec (longer for raids obviously), problem solved.</div></div><hr />
