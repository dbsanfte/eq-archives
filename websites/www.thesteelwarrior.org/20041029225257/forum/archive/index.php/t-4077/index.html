<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Uh, hands down ornate. 8ac 15hp upgrade. Not much of a question. Resists are a negligable difference. Combine it with the ornate clicky effect, which is amazing if you don't have a shaman, and there is no competition at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LDoN is better than both though, so ya might wanna condider that...plus it's decent exp while grinding for it...plus it's upgradable. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Considering that I didn't have to do 60 adventures or so to make my ornate bp decent, and got the money doing exp, I'd say that you really can't compare them so easily. Remember you can just as easily add a 40 hp aug to the ornate bp, which narrows the gap. Don't forget the buff either. It's very nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah that 300 plus HP buff is not to be scoffed at when your without a sham in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you already have BP of erad, you might as well skip the ornate, it's not that much of an upgrade. ornate *is* actaully better, but not by much. assuming your on a DKP guild, you'll probably really have to pay for it over the other plate classes, which, in my opinion, wont be worth it for a minimal upgrade. you'd be better off focusing on other slots. after you max out your raid sta, you should start looking for pure HP items, i'd start by looking for items with around 30-50 hp for each slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im at the point now I would take whatever drops first. Im still using a FH BP and find my chest is one of the most lacking slots I have. Weve done the giant in BoT that drops it a half dozen times and it only dropped once, and I lost out in the bidding for it. Weve done SoRZ a couple times now too and once again I lost out in the bidding process. I have enough points for either and if I could choose I would go for the KIzrak's, but again whatever drops first Im not picky at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all your guys's input, Just wanted to know what you all thought about the 2 breastplates. I won Breastplate of Eradication going from a 30 ac Bp to a 55 Bp with awsome stats and 100hps which I never thought I would get with my schedule off a cool mob never thought i would get to kill SoRZ, IoRZ and AoW hehe go figure anyways Loveing my Breastplate of Eradication thats for sure. <br />
<br />
