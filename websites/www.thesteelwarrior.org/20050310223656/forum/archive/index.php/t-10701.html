So I figured this would be the most appropriate place.  So, I'm the new guy here scoping out the threads and it seems you have a plethra of information and a lot of experienced Warriors.  So for the time being i'll just sit back and soak it all in untill I actually have a suggestion, but i'm pretty sure you guys have it all covered.  :)  Great site by the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
great idea sir</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naulab</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.luna-fx.com/thedsp/piechart1.jpg <br />
<br />
The sample in the above pie chart is from a sample of 100 random warriors on the Brell Serilis server.  The results are slightly skewed because most of the people I asked are friends of mine, and well. Drunk people are more fun to play EQ with.<br />
<br />
As shown in the above pie chart(one regarding to the use/after effects of beer, so it's ok to use a pie chart). Roughly 95% of all warriors are drunk or working to become so while playing. 4% of the warriors polled tried to play off as being drunk by throwing in strategically misspeeled words, but aside from that they were very alert and attentive and fulfilled their roles as tank perfectly. Where on the other hand a vast majority of the drunk warriors would often be known to incite/bellow themselves just because it leaves a funny looking icon and the emote of yelling at yourself is mildly amusing. While also finding it entertaining to rampage mezed mobs or turning a mob on enrage to wake people up (personal favorite of mine).<br />
<br />
Now this odd outlier, that didn’t fit into either of the categories of warriors, the Soberious Warrious Phenomenon. Or more commonly referred to as the sober warrior.  After careful inspection of this warrior I believe them to have been a macroed bot. Every fight the same thing, never a word. Not even a single joke. This warrior didn't laugh, they didn't cry. They just chugged ever forward, mob after mob after mob.  On many attempts I would skele nuke on my necro to get some form of reaction (most melee classes absolutely HATE this)  but never so much about f*ing necros and their f*ing annoying skele nukes that mess up melee range.  I'm going to write this one particular Sober Warrior spotting as perhaps a false alarm.... but it very well could have been one.  If more of these sober warriors start appearing the fabric of EQ will start to crumble and come crashing down upon us.  For a sober warrior is just one of those things that shouldn't exist. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now to further my studies on what drives a drunk Warrior I dig into the mind of a particular tank known as Armegedon of brell serilis, also know as Troll Whaz!  This one warrior I have raided with for a little over a year and grouped with him back in my earlier unenlightened days (I played as a necro). Many a nights have we spent killing stuff while he drank and slowly the average xp grind became more and more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
After about an hour of solid drinking the cleric could expect fun things, such as the tank deciding he’s a monk and trying to hold agro with punching alone, ladies and gentlemen (yea right gentlemen) of TSW this is not possible.  Another spot of fun is playing retro troll and trying to hold agro using an old SSOY and Lammy (why he carried them around is beyond me) once again, not possible. There are numerous other well documented cases of said warrior to tank while not wearing any pants, in game and out of game.  I could ramble on and on about the drunk warrior that is our beloved Armegedon, but alas I have a limited time before I might actually have work fall onto my desk that must get finished.<br />
<br />
So we move onto the raiding aspect of the drunk warrior.  A drunk warrior may or may not believe that he is damn well uber enough to tank ALL the adds of the battle master event in RCoD. Ladies and gentlemen, once again no… you can’t.  On a few all day time raids I have seen the aforementioned tank accept a res and forget to loot his gear, only to be made painfully aware of this when the time to tank comes up again.<br />
<br />
Now at this point you may be thinking, but Naulab, it seems like your drunk tank is a liability on raids! Why do you put up with it! Make that troll go sober and pwn up on everything!  I tell you this, EQ is a game, a drunk warrior,  none-the-less a drunk TROLL warrior is one of the most amusing things you will ever come across.  Now I will admit, when we do things such as time and other raid events that have achieved the status of “recruit twinkfests” Arme and our other drunk warriors cut loose and have a good time. Much to the delight of their fellow guildies.  But when the time to be serious on a challenging raid comes up, a drunk troll is the meanest, most attuned to the game tank I have ever seen. <br />
<br />
These are the conclusions that I have arrived at based on the data I have collected through various encounters with the drunk, seemingly drunk, pretending to be drunk, and probably macroed warriors.  I implore you to seek out your own conclusions as to why a drunk tank is your friend. If you enjoyed this post, or are ever bored enough throw brell.Armegedon a x-server tell of  TROLL WHAZ! or me brell.naulab a GNOME WHAZ!<br />

Maybe I should give a little backround about myself...  :)   20years old, been a US Army MP (Military Police) for 2 years currently between trasfers from the 810th MP Co. in Tampa, FL to 16th MP Ft. Bragg, NC.  Just came back from an 18month deployment in Iraq Aug. 2003, I have a few stories to tell, but nothing to tell here... ;)   Got back into playing EQ in Dec, but started playing EQ in '99.  So there you go, just a little info on myself to break you all in so when I post something rediculous I can just blame it on PTSD.  :)</div></div><hr />

replace warrior with shaman and you just described every one of my old shammy guildmates on terris. i even had the screenshots to prove it (one even had the aa skill 'tittymez' )</div></div><hr />

No they really don't pay me enough.  Then again all I do is read eq boards and mess around on the net for 80% of the time I am here. Glad you enjoyed it.</div></div><hr />

He also chewed tobacco. Well, one day he's running a bit behind, so he takes his can of beer back to work with him. He goes back to his office, closes the door and starts working. He figures that given the work schedule for the day, it's unlikely that anyone will bother him. Well, he's about half way through his beer, which is sitting on his desk, when the door opens and his boss comes in.<br />
His boss starts talking to him about some work project, and for a minute doesn't see the beer can. But then the boss does see it sitting on the desk and stops in mid sentence.<br />
So the guy casually reaches out, picks up the beer, and spits into it.<br />
The boss figures it's just an empty for chewing tobacco, finishes what he has to say, and goes out.<br />
The guy told the rest of us later that it was a horrible, horrible moment because he had to choose in that instant whether to lose his job or ruin half a beer. Was not an easy decision.<br />
&quot;Beer...job? Job....beer? That was what I was thinking,&quot; he told us later. &quot;Good thing it wasn't a full beer.&quot;</div></div><hr />
