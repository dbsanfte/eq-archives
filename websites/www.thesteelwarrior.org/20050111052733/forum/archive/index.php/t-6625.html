<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many &quot;points&quot; of endurance do we regen per tic?<br />
<br />
The Heightened Endurance AA only adds 1 per level on that regen, but if the amount we regen per tic is 10, that is a good increase, if it is less than 10 it is really nice.  However, I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to be around 27-28 end / tick. Like mana I would say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So adding 1, 2 or 3 points to it is pretty negligible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see it like this, a cleric can cast a spell costing 250mana, FT 3 makes a nice differance on the long haul to them. Regening the same number of points should have a similer effect.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed was that with out it on a easy mission if I did nothing but incite every mob (killing fast) my end would go down over time and not come back till I stoped killing. With it I regen some back over time. With a large END pool and regen I can use an ability at the start of a large mob fight and start regening END right away, usualy the MA will last till defensive drops so by the time MA's usualy die I can be ready to AoET furrious and transition in to defnesive and have the END to last through them all.<br />
<br />
Of course if you rarely use your abilitys then it is likely not a very good one for you to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gains from heightened endurance seems comparable to FT.  It's not something you notice but it helps if you're actually using it up.  Though granted that only happens if you're MAing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small increases in mana (or in this case end) over time have always been better in practice than in theory. Since this isn't in-game, I can only go over the theory aspect. I'm not a warrior, so some stuff could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Heightened Endurance keeps endurance running in two forms; Regeneratively, like FT is to mana, and Mitigatively, similar to Mana-Preservation effects but time-based instead of being percentage-based.<br />
<br />
Regeneratively:<br />
<br />
HE3's regenerative effect is easy to calculate: 3 end per tick, 30 end per minute. In theory, here on this board, that is negligible. Taking a longer-term approach, that 3 end per tick gives an extra Incite (250) every 84 ticks (approximately) - 8 minutes and 24 seconds. Over a 45-minute LDoN mission, that's 1350 extra endurance; just over 5 free incites. Nothing earth-shattering, but for warriors having trouble inciting everything in fast groups such as LDoN, this can help tip the balance. Over a longer, sustained xp group (doesn't matter where or what level of content), in a span of 3 hours, that 3 end per tick adds up to 5400; about 21 and a half incites. Keep in mind that extra end can be spent on more than incite, and even warriors with high endurance pools, and/or don't usually have problems managing incite, can make use of this. I'm just a cleric, but I can see the value of things like Fortitude+AE Taunt on a bad pull every once in a while (Fortitude &gt; Furious in that if the server is lagging a little behind, a riposte at the exact moment an add is mezzed can break that mez), a defensive-type disc if there's a named or even if the group healer is hurting for mana but the group doesn't want to stop pulling, a free offensive disc for fun, etc.<br />
<br />
Discussing HE3 in theory, here on this board, 5400 end over 3 hours can still be seen as pretty negligible. In practice, in the field, this is primarily the exact same argument for casters and Mental Clarity; and that little bit can be pretty significant. I've never met a caster that didn't notice their first point of FT. Raid-buffed, getting over 100 mana per tick, I'll still notice if I'm missing something small in comparison like Spiritual Dominion, or if I'm Mind Wracked, etc. Every little bit really does help (at least in terms of mana), and HE3 is the only little bit that increases endurance regen.<br />
<br />
Mitigatively:<br />
<br />
Going beyond this &quot;FT for melees&quot; idea, Heightened Endurance also helps while a warrior is using discipline(s). Other than the paladin self-only regeneration line of spells, there are no spells that cost nothing to cast, but cost mana over time. Unless I'm reading Lucy's raw data wrong (the page detailing discs, costs and timers here seems to have been lost temporarily, I think it used to be under &quot;Trainin'&quot;), discs are exactly that, which allows HE3 to mitigate part of the cost of using them.<br />
<br />
HE3's 3 endurance per tick mitigation, while using a longer defensive disc, adds up over time, just as it does regeneratively. Reducing Stonewall's upkeep from 11 end per tick to 8 cuts the total cost of the entire disc from 330 to 240. This mitigation is a constant over time (3 per tick) and so the 3-minute discs will always save 90 endurance; 96 combined with Furious/Fortitude.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, for tanking named mobs where a warrior is using multiple disciplines, HE3 mitigating the cost of every disc will somewhat help prevent the warrior from running out of end while the disc is still active, and possibly allow the warrior to follow the defensive-type disc with Charge - if every attack lands, then that should be up to 30 seconds after defensive drops that riposte-spikes are still not an issue. Charge's upkeep is 42 per tick (45 minus the 3 from HE3), and so the savings from mitigating the cost of defensive alone should be enough for at least 2 ticks of Charge.<br />
<br />
HE3 seems to make a difference both in raids and groups, but its actual value in practice, and whether or not it's worth the 18aa to max it, would depend on your current setup and current needs.<br />

Second aa i got after sturdiness.  Its the second most important aa in god, yes its better than wa 5.  The effects are very noticeable, and we need as much regen as we can get end game.  Doing tier 4 + 5 in time i rarely have more than 15 mins between tanking.  I use about 60% end per mob depending if i have furious up or not, and dont bellow when it pops half of the time in case i need my end for another disc.  If you have no end you lose any advantage to being a warrior, and so as it is it takes about 20 mins to regen a full bar of endurance.</div></div><hr />

How in the hell can this be better than WA5? Think about what you're saying for a second. You ONLY need incite when tagging a mob of a puller, or first engaging a mob; after that, it's just fluff. And believe me, you will get 10, 20, 30x more agro from WA5 than if you use bellow everytime it pops while tanking a mob. This I guarantee you.<br />

I have 0 Endurance problems, (unless I am messing around soloing) and even if I did have small endurance issues, I wouldn't trade WA1 (let alone 5...)  for some measly endurance regen.</div></div><hr />

You blow 2 discs on rz in time + furious bellow ect and have enough to pull bertox 10 minutes later?  Bullshit.</div></div><hr />

Now if Incite is the only thing I use endurance on in an XP group HE 1 gives me just enough of a boost that my endurance pool essentially lasts forever.  For boss fights where you burn through Furious + Defensive + Fellstrike + 3 Incites in the space of 4 minutes it's not going to help you much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 minutes later and furious isnt up to use.   Unless you sit there and spam bellow you shouldnt be using much at all, once or twice is plenty.   You should still have around 50-60% after the first kill then get to sit around for 10 minutes before the next pull and you are up 80%+  without regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't imagine most people tank everything and unless you're using incite/bellow every chance (which isn't really required), you would still have enough for defensive for another fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure endurance regen is good but in raiding situations it isnt worth the aa's yet.   I will get it near last.    If you solo alot, it would be great to have so you can hit your heal every 5 minuets.    I am only elemental geared with a couple pieces from time as well so dont have crazy amounts of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With ease?<br />
<br />
Besides, if I DID run out, it's a rare occurance. WA% benefits me much, much, much more than that single occurance where I *may* run out of endurance.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I never run out of endurance here, I'm saying you're insane for saying it's better than WA5, that's all.</div></div><hr />

If I have full endurance it's pretty hard to run out.  Pretty much have to be tanking over 20 minutes nonstop to use up all endurance even if I use Furious (though it's quicker if you use Fellstrike as well) which just doesn't happen very often.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's better than WA, but it's my 5th GoD AA (SJ/Sturidness/WA5/Sinister Strikes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure how other people do in exp groups, but i chain pull with bellow for hours in 2nd castle in pofire, and i generally stay pretty full on endurance.  I think after about 7 hours of pulling with bellow, I finally started to get down around 10-20%, and yes we were killing fast :P</div></div><hr />

 Taking a longer-term approach, that 3 end per tick gives an extra Incite (250) every 84 ticks (approximately) - 8 minutes and 24 seconds<br />
<br />
So, 1 maybe 2 extra incites/bellows, that you don't use half the time anyway, makes a difference to you?<br />
<br />
If you've got that little between fights, you can't be using furi/fort most fights anyway. <br />

Saying it's more important than WA5 reserves you the entire back seat on the short bus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes i tank everything in time post tier 4, and often have to hold up raid to regen enough stamina to safely tank depending on the mob and duration of the fight.  WA 5 is nice, but did you honestly have any problems with aggro before god came out?  I sure as hell didnt, wa 5 is simply a luxury.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno man, I'd think the easiest way to fix the fact that you have endurance issues would be to not tank every damn mob in potime. Still, though, if you only used Defensive when it popped, you'd have regen the endurance expenditure back well before Defensive repopped; but you choose to bellow for the errr... 1 Enraging blow worth of agro. . .  Weapon affinity 5 is a 50% increase in proc rates. Just a little bit better than bellow, I'd imagine.<br />
<br />
Pointless arguing, you're just trying to justify the fact that you made a dumb statement to begin with. Either that, or you really are this stupid.</div></div><hr />

You've been farming Quarm for 5 months and don't have another warrior who can tank while you 'med' instead of holding up the raid to wait for you? Ouch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of the 6 ish active warriors in my guild, the top tank has about 13.1 hp buffed, and the lowest has i want to say 12.4 or 5.  Everyone tanks every day that we raid, and for the main purpose you just mentioned.  <br />
<br />
No one wants to wait will a single tank meds endurance, thats simply retarded.  I suggest you gear up your other tanks in a hurry and share the duties so that raids go smoother and faster.  If you only have 1 tank that the guild feels they can rely on what happens when you die?<br />

<br />
But seems to me even if you're tankings gods back to back, you at least shouldn't fall behind very far if you're just using defensive or evasive?  Bellow is a luxury, not a necessity.  I use it only if I feel aggro is going to be very close and this doesn't happen much in Time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty much an oxymoron now.   You say did you honestly have any problems with agro before god came out?    If you don't have any problems holding agro then why even use your incite/bellow at all?   Use it once or twice bud.     After the first kill, furious is down for 30 minutes.     That leaves you with defensive and your incites/bellows for the next 2 or 3 kills.    If you don't have any issues holding agro like you state above, then you can kill incite/bellow out of the loop.   This leaves you with defensive for the next mob.     Defensive doesnt last an entire time god fight.    in the 10 minutes after (without endurance aa) you will regen a good 20-25% of it back.   Which is MORE than what def uses in the first place.   <br />
<br />
The math you are trying to present doesnt make sense.   You must be spamming your incites/bellows at every single opportunity.   In this case, I pitty your raid if they have to sit and wait on you to gather enough to use defensive again.   In 10 minutes after the god fight, it is refreshed and you have already regen'd enough to use it again 2 or 3 more times.</div></div><hr />

Possibly a stealth nerf?? I know that it used to be replenished by the time Bellow was available again, or very close to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely just due to different group makeup and varying pulling speeds. I have less problems with end now since +end is on items. <br />
<br />
I really only run into trouble when I use furious + defensive on one mob and then need defensive/evasive again right when it pops with no break in pulls between the named.</div></div><hr />
