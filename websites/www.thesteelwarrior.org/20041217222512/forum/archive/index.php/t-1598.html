<br />
Paladins get a round one.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights don't get one, but they get some sort of altar with really spooky candles around it.<br />
<br />
Monks get a tiny one with a little tea set.<br />
<br />
Rangers can forage and eat with their hands, so they don't get one either.<br />
<br />
Rogues have to steal theirs, but they can sell them and keep stealing new ones to make money.<br />
<br />
Beastlords get a dish with the words Fido, Fluffy or Snookums available to it.<br />
<br />
And Bards have to sing at the Warriors' tables.<br />
<br />
I forget which levels these all apply to.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clerics, they get an expensive wooden alter with more carving than is necessary, covered in the richest cloth they can find, with golden candlesticks, and a really big silver cup filled with watered down wine.<br />
<br />
Druids are like rangers, they eat with their hands, and wipe em off on the grass, they get a blanket with a basket full of PB&amp;J samiches, and warm soda.<br />
<br />
Shammys get a little stone table, covered with Rat skulls, bat wings, feathers from weird birds, and various jars filled with lizard parts.<br />
<br />
Mages summon one whenever they need to eat, usually accompanied by some form of elemental to wait on them.<br />
<br />
Wizards port around till they find a mage, and eat dinner with them.<br />
<br />
Necromancers are like shadowknights, they get a black stone alter, coverd in spooky candles, spiders, and other rodents of ill omen.<br />
<br />
Enchanters pick a table they like, and convince the owner it was theirs to begin with.</div></div><hr />

We have no idea how the dmg tables are made. Its a well kept secret.<br />
However we have found out what is the formula used.<br />
<br />
DMG =  (Weapon dmg * X) + Damage Bonus<br />
<br />
X = DMG Table Factor, and this number varies from 0 to 6.<br />
<br />
0-6 beeing determined by the famous dmg tables using :<br />
Melee ATK, Melee Skills, Melee Bonus (monk only),Mob Mitigation<br />
<br />
So the avg warrior at 65 will probably use 3 in PoV<br />
The well geared 4, and the raid buffed 5.<br />
(Warrior ATK beeing the deciding factor, like 1400 vs 2100)<br />
<br />
<br />
