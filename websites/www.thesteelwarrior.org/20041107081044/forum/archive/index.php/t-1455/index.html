<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kadore Damadred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been reading some of what has been posted, here and a little on PoN, I tend to group with friends and in guild raids, what little things we try to pull off. <br />
<br />
 Seems on days when just haveing a good run on procs, I have no problem getting aggro and holding it, bounce every so often <br />
on slow, rarely on initial tash, and cripple<br />
<br />
 Pick up groups seem a different situation to me, alot of times, when do find a group, its usually not a well balanced group , trying to use a Enchanter as main slower and they seem to cast tash on inc before I've even hit attack, I still agree with what has been said a few times, were not so broken as people seem to think and people forget , its not a warriors job to lock aggro, its your job to let me have aggro and keep it<br />
<br />
 I dont have any interest in more aa, more Disc's, I'd like to see a big difference in my proc rate between 135 dex and 255 dex, haveing all the AC/HPT's in the world mean nothing, if I cant get the mobs attention, and Dps doesnt get it done these days, too much has changed since FBSS, Crafted and dual SSoY's were the end game <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Increased proc rates won't help those of us who use dps for aggro.  And yes, dps aggro can work.  Now, if they gave us an innate ability to proc, which we could turn on or off, that added hate, then proc rates might be a viable option for increasing warrior aggro.  But otherwise, you're still relying on getting the right weapons, and leaving good weapons unused and worthless due to no aggro proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kadore Damadred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">didnt consider that , just from what have seen so far, hasn't thrilled me much<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, in exp groups I find myself hoping to get a proc off before the slow or tash lands, if one of my weapons procs I can hold through the slow np but if it doesn't I either have to have a well timed succesful taunt, sometimes I just still keep aggro through dps, or I lose aggro and /shield the slower.  In tier 1 planes it wasn't that big of a deal, I set up a hotkey that sends a tell to the slower if I get an early proc and then they slow right away, and usually if I needed to I'd get enough time to tank the mob unslowed to hold aggro through either way but now in PoV/PoS, since things basically need to be slowed asap, its a real pain hoping that my weapons proc within 5-10 seconds to hold through the slow.  Shamans are easy usually to keep aggro off of and if they pull aggro they can take a few hits or stand there for a sec while I taunt off but chanters on the otherhand, tash just pulls so much aggro and then the fact that they have to tash then slow, harder to keep aggro through compared to malo/slow cause malo doesn't pull aggro.  Tash seems to pull more aggro then slowing to me, probably due to the poison counters, but it really sucks when the chanter pulls aggro with tash because its one thing if the shaman pulls aggro with a landed slow but if aggro gets pulled on the tash, the enc is down before I can even hit shield. <br />
<br />
Solutions to this however for me I was thinking would either be get weapons that put out enough dps quickly enough to overcome the hate aggro of slow/tash in the amount of time then switch to the crappier ratio proc'rs(use frosty + snare whip atm) to hold aggro the rest of the fights with procs cause most hate from then on is built up over a greater time.  Or another thing that I like is to have the chanter/shammy stand right next to you so if they pull aggro, the mob faces them, you taunt, succesful, take aggro back.  I hate when someone pulls aggro and then the mob starts to run for them and you press taunt and you get an &quot;target is out of range&quot; message yet your taunt button is still down for the 6secs.  I never really have problems holding aggro any class that melee's as long as I have some procs, only when it gets streaky.  I can lock aggro for 90% of the fight usually with ease, its just the first 10% that matters so much where we're given the heavy disadvantage.  It would be cool to have a skill that allowed us to proc our weapon whenever we want per one mob but then again I could see that making things to trivial heh but it already is trivial for hybrid tanks.</div></div><hr />
