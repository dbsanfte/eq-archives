What I am wondering is, is there a difference in proc rate between the 2?  I got Symbol of the Planemasters tonight, and it seems to proc 2-3 times a minute, just eyeballing it.  How does this compare to the proc from the gloves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually PoN parses show that buff proc are influanced by WA : at a standard proc rate (2ppm) the buff proc is 2ppm but when you increase other proc rate (by adding them or having a proc mode on the weapon or having WA/CE) the buff proc rate will decrease. at 2ppm +2ppm it goes to 1.9ppm and at 3ppm+3ppm it deacrease to 1.6ppm.<br />
the proc order seams to give disadvantage to the last one. so maybe that it can differ a lot depending on swing per round or whatever you like but what is sure as stone is that neither SotPM's proc neither GoCS's proc will have more than 2ppm.<br />
<br />
the joy of having a third proc and a lucky random series may have biaised your feeling Gnomos...<br />
sorry for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same proc rate for both.<br />
But a difference you didn't mentionned is that gloves are 0.5 cast time, gloves are 3 sec. Big difference if need to recast mid-fight.</div></div><hr />

just my 2cents</div></div><hr />

You can't look at a 1-minute sample to determine an average.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it means your sample size is too small.</div></div><hr />

It means that eventually, if you parse long enough, your string of good luck will be offset by other strings of bad luck.</div></div><hr />
