I never maxxed out innate defense because I never see a difference. My guild (i'm the leader/MT) is making progress fast and I wanted to know if finishing out innate defense would be a waste of aa's or not =\  Will I see a difference when tanking vt/ele, GoD trials, ldon hard etc..? Any opinions accepted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is virtually no PoP AA that you can actually see the difference in one rank. Parses show that it helps, and helps quite a bit. It's a cumulative effect, and I feel it's definitely worthwhile. Improving mitigation for any tank is far more important than, say, offensive AAs or stats.</div></div><hr />

The extra mitigation is key for tanking successfully.  I personally did notice when I finished off ID.</div></div><hr />

<br />
besides all this there have been numerous parses showing gains in armor class having only modest effect and not the godly effect we often imagine it will have. its all cumulative of course and adds up well over the course of all the work we put into improving our mitigation.  but i would say that a warrior maxed out in the defensive aa's will run circles around another warrior with great AC and hitpoints but no aa's. and yes one level wont make an obvious difference but its there.</div></div><hr />

Turk, theres no need to be the arrogant prick that you are ingame, on message boards. I know stupidity is your nature and your a few beers short of a six-pack but still. <br />
<br />
<br />
I thought(still do) that a tank is supposed to actually take damage for other classes that dont have sufficent hp/ac to take them well enough.<br />
<br />
At a time (no longer have this problem) I could not hold aggro for shit, the only way to get it was to A. Get better weapons (wasn't gonna stay up 24/7 to play just to  &quot; be uber &quot;) or B. Get offensive aa's so I can pull aggro off easier by hitting more often etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
After lr5/nd3/pe/pp5/pd3/double riposte3/flash of steel3....I got cs3 and id2... Decided to stop at 2 as I saw no difference. Now i posted here for information, I got it - thanks for the help, will work on finishing up innate defense now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heavy hitting mobs + spikey dmg output = dead tanks<br />
<br />
his famous saying to the tanking crew is &quot;average mob dps hardly ever kills tanks.  dmg spikes is what kill tanks&quot;<br />
<br />
the innate defense line of aa's wont work wonders for you, but it will help to level off the dps spikes and make them less extreme and therefore more manageable.</div></div><hr />

Mitigation and avoidance helps out just about equally, like it should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they provide almost exactly the same improvement.  I guess people cling to the LR so much because when it works, you take 0 damage.  When ID works, you take 1550 instead of 1650.</div></div><hr />

As for melee damage reduction... they are the same.  The sole advantage is that mitigation also offers the chance to avoid procs.</div></div><hr />

But if you're counting on a miss to avoid a proc to survive you're already dead anyway.  No one who's just getting these AAs are going to be fighting anything where proc damage is remotely a factor on survival.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of like saying if you're counting on DA to survive, you're dead already?<br />
<br />
My guild fights several mobs that can, with lucky procs, single round our MTs.  <br />
<br />
And if I had to choose between only one of mitigation or avoidance, I would choose avoidance because parses have shown that they both reduce incoming melee damage by the same amount... and avoidance also gives you a chance to reduce spikes caused by procs.</div></div><hr />

When the Mitigation works, you take less damage.  But you still took damage.  Mitigation AAs aren't a constant effect, otherwise they'd work more like Shielding.<br />

Casters will always take Avoidance AAs before Mitigation since they can't take enough hits for the mitigation to matter, but the avoidance can keep them alive.</div></div><hr />

At 3500 a proc and his melee, he can technically always one round a tank. Or there's the Carprin cycle in CoD. The mobs can proc a 5k (I think) lifetap, and again they can proc it 2+ times in a round. More avoidance helps on those mobs &lt;shrugs&gt;.</div></div><hr />

Reparm and Sigismond are the only mobs pre spellshield mods with significant DD procs that you can't realistically do anything about.  If you're fighting either of them and you don't have both LR and ID maxed you don't belong fighting them in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree that by the time you REALLY need to avoid procs, you should have both LR and ID maxxed, it still remains that when comparing the two head to head you have:<br />
<br />
LR - 10% reduction in melee damage and chance to avoid proc damage.<br />
ID - 10% reduction in melee damage.<br />
<br />
Looking at them side by side, you can't honestly say that there is no advantage to the avoidance AA.  Sure.. it's a small advantage.  And by the time it becomes important, you'll probably have both.  But that doesn't mean that the advantage doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
I went to LR5 before I got my first ID.  But ID 1-5 were the very next AAs I bought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to look at the game like &quot;Well I avoided that hit, he could have hit me AND proc at the same time&quot;, the only conclusion you can get is that it's a miracle you're alive at all.</div></div><hr />

LR &gt; ID, each level costs the same cost, each level reduces melee damage the same amount.  One reduces proc damage.<br />

Hes not saying LR &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ID, hes just saying that he thinks you buy LR first, then you buy CA, in that order, nothing inbetween.  And hes right.</div></div><hr />

Just cause they do not hit for 3k each, they proc so frequently that getting tapped by it 4-5 times between heals is not at all uncommon.<br />
<br />
And you in no way need EP+ to fight here.<br />
<br />
I see where you are coming from, but it is odd how the upper end players seem to think lower tier warriors have excelllent surviveability versus trvial (to them) content. Just is not so, and if I can reduce the incoming proc damage, I am sure gonna.<br />
<br />
Try and keep in mind, you have like 3-4K more HP than most of us, and much higher resists. A proc for 600 on me, is like a proc for  1000 on you. And from my experience, mobs that proc for only 600 tend to proc more than the ones that proc for 1000. Not to mention, some of these low ones, especially in GoD, are unresistable, or use whacky chromatic crap.<br />
<br />
Even the little 200-300 procs have buried me. Hard to rely on 1-2 second CH chain when limited to a single group =p<br />

It's not elitist when it's truth, with bazaar gear, I can equip a 55 war to 4k hp.  <br />
<br />
I can then buff that war to 7.5k ish hp's.... tell me how in the world is VS gonna one round that 7.5k ish hp war.  with 3 procs it's 4500 dmg + his pathetic melee MAYBE 1000 more, and if they are actually raiding VS, then they can have at least 3 healers there, and that will save him from the next round, add in one ench and the DPS is cut by alot with runes....<br />
<br />
He wasn't &quot;forgetting&quot; about VS, or any of those others you listed, but the fact is that, the odds are damn good in favor of you surviving VS's MAYBE 6k per round (at MAX dmg + proc)  <br />
<br />
Yes, your comments are elitist Sorguran. <br />
<br />
Not all of us have the option of the ideal number, classes, or geared people on raids or in groups.  Therefore, we need every advantage we can get - just as you need every advantage you can get for the encounters you are facing.  True, I make the choice of who I play with and how often I play, so I have set my own limitations on gear, classes, etc.  But, those limits are there and saying they do not exist or they do not matter is just wasted bandwidth.<br />
<br />
You're uber relative to 99% of the players out there.  Be happy or sad about it, I really don't care.  But don't give advice to people as if they are as &quot;uber&quot; as you are (unless they ask for it) - all that's gonna do is cause them grief down the road when they try to follow your advice.</div></div><hr />

Where there is any chance of procs landing, the streaky RNG will eventually be victorious.<br />
<br />
And no, Sorguran, it is not the truth that people who can't get spellshielding mods don't need them.  There are many mobs available that can one-round a warrior prior to having access to spellshielding mods.</div></div><hr />

I have had 500 MR when I first started doing PoP with just Luclin gear.  Put Guard of Druzzil + Psalm of Veeshan = 500 MR easy.</div></div><hr />
