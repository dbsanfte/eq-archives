<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Off to Conneticut for a few days of racing; my cousin was invitd to the Funk Master Flex Invitational (http://www.speedbowl.com/speedpages/main_event.html) Race up at Waterford Speedbowl !! :D<br />
<br />
With some luck and a lot of motor ( legally  ;) ) we should make it to the feature race and have a lot of fun without tearing the car up too much. <br />
<br />
Than we come back Friday; take the car apart and ready it for the race Saturday here on Long Island ( totally different setup for the tracks plus the big engine goes back in the car ) and than Sunday is my re-scheduled Enduro Race.<br />
<br />
Here's to a busy busy week and seeyas soon !! Hopefully we'll be on TV s well come end of the month !! The host is Spike TV's show 'Rides' by Funk Master Flex. Hopefully this will turn out to be a yearly event because it's going to be a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

We had fun. We 'kinda' qualified ( broke the track speed record ) but once we made it over to the inspection booth; we were f00ked. Found out that you can't run 4 bbl carb, high rise intake, aluminum heads, quick-change rear ( our car sounds like a jet turbine ) .. or 14&quot; width tires....oops...oh, and we were 350 lbs under weight.<br />
<br />
soooo, off we go in search of a restrictor plate, lead blocks, smaller rims.....not too bad really; but on our second lap around the car goes into the fence. man, the car did NOT like to run on small tires at ALL. so, in the end of day one we were about .5 seconds off qualifying time and had one more day to try to qualify. <br />
<br />
OVerall; we now know why they call the track the 'Bowl. After a hard night's rain ( and us feeding the indians by shooting craps in the Mohican Sun casino :D ) ... the infield was a lake. They dried it up enough to let the cars out again to try to qualify, and we blew up the rear end. 10 minute later it's fixed ( much &lt;3 for quick change rears ) and off we went. Back to the whole 'Bowl name; we were flying until we looped it; and we were the Rice Krispie that was stuck on the rim of the bowl. NOt so good. Good news though my other 2 cousins raced and qualified; finished 12th and 17th; and when it was all said and done we all had a great time.<br />
<br />
So, our lessons for the month:<br />
1. don't bring a cannon to shoot guppies.<br />
2. don't f**k with the 'bowl because the bowl is not kind.<br />
3. stay away from the craps tables. hit the buffet first.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for next year though; the host of the race ( SpikeTV and Funk Master FLex who is a nice guy BTW ) wants to try to make a 15 race tour of these cars and he seemed pleased with the turnout. Next year we bring the other car; and tear the place up. That is; if TC doesn't bring his Busch Cup car :D :D. <br />
<br />
Pics should be back next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">not even qualified ... very disapointing<br />
I hope for your ass that the winner isn't a knight ;)</div></div><hr />
