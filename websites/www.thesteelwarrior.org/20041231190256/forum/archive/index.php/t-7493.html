<br />
The AA description for finishing blow states that non-warriors must first train a level of combat fury before they can train finishing blow. Does this mean that delivering a finishing blow is based on first delivering a critical hit?  i.e. this ability triggers when you score a critical hit on a mob that is fleeing and can be affected.  <br />
<br />
If it is true that finishing blow triggers from critical hits, could a warrior effectively force a finishing blow by using mighty strike?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finishing blow is the first critical hit on a fleeing mob.  Back when Cleave bracers were bugged, you can basically add 11% DPS to any mob that flees and is killable by Finishing Blow since you'd kill a runner almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Never actually verified it, but the cleave bracers are pretty conclusive empirical evidence.  So mightystrike should be guarnateed finishing blow, but not sure why you'd use a disc to get a finishing blow.  Remember that it only works up to level 59, so the most common place to use it such as some parts of sewers or LDoN normal, it can still fail on some mobs.</div></div><hr />

I only have 1 level of FB, but it goes off pretty often so it's not a worthless AA.</div></div><hr />

Nice to do a finishing blow on the sentries<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Finishing Blow 6, it's fun but I wouldn't make it a priority if you have more useful AAs still to choose from. If you worry about runners it would be better to invest in Weapon Afinity (a must anyway) and a snare weapon like Silken Whip of Ensnaring (name?).<br />
Keep in mind that Finishing Blow doesn't go off until the mob is under 10% and mobs that run will start running when they drop under 20%. An unsnared mob with SoW can cause a lot of trainage between 20 and 10%  :D<br />
And finishing Blow 2-5 do not increase the amount of times it will go off, it only increases the lvl cap, you'll need to invest in Crit Hit AA thingie to increase the amount of times it goes off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can confirm this is incorrect. In Sebilis frogs will run at ~23%, the moment they have turned I have gotten finishing blows. At first I thought it was just an oddity, but I tried in other zones like solb and lower guk live side and was able to 32k them well above 10%. The AA description is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know offhand what % increase the various levels of crit AA give?  Not the total crit rate with them, but the % they increase your crit rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The OoW Finishing blow was very nice in the sub 67 murkglider instance. Basically all mobs there flee when below 23%, and since they have some 30k hp, its a pretty nice DPS boost. Was nice when I was farming runes with a cleric + ench and had no snarer.<br />
<br />
However, the exp rate even when FB'ing every mob, still doesnt compare to a full group in MPG or riftseeker, so its of questionable value unless you solo alot or spend all your time in sub 67 expeditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, a few more questions about Finishing blow, before I spend AA on it.<br />
<br />
1) What determines crit rate? Dex?<br />
<br />
2) Is crit rate the same as proc rate?  IE, haste goes up, proc rate per swing goes down, 2Handed weapons proc less than 2 1 handed weapons (when both have procs).  Or, is crit rate dependant on haste?  Would getting more hits total get more crits?  Would faster weapons get more crits?  Would 2handed weapons get more or less crits than 1 handed weapons, etc.<br />
<br />
3) What would I look for in weapons to get the highest crit rate possible?  I'm thinking 2 super-fast 1 handers would get the highest crit per unit time rate, is this correct?<br />
<br />
4) Lastly, whats the % increase in crit rate going from CF1-6?  I have level 1 now, and was wondering if I would see a noticably large increase or not.</div></div><hr />
