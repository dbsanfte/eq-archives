<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fieldweeble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use a custom interface right now made specifically for pure melee classes. If they're removing the stamina bar and replacing it with an endurance bar, this could have some nasty effects. Does anyone know of a good UI with the endurance bar in it, or a good warrior UI in general? I'm not sure if this will effect anything, but if it does, I don't want to have my game slowed down the day I want to play the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">www.eqinterface.com<br />
<br />
Might have something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its my understanding that nothing is changed in the UI, both bars look the same in the XML.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">^^ Yup.<br />
<br />
Endurance bar works fine in my UI.  The only people who will have problems are the ones that got rid of the STA bar because it was useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sars has it for all those with sars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are you saying that the dev team added no new code for Endurance, they simply took the existing code for Stamina and made it so that it applies to Endurance?  If so, then a custom UI that previously had a stamina bar will still work, correct?<br />
<br />
Or is there still a Stamina bar, and now there's also an Endurance bar?<br />
<br />
If I wasn't at work right now I would just log in and check for myself.  If I need to make any changes to my custom UI I figure it's better to do some research on it before I get home.<br />
<br />
Ruldar's comment about &quot;both bars&quot; is what's throwing me off here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no, the stamina bar had been renamed endurance bar. There is no changes made to the UI at all.<br />
<br />
All the stuff was done behind the sceens as far as useage and so forth to make it use the sta bar but renamed as endurance bar, you do not need to make any UI changes in this reguards.<br />
<br />
There is only one bar, he was referenceing the old sta and the new endurance bars when he said both, and as I hope I made clear they are one in the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there was never any such thing as a stamina bar.  The yellow bar was called &quot;Fatigue&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mention this because you need to know this in order to edit your XML's, if editing XML is your thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, that is what I meant.  The old sta bar and the new end bar both have the same numbers and whatnot in the XML.</div></div><hr />
