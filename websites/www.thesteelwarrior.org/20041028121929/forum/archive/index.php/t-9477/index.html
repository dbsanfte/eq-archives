<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I haven't been exploring every nook and cranny of Omens, I have noticed that most XP camp spots seem to have a balance of faction mobs.  My question for this Font-of-All-Knowledge is where is best for raising Dranik Loyalists?  I'm shooting for ~75% or better of the mobs giving me DL faction bumps.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really many great spots, but north of WoS, there's a cave filled with mobs that give DL faction. Fairly sure there's almost no dragorns in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Off the top of my head, I'd say Noble's Causeway.<br />
<br />
I thought it odd that killing dragorns there gave Loyalist faction, but yet they do as i discovered this week, to my surprise.<br />
<br />
Can camp plenty of those along with the usual kyvs, ukuns, etc. Not to mention the usual ph's and nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some mobs listed here as well as 3 quests similar to turning in giant warrior helmets to raise faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dranik's scar is by far the best place for factioning... especially if zone is empty and theres enough mobs alive to shakerpage.... and even killing regular dragorns doesn't lower your loyalist faction so it really doesn't matter where you hunt it'll always go up... unless you exclusively fight drags</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arganax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can anyone confirm that a kill is the same +faction regardless of the lvl of the mob?  Just wondering if I would be better served killing in DS while lfg or just beating on a groups mobs in WoS or MPG.</div></div><hr />
