We have had two people try and complete their Time flag since the patch (combine all 4 essences and do the PoI part) and both people are unable to zone into Time unless gimped in. Both people have all the flags, and their seer messages are perfect.<br />
<br />
It was working before the patch fine. Has anyone finished their Time key since Tuesday's patch?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, my guild has had the same issue, me being one of the people affected.  I finished my Time key on Tuesday evening after the patch along with a couple of other people in the guild.  We haven't been able to zone in, flags are all in order, and we've attempted through PoT as well as through the gnome in PoI.  It appears for the moment they've broken this.</div></div><hr />

The gnome in POI tells them they are ready and to zone in, but upon clicking, they are told they don't meet the requirements.  2 people did the combines after the DON patch, 1 did his combine with the rest of us pre DoN, but did not zone in that day.<br />
<br />
Flags dropping in phase 3 gave flags as normal.</div></div><hr />

Was going to say the same thing.  I got my piece from Phase 3 on Friday and it was working fine that night.</div></div><hr />

What gives, eh?  Anyone heard anything form a dev?</div></div><hr />
