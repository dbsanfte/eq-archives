There are two mobs at entrance, five mobs inside the fort, one on ledge above and three on top of the fort.  Several in hall ways on top going around fort.<br />
<br />
Anyone know which mob is PH for King?<br />
<br />
BTW, at 65 I single pulled everything.  Agro range is like negative numbers.  I literally had to stand in there face, kick, atk, and then they would follow me.  Two mobs at front door of fort are 59-61 and I could single pull everytime.  And these mobs have a BUTT LOAD of hitpoints.  I'm thinking like CT mobs.  In King fort there all 59-61 and I got 1% aa from each in a full group.  Didn't get any loot (besides coin) or see any names in the three hours I was there last night.  No mobs I found saw invis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, thought I'd add, mobs have a BUTT LOAD of hitpoints.  I honestly think you may have trouble killing the mobs in a reasonable time before repops doing a duel box.   The mobs gate and run on low life.  There's a spider at zone in entrance.  Kill him, he runs btw, and double the time it took you to kill him, that's about how long it takes to kill the mobs near King.  Think CT 4C camp as to how tuff they are... rarley do dmg, they hit like little boys but have tons of hitpoints.  A majority are casters also, doing the awful aoe rains... and the gate.  No Bain of Thule thank goodness :P<br />
<br />
I even tried to up my groups DPS using a charmed mob, but the atk rating on these guys must just SUCK cause my enchanters pet was barly even hitting them.  The mobs barely hit me as well, couple times charm broke and I didnt even see it cause they kept missing my enchanter.<br />
<br />
Anyways, unless you feel comfortable duel boxing CT 4C then I don't think you would have much success keeping the fort cleared duel boxing :/</div></div><hr />

You just need the right 2 box.  Enchanters aren't exactly a DPS class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG, were going to start a war, Haass. <br />
<br />
Enchanter has the greatest DPS when using mobs with high ATK values, like Tactics, HoH, BoT....  These places make other class DPS look like lvl 4 monks.  A duel wielding / SoV / NDT CoD pet in most planes will well break the DPS of an entire group.  Except for the recent MR CoD charm nerf, charm +TD was the reason why most 3 group targets could be taken out with 4-6 people.<br />
<br />
Careful what you say Haass, a stray enchanter reading these boards may erupt into a massive flame fest like the bard taunt vs warrior taunt thread.  /whistles<br />
<br />
The mobs in Droga have very low atk values, the lvl 61 lords would rarely land a single hit on me and using them as pets was a waste of mana since they barely hit there target as well, it was more beneficial to chain cast Insanity/Dementing Visions wich still yields close to 180 dps. (1875 dd with no crits / 10second cast time with spell haste).  I know my warrior doesnt put out close to that DPS. (SCM3+MC3+FT7+VoQ)<br />
<br />
And I said that if he felt comfortable duel boxing CT 4C then he shouldnt have a problem in Droga.<br />
<br />
/walks away on egg shells<br />
<br />
... Was Tyenn's second post on the boards and I didnt see his magelo.  I assume hes meaning warrior + shaman for Droga and hopefully lvl 65... All mobs in Fort ar 59-61 and have ALOT of hitpoints, im not exagerating.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think enchanters got a bit too power trippy with an expansion of low HP mobs that hit for insane amounts.  The world does not revolve around them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, yeah Haass, no worries, if I sounded defensive I'm sorry.  I only ment to reply to the sinlge comment about enchanter dps.  I aplogize if i sounded like a whench :/<br />
<br />
/hugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't sound like a wench, but when I think &quot;DPS&quot; I don't think &quot;Chanter.&quot;  Of course I don't do PoP charm killing to get AA's in 20 minutes either.<br />
<br />
While they may be kings in one expansion, that does not carry thru to all of them.  Charming before PoP wasn't nearly as out of whack as it is now, with both risk and reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perfect, just wanted to make sure he wasn't on top of the ledge or by the pool of water or whatever.  Thx a ton.<br />
<br />
low aggro radius <br />
<br />
Yeah, almost too low, if that's possible :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no, it is not :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sick of places where i have to bring a goddamned full, balanced group containing a warrior, cleric, shaman, enchanter, snarer and someone for DPS.  It's nice to have a dungeon where you can eliminate one or more of those things and just HAVE FUN PLAYING THE GAME.<br />
<br />
I know you've all been conditioned to assume that all dungeons need to be massive 5 pull mez fests, but it's really much better this way.</div></div><hr />

/zips her lips about agro ever again<br />

BTW, gratz on the SoD Haass !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I've added my magelo's in my sigs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent 4 hours in Droga today. The King never made an appearance at all, but the some elder above did, who dropped a 12/19 sword with a 75dd/stun proc. That's pretty close to the hammer from the King, so now I'm using the droga sword + red epic, even over jbow or gsot. <br />
<br />
How rare is the King?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How rare is the King? <br />
<br />
8hrs over 2 days till I got a King pop.  <br />
<br />
So, the Planar Stun sword drops in the area ontop of the King hut?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's Elder Seer Gamolk or something like that. Yes, pretty much above the King hut -- just curl around above on the path to the right of the hut (while facing the hut).<br />
<br />
I was using the Sword of the Bloodsworn last night in HoH, and was pretty impressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When they do hit, there really pansies, I believe max was 120.  Again think of these mobs as CT type mobs, except no Bane of Thule.<br />
<br />
Seriously, there pansies, my 65 chanter (CA3 though) would go several rounds before I even noticed her charm wearing off.. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max hit on most mobs is 209.  Max hit on King is 239.</div></div><hr />
