<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NorokFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'll be happy to let bards have taunt if warriors can have CH, rezzes, mezzes, free porn in our UI, and a little snow bunny that follows us around and gets aggro instantly for us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just thought of something evil!<br />
<br />
heh I say give bards not a song but a taunt button and cap skill at 120 same as track lol.<br />
<br />
Then we all have a laugh muhahahaha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On the bright side if it were ever given to them the huge uproar that would follow if implemented  could  finally get warriors looked at. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, couple of my bard friends back on Tarew keep wanting to use my BoC.  I just tell them that a bard with an EB weapon is an affront to nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">funny part is the bards you knew would believe you. :D<br />
<br />
some of them chucklefucks crack me up. christ this game has it's funny moments</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What the hell would a bard want with taunt?<br />
<br />
Perhaps Thott can convince SOE to perhaps give them defensive, BUT it cost MANA, AND it's an AA!<br />
<br />
OMFG I have such |33t idears!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That has to be one of the funniest threads I've read in a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They do have snap aggro, I suppose they need to look deeper into their spellbook or something. I have been with a few different bards who thought the STUN song was a good idea to keep dmg off of the MT and save cleric mana. This was normally followed by ME chasing my bard friend as he ran in circles at warp-speed trying to shake the now pissed off mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nah, bards need 2hs skill so they can use a BoW /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haha! That's good stuff. Grimmlokk's spoof on the &quot;relax&quot; guy was right on the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just want the agro of a full offensive monk.<br />
<br />
*Snicker* I would like that kind of agro too...<br />
<br />
Some of thoes bards are so clueless about agro and agro generation it boggles the mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">oh my fucking god, the can do almost everything in the damn game with their songs, they are the ultimate utility class and now they want tuant!? fuck you bard pansys stop asking for more crap, i know that bards can get agro or not get agro depending on who is playing, so to all those who say the class is underpowered the real problem is between the keyboard and the seat. the guy had the nerve to mention enraging items? haha 30k for a flesh grinder 40k for a wave crasher well over 80k for a SoD if some stupid guild hasnt already screwd the sleeper warder camp GG bards GG VI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">heh I say give bards not a song but a taunt button and cap skill at 120 same as track lol. <br />
<br />
What are you saying, if you capped them at 120 in taunt knowing the bard loving at SoE it would probably work better then ours :) <br />
