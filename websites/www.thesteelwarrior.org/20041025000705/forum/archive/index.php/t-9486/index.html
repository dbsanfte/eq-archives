<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you have done the  whole thing, please give a relative difficulty on each of the epic 1.5 mobs please.<br />
Me and my friends are pre-elemental so we don't have the killer stuff.<br />
My war buffs to 11kHP and 1800AC with the new OoW buffs.<br />
<br />
Vxed Borer - was no problem with one regular XP group.<br />
Bloodfields, Girplan Devourer - was tough with 3 groups and a poor strat.  I'm gonna take 4 groups on next go and keep the healers out of the knockback AE.<br />
Veskar, Galuk Drek - haven't tried.  How many pre-elemental toons needed?  Is one group enough?<br />
WoS, Dragorn Champion - haven't tried.  How many pre-elemental toons needed?  My guess is 3 groups to make it easy.<br />
RCoD, Krekk - haven't tried.  Having trouble gauging difficulty on this part.  Any pre-elemental folks had a go at it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Girplan Devourer: I don't think you can avoid the knockback. Just have your healers spam heal pretty much. A couple of MGB heals and 4 groups should be plenty for you.<br />
<br />
Galuk Drek: 1 group. I was elemental and almost had him with a ranger and clericbot.<br />
<br />
Dragorn Champion: 3 or 4 groups for a pre-elemental set up I think. I believe I had 2 groups, but have heard people have 1 grouped it. As many rangers and wizards as you can get.<br />
<br />
Krekk: Totally depends on your people. 4-5 groups should be able to do him if you can do Devourer with 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have any trouble with more than 2 groups of similarly geared people, then the epic needs to be retuned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xion`X</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Borer: I used one group and had 2 rogues single pull all three of the borelings and the Borer to zone in.<br />
<br />
Girplan Devourer: Two groups easy just fight against the wall to minimize knockback.<br />
<br />
Galuk in Veksar: I killed him with myself ( 70 warrior, 66 at the time) a 69 shaman, 70 Rogue, and a 70 druid.<br />
<br />
Champion: I had one solid group and 2 boxed wizzies.<br />
<br />
Krekk: I had twelve people was a long fight but cake.<br />
<br />
Posessed Brute: one solid group.<br />
<br />
Conqueror Xionn Teir`Exile<br />
70 Dark Elf Vanquisher<br />
Tholuxe Paells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Conqueror Xionn Teir`Exile<br />

<br />
Xion, could you elaborate to tell us if you and the folks you fought with were EP/Time/Qvic?  You made it sound pretty doable pretty easily, but I'd hate to underestimate the encounters myself and I'd be doing them with, well, folks geared like me.</div></div><hr />
