<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HaZZy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sceptre of Destruction and Blade of Carnage :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Things that haven't lost their value and/or their utility:<br />
<br />
1) Fungus Covered Scale Tunic<br />
<br />
2) 36 percent haste item<br />
<br />
3) Zlandicar's Talisman<br />
<br />
4) Heart of Zlandicar<br />

5) The beastlord usable fungus vest<br />

7) Cobalt Greaves<br />

8) Cobalt Bracer<br />

9) Incarnadine BP<br />
<br />
Then there's things that are excessively expensive because of rarity, but still useful/valuable:<br />
<br />
1) Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
<br />
2) Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings<br />
<br />
3) Blade of Carnage<br />
<br />
4) Sceptre of Destruction<br />
<br />
5) Manastone<br />
<br />
6) Holgresh Elder Beads (they remain extremely powerful when considering necromancers)<br />
<br />
That's just some stuff off of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
For a warrior, I'd suggest the two items you'd find most useful and would have the most staying power are Fungus Covered Scale Tunic and Sceptre of Destruction. Neither is ever going to lose value that much, and both are pretty much god-mode style twinking for lower level melees. And with the advent of shared bank slots, well ... you can see how fun those two will get.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stonewood compound bow. Saved up 280k to get mine. Won't stay valuable but its an upgrade that isn't beatable pre-elemental planes. Except for the stuff which no longer drops you'll be able to get everything else listed above in raids many many months before you even enter the Ele-Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow stonewood is selling for around 60kpp on the nameless now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">about 80k-100k here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah those bows are uber but the price is not stable and i only see them going down<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
i prefer it over the HoRZ and the beauty of this item is it has retained its value over the years due to being all/all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no it retains its value because u can give it back to yel for ft2 100hp 110mana boots.<br />
<br />
i would buy either scepter or BoC for main hand and get a cheaper offhand weapon. buying either for offhand would be a waiste when you could get so much more for other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meanfred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, Thats what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna flip my money over a few more times, and get a BoC, that looks like the best bet here, instead of wasting money now on something that will lose its value to me down the road, so I'll have to buy/sell some more equipment to get started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you are going to get something that won't lose it's value down the road, get a Sceptre of Destruction, only limited amount of those.<br />
<br />
BoC's get added in on a weekly basis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ultimately the choice is yours to make, but for functionality BoC &gt; SoD. However, BoC is going to continue to drop in price since they are entering the market at a fairly constant rate while the SoD should never drop much in price since it doesn't drop any longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">White Dragon Helm tends to be hard to come by due to it being used for caster boots as well, that is the sole reason it retains it's high value.  My twink wizard has one, and I have another one banked so I can turn in his current one for boots after I get another KT faction hit and still have one, and they both cost roughly 200k each because of the caster turnin and it being the best boots accessable by a vast majority of people.  It's a great twink item for any class really, but I think Tormax Crown is a better choice if you have access to it.  I also do not care for HoRZ due to the graphic, I will never go back to a graphic helm, thank god Raex doesn't have a graphic.<br />
<br />
As far as functionality goes, BoC is definately a better bet then an SoD, I would suggest saving up for one as well if that is what you plan on doing, but small upgrades to large amounts of slots will take you much farther then one uber item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just my opinion but I would think that the choice between BoC and SoD is not all that clear cut. If you raid or do a very standard group all the time, then yes BoC would be better for the added taunt.<br />
<br />
For some people though the stun component (pre-PoP stuff) and possibly added DPS from procs (I seem to remember someone posting a log during the Luclin era of dual SoDs beating Hategiver/BoC for DPS - but if I'm wrong about this just ignore my argument) might be worth the lower taunt. <br />
<br />
This choice would of course be up to the original poster to make.</div></div><hr />
