<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This one should be easy to add, not very complicated and certainly not trivial.<br />
<br />
Make weapons that have a proc that includes a debuff (eg Nightmares on VDD, Proc on Obsidian Scimitar of war) have seperate parts to the spell, allowing the nuke to crit.<br />
<br />
So, the VDD would crit for 200hp, but still only debuff the Ac by 27. They can seperate stun resists from nuke damage, why not allow things like that to do criticals as well. Not earth shattering, it's a moderate DPS upgrade, and shouldn't be too hard to code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crit procs work on what, 10% of all DD procs? So it'd be a net increase of like .5 DPS with a VDD? .1 DPS with an OSoW? You seriously don't think that'd be trivial? If it WAS an easy fix, it'd be worth it for the eye candy, but I suspect it's not very easy. If it took them more than 15 minutes to solve this one, it wouldn't be worth the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Off by a decimal, oops.</div></div><hr />
