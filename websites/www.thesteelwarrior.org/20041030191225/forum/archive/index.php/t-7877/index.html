<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you can see from my magelo, I am currently doing *ok* in gear and will be upgradeing my current visible armor slots that are weak (boots/gloves) by the end of the month provided by DKP stays high and we get some lucky drops.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for are viable upgrades in NON-visible slots. <br />
<br />
I spend alot of time and care in my gear and my xp zones are based solely on the equipment upgrades that may be available.<br />
<br />
My view is that AA's come but gear makes the warrior to a large extent.<br />
<br />
And to get to the point, I'm looking for<br />
<br />
a) a Backslot option (Loyalist Shield of Honor i've been DILIGENTLY questing for but i no longer think exists)  What else is out there?  And does anyone have any experiences to share concerning a1) Loyalist Camp a2) experiences regarding another viable backslot upgrade (and where)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
b)  Other cheap / easier upgrades that can be 1 possibly 2 grouped but won't end up costing me DKP<br />
<br />
Thanks for the time !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the best option I can give.<br />
Crinose Cape of the Werewolf isn't to bad.  It is 80hp's.<br />
