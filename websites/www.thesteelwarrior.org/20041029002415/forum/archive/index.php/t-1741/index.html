<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm in much the same situation, I two-box, and have 62 shaman, and a 52 SK I work on occasionally.<br />

Some ideas with the 60 shaman .. top of the platform in Scarlet Desert.  Any boat in Dulak, except maybe Windscorn, you'd have trouble keeping up with the spawns on Windscorn.  Possibly, just possibly, the enforcer camp in PoJ (short room).  Guards in Katta (Twilight side is best), but you'll go KoS on them before too long.   Sol B.  Giants in BW.  The shammy needs to do the pulling in many of these places to reduce the possibility of adds.<br />
<br />
Of all of these, the only place the shammy will get experience he will like is probably the enforcer camp in PoJ.  At 52, I'm not sure you're capable of tanking things that the 60 shammy will get good exp from.<br />
<br />
This will get easier when the shammy hits 61, the 61 shammy pet has much better survivability tanking the adds.    <br />
<br />
With the 53 shaman, some of the boats in Dulak should work, or zone out in PoJ.</div></div><hr />
