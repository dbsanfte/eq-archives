Some people get bent over clones, but for the most part, people don't really get in your face, because they TOO have made clones. EVERYONE does it. The creation tools are just so much damn fun.</div></div><hr />

Did you make the character the way you want to no matter if it is a clone or not?  Do you care what other people think?<br />
