<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had the misfortune of stepping into a &quot;bugged&quot; LDON zone last night and having all of my augments strip out of the items they were in and end up on my cursor.  Yes, I lost a +5 STA aug in the process (waiting on a GM for that... not holding my breath).<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that they are all out, I'm thinking it would be cool if I could turn in some of the earlier ones I had bought to get the points back (something good out of the negitive).<br />
<br />
I thought I remember reading something about an NPC in south ro or somewhere that you could turn unused bought augments in for the points.  I can't seem to find the info, or the NPC at the camp.  Anyone know anything about it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

He will talk about only buying the old 40hp augments but if you hand him any augment he will refund your points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Awesome! Thanks for the info.  I'm going to turn in my old augs (since the bug stripped them out) and do a little upgrading ^.^<br />
