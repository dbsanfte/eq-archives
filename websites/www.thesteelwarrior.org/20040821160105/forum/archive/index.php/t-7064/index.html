You are correct, Knights are currently without any defensive disciplines.  I brought this to the attention of the development team and the addition of a defensive discipline in the future seemed to be promising. However, for now, we are going to work on the content.  Let's see if we can get that sorted out and tuned so that more than the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; can enjoy it and then start looking at a potential defensive discipline.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep reading the post, he later states that knights will not be getting defensive, but a defense disc.  Basically admitting they will get something, but not defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Incredibly uncool. Regardless if it's not as our disc they simply do not deserve this. But, to me at least, the way Brenlo puts it, is that, if they cannot tune content properly, they'll be giving Knights a crutch too.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't make sense to make a change that would affect all content in the game when only this small portion is clearly what needs fixing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  From what they said, it isn't. Not only have they already retuned the GoD content, but any talk of a defensive discipline has NOT been about defensive. It's been about a fortitude/furious sort of discipline. Monks, rangers and even rogues have an immunity discipline; it doesn't seem far off that knights should get one. Knights will NOT be getting defensive, Brenlo was very clear on that point.<br />
<br />
  Side point, this should be in the war room. This is balancing issues that isn't specific to high level warriors at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's been about a fortitude/furious sort of discipline<br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't have a problem with something like that.  It wouldn't be something game changing but it would be a little help to the knights.  They probably should have had something like that from the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A fortitude / furious dicipline? Dont they already have a DA spell at 51? What would this mean, that they willd have 2 invulnerability skills that can be chained to get 24 seconds of not tanking dmg at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Divine Aura/Harmshield have the unfortunate side-effect of making you one of, if not the lowest member on the agro list.  You can't tank while under these effects unless you are the only one on the agro list, which makes it hard to do much as a group. It's impossible to tank with it in a group setting.  They're looking into giving a more defensive discipline along the lines of Fortitude, not just something that'll allow them to live 18 seconds longer while watching everyone else dies.<br />
<br />
If they'd change DA/HS for Paladin/SK to not lower you on the agro list, or give a different spell that does the following:<br />
<br />
1. Stops all damage taken<br />
2. Silence<br />
<br />
And still remain 12-18 seconds, but allows them to do melee damage, it might be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As was said in another thread here, Brenlo later clarified himself.  He said:<br />
<br />
Remember that there is nothing firm on this, the idea was merely well recieved by the developers<br />
and<br />
I do not mean that they will get Defensive, but a defense oriented disc as they currently have none and every other class that can melee does. So let's not get confused over my wording here. Not the warrior Defensive ability but something that does grant some defense. Is that better wording?<br />
<br />
By him including &quot;every other class that can melee,&quot; he includes an auto-parry/riposte/dodge disc in the possiblities, not just a mitigation disc like Defensive/Stonestance/Protective Spirit.  He also even specifically says it's only being considered at this point, whatever &quot;it&quot; ends up being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for clarifying Kaesorn, I didnt know DA had that side effect :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">DA was level 55 back in the day.... =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still maintain that the best possible thing for WARRIORS is to give knights defensive.  Heck even if they gave them a defensive with the lowered damage of defensive plus snare of stone would be ok.  My point is give them defensive and in exchange upgrade warriors slightly...probably in dps, possibly in an additional 5% innate damage mitigation or avoidance.  Warriors would clearly be the best tanks but knights could do the job then.  Its ridiculous when a fully time geared knight cannot tank as well as a pre-elemental warrior.  Sure two comprably geared toons, the warrior should tank better and do more damage just as the knight should have more utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Where do people get the idea that defensive is a crutch or it somehow makes balancing content harder.<br />
<br />
It's the fact that you can defensive at all why certain encounters are even possible.  <br />
<br />
A long refresh stonestance like disc wouldn't be too bad I guess.  Furious/Fortitude line in some senses are even more powerful than Defensive and I'd rather not see more classes get it since it really should be nerfed even for the classes that already have it.<br />
<br />
Paladins already have a short duration disc against mobs 65 or under, it's called stun.  If they really wanted to, just make a really expensive stun that affects up to level 67 or even 68 (say, 300 mana, 2-3 second stun refresh 12 seconds).  SK, I don't know, they're not supposed to be a defensive class so I don't see why they need some kind of defensive disc anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">big problem in disscord is knights cant tank bosses in single group trials, it SHOULD be fixed, single group trials shouldnt require a warrior.<br />
<br />
easy solution imo<br />
<br />
1. give them a get riposte disc, its stupid rogues and rangers get this while knights dont.<br />
<br />
2. make the trial bosses undead and give knights defensive on undead. heck even add a few major mobs that are undead where knights or warriors can be used to tank on.  for example in pop - 2 or 3 time gods undead, 2 elemental gods undead. that combined with their fearless ability would make them the ideal tank on a few encounters at least. the single group trials really need to be changed either way though.<br />
<br />
undead disc with more undead boss types would give the knights a niche and yet not unbalance everything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any more than they should require a cleric?<br />
<br />
Better alter Kod1 while you're at it, which requires an enchanter.<br />
<br />
I understand the argument, but certain situations have REQUIRED a certain class throughout EQ. Remember chanters seiving Vox back in the day? Why has it suddenly become a 'content altering' issue?<br />
<br />
In every situation that REQUIRES a warrior, that warrior REQUIRES a cleric. Any place that doesn't REQUIRE a cleric, a knight is a better choice than a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if that were to happen I'd say that the best possible thing for KNIGHTS is to give warriors their spell books.<br />
<br />
You want to tank like us?  Then I want to be able feign pull, have a pet, and to solo like you when I'm alone.<br />
<br />
Balance does not mean putting 2 pounds on one side of the scale while only having 1 pound on the other side.<br />
<br />
What person in his right mind would buy a stock, no extras, car when the dealership will let him have one with a CD-player, sun roof, AC, electric seats, keyless entry, remote starter, and an alarm for the same exact price?  You'd be stupid to not get in on that deal, since both cars would now have the same engine, frame, reliability, and sturdiness if knights got their way.  There'd be no point in rolling up a warrior at all.  You'd be purposely handicapping yourself half the features you could have had, for no reason at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I find it funny whenever a warrior posts that Knights gets defensive someone immediatly thinks they are a paladin even if in their sig or magelo it says &quot;warrior&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>RhaamanNoodles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">something similiar to defensive but not as effective. I've always thought knights should have a fortitude like discipline auto parry not auto ripo, since Paladins are the defensive hybrid. Maybe give Sk's furious but shorten the duration a bit under pally's auto parry disc (since Sk's are the offensive hybrid).<br />
<br />
Whats wrong with them geting a 25% mitigation disc that drops off quarm to help them tank in GoD? The disc could have a mana upkeep, and make any spells cast be a % higher cost to mana while making HoP/LoH unusable while the spell is in effect. Not sure if it should take a buff slot etc.<br />
<br />
Warriors would still be the preferred MT and Knights could do the 1 group trials and have more of an offtank role in raids. Making drop off quarm ensures that PoP tanking remains at the same balance where knights really don't have any problems.<br />
<br />
I'd support it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aegorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wonderful... so how does a warrior's tanking ability differ from a knight class's tanking ability once they get that? Warriors are the least needed class in the game right now.</div></div><hr />

Wonderful... so how does a warrior's tanking ability differ from a knight class's tanking ability once they get that? . <br />
Did you even read the thread before spouting off?<br />
<br />
Warriors are the least needed class in the game right now <br />
<br />
Do you play everquest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My opinion<br />
<br />
Giving knights a riposte or parry disc makes sense. <br />
<br />
Giving knights a disc similar or lesser like Defensive or evasive disc, then they should rather remove the defensive and evasive disciplines totally. <br />
When everyone tanking needs a disc to do the job, then it would be easier to just remove all discs and alter the mobs accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ohh and about that some encounters ''needs a warrior''. Try and think big. How many group encounters needs a chanter?? how many needs a cleric?<br />
<br />
If you really think there is a problem, then it opens up for discussing several encounters, where success is dependent on that you have 1, 2 or 3 critical classes. <br />
Should we then ''demand'' all those encounters changed, so that there is at least two alternative classes which can do the same job?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If it is a minor (15-20% roughly) Mitigation /disc that dropped off Quarm (or something else in Time) and was No Drop, I would not see a problem with that.  My only concern is overpowering Knights at the pre-elemental stage where the balance is already good.  Also, it should eat mana as quickly as Defensive eats end.  That's just the opinion of a non-elemental geared warrior, though, so take it for what it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">For GOD'S sake don't make it drop off Quarm. I don't wanna have to trawl through Time again  for every Pally/SK we have. Make it a Geo stone if you have to.<br />
<br />
Fact is, these changes aren't needed outside of Tipt and Kod+ content. Anyone who gets to Kod, should be PoTime+ - this is evident by the quality of the loot dropping there. Time+ Knights can tank Tipt just fine, and pre-elemental knights haven't even stood in front of any of the mobs causing problems yet.<br />
<br />
If knights get a reasonable duration defensive type discipline, they will be by far the preferred tanks on all bosses from Vox to Rathe, due to their vastly superior agro in the first 30 seconds (even with incite, knights still pull mods off casters faster, and lock agro faster than any warrior), and suplamental spells during the battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No to knight defensive mitigation / evasive / defensive increases.<br />
Yes to better knight spells / ripotse / parry (for 2 to 3 tics) disc's. Yes to knight ofensive disciplines. Why because I dont mind them getting a discipline much like aggresive to work for a minute to increase there melee dps.<br />
Those things are fine.<br />
However pure mitigation of incoming damage best should be left to the warrior class. <br />
There dosent need to be a reason to justify this.<br />
KNIGHTS DO NOT NEED DEFENSIVE.<br />
DEFENSIVE IS NOT A BROKEN DISCIPLINE.<br />
Its the same discipline that is has been since we got disciplines. And well if you want it, then reroll as a warrior.<br />
if I want the benefits of being a SK I'll reroll a SK, or a paladin etc etc. <br />
<br />
If you want to be the very best tank in the game you roll a warrior.  <br />
and thats all there is to that</div></div><hr />

 Ok im very old school, buts its been so long since ive even cared about kunark dragons. But resontly i found Gorenaire up, no one in the zone, and though, hey fun. So i slaughted her. Was awesome! I felt things i had long forgotten awaken in me!!! I want to kill more! More i say!! All Dragons in kunark must die! WW are boring now after Tribute farming for weeks. <br />
<br />
My question is, I know of course that Gorenaire, Talendor, and Servelious are on 7 day respawns, but what i cant remember is there respawns on server downs. I seem to remember it being 3 days and not being instant, but im not 100% on that. Also i cant remember if there respawn is exactly 7 days or if its +/- a day or 12 hours. If anyone knows exact numbers, id be very greatful. <br />

This is why knights will never get defensive.  You can solo content. <br />
I wont bother to explain myself. I'll just let that quoted  paladin end my case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that niether warriors nor clerics can solo as effectively as most other classes, yet they are the core classes of major raids, is more than coincidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you speak about things like balance in a game like everquest, you are not comparing apples to apples.  You are comparing apples to oranges and attempting to balance them so that they, in the end, are balanced and people want to play both.<br />
<br />
You cannot say &quot;in this situation, comparing this apple to this orange, the apple can do this and the orange can only do this, therefore the apple should be jucier&quot; because in a different situation, the orange may have a large advantage on the apple.  A good example would be clerics and druids.  Druids cannot heal nearly as efficient as clerics, so therefore druids should have healing up'd to the point that they can? No, because clerics cannot solo nearly as efficiently as druids can.<br />
<br />
When you are talking balance in a game with so many different characteristics and classes, you have to consider the class overall and its strengths, not just compare its weaknesses to the strengths of a class that is stronger in that area.  So you see, soloing ability DOES have something to do with tanking if you want to look at balance overall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">no they shouldnt require a cleric or enchanter either. 2 wrongs make it right?<br />
<br />
knights are tank classes, i cant believe anyone honestly thinks they shouldnt be able to do single group trials as the primary tank.  really, it is not asking for much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">knights are tank classes, i cant believe anyone honestly thinks they shouldnt be able to do single group trials as the primary tank. really, it is not asking for much.<br />
<br />
Nope, not asking for too much at all.  And the solution came as a retune of that area.<br />
<br />
What &quot;is&quot; asking too much though, is asking for defensive (or any other defensive ability boost) to do it.  Because getting defensive will make &quot;every&quot; area of EQ (even the biggest of raid boss mobs) easier to tank, not just the one area they had issues with.  Making SKs overpowered across the whole game just to fix one small area they had an issue with is an example of the most lop sided balance there could be.  I don't think most of the knights realized this as a part of what they were asking for.<br />
<br />
I don't think any of us warriors were saying that knights shouldn't be able to single group primary tank an area...  we're merely pointing out that knights don't need to have the rest of the EverQuest content, which knights were already balanced for, trivialized by giving them defensive.  Defensive doesn't just automatically become unavailable when a knight steps outside of those few GoD zones they had problems with.  It's always there, available to be used on any mob in the game.  Mobs the knights were already balanced for when compaired to warriors, would have all retroactively become easier.<br />
<br />
For example, if it was decided that warriors don't do enough damage while wielding Seru bane weapons... then the seru bane weapons are in need of tuning, not our entire damage table that will effect the rest of the game as well.  Flooding an entire city to put out one fire in a single group of buildings only leaves you with a much bigger problem in the end.  We'd like to help them put out the fire if possible, but the knights seem so worked up over this that they can't look past their anger to understand that we simply don't want them knocking out the dam to accomplish it.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with asking for the retuning of an area that geniunely needs retuning.  But asking for a power jump across the entire scope of the game just to make the small problemed area doable is just waaaay too much.</div></div><hr />
