How can we tell when the rings are actually up?   It is frustrating when we think the ring is up and we get to the end and just a plane ole mob spawns after an hour or two of clearing.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take note of when rings were last done, and hope they aren't bugged anyway when you try. Earth and Air are garbage ass lazy shitbag design, have been since day 1, and I don't have very high hopes of them ever being fixed. Elemental planes tend to put the FU in fun, you might say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or just send a spy to see what rings they do!</div></div><hr />

but as dima said, you need to just keep an eye on the zone when they are due and hope that you didn't miss it :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw him reading his Sekritz of the Planez hoping it would save him from damnation but alas Pyronis owned him with his AE.</div></div><hr />
