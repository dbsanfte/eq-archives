-Also do you have to clear all of tacvi to get one?<br />
-Also can you MQ them?<br />
-Also since we cleared all of tacvi but tunat, can you get a new instance and keep making those tomes every 2hrs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant get 14 writings everytime you get a next exped.  You do have to clear all of Tacvi to get one, as books range from right near zone in, to all the way back to tunats lair, and the final book doesnt spawn until fake tunat dies.  <br />
<br />
Im not sure if you can MQ honestly.  You cant, and more to the point -- we found this out the hard way -- if you kill mobs and dont loot the book, and then come back the next day to finish your clear, the books you passed up will no longer be up.  <br />
<br />
I think the respawn on the books is the same as the bosses themselves.</div></div><hr />

Was this changed recently?  Didn't used to be like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno honestly, i just know that Maddoc's Remains pops the moment fake tunat dies.  I dont remember it being like that either, but there was such a long period of time between our first look at Tunat and our first death of Tunat that i honestly cant remember.</div></div><hr />

Almost 100% sure you cannot.  Each book turn in is one of those 'silent' character flags, like occurs in the BiC quest or the Epic 1.5/2.0 quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leenyne</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure if any of the 8 you hand in to the intial NPC can be multiquested, but since the other 6 are given to specific npcs I really doubt they can be mq'd either. Maddoc's remains is actually there while fake Tunat is up and I did loot mine while he was alive even. Was abit tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can't be mq'd for sure. Have tried and failed =D. It's like BiC, you can get another book while you have a diff one on corpse just by hailing hte npc again.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect.....you can get all 14 books w/o having to touch Tunat. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">03-18-2005, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried Tunat late late with a small force after clearing rest of Tacvi, just to see what happened and failed sorta early at 55%. After all had TLed out I looted the 14th book under Tunat.<br />
<br />
I would say it is impossible for any class except Bard (and maybe a lucky rogue) to loot it though as you can't normally loot a mob corpse if another mob is in aggro range. Bard pop DA and spam /loot and Fade. A rogue would have to do a Escape and /loot and be lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">03-18-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah thats what i was thinking, the &quot;you cant loot with a mob in aggro range&quot; thing.  You are right though, a bard or rogue or someone else who just got plain lucky could probably do it before tunat was dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can loot the book at fake tunas feet as long as A)your guild is fighting him and B)you havent done anything to get on agro list yet. Obviously you will have to be quick, and maybe get someone else to /open the corpse for you beforehand, but it can work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saio</div><div class="date">03-20-2005, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have had 1 wizzy, and 2 druids finish the book and have only engaged Tunat 1 time.....with Target DA and a WS person to get first aggro you can get the books.....druids can run in....grab 2 books.....exodus...then come back for the last one ...not sure you have enough time to grab all three before getting aggro<br />
Then summon corpses or get a rogue to Sos them to raid...viola...insta book for any class. <br />

<br />
You don't need to clear Tacvi either. Just an expedition there and a copy of Macroquest or something with the warp hack and a few other toys, and you can just port around at will ganking the remains without even killing a thing. And the best part is, even if you get petitioned, it doesn't seem like the GMs will ban you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most mobs do not actively add idle PCs on hatelist if they're already occupied.  For example it is perfectly safe to afk under a corner where you pull an AE rampaging mob to, so it shouldn't be very hard to actually loot a book while someone is keeping Tunat busy.</div></div><hr />
