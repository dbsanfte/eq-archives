<br />
<br />
The original thread (http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessageRange?topicID=855.topic&amp;start=261&amp;stop=266) <br />
No there is a Difference between being chosen as Main tank on a raid, because you are the Best Tank for the job or even the best Tank to such a degree that anything less would likely not be enough or be an unacceptable risk, and being the ONLY POSSIBLE Tank.<br />
<br />
At what point during Raiding do mobs become Warrior only and what point is it where Knights are able to tank? Is it all Named mobs on all Raids everywhere that should be Warrior exclusive? or is it wrong entirely that Knights should ever engage a Named Raid mob, regardless of the Trivialness of the mob to the raiding Guild? where is it in the Warrior class description or mentioned in Class balance talks by Sony that they say &quot;Warriors are designed to be the Exclusive tank of use in raids&quot;?<br />
<br />
The gap in tanking power caused by Defensive is not simply a gap, it is a solid Wall saying you cannot Tank, you cannot perform your core function.<br />
<br />
I can accept not being able to Tank something on the basis of being the inferior Tank or even that the difficulty exceeds my tanking capacity to such a degree that it is an unnessisary risk, but I cannot accept not being able to Tank something on the reason of lacking an Eclusive Ability.<br />
<br />
As for Complete Heal Chains, thats a different story and subject. Both Druids and Shamans are well compensated for the differences in their healing capacity in performing other vital roles in raids, additionally they both can assist in keeping the CH Chain going (by patch healing etc) and both can assist the Clerics who are CH Chaining in Healing the rest of the raid party so that the Clerics don't have to break off. Additionally Both Druids and Shamans HAVE lesser forms of Complete Heal. The difference though is that their form of Complete Heal isn't as powerful as the Clerics and therefore they aren't generally chosen to be part of the Complete Heal chain (though it's common enough to add Druids into that chain)<br />
<br />
the Difference between the Priest Classes is in the level of ability of their Complete Heals, and this is what Paladins are asking for in regards to a mini-Defensive, an ability that is proportionatly scaled in power in relation to Warriors. We have similair issues that the Priest Classes did regarding Complete Heals as the Tanks do regarding Defensive, and we are asking for the same solution, a lesser form that would allow us to function in relation to Warriors.<br />
<br />
Druid Complete Heal is well in excess of 60% of Cleric's Complete heal and while a 4600hp heal is certainly powerful it did not allow Druids to Surplant Clerics in Raids. Paladins are asking for a similair Solution. A Mini-Defensive that is less then half of what Warriors have and that would not Surplant them in Raids any more then Druids Surplanted Clerics. <br />

Now its just a bunch of people gradually getting more and more delusional as they pat each other on the back saying, omg i agree with your call for defensive, warriors suck!<br />

What this paladin and others want may be outrageous to us, but if you'd just look at some of the stuff that has been suggested here...yeesh.</div></div><hr />

OMFG they have a whole rant area that says right under it &quot;vent and whien about paladins&quot; hehe&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Kahm twists the facts mighty pretty. We all know Knights have MT'd PoTime. They are prefered tanking CT and Inny. And we know that in any fight longer than 3 minutes Defensive isn't absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
So the whole Warriors have a stranglehold on MTing because of exclusive access to their class defining ability is BS in the first place.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't Warriors, who are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles be prefered to tank them anyway???<br />
<br />
So, Kahm, Gilfalas, McBash, et al. deny Warriors are entitled to be the Primary Tank, to have their raid role, and freely declaim the way to insure Warriors do not keep it is to share Defensive with Knights.<br />
<br />
Pretty clear in their intent. Heck, some have come right out and said that since the Provoke line gave Warriors resonable aggro and they could get experiance groups again that they figure Knights should get to MT. No longer able to victimize Warriors in the experiance group arena, they look to take our raid role.<br />
<br />
Kahm demands a proportional piece (50%, 75%??) of a pure class specialization ability for Paladins, conveniently forgeting that Warirors don't get an equal portion of Paladin spellsbooks (whisks the spellbook out of sight).<br />

I thought you where a mainstay there, arguing rationality.  Back on topic...I see no problem with pallies letting off steam and expressing their frustration on the pally message board.

<br />
Lets see, that would be when one of the mods made a snide remark to me implying that I wasn't being &quot;loyal&quot; after all the &quot;campaigning&quot; the Paladins had done for Warrior aggro improvements when I wouldn't sign off on giving them half defensive and I responded something like up yours to him.  That was my &quot;third&quot; offense I was told.  My second was when I told someone to stop being a jackass early in 2004 and my first was an unspecified offense sometime in August of 2003.  Guess my potty mouth was just too much for those poor Paladins to take.</div></div><hr />

I was just instabanned after a total of 5 posts, either for not agreeing they get defensive or for something i said on TSW boards.</div></div><hr />

Gotta love them PoNazi admins. And there love of supressing the truth and the alteration of their &quot;Vision&quot; <br />
<br />
Heh the sad thing is I only said &quot;I dont think defensive is what plate hybrids need&quot; and like Chris Rock calling security in Head of State I got kicked off the fourm and baned. <br />
<br />
Way to go you nazi bastards have fun with it ^^ <br />

<br />
Well the rule is you get a warning if you insult someone, so the best strategy would be to have three insults in your very first post thereby incurring three warnings without any kind of waiting period.  Fast, efficient, and bing bang boom, all done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's fun watching Gilfalas labor over the whole &quot;trolling&quot; concept. It turns out that a troll is, for the most part, anyone who disagrees with him. I've seen plenty of perfectly calm posters get warned or banned from PON (Shadowfrost, Glatius, Battleblade, etc), while freaks like Seventhsword, Arbosch, Graal and the like have a happy home. It's basically a crowd of bobblehead dolls over there, nodding away at each other.</div></div><hr />

That should be simplified enough I geuss</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I took it more as a tongue in cheek comment on the fact that so many of us who've been banned from PoN feel the need to say so publicly.</div></div><hr />
