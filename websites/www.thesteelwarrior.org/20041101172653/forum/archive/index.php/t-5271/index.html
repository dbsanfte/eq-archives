<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I've been trying to get into a raiding guild now after having been in a family guild for 2 years.  On my server, all the raiding guilds are at Emp level and higher, or not even close to NToV.  My problem is that having been in a family guild, my gear is substandard, at least to the raiding guilds.  Any of them want a minimum of 5500hp, and with ND3 at level 65, I have 4526.  I'm planning on getting a second bloodmetal earing once the prices have dropped again (I refuse to pay 40k+ for one).  Other than ldon and ornate, what options do I have?  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">guilds have equipment requirements to join?  I've heard of AA requirements, level requirements, and flag requirements, but at least in my mind, I expect a new recruit to be wearing trash unless you steal them from another uber guild.  Generally you're going to have to gear up new recruits regardless, so I have never worried much about their gear.<br />

Sorry, this isn't very helpful, but just seems strange to me.</div></div><hr />

Look at Dima's profile...he just went for HP iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't mean what should I go for once I make it past the trial stage, I meant what can I get with a single group to upgrade what I already have :)  Meaning I need that 5500hp mark before I get accepted.  I'm not going to get anything from guild right now unless if it's going to rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chokidai Hide Pauldrons and ornate basically.  If you have a lot of cash ele bow or ykeshan spirit bow/ bone carved shortbow or whatever it's called from CoD or Darkwood Bow of Suffering being the cheapest.  Halas Meat Pies + Grobb Liquidised Meat.  Unbuffed hp shouldn't matter, it should be your raid buffed hp so shoot for high raw hp stuff rather than just high sta stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PD, PE<br />
<br />
Going  to be hard to get you 1K HP's without spending the money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doing the Strength of the Elements and Spirit Wracked cord quests would get you +185 hps in 2 slots.<br />
<br />
PE and PD should be good for 4 or 500 hps.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, farm BoT or buy ornate molds in the bazaar.  Of course there are high-dollar items that would help a lot like Helmet of Rallos Zek, Blade of Carnage, Crystalized Acid Bracers, Elemental Bows, etc.  <br />

See Wandor's Twink (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=460039) for ideas.</div></div><hr />
