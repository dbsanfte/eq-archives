<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wish I had that kinda gear at level 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">earring and arms rest should be good for a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cloak of the maelstrom/hiero cloak/crinose cloak of the werewolf, anything that has hp to replace the damn lodi heh, hate the lodi.  Bracer of defense to replace the cobalt.  Bag the IGS's in your resist bag along with the lodi and replace it with something like Chokidai hide pauldrons.  Grab another electrified earring if you can, take the raw hp over the sta of vah shir earring.  Maybe kylong shinguards or barbed rubicate legs have good stats but they're chain so less AC.  Those are just some ideas, not sure what your money situation is really, otherwise just lvl up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tamurlane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lose the vah shir for a hp earring fo sho'.,. find a good reason to bag the cobalt, lots of stuff out there, find some shoulders with some hp... maybe go quest a bracer of benevolence. look into cultural stuff for legs or maybe an mq depending on your factions for it, same for boots.  depending on cash you might be able to snake a nightmare wood bow. get a flag so you can get a charm.. as bul said, no idea on your cash situation. have fun btw..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I personally don't like the stats on the nightmare wood bow, your bow is pretty decent for what you need it for pulling/tagging, some nice ones though I like are darkwood bow of suffering or twisted long bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh you have SBoLighting in the main and the Bloodsworn sword in the offhand. Looks like you kinda not sure if you want dps or agro heh....<br />
<br />
Arms is yur weakest right now, mine is nothing much eather. Then legs and boots and wrists. Id look to those slots first before the sholders and the back..... <br />
<br />
Check out my link and get anything i have if you can afford it, most of my stuffs is &quot;best bang for the buck&quot;. Everyone say bag the IGS but considering anything better (20 AC is not all that bad) is high high cost or just plain unavialble, I would look to others slots first.<br />
<br />
Actually you should fix up yur weapon situation, although I guess you doing OK for dps and doing OK for agro... I dont know.. I know you can sell you SoLightnigh for a CHoS I would thinks.. but then yur dps suffer. Or just sell both for WMBS, take the agro hit, and upgrade your others stuffs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Lodi shield has got to go.  Not only are there better STA/HP cloaks (as mentioned above), but most of them are actually cheaper so selling the shield can fund other upgrades.  Same with the IGS.  If you don't have the cash, I'd at least recommend questing the dragonic pauldrons from WW. Simple quest and they at least have HP on 'em (other, better, shoulders but you can see that if you just check out Omni's upgrade post from a few weeks back in this forum). <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, Buldog was right on.  Get rid of the back and shoulders since the ones you have are AC-based and not HP/STA-based.  Then dump the bracers.  You want the cobalt bracer for the rest of your gaming life, but you want it for the clickie and not to actually wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i agree on the lodi shield, if you have the resorces and faction you can do the katta quest for the shield, i think it's called loyalist shield of honor, has 50ac 75hp, and str/wis, fairly good item. if you do have the cash to throw around a herophants cloak has 75hp and usually goes for 10 to 15k on stormhammer, the land of inflated prices. some times it's hard to let go of the AC, but the HP really will do you better in the long run.</div></div><hr />
