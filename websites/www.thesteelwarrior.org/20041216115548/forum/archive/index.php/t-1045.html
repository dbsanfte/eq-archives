Take a system that is already vulnerable to interruption by lag (CH rotation), and add some built-in lag along with the complete inability to press another hotkey while the pause is going.<br />
<br />
Our healing is much, much more reliable since we stopped that shit.</div></div><hr />

Raid situations are laggy enough with bunches of people and annoying zone lag, a /pause wouldnt be real prudent. Our clerics can count to 3 also, sometimes 4! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but not the way yer insinuating... they use pause for an anti fizzle device (rare but does happen I am told), but not for timing on CH cycles.<br />
<br />
Something like:<br />
/pause 2, /cast 4<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
This will recover a fizzle damn near immediately... but most often gives you the &quot;You have not yet recovered....&quot; message.</div></div><hr />

Voting on a poll on this board doesn't bump the thread, so I can't see what the problem is with them.  <br />

That's one of the reasons we came over here.</div></div><hr />

The druid was a friend in the guild who had recently quit and left it to me, so I didn't know much about it.  I made a hotkey that would stand him up, cast 3k heal, then sit down again.  First time he fizzled I died because he wouldn't do anything again until the 10 second timer ran out, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Good clerics know how to make a fizzle-free hotkey.</div></div><hr />

even better clerics dont + watch &amp; press alt-whatever to recast if they fizzle :p</div></div><hr />

Humans can't recast as consistently and quickly as a fizzle-free hotkey. Fizzles have nothing to do with the /pause vs. head-count debate. Abso-fucking-lutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;fizzle free&quot; hotkeys have other issues, theres reasons you dont wanna use them, has &quot;abso-fucking-lutely nothing&quot; to do with pause vs counting, thats not rocket science to figure out.  If you are talking about for bot clerics, sure they make sense cause odds are that person isnt watching the cleric that close &amp; dont need the additional flexibility that you get from not using such a hot key, real people can recast as fast as a &quot;fizzle free&quot; hotkey + retain more flexibility because they can duck outta ch much easier &amp; either cast different spells, change targets, etc without worrying about the fizzle catch start to recast ch again.<br />
<br />
I used a a ch button with 2 ch casts in it, drove me &quot;Abso-fucking-lutely&quot; crazy.</div></div><hr />

Works great for me. Till doublefizzle happens.</div></div><hr />

What other issues? Please list any issue that is NEARLY as bad as a CH being cast a second too late.<br />
<br />

<br />
No they can't. They really can't. Machines trump human reaction time all the time. <br />

<br />
Fizzle-free hotkeys don't interfere with your ability to duck spells. The recasts all happen very quickly. <br />
<br />
<br />
 &amp; either cast different spells, <br />
<br />
Not sure why a rotation cleric would be casting anything but CH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happened to me all the time - I duck &amp; ch starts casting again.  yes, my hotkey was laid out exactly like the one mentioned above: cast, msg, cast &amp; yes, i'm playing on a nice machine with fast connection so its not lag/latency issues.  I can recast a fizzled spell in &lt; 1 second np, if you pay attention &amp; have any kinda motor skills you can recast a fizzled spell in virtually no time.  It takes me &gt; 1 second to duck outta 2nd ch if I need to change targets or whatever right after starting to cast ch.<br />
<br />
Probably the most annoying times i've had this happen is in xp groups in poe where i'll be reading cnn on my other computer, look over when I know its about time to ch &amp; notice an add beating on a caster right right when I start casting ch - duck ch, hit the emergency bailout divarb button &amp; have 2nd ch start casting instead.<br />
<br />
Fizzle catcher macro is super if you are in say ssra/vt &amp; gonna be fighting some crap mob where you arent going to have to do a tank swtich, not gonna have to worry about adds, not worry about aes, not worry about anything except not falling asleep for 8-10+ minutes &amp; dont wanna pay attention at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure why a rotation cleric would be casting anything but CH.&quot;<br />
<br />
during unplanned tank switches we have the clerics at the end of our rotations spamming fast heals till their turn in rotation - this helps a lot on elemental minis like magmaton/reparm etc so you can have your next tank get in &amp; start fighting without waiting 10 seconds for heals to land &amp; losing dps people during that time frame.  For some pop mobs, its often worth it for a cleric to miss a ch in order to say land a heal on a key player (like a chanter or other cleric for instance) since most pop mobs have really spikey dps &amp; the majority of chs are hitting for in the 0&lt;1k range anyways.  For lesser mobs, I routinely heal people fighting adds/getting hit with aes while participating in ch rotation.  Also, if youre fighting blazzax or spider queen in pof with like 45-50 people, lotta times you need to have your clerics leave the ch rotation &amp; mgb ee &amp; rejoin the rotation, etc. <br />
<br />
If you wanna have a buncha mindless clerics that do nothing but press a button everytime their name or number is called, who cant communicate &amp; work together as a team, then yeah, I guess they shouldnt be casting anything other than ch &amp; a fizzle catcher would be great as to require a complete minimum of interaction.  Really isnt any point in having real clerics at that point though , might as well just have everyone in your guild that 2boxes pl up a cleric &amp; use them for all your rotation cleric needs - just dont complain to me when you guild totally sucks because your most important class is all a buncha drones who dont know what they are doing &amp; cant function as a team.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this is a warrior board, not a cleric board so I wont bother with this thread anymore - morale of story is fizzle catcher in hotkey = not good for every person in every situation &amp; until you play a cleric from 1-65 + 140+aas &amp; can speak from experience, plz dont try to tell me i'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

I've only seen a triple fizzle once but really that setup is too easy to do as long as you can count to 3 and know when to click that little button or hit the hotkey.</div></div><hr />
