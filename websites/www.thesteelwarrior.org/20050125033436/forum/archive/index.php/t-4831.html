     <br />
  <br />
    I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I<br />
  believe he's a she. Think about it. Christmas is a<br />
  big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing, social deal,<br />
  and I have a tough time believing a guy could<br />
  possibly pull it all off! <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    For starters, the vast majority of men don't even<br />
  think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. <br />
  Once at the mall, they always seem surprised to find<br />
  only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood<br />
  rings left on the shelves. On this count alone, I'm<br />
  convinced Santa is a woman. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe<br />
  would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating<br />
  musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the<br />
  shopping bag. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    Another problem for a he-Santa would be getting<br />
  there. First of all, there would be no reindeer<br />
  because they would all be dead, gutted and strapped<br />
  on to the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed,<br />
  desperate claims that buck season had been extended.<br />
  Blitzen's rack would already be on the way to the<br />
  taxidermist. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    Even if the male Santa DID still have reindeer,<br />
  he'd also have the transportation problems because<br />
  he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow<br />
  and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for<br />
  directions. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
  <br />
     <br />
    Other reasons why Santa can't possibly be a man: <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    - Men can't pack a bag. <br />
  <br />
    - Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red<br />
  velvet. <br />
  <br />
    - Men would feel their masculinity is<br />
  threatened...<br />
    having to be seen with all those elves. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    - Men don't answer their mail. <br />
  <br />
    - Men would refuse to allow their physique to be<br />
  described,<br />
    even in jest, as anything remotely resembling a<br />
  &quot;bowl full of jelly.&quot; <br />
  <br />
    - Men aren't interested in stockings unless<br />
  somebody's wearing them. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    - Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously <br />
    inhibit their ability to pick up women. <br />
  <br />
    - Finally, being responsible for Christmas would<br />
  require a commitment. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    -I can buy the fact other mythical holiday<br />
  characters are men: <br />
  <br />
    Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and<br />
  looking ominous. Definite guy. <br />
  <br />
    Cupid flies around carrying weapons. <br />
  <br />
    Uncle Sam is a politician who likes to point<br />
  fingers. <br />
  <br />
    Any one of these individuals could pass the<br />
  testosterone screening test. <br />
  <br />
     <br />
  <br />
    But not Santa!!!</div></div><hr />

(but i'd love to have it up on the main page. it's awesome)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you imagine describing a womans physique as that?  You'd be on the shit list for life, assuming you live through the initial onslaught.</div></div><hr />
