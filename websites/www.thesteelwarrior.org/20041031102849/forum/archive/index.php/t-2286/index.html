<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings and salutations, as a lowly level 57 warrior who often finds himself with his arse in area's where he seems to be quite outlevelled by the monsters he has to fight, i've come finally to the conclussion i need a SERIOUS overhaul of my equipment.<br />
<br />
I got something of around 30K pp to throw around on new gear or upgrades<br />
<br />
I've opened up my bank &amp; inventory on my profile and about everything that wouldn't be better to use over my current setup is concidered sellable for more cash.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any help/advice you guys could give me, as i've been going berzerk trying to figure out what and how to upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">replace hero bracers with Silver chitin wristbrand maybe?<br />
<br />
Make Eyepatch of plunder quest, VS is realtivly empty so you should get Lodizals section.<br />
<br />
And the 100hp quest shoulders should be fine too, requires some questing as well :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The following is a small list of the areas most in need of upgrade and a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
drovlarg mantle: forged shoulderpads, fierce heraldic pauldrons<br />
<br />
orc fang earring: bloodmetal earring of engagement, mosquito leg earring, earring of the solstice (no drop, but i believe the pieces are MQable)<br />
<br />
hero bracers: crystal chitin wristband, bracelet of fortitude, fierce heraldic bracer<br />
<br />
shissar fangs: idol of the thorned, nighmarewood compound bow<br />
<br />
grotesque alloy mask: crystal spider eyes, death mask of the elysians, fierce heraldic visor<br />
<br />
Not sure what these run on your server, but if nothing else just check out whats available in the bazaar in your price range: ac, hp, and sta are your #1 concerns.<br />
<br />
Not sure if you're looking for weapons, but you may want to invest in something with a good aggro proc like a greatstaff of thunder - these are under 5k in many servers now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Greug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got two map pieces allready for the eye patch, just missing the stormfeather (hate this spawn with a passion after spending 3 days there and getting KS'd  when he finally poped on my head)<br />
<br />
So the SF and the Stalker are the only two map pieces i've got missing now  (will see to ask a friendly guilddruid to port me and to go track for stalker)<br />
<br />
ps: due to some &quot;minor&quot; stupidity at creation process, i can't wear Fierce heraldic (trust me, no need to beat me up for it, i have done so often enough eh)<br />
<br />
I'll check for that mantle replacement tho, i'm ashamed when people inspect me and they get to see that piece on my troll<br />
<br />
Prices are pretty weird at times on VS (one day you can find a bunch of items at a few K, the day after they're at double for the next 2 months)<br />
Solstice can be completely MQ'd/bought for about 4 - 5 K package deal on the server, so might look into those.  last mosquito leg i saw pass in the auctions was at around 10K+<br />
<br />
Been looking for the GsoT but, apparently it's not being farmed on our server, or, it's being retained by the guilds instead of being sold (aka, haven't seen a single one for sale yet)<br />
<br />
Gonna check for some other upgrades, worst comes to wear i'll just go abuse my friend's necro some more for plat farming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just want to add &quot;Bracer of Defense&quot; somthing around 2k and nice for Wrist-Slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To save you some plat, if you have a slower and 1 or 2 other mid 50's, go to UP and get the elysian mask.  Drops off corrupted elysians (go to eqdruids.com and look in the hunting area if you need tips on hunting there...lots of great guides and it's a piece of cake once you get the hang of it.)<br />
<br />
As to the GSoT...on EMarr I rarely saw one for 2 months, then when I did it was 50k.  So, when I saw one for 38k one day I bought it...that was only a month ago...a friend of mine just bought one for 3.5k:o ...be patient and I bet you'll see these for less thank 10k in the near future.<br />
<br />
Not sure if they will stay this way, but on EMarr Mosquito Leg Earrings have also dropped from 22k to 11k in the last couple weeks.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you'll see a lot of the 'old school' uber stuff drop pretty significantly due to a combination of 65 crowd farming (since they can get better xp in old world dungeons now), and people unloading old stuff due to the insane things coming out of PoP.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rathsar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Temporary shoulder upgrade : Tattered Mantle.<br />
<br />
Wrist: Rock Moulded Wristguard - kinda new and pc dropping like a stone, around 4K on my server - better overall imho than Silver Chitin WB.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder is hard to beat for the money, around 15K is/was the going rate a few days ago (on Lanys at least).<br />
<br />
If you can afford to, Barbed Dragon Boots are probably going to set you back around 5K or so and are hard to beat for the money - nice Sta/HP.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Trondir <br />

<br />
OK so replace &quot;FH&quot; with &quot;cultural</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A lot of these are repreats from others, but...<br />
<br />
Ear:  replace orc fang with PoTC earing<br />
Face:  Death mask of the Elysians<br />
Wrist:  Replace Hero bracer with cultural bracer or Rock Moulded Wristguard<br />
Chest:  Cultural, or farm a Moktar or Ralduken BP<br />
Range:  Idol of the Thorned, or look at bows with STA and or HP's...couple out there, forget names<br />
Weapons:  Procing agro weapons are a must.  GSoT, smithed ykesha's, the Droga weapons, even a frosty would be a significant upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I see you are guilded.<br />
<br />
Take about 12 or 18 people your level and move to plate house.<br />
<br />
Had an excellent guild for this but lost it sorry.<br />
<br />
Goes something like say a phrase.<br />
<br />
Dwarf spawns , someone smacks him.<br />
<br />
two low 50 giants spawns.<br />
<br />
Once each one of these dies a 54(?) spawns <br />
<br />
Once a certain one of the 54 dies a 55 spawns.<br />
<br />
Then a 58ish<br />
<br />
Then a 60, tanking him is easy even without slow for you. With chanter and sham should be able to land slow on a couple of tries.<br />
<br />
Then the dwarf spawns again and makes a run for exit. Need to kill him before he runs or no cycle again for like an hour or something.<br />
<br />
Also there are 4 local spawns plus two or three longer timed named spawns in area.<br />
<br />
There is also a spawn up stairs you will prob deal with on level 60 cause his resists are huge and snaring him can be a problem.<br />
<br />
Each cycle should drop 0-2 (usually one) item needed for Thurgy plate armor.<br />
<br />
Get the needed gems (non bp gems are real cheap now a days on my server (20-100pp each) and faction (kindly or warmly to coldain) and you have armor slighty better then cultural.<br />
<br />
This Link (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=102) shows all the armor that can be had from Kael drops + gems + faction.<br />
<br />
This Link (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/veliousarmour.html) shows all the info needed for velious armor quests quests<br />
<br />
<br />
Sory I do not have exact information about cyle like phrase or mob names and who spawns what but my info regarding that was lost. Was on old guild website and they gone now <br />
<br />
A good trick I was shown was charm the mob whose death line eventually triggers the 60 spawn. Kill him when other two mob line is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Greug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Okay so threw out a few thousand PP allready for the rock moulded wrist piece (nice upgrade btw, didn't know it was around that price) and splashed out 5K for a GSoT (&quot;friend&quot; had it rotting in bank, till i yelled at him eheh, he's not even a warrior!)<br />
<br />
Gonna see to produce some more funds and get some decent upgrade next for the earring/and other crap,  thanks for the suggestions people.<br />
<br />
ps: Did plate house runs with the topnotch of our guild and i think EQ doesn't like us eheh, not a single plate drop over a 2 hour period.  Oh well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thoggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh MAN! Could you post a link to where you got that picture? Being a troll warrior myself and play nothing but Trolls id love to have it to keep!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Greug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">http://www.wanderingwolves.com/eq/troll.gif<br />
<br />
