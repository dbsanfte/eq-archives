<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the new changes to regeneration I find myself wondering why anyone would start a troll or iksar anymore. Now any class can regen 98% as good as you can. So i get to be fat  and hated for a whopping 2-3% better regernation. Would have been so much smarter to take an ogre.<br />

Yep. <br />
<br />
I might have been pissed if regen was the reason I chose to be a lizard. Heck, I didn't even know there was a difference in my ac, regen or the exp penalty until 2 weeks after I created my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gerick said &quot;stun immunity ? good stats ? good gear ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trolls and iksar's dont get any stun immunity. The big advantage to these 2 races as far as warrior goes was the inate regeneration bonus which used to be substantial and is now minute.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trolls have melee stun immunity from the front al~la ogres if i remember right.... no race has stun immunity to spells tho :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No they don't, but having an high unbuffed stamina gives you a higher chance of avoiding a stun.  Of course, after the release of the stalwart endurance AA, chance to be stunned went through the damned roof, so being huge doesnt help much any more unless you're an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksar's still have AC bonus.<br />
<br />
But in this argument, why does anyone pick a human, gnome, barbarian, hobbit ... what benefits are there?  They get no innate stun immunity, no innate regen from race, some have vision problems without spells/gear ...<br />
<br />
Faction isn't much of a big deal since PoP + expansions.<br />
<br />
Shrink isn't a big deal, cost of minimizing device when no shrinker in group is minimal.<br />
<br />
I picked Ogre because thought it was fitting that a strong MA be the biggest race there is.  Even without stun immunity I would have picked Ogre, even though I had to deal with crappy faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They shouldn't; all should start over as a humans!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think most people don't care about the stats and the off chance they will get stunned. Most play what they will have fun with. The entire stun-immunity arguement is totally based in a power-gamer mentality. I have a level 65 Dwarf Warrior, and I don't think stun was ever a big factor in any raid or group I was with.<br />
<br />
As for Iskars, I might have played one myself, they just cool... oh, and the tail  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ah my mistake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trolls/iksars still have a standing regen advantage (and sitting too I believe although it's not as significant as it was).  <br />
<br />
The racial DISadvantages (faction, size, plate armor for iksars) are completely insignificant in today's game, so in my mind it doesn't matter that the advantages are too.  Why play a human?  Why play a Barbarian?  Cause you want to.  Personally I would never make a troll, ogre, or iksar because they don't appeal to me, but they are no worse warriors than anything else.</div></div><hr />

I used to be in the Iksar camp too, but then.....eh.<br />

I'm in the half-elf camp with Shik now =/<br />

At least Shakerpage got approved as a name!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To answer the original question: after the Trolls lost their home town, I was thinking about making an alt and I finally decided on a Troll SK, precisely because I thought trolls might well have the most disadvantages of any SK race. Erudites were in there too, but they don't have an exp penalty. So, I picked a Troll because I couldn't figure out why anyone would still play one, and I thought it would be interesting to solve the problems associated with Trollness. And, eventually, eat some halflings.<br />
There is no logical reason to make a Troll.<br />
<br />
Back when I started started EQ, I only did minimal research before picking a race (hell, before picking a class).<br />
I picked a Barb because they could wear both medium and large armor, which I thought might come in handy. They could slam, which I thought would be handy. They had a good newbie zone and starting city (lol, no, not PoK). I thought it would be easier to play a race that didn't have as many faction issues as evil races. <br />
Once, those were pretty good reasons for picking a Barb war as a first character.<br />
Briefly, once I realized that Barb wars had no newbie armor quests (well, not back then) I thought human warriors looked like a good choice too. But oh well: I tailored myself some leather armor, then smithed banded, then chain. I couldn't see in the dark, but I learned to back through the cave to BB. Killed hundreds of gnolls to tailor the gnoll cape (bleh, forgot what it's called) and then turned that in for a magic (!) piercing weapon and killed wisps for a Greater Light Stone (woot!).<br />
Even pre-luclin I'm not sure race mattered much; all had benefits and all had drawbacks--you just had to &quot;fix&quot; different aspects of each character. Now race doesn't matter that much, but for different reasons--you don't have to spend a year leveling to 50; post-luclin expansions have largely dropped faction issues and PoP trivialized travel problems; the shared bank slots and the bazaar have trivialized lower-level gear-up problems. The regen patch muted any differences there, the 55 kick stun muted slam advantage, and so on and so on. Not only have differences between races been muted, but entire newbie skill sets have disappeared (remember practicing sense heading, lol? Remember meeting characters who spoke in languages you couldn't understand, heh? Remember when Blackburrow represented a substantial risk that you would fall into a trap to the bottom of the zone and lose all your gear?).<br />
I wish that I'd also started characters in Freeport and somewhere on Faydark too, not because I wish I'd played those races, but because I would have had a chance to play in more of the classic young-player zones when they were still full of groups looking for more. <br />
In my view, as well as adding significant content, expansions also tend to have the effect of eliminating content. <br />
If I were able to make one change to the game right now, I'd make it impossible for a character to use a PoK book before he was level 30. I realize the many drawbacks to this idea. I'd still make it, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play a troll cause nobody wants to see a naked troll running around so the healers do everything they can to make sure I live. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heh; if i could go back with shikarii he'd be a wood elf. just for the fact that wood elfs are fun to RP and pretty much self-substaining. the hell with +regen, +frontal stun immunity, +ac bonus.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If I could do it all over again.. I'd still be a Human. Seriously, Iksar still have hp advantage, and that regen, while useless, doesn't mean other races have something special. I'd rather stay a low-stat blind-ass human just to be human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One of the reason I made a troll (and I still stand by it today) was the fact that troll warriors are extremely rare, at least on Veeshan. Everyone was making ogres. &quot;Ogres are great, ogres get frontal stun immunity, no other race can do better, etc, etc.&quot; Well, I proved them wrong. Who were 3 of the top 4 at the Kunark-era BotB? Trolls! :P<br />
<br />
The regen ability was great at lower levels, and I never cared about faction. Plus when Velious came out, I got a cool looking skull helmet that didn't look like a sex toy or something cut from a wooden table. :P<br />
<br />
Am I pissed about the regen gimped? Hell yes. Maybe they should un-nerf the regen AA's that took away from Trolls/Iksars when AA's went live. But until then, I'm hoping my Vadd helmet will have the skull graphic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errr since when does stamina affect whether or not you get stunned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I picked a wood elf for 2 reasons:  1) I didn't know much about the game and 2) the blond female wood elf model looked like me and it made sense to pick her.  I would still pick a wood elf even knowing what I do, as I like the premise of a chick running around protecting all the prancers, skirts and dresses.  Not to mention there is just something evil about a woman with a nice long sharp knife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It was on the old boards somewhere Payn, big races used to get stunned alot less than other races.  I don't remember exactly where the info originally came from, but remember seeing it on the old board. Now it seems everyone that isn't either an ogre or maxed in SE gets stunned way more than in the old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Balkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">just everyone be friends! all warriors will like be the same at the end of the game .. i think ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Balkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">what i left out .. play the race thats the cutest and have fun \(^_^)/</div></div><hr />

<br />
          thats definitly not true, maybe to sombody who is twinking they will not be signifigant, but to someone who is just starting it can be. its fairly difficult to find cheap armor for an iksar. and at lower lvls you have no chance at all in making a dent in getting faction up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Went barbarian way back when for a couple reasons-<br />
  1. Wanted a large race for the sta and str<br />
  2. Faction. I like to travel. <br />
  3. The role play aspect. I liked the idea of an Ogre/Troll dumbard to role play. But picked barbarian for the &quot;berserk/bring it on&quot; role play idea. Plus, being barbie you can make fun of the fat boys, and the midgets. Best of both worlds hehe<br />
 4. Last but not least... chicks dig muscles! hehe<br />
<br />
 Granted, my first two reasons are irrelevent now with gear and expantions. But the last two are still fun.<br />
 <br />
 But I sometime wish I had gone gnome for the role play and sheer challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Iksar have AC bonus, which s tacks with everything else, and can wear everything else basically once you get to luclin, and can go everywhere basically once you get to velious /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>aabuster1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well... <br />
<br />
Tried Ogre Warrior, attacked guildmaster died. Zoned in outside, bat attacked me, died. Said the heck with that. Made Troll Warrior.<br />
<br />
Regen is great at low levels, saved me a buch a times from dieing - would be in the purple but regen would pop me back up and I would finally win, even if I did go into the purple a couple more times. <br />
<br />
Now at level 65 I still enjoy my regen. Have +13 regen from items and a few +regen from AA. Magelo says I have  35 standing regen / 41 sitting regen. If I understand right the max regen from items is +35 so I can still get another +22 on items and another +3-4 regen in AAs. <br />
<br />
Really works well farming in velks; Never have to stop and sit for HP, can take on the occasional 3-7 mobs at once and still keep going. No real functional value on raids, but I enjoy the grouping side of the game far more than the raiding side. Saved me more than once in LDONS when some idiot would go hit the chest and DOT us with those super DOTs, I'd just sit down while the group died and my regen saved me.<br />
<br />
Soo still love the troll, TROLL &gt; ALL, so I'd never pick any other race as a warrior ... Besides saying how much regen ya have in groups is such a good conversation starter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm trying to imagine that, aabuster --<br />

Enchanter says, &quot;Boy, it sure is cold out here.&quot;<br />

Mage says, &quot;My pet can tank better than half-elf warriors.&quot;<br />

Druid says, &quot;Anybody need any pods of water?&quot;<br />
Entire group says yes. <br />

TrollWarrior says, &quot;Hey, how many hit points do y'all regen per tick? I've got 35 standing and 41 sitting!&quot;<br />
Everybody stares at TrollWarrior for several seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">plate armor for iksars <br />
Well with the xpacs this is no longer an argument. For if this held true then iksars could not use the Ornate armor. or even the velious armor. Also Luclin brought alot of aromor that is plate that iksars can use. The XP neg because we get regen is mute because of the bonus you get for being a warrior.  Now when i go into a dungen i dont have to be shrunk and i can get around just fine. When cornering i get shrunk 2 and corner with no problems. (Now that they fixed it again) My ogre friend has to be a gnome or he cant corner. Even before the Dx9 switch he had hard time cornering unless he was a gnome. <br />
   The main reason i chose to be an iksar was because i am on a PK server and this char was going to be a low lvl PK machine, and i was till i got so hooked on being a warrior that i made him my main. So then it became my job to be the first Iksar warrior to be MTing on our server. 90% of all warriors on my server are ogre, troll, and then probably barb. I am one of the only iksar warriors.</div></div><hr />
