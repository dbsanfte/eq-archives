<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Awhile ago I used to have a Copper Hammer of striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn, but I opted to sell them since I needed the money for other equipment upgrades.  I'm using a GSoT now since its &quot;almost as good&quot;, and now that I feel my equipments have finally caught up a bit I need some advice on what to use for maximum agro.<br />
<br />
I can't camp the droga weapons (guildless and don't have willing friends of the right classes to do it), however, cost on the weapons isn't that big of an issue. I can camp other stuff with a 2boxed shammy for cash, and I've also taken up buying and re-selling stuff for profit.<br />
<br />
Augmenting any bazaar weapon (except a blade of carnage) with angerIII would seem like a waste to me, since i'll eventually get better weapons and it wouldn't be as big a loss to lose cheaper augments like AngerII or the ykesha ones.<br />
<br />
The options I were considering for agro setup were:<br />
<br />
PRIMARY: Copper Hammer of Striking with a ForceofYkesha augment<br />
SECONDARY: Sword of the Bloodsworn with a StrikeofYkesha augment <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
PRIMARY: Greatstaff of Thunder with an AngerII aug<br />
<br />
I could probably get an AngerII aug within a week or two, since it isnt too hard to get a pickup LDoN group to do miraguls instead of takish/mistmoor.<br />
<br />
The dual wield combo sounds like more solid agro to me with all the procs and faster hits, but it'd take me at least a month, if not more to get enough LDoN points for the two augs, and thats assuming I'm able to convince two pickup groups a day to do guk instead of takish or mistmoore. Not to mention having to spend alot of bazaar time buying and re-selling to get the 25k or so I'd need to buy the weapons again.<br />
<br />
Which one do you think I should get? Would different augs and swapping main/offhand (if applicable) provide more agro?<br />
<br />
edit: My source of LDoN info says that the only AngerII augs either require a time weapon (slot type 8), or 1handed only. Is this true, or is my source inaccurate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can't camp Droga for the Hammer and Sword, you probably can't get anything better than a GSoT.   Next step up in DPS is Sot4W, but GSoT outaggros it.  Better weapons that the three talked about here require guild support or deep pockets.<br />
<br />
Given an upgrade to the weapon isn't likely, I'd drop Anger3 (yes, plenty of points) on the GSoT.  Anger 2 doesn't suck either.  As far as I know, there aren't any limitations on the weapons you can Anger as long as they have a slot.  I have an Anger 3 on my CHSD, and an Anger2 on my Malevolent Dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Totally 100% innacurate. <br />
I have a Blade of War (2H not a Time weapon) with Anger on it.<br />
<br />
Now as to the original question... Really hard choice.<br />
<br />
The augmented dual wield combo should last you for a long long time.<br />
And provide superior agro.<br />
And the agro gap will widen in favor of the dual wield as your dex raises.<br />
<br />
With only 150 dex, most of the agro comes from you swinging at mobs.<br />
Not the procs (since they are very rare).<br />
<br />
When your dex raises, your proc rate will go up.<br />
The &quot;Agro Per swing&quot;  will however remain the same.<br />
While the &quot;Proc agro&quot; will almost double at 305 dex.<br />
<br />
That leads me to believe, that if atm with a really low low proc rate<br />
the dual wield combo is better (you say it was)<br />
With a normal proc rate, the dual wield combo will outperform the 2H.<br />
Since you will be optimising dual wield advantage (more procs).<br />
<br />
So the question i ask you ...<br />
Want the best agro ? Go back to dual wield + Augments &amp; slowly raise your dex<br />
Want good easy agro ? Stick Ykesha or Anger2/3 on the GsoT<br />
<br />
If a 2x 15/20 with no procs will generate the same agro as 30/30 with no procs.<br />
Adding procs to the equation, can only favor Dual Wield.<br />
Because DualWield, will by nature proc more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you put Ykesha on both weapons, you are gonna push like a warder. That's not always a bad thing, but be aware that you are going to get ~3 knockbacks per minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, the lazy part of me just wants to get anger 2 for my GSoT and call it a day, but getting 4-6 procs/minute (Dependant on if a shammy in the group buffs my dex) a minute for an average of a proc every 10-15 seconds sounds sexy, especially with all the stuns, and all the DD would actually contribute to DPS.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there thats auged CHoS/SotBS with ykesha or anger2 aug(s) have anything to add to this? :\<br />
<br />
No matter which path I take its going to be a significant timesink (considering i get 22 points/adventure) and I'd like some comments from people who have either setup (with similar augs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do bear in mind something concerning Dual-Wielding and 2H weapons.<br />
<br />
While the riposte difference between using a Dual-Wield setup and 2H weapon might be marginal or slight on normal xp-grind encounters, that very same marginal or slight difference can make a lot of difference when tanking PoP named mobs who hit for 1k+.<br />
<br />
Maybe a bit off-topic, but just a heads-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use the CHoS/SoTB combo, mainhanding the hammer.  My original intent was to augment both with AngerII procs, mostly because I considered 2 procs of 400 hate to be better than one proc of 600 hate for a lesser amount of points.  I'm sure someone would like to disagree with that but that was my feeling.  I augmented my CHoS with AngerII and found that the three procs I now had along with incite was in general plenty of aggro for most situations I can come across.  I still haven't augmented the SoTB figuring I can afford to spend my points in better places.  The difference with the single AngerII proc was however night and day.  So I guess my answer to the question is one AngerII proc is more than likely sufficient for someone who is guildless and probably doesn't do more than LDoN or doesn't expect to go past tier3 PoP in the near future.  My advice would be to slap the AngerII on the hammer, use it for awhile, and if you still feel like you need more aggro, then you can purchase a second augment.<br />
<br />
As far as the riposte is concerned, I still carry the GSoT around in my bags.  One thing I've noticed about the DW combo is it is far superior in terms of the initial aggro.  My biggest problem, even with incite, when using the GSoT is the short term aggro when the mob is getting slowed.  If I find I'm in a situation where riposte is eating me alive over the course of a battle I DW through the slow, establish solid aggro, then swap in the GSoT to save the healers some mana.  This is mostly of course in PoP or when tanking raid style named.</div></div><hr />
