<br />
In addition, while our tests have indicated that players are getting the intended 5% miss rate while using a single max-skill weapon against even level enemies (yes, we've tested this exhaustively, and cannot reproduce the 9% miss rate you're reporting for normal swings)<br />
<br />
I think we can all agree that we are no where near 5% as a miss rate. So I would like to get a testing thread going so we can get a good number of tests.<br />
<br />
Tonight I was in Felstone Field fighting the 50-52 undead there, with 4 54 Jibbering Ghouls in to dirty the data. <br />
<br />
Skill is 259 thoughout the sample. This is only for the default attack. No other attack types are considered. Screen shot can be provided.<br />
<br />
1172 swings<br />
154 misses (13.1%)<br />
35 Dodges (3.0%)<br />
18 Parries (1.5%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">remember that the dev said the 5% miss rate was for EVEN level ! he said nothing for its scaling to the +1-5 levels.<br />
BTW, what is your sample size ? (1172 isn't a huge number that permit RNG averages).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to say I don't know, as it was done real time and not via log parcing.

<br />
Given is pass/fail nature, you can speak with a high degree of confidence with 1000+ tries. And of course I know it was on even levels that the dev said that, hence the warning saying that I had a small number of level 54's in the sample. Given the drop rate on Minion's Scourgestones, and that I collected one stack, I would guestimate a mob sample size of 60.</div></div><hr />

And you realize this is more of the game lying to us. Its not really a miss but that is what we tell the client...</div></div><hr />

Hmm.  I'm sure they're going to somehow roll some added miss rate on top of the base 5% no matter what the mob is.  It pretty much sucks, but I don't think it's worth fighting over at this point until the changes go through.  The tweak to the skills miss rate will hopefully help a lot.<br />
<br />
As for a mob that only dodges, sign me up. ^^</div></div><hr />

I believe /combatlog will turn on a combat log which goes into your WoW directory.  Not sure on the format or anything (haven't played with it yet), but I suspect a parser would be fairly easy to write for it.  I think getting that parser (may mess with it tonight) would be a great step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
If someone has a combat log they can post, I can check it out (horridly boring all-day meeting = slacking)<br />

<br />
You know if in the 2300+ swings that  I  have been tracking now, I had actually gotten my 2h skill to 2 god damned 60, I would parsed at 2 god damned 60. Sorry that in the first 40% of  52 I have not been able to get that last skill point.  If you want to tell me how to get it some other way that swinging the god damned sword I would be happy to &quot;make sure my weapon skill is maxed.&quot;<br />
<br />
259 Skill, 2h Sword again 50-52 Skelletons at Felstone Feild. The Majority of the sample is against Skeletal Flayers, level 50-51. There were 2-3 zombies in the sample (hence the parries). No mobs higher than 52 or lower than 50 were attacked. Did run from the @#$^ jibbering ghoul a couple of times.<br />
<br />
1202 swings<br />
141 Misses (11.7%)<br />
5 Parries (0.4%)<br />
48 Dodges (4.0%)<br />
<br />
Oh and thanks about combat log, that did work...now I just need to find a parser....</div></div><hr />

Ask and you shall recieve. Does not cover nearly all we can do, but a small sample to get you started. As a note, the log file is not written (or wasn't writen) until I quit the game (though I did not try just going to the character select screen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you realize this is more of the game lying to us. Its not really a miss but that is what we tell the client... <br />

How did you ever become one of the reputable people during EQ's early days making bullshit statements like this?  Lying to us?  You mean like those other &quot;lies&quot; (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=10346) you claimed were happening and you ended up eating shit on?<br />
<br />
Here's a fucking idea.  Stop using cosmos's goddamned parser.  There's no fucking way that thing is accurate, at all, fucking period.  Create a combat log and either analyze it yourself, or look for something reputable to do your tests with, or stop fucking doing them.  All you're doing right now is making yourself look dumb by creating faulty data sets and making up conclusions based upon them.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the last point of your skillup for your level will always come in the last 40% or so of your level.  You'll sit at 259 until you get over the halfway hump, and then you'll see it go up to 260 somewhere after that.  You'd think with all these astute observations you've been making lately, you could notice something like that in 50 some odd levels.<br />
<br />
And if you think I'm being pissy, or harsh, or whatever, then so be it.  You've been on a tyrade about some nonsense for the last month with absolutely ZERO proof of any of it, just minute data sets that you think proves something.  I've got zero issues with forming hypotheses or doing actual testing on in game scenarios, but stop with your bullshit conclusions of everything being broken or you being lied to unless you're 100% sure.  This game has been in the works for YEARS now, I don't think you're the one fucking person who's so far been able to see what everyone else can't.</div></div><hr />

me thinks you already know this, but I'll say it anyway.  swinging your sword would be the one and only way to skill up.  Yep, that last ones a major pain in the ass to get.  I'll bet you a wooden nickle they did that on purpose.  I can tell you that everytime I've finally got that last kill point my miss rate got better.  Of course I dinged a few bubs later =O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Haass in my book telling me I get 2 stamina means I should get the regular benefits of 2 stamina--otherwise its dishonest.<br />
<br />
You are right, though you don't say it, that I don't provide a context for the lastest one. Here it is: the devs speak again (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=1123852&amp;P=2) .<br />
<br />
When fighting against mobs that do not dodge or parry, those events still actually happen, but are translated into &quot;misses&quot; by the UI. While there are some other subtle but important differences between humanoids with weapons and/or shields and other types of enemies (like beasts, elementals, etc), the translation of &quot;dodge&quot; and &quot;parry&quot; into &quot;miss&quot; is an important factor in ensuring that fighting a giant spider is relatively equivalent to fighting against a humanoid of the same level that is using a weapon/shield.<br />
<br />
and a bit later<br />
<br />
Another key factor players should be aware of when considering the 5% base miss chance is their position relative to the enemy. If your character is positioned in the 180 degree rear arc of the enemy, any of the times that the enemy would have dodged/parried if you were in front of them are translated into &quot;misses&quot; instead. This can often lead players to believe that they're getting more then their expected number of &quot;misses&quot;, when in actuality it was a combination of misses, dodges, and parries. <br />
<br />
So yeah, we get lied to. Past that I haven't drawn any conclusions. The tighter testing of the second sample may help. Miss rate still looks high to me though--but the sample is probably too small  to say. Assuming parries happen at the same rate as dodges (about 4%) leaves me at 7% miss rate against mostly 50-51 mobs. I am inclined--pending more testing--to agree we do seem to have a 5% base miss rate. Not that you can tell from testing yet though.</div></div><hr />

There are a TON of things stated in the book, on their sight, that are either outdated or just not true anymore.  Kinda happens like that when the money guys show up and say, well looks good to me, ship it!<br />
<br />
One of these days, they'll get their servers working and maybe then they can work on the doc's.  But calling them liars implies they intend to misdirect you.  You honstely believe that Blizzard intentially is misleading you?</div></div><hr />
