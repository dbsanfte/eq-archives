<br />
*edit* Not looking for spoilers or anything, but are there any events coming up that are as imaginative as Inktu'ta? The Cursecallers was a blast for me, and I really enjoyed the various encounters in the zone.<br />

<br />
Runt event isn't hard, however you will need some heavy healing for High Priest script. At least when we did him(before even oow was out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">txevu is the first time in the expansion that you really come across encounters that'll really open up some dps on your tanks.  high priest is really really easy with 70 and new spells. :(  <br />
<br />
inktuta is unique, there's no other place like it.  ink is about thinking to win, txevu/tacvi are about surviving.  you'll come across alot of half wiped zerg for the wins in txevu/tacvi content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP is alot easier, I'd expect most guilds to do it in 2 tries with no strats or 1 if they are good at changing their plan on the go or have the strats. Zun is alot harder because it requires your raid to split up and a mistake at 1 point = wipe elsewhere, that and you are basing the win on a random pop.<br />
<br />
Tacvi is not that bad either with 70 + aa from OOW, Xxeric in 2 tries and Riel Tavas at 17% on our second try.<br />
<br />
Though with MPG trials , King/Queen etc we never bothered with much else but Ixt's, Anueks and then Runt/HP/Zun. Others seemed like they needed a fair few tries to master and the RvR and time invested just inst worth it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With level 70 and 600 resists HP is a lot easier.  The hardest part of HP comes from the fact that his AE seems to have an extra -100 adjustment on top of what it claims so even though it's a standard everything + snare combo you can't get it to bounce early by having high MR back when 500 was the max so you end up either taking the dot or devoting a lot of resources to curing.  With 600 MR, you'll simply resist it outright or it'll just bounce in a few ticks like most snares do.  Same with Zun really, level 70 and 600 MR makes resisting his AE a snap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inktu'ta is a great zone. Lotsa little things to get a grip on. Very &quot;alive&quot; fights that have a lot of people involved and active, making decisions on their own etc. A little sense of pandemonium sometimes is good for morale hehe.<br />
<br />
I know the guild would like to hear that there is more of the same coming, but, we have heard evil things about Txevu! We're a fairly casual guild that started with Stromm and raids on a limited schedule ( lot of older working types) so we're very happy with our steady progress. May it continue ... knocks on a gnome ... and may we always be one raid expansion or more behind hehe. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inktu`ta is definatly one of the funnest zones. The encounters change rapidly from one thing to another, lots of variation on how things can be done, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Txevu, on the other hand, is pretty much &quot;DO this or die&quot; and alot of the same basic encounter. Champion is probably the funnest event in the entire zone, and it is trivial after 3 attempts at most. Have fun, and enjoy the expansion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The champion event was hard back when the 3 adds used to be random mez/unmez (due to level).  Now that you can guaranteed mezzing all 3 adds it's a pretty standard MT encounter, though the Runt part is cool.  We always cheer for the Runt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same lol. What adds though? We normally only have to do Runt,Champion and Goat. (SK solos runt, warrior picks up Champion, nother warrior picks up goat when champion dead)</div></div><hr />

Before OoW it's random whether you can mez them or not which makes it a bit more interesting.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure the goat assists champion anyway so there's not much point to get aggro.  Just use Riposte if you have both goat &amp; champion alive at the same time, and with today's DPS that should never happen anyway.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, we've never had the adds, and if you go right corner and not left corner, you can get champion single, and then do Goat after Champion is down. Its how we've been doing it atleast.</div></div><hr />
