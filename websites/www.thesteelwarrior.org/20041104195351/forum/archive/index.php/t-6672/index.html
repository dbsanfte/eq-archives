<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Single target rampage that has a decent range so it's a good idea to let RT pull with DA or you risk having a caster that isn't paying attention and is sitting on inc get on rampage.<br />
<br />
There are a few ways to fight this depending on the number of healers you have.  You can either range fight it or you can MGB heal fight it.  Tactics depend on your guild.<br />
<br />
Approx 650-700k hp, max hit 1913, kick for  580, bash for  575, swings around 3.7 delay once slowed.  His melee is weak so it's just taking care of rampage and keeping everyone alive with his AE if you melee him.  It's good practice for elemental-type fights (ie Blazz, Babs, Wise, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, just the info I was looking for!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kick / bash damage might be higher, around 634.  I think the values I see are on a defensive warrior.  Nothing major, though/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have done him with 50 people. Just a little tip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I suggest assigning a &quot;suicide team&quot; to remove the damage shield while SolRo is incoming, especially if your tanks dual wield.  The damage shield will produce more DPS than SolRo himself until it's removed.  The suicide team should consist of: tash chanter, malo shaman, MOK cleric.  Ideally MOK should land before SolRo reaches the tank.  It's about even odds as to whether any of the suicide team will actually die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's not much to sol.ro, he's the pussiest god / diety in PoP imo.<br />
<br />
Tank him, ramp tank him, cch, heal ae, beat him down. Most use suicide dispeller to pull, tho it's not needed if your melee have brains enough to listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Everytime we have ever killed him we always use Chanter/Shaman to pull with debuff.  Then have another Chanter/Shaman pull with slow and take him over to the MT.  We always do him range style just have everyone use arrows/etc.  He doesn't seem to have to many HP goes down pretty fast he is pretty pathetic to be a God.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If your tanks are using a 2h, the 150pt damage shield isn't too bad since it'll take a few moments to remove.  Melee shouldn't go in until it's removed, just common sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the advice, we layed down a brutal beating on Sol Ro list night, he's by far one of the easiest encounters we've had in a while.</div></div><hr />
