<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">heard somethign on pon where they said defensive if used on named in tipt that the discer would be at bottom of aggro....<br />
<br />
is this true or a wishlist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">True, theres a thread in Tavern on it<br />
<br />
well basically true i'm not a war so i dont know exact mechanics but basically cant use D/E/S on KHJ/DD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read through some of it before it came down to another ruined post.<br />
<br />
to sum it up?<br />
<br />
 &quot;its only Jhiru and Diabolical Destroyer&quot;<br />
<br />
And it's not a total aggro loss except with defensive/stonewall and rip/dodge disc?<br />
<br />
and not a complete drop like DA?<br />
<br />
Can anyone hold aggro WHILE defensive doing this or has it been tested yet?</div></div><hr />

A single cleric was able to keep me with chain casting supernal light and one DI under defensive. Last guy seem to be the same as always.  Group was warrior (me), cleric, monk, shaman (my bot), non-guild bard, and chanter.</div></div><hr />
