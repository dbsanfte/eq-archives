<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SK are clearly underpowered in most situation now, they struggle (mana wise) to hold aggro in xp grp, their dps is lacking, and their tanking ability quite weak. <br />
Paladin though, are still VERY good tank in xp group, stun mitigate A LOT of damage, considering most mobs are fully or mostly slowable, they will do a large part of their dmg in the 1st few seconds, before slow lands, a stun at inc will drasticaly reduce the mana needed to heal the tank. In Vxed Tipt KT Ikkinz 90% of the mobs can be stunned.<br />
But well when it comes to tank a named, the paladin become a mana sponge.<br />
<br />
You can say whatever you want, with gear of the same quality, it's STILL much easier to clean trash mob with a Pal MT than with a War MT, it's less mana consuming for healers, safer for debuffers, and Pal can back heal very well in case of problem (Am I the only one to think that pals are the best back healers ? even in front of druids now in terms of hp/sec healed in emergency case).<br />
<br />
Shadowknight just suck at the moment. Low dps, no way to mitigate damage, they can pull but so can 3 /4 other classes that bring more to the group than a SK, they don't buff, picking a sk in your group is just charity.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but only among good paladins, which represent like 10% of the overall paladin population.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem is, if you change the mobs to be easier such that a paladin tanking some of these things, is equivilent to a warrior tanking them now with discipline, you end up making the trials themselves significantly easier, since you had to just cut their damage 30%+, and warriors still have disciplines.<br />
<br />
Giving paladins the disciplines, even lesser versions and you change things across the board, moving paladins closer to warrior abilities.  If Paladins are 95% of a warriors ability, plus all of their healing, then where would that leave warriors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extensive play of a level 64 shadowknight should have told you the following....<br />
<br />
Pact of Hate doesn't stack with the Clarity line<br />
Aura of Hate doesn't stack with the Ferocity line<br />
Mental Corruption doesn't work ~40% of the time.<br />
<br />
Shadow knights enjoy the BEST self mana regen of the hybrids, but I believe rangers with that go to buff bots do better in the long run, as their self mana regen buffs stacks with all of the above and isn't situational.<br />
<br />
I have played a shadow knight for close to 5 years.  Do I have room to complain, yes.  Have I complained, no.  For years I have made what I was from my class and have enjoyed and do still enjoy playing my shadowknight.  I learned to recognize when things were broken.  Warriors had crap for agro for 5 years, it was broke.  I was a big believer in the changes they made to warriors to fix that huge hole.  All the whining has just moved to other classes now that warriors have had their aggro problems fixed.  The thing that pick up groups were passing you over was agro, now they are passing over knights for the lack of efficient tanking.<br />
<br />
Until collectively tanks stack WELL in groups there will be problems.  There is only one spot for a tank really, much like there is only one real spot necessary for a cleric.<br />
<br />
Another solution to this simply would be to make groups have up to 8 people.  This I don't see happening however, but it would alleviate the strain on group make up and open up more secondary roles for groups, which with most content just isn't all that necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, I meant that Pact of Hate INSTEAD of KEI (it is better).  I have run into instances where Mental Corruption does not work (I see no reason it shouldn't work on all mobs, but thats SoE for you), but most of the time it does.  I don't know what the Ferocity line is (which class casts that?) but that's why I said MOST group taps stack.<br />
<br />
I was referring to the MOST of the time that Gurgeh posted.  MOST of the time SKs are excellent both as tanks and as non-tanks in groups.<br />
<br />
I am aware that there are alot of bugs and stacking issues in the SK spellbook, but overall SKs are damn good in XP groups and on raids and do well both in tank and utility roles in XP groups.  I know I for one don't disregard SKs in a group because they already have a Pally or Warrior.  And, like I said, SKs spells stack very well with Necro spells.  By all means, fix stacking issues and spell bugs, but I simply do not see SKs as having any real issues ATM (GoD excluded).  They are certainly not as horrible as Gurgeh makes them out to be.</div></div><hr />

All the time, you just think its not valid. but warriors have no &quot;useless&quot; spellbook. If its oh so useless, why are you still playing a knight? One can argue that a Paladins spellbook is useless sometimes if the damage isnt AE and isnt constant enough and the mob isnt undead or stunable, but an SKs? You have got to be kidding.</div></div><hr />

200 hp to the group<br />

150 damage to the mob <br />

And if you want to start draining your mana<br />
you can easily get 600-1200 damage in bursts.<br />
<br />
All in all, useful.  But so are disciplines.  Really turns into a wash in my mind.  There really isn't a big difference in my mind between discs and spells except discs are very utilitarian, they are only about killing or avoiding death.<br />
<br />
All in all, the odd thing about this is that it is the damage classes that are far outstripping every tank in being able to perform their role better and better and the tanks are the ones falling on each with gnashing teeth.<br />
<br />
The preferred method of garnering experience is STILL one in which no character comes with in reach of the target.  It is still superior to all other forms of play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's actually correct. In the current state of game; nobody, at all, can out-taunt a Warrior with the correct setup.<br />
<br />
With my configuration, and WA5, I've had enchanters chain tash, DoT, and all that other funky shit they have that used to REALLY piss the mob off, and then sit down with the mob at 10%... no summon. I've had wizards open with White fire, then chain cast 4 stuns/nukes and sit at 10%.. no summon. I've had SK's cast everything they have (that used to dominate us in taunt), sitting down at 10%.. no summon.<br />
<br />
WA5 with the correct setup makes agro control so incredibily trivial, it's almost boring.<br />
<br />

you shouldnt try to talk ZBite down as well either, it beats any other mana regen a melee can bring to a group except beastlord.<br />

Procs are still not the majority of a warriors agro.  And since WA5 is only 50% increase in proc rate, I don't think you are gaining as much agro as you might think.<br />

And one of the biggest advantages is still the fat that knights can get substantial agro from a distance.  Bellow of the mastrug is NOT substantial agro.</div></div><hr />

I laughed when I read this.  Not the majority of our aggro?  Compared to what?  I know exactly how strong my aggro is based off of how many Anger, AngerIII, 150dd/stuns and 75dd/stuns I've seen proc.  If at least one of these hasn't fired off within seconds of engaging, my slower is going to get the beatdown, because they now expect me to have aggro lock by the time I'm hitting the mob due to Incite and WA5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">quoting myself from a thread on PoN:<br />
DBoTW (3.9procs/minute in mainhand with WA5) procs anger which gives roughly 1800 hate per proc<br />
Bloodfrenzy (2.325 procs/minute in offhand with WA5) procs EB with gives 700 hate.<br />
<br />
Aug both of those anger 3 for 3 procs/minute in mainhand and 1.5 procs/minute offhand, anger 3 is 600 hate.<br />
<br />
That is an average of 11347.5 hate per minute from just the procs. That's about equivalent to a stun every 2.6 seconds. We can't even come close to casting that fast. That doesn't include the 1100 hate from incite, btw. Would you like to add in bellow, add in self proc buffs like pestilence shock, and then multiply that by 15% for having a raex bp and then see what the numbers are? Try 15590 hate per minute on average. That's the hate equivalent of 1 stun EVERY 1.9 SECONDS. A chain casting paladin that has 4 stuns loaded and is uninterrupted, never fizzles, and is never stunned will put out HALF of that in hate from stuns. I would recommend not using warrior aggro as a balancing point, were I you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">does anger really proc that much with WA5? doesnt look like 2.1 +50%.</div></div><hr />

I think you will have a tad harder time holding agro than if you didn't have any procs on your weapons at all, but were 100% hasted.<br />
<br />
I am just saying that hte gain from WA5 is not so great that you will be eclipsing knight agro.  Though it is getting close.  Think of it this way.  Take three mobs and have a warrior and a knight go at it and see who can keep agro without using taunt.  The warrior would rarely, if ever, agro more than one on himself at anytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you're going to assume that every Warrior has dual Anger 3 procs, WA5, and the equivalent of Bloodfrenzy/DBoTW, then you have to assume every Paladin has WA5 and the Paladin equivalency of one of those 1handers or a 2h with Ykesha aug, as well as all the best foci for his spellcasting and relevant AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by Graal the Dorf <br />

Bloodfrenzy (2.325 procs/minute in offhand with WA5) procs EB with gives 700 hate.<br />
 While your proc rates are correct, your conclusion is off a bit. First, the base hate for Anger is not 1800 hate/proc. Let's break it down -<br />
<br />
Anger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3624&amp;source=Live) :<br />
1:  Stun(0.00 sec/68) - 400 hate<br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 100 - 100 hate (at best)<br />
3:  Increase Hate by 650 - 650 hate (duh)<br />
<br />
That's a total of 1150 hate. That's a difference of 2535 hate/min. Second, you are not considering any pally procs at all. You are basically saying that a warrior with the best possible agro gear can out agro a pally who is ONLY casting stuns. I don't think that is unreasonable at all. Particularly when you start figuring in some procs, the pally will quickly catch and pass a warrior.<br />
<br />
Of course that is also completely disregarding the fact that your mythical warrior is weilding a Bloodfrenzy simply because it makes the numbers look better for your arguement. Chances are MUCH better that a warrior with the type gear you are describing would be weilding an EoE or Q hammer, neither of which has as good a proc as Bloodfrenzy for pure hate.<br />
<br />
Lastly,  Ainian I usually agree with you on most matters, but I strongly disagree that warrior agro is as trivial as you describe. Sure, if I give a warrior a little lead time I would have a harder time getting agro, but I get summoned and pull agro from Raex BP, DBotW, EoE, A3 x2 weilding warriors on a regular basis. Not on bosses mind you, but on exp, trash, and trial mobs for sure. Without liberal use of concussion pants, I would be splattered more often than not. Warriors still need a little lead time to get solid agro, if you have a bad streak of no procs or if you lose agro before it is locked, you are still left chasing a mob around hoping that you get a proc or taunt works. Knights will always have the advantage that agro can be locked before the mob even gets to camp and that they are never relying on the RNG for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Take three mobs and have a warrior and a knight go at it and see who can keep agro without using taunt. The warrior would rarely, if ever, agro more than one on himself at anytime. <br />
<br />
Correct. My agro isn't &quot;agro on demand&quot; like a Knights, so in this situation, I wouldn't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
I think I described what I was saying wrong. In all situations, I had a few seconds lead, or at least one proc in. By the time they have their spell refreshed, and begin to cast their second, I had more procs in, and so on, and so on. .  I tested this again with a Paladin. He had 2 stuns loaded, Divine stun loaded, and was healing for taunt (typical exp group Paladin taunt setup.) He couldn't pull agro off me.<br />
<br />
Of course, this isn't 100% consistant. The RNG comes into play still. But the effort required to get and HOLD agro for a Warrior, is far, far, far less than the effort required by a Knight. (However, you're right in the regard that I won't be having agro before the mob arrives; which enables nukes or taunt spells to begin instantly.) <br />
<br />
But let's look at this in a serious way. Wizards shouldn't ever be nuking before the mob arrives in camp, regardless of the tanks class. Ever. Same goes for debuffers, or anyone else in the group/raid. Wizards should always be clicking concussion in between spell casts, and while their spells are greyed out. It's just basic common sense.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is Warriors out with with the exact setup I have in regards to taunt, who can verify just how trivial holding agro is now. If not, they are lying in fear of the big nerf -- because I'm not, I assure you.<br />
<br />
I'll be running some new proc parses shortly, with my gear configuration.</div></div><hr />

But let's look at this in a serious way. Wizards shouldn't ever be nuking before the mob arrives in camp, regardless of the tanks class. Ever. Same goes for debuffers, or anyone else in the group/raid. Again, I don't agree. GoD mobs hit hard as hell, no matter how many HP you have. Even at 13khp you can go down like a cheerleader on prom night if you get unlucky with max hits. It is not unusual for me to stun a mob on incoming (Telekin, 8 sec/65 stun). While the stun doesn't seem to really last a full 8 seconds, it does last long enough for debuffs and slows to land. This is critical if the tank for the group is not geared such as yourself, the risk is too great when you have an unslowed mob hitting for 1200-2k triples. I don't use this tactic as often when I have a warrior tanking, but then warriors don't need as much cushion either. With a knight tanking I can do this because I can be reasonably sure that they will get agro by the time the stun wears off.<br />
<br />
It's a catch 22 really for warriors. If the warrior is undergeared, then stuns SHOULD be used to help minimize damage taken, but you have a much greater chance of getting summoned or taking agro outright. When the warrior is geared to the teeth, you COULD use this tactic since the agro would be sufficient to keep the mob on the warrior, but in this scenario the tactic is not necessary.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, this tactic is almost always viable with a knight tanking. Their on-demand ability lends itself to this much better since the chance of them getting an early agro lock is much greater, just shy of insured. Knights do not have to be anywhere near the top end of the spectrum to have superior agro skills. Warriors have their agro directly tied to their gear and the RNG, which I think is a fair trade off.<br />
<br />
I'll be running some new proc parses shortly, with my gear configuration. I think this is the key to your opinion. Keep in mind that you are among the top warriors on any server, most warriors, even from many high end guilds do not have the gear you have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The aggro stuff is a phony argument anyway. How many Paladins do you see running around with a BoW. Force of YKesha augment, Symbol of the Planesmaster, WA5, chaining stuns 6 seconds apart because they &quot;can't hold aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The biggest thing I think of when I think of knight agro and warrior agro is that of ranged agro.  Anymore I will pull a mob and FD it off just outside of the raid.  Then our pallies peel with a stun.  Right away I can get up and the mob will go straight to the pally by the time stun wears off, or if stun is resisted.  If a warrior uses mastrug it takes ages for the mob to come off of me.  <br />
<br />
This is important because two mobs on any tank usually means tank death or cleric death.  KNights don't have a problem with this since they can readily pull mobs to them.  Something warriors cannot do.    Warriors can't pull a single mob out of a crowd just using ranged agro.  Suer they could sit, but that still brings all the mobs, not just one.<br />

But yes, having 10+ procs per minute is significant.  I do wonder if a 0.0 second stun is as much hate as a a stun with a duration.  I actually don't think it is.  But I haven't tested it.  I know the other paladin stuns with varying durations are all the same hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Paladins don't use aggro weapons because they don't need too.Simple, to the point. Exactly correct.</div></div><hr />

People tend to ignore the fact that once a Warrior uses Incite, he's all done with ranged aggro and that effect for 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Should the Enchanter say, &quot;No, not that one! Grab the Inferno Mephit. Mezing the Flame Mephit!&quot; then the Warrior has no ranged capability, nor psuedo snap aggro, nor H8oT.<br />
<br />
The Paladin can move from one target to the next quickly. Stuns also provide many additional benefits useful in combat. Just the ability to build aggro on a mezzed mob then change targets to a mob that just broke mez and is after the Enchanter is unbelieveably useful.<br />
<br />
Time to break the root placed on an add (root spliting is sooo nice)? Use a stun. The DD and knockback works loverly AND the short time the mob is stunned often gives your group a chance to position, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry. Given the great flexability of Paladin aggro control, the power of stuns and how they mesh with other abilities, and the low cost in time and effort to obtain Paladin aggro control compared to 2 aggro weapons, 2 augs, a BP, a right-click weapon aggro buff device, etc. etc. Paladins are NOT given short shrift in aggro.<br />

I've done ikkinz exstensivly, as both cleric and pal, and really with wars (or paladins) tanking there isnt too much problem with encs/clerics getting aggro on YT and dying, (for single group)  (and DVA is far far superior for these situations then using a quick heal) usually the problem is unslowed, usually hasted mobs owning the tank really quickly, which is better solved either by just having quick healers or rooting and preduffing.

Frankly, I still say screw knights.  If they wanted, they could load up on aggro procs and WA5 as well.  The irony is, had they given us a 2h in the first place like we had asked for, we'd have slightly higher initial aggro and less aggro over time.<br />

And there is no way Anger is 1800 or 1150 hate.  Until I see some extensive test data or a dev come in here and say it, I will be conviced Anger is no more hate than EB.<br />

I'd also sure feel sorry for the wizards, who are already the bitches of rogues, if our aggro was nerfed.  Personaly I find rogues doing 500 dps with zero fear of aggroing with tanks that don't have our setup way more broken than wizards who don't have to concussion.</div></div><hr />

Yes, its not as good as paladins overall. (Although DBOTWL/EoE + WA5 + Saryn + Anger3X2) + Rune Incite I'd wager its pretty similar, and no not everyone has those but more pointing out that at the upper levels the aggro capabilties between the class's is very similar, while tanking is  not. (One class reciiving upgrades both content and balance wise making other class's weaker sound familiar to anyone!?!?)<br />

At this level of content warriors will have augged BoW/VDD or DBoTWL/EoE. Time level content, and at time level warriors have these. (ok a few might have an augged BoC or HG or BF or something while waiting for a drop) <br />

While PoJ trials definatly did have a biased against warriors, it wasnt the degree of diffence that exists in this situation, Also, the fact that quarm or time gods could betanked by non warriors was pretty apparent to most time level people as soon as non disced warriors starting tanking him.<br />
<br />
'Sucking it up' is not a great solution, the thing about this is its horrible for the morale of the class' feeling useless, or feeling like a 5th wheel is not something you want to happen to anyone. Not only does it do it for paladins atthis content level, but below this content level, becuase they see what is in their future, and its not fun to work towards something that makes your class less viable.</div></div><hr />

GoD is about extremes and you WILL use the best CC class, the best healing class, and the best tank in the hardest points, if you think this isnt balanced then you will probibly ignore that warriors are ment to be the premir tank in this set up, if that wasnt the intent they wouldnt have made them hit so god danged hard, some of the trash mobs can 2 round some vex thal geared warriors</div></div><hr />

Slight quibble, but I do not believe the IMBUED procs (ala Pestilence Shock) are affected by WA5, and 4.32 seems kinda high as a proc rate.  Also, I think you slightly overestimated the hate on the imbued procs.</div></div><hr />

You are talking the ultimate current setup until better agro weapons are found (if at all..) in GoD, not something we are gifted with by simply scribing a spell.

And no Time level warrior will still be using a BoC or HG (but would still use BF).  Even an auged ethereal destoryer would be better than a BoC/HG.<br />

Brael's post made me laugh as well.  You cannot post the ultimate warrior setup and assume it's what every high end warrior is going to have.  Warriors need 5 items (Raex BP, Darkblade, EoE, Symbol, Bellow stone, not to mention Anger augs).  This is far from your average high/end game warrior setup.  Considering Paladins need what, 1 weapon? and a shield to go with it?  And most Paladins don't augment their weapon with Anger.  So comparing the ultimate warrior hate setup to that of the average Paladin is a very unbalanced picture of what the case is 99.95% of the time.<br />
<br />
On another note, I ran into the first Endurance drainning mini-boss last night (the dot also did -2000 mana/tick and -1000atk, go go 685atk and minimum hits every swing).  No endurance = no disc, no incite.  The fact that none of the warriors had endurance and none of the paladins had mana wasn't balancing, it was retarded.</div></div><hr />

Zaboo, if 5% of all Warriors have the ability to generate jesus aggro (of course its 100% of all Warriors I play with... we most likely have a slight content difference which influences this stuff) then only 0.5% of all Knights have the ability to barely tank these mobs, and this is 1 group fights not raid stuff.</div></div><hr />

You are probably right when you say 0.5% of knights can tank that stuff; however, I can't support changes to knights when they perform very well in LDoN and PoP.  The encounters themselves *might* need tuning, but the expansion is only a couple of months old.</div></div><hr />

As for being able to use a Blade of War if I wanted to be?  Umm... no.  The main problem with aggro seems to be that the hate mod on spells is less on GoD mobs than on PoP/LDoN stuff, this has the effect of (besides slightly exaggerating eoe/pestilence shock procs when I listed Warrior aggro... used 800 hate per on them) causing nukes to be less aggro, debuffs less aggro, stuns less aggro, snare less aggro, fear less aggro, etc... in short it's causing things with aggro mods to be worth less while spells with direct hate mods (anger, incite, terror, eb, jolt, concussion, etc) to be unaffected changing the balance there somewhat as well.  I'm not complaining about aggro though just giving a bit more of commentary on that.<br />
<br />
Zaboo, you're 100% correct that Knights perform just fine in PoP/LDoN, I don't want improvements to that area at all, its Kod'Taz+ where the issue arrises (Ikkinz espically).  In these areas the lesser effectiveness AC has on us combined with the much much much higher chance of getting a damage spike is putting Knights at a significant disadvantage.<br />
<br />
Madronedorf, problems usually get overstated yes.  Guess it sucks for me since I try to look at it unbiased and not exaggerate the difference or the improvements needed.  Sadly that means the improvements needed if this were to do anything (which I'm well aware of the fact that it won't) would be less than are needed, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

Stating a whole ream of &quot;stats&quot; about agro generation from mr perfecttank, then the 2nd quote about warrior agro generation strikes me as a complaint. I was simply pointing out that he hadnt (based on his mangelo at the time) tried in any way to emulate these means of generating Jesus agro, even though several of the paths availible to warriors are also there for knights. They simply ignore them because in the past they could chain lvl 20 spells and never have a problem.</div></div><hr />

No, you were WAAAAAAY off.  First of all, pestilence shock only procs from the mainhand weapon.  Second, the more your weapon procs, the less this will, just like your proc buffs.  Third, 800 hate for pestilence shock is over twice what it actually is I'm sure.<br />

In order to aggro like I do, I had to give up hp/ac for combat effects, and I have to take TWICE the ripostes dual wielding. (trust me, I want to use a 2h)  I sure won't be wearing the new GoD BP either.<br />
<br />
Most knights on the other hand, don't seem to want to give up anything.  They want their focii and FT, they want their dps weapons and dps proc buffs, and they whine when they can't tank as well as I do after butchering their ac, or they whine when I aggro over them after dedicating my entire loot and AA path to aggro.

Are you insane?  Even with the best equipped WARRIOR you can't tank these reliably.  If you expect these trials to be beaten reliably by a paladin with &quot;appropriate&quot; gear you're expecting paladins to be on par with/better than the best equipped warrior that can exist at this time.  In other words, a warrior with a spell book.<br />

When you die to these trials with a warrior tanking, it is because the players made an error, it might be small, but it is ultimatly because of something the player did. That is ok, these are meant to be challenging and I am ok with dying on them because people messed up. Thats fun, Thats everquest. It is NOT fun to do your job correctly, and just die because the RNG treated you poorly, and have this be the case over and over. Tanking a trial reiably != Winning a trial reliably. It means you can do your job and if you do it correctly, on the vast majority of attempts you will not fail because of something beyond your control.<br />
<br />
I am perfectly fucking fine with when people screw up with regardless of who they fail with, but to have the outcome of your fight rely on the RNG is BS for the majority of attempt is BS<br />
<br />
and before someone says something about even warriors sometimes get one rounded on Quarm or some other dumb thing thats not related thats completly different because in a raid you can afford to have people die, its not the end of the raid if the MT dies.</div></div><hr />

bullshit<br />
<br />
first of all, the only 4 new skills we have gotten where the incite line and the rage, stonewall and the pile of shit healing will,  all the rest were already discplines and knight have discplines as well, stonewall was already there in the form of defensive, they just swapped one penalty for another<br />
<br />
second, <br />
<br />
these are NOT spells for 3 reasons.<br />
<br />
reason one, do you (assume your a pally) have a spell that has a perallel negitive factor? most of our discplines do, for example stonewall snares us, another is that defensive has us take a offensive hit, and offensive makes us take more damage, do any of your spells do this?<br />
<br />
reason two, since when have your spells grey out OTHER spells when cast? since when do your spells cost a large amount of mana, and such a large refresh timer that you can use it on every 20 mobs?<br />
<br />
reason 3, <br />
<br />
since when do your spells stop working after they have been casted? we use a clicky while in healing will mode and it turns off, we cant stack effects like SKs can stack nukes and DoTs, so kindly, please think a little more about the rigid system they have in place before you go calling it a spell book<br />
<br />
id laugh my ass off if they moved all your spells to the endurance system<br />
<br />
hmm, one stun every mob, 1 group heal(no other heals because they grey out) every 20 mobs, cant chain stun because they grey out since they are on stun line also, the jokes are endless!<br />

While your proc rates are correct, your conclusion is off a bit. First, the base hate for Anger is not 1800 hate/proc. Let's break it down -<br />
<br />
Anger :<br />
1: Stun(0.00 sec/68) - 400 hate<br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 100 - 100 hate (at best)<br />
3: Increase Hate by 650 - 650 hate (duh)<br />
<br />
Absolutely right. I'm not sure what crazy math I did to come up with 1800 hate. My apologies. I would have put the stun at 500 hate and was just guessing on the DD and gave that 50 points of hate (likely wrong) but that is 1200 hate total given those numbers, not 1800.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Partha which Knights?  Every SK I've spoken to has said their chance to live through it is well below 50%.  If you count Rangers using WS when I die then I have a 80% success chance but thats not the Knight tanking it reliably now is it?<br />
<br />
Gerick, nearly every spell I have thats useful requires a tradeoff and putting disciplines on seperate timers does alot for melees you're no longer forced to hold off on discs to keep one up incase its needed, the changes to that system were needed badly but dont forget how much stuff it gave you access to which had to not be used before, and I'm an SK and you know I'm an SK so don't assume I'm a Pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Brael,<br />
<br />
There are basically 3 disciplines we can chain, and we can only chain them once every 40 minutes (and can use def/evasive a couple times in between if necessary):<br />
<br />
1 'oh shit' (furious or fortitude, aka our Harmsheild/DAs),  1 tanking (evasive or defensive, which come with DPS penalties or detrimental effects to offset the power of damage mitigation), and 1 DPS (mighty fellstrike charge precision aggressive, our Slay undead/HT).  Our 4th timer is utility stuff such as resistant/fearless/healing will (that doesn't work in combat).  A warrior will almost invariably use the highest form of Provoke available to them, just like any class uses their most efficient/uber spell/ability.<br />
<br />
Warriors gained some flexibility with these changes but it didn't alter our basic role, tanking uber mobs.  Incite was a nice bone tossed to us, but its just another agro tool, not a game changer.  Warriors were doing the same type of thing before, but using items instead of via an ability. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Brael, you know pretty much where I stand, I have evolved in my thinking and actually now think that there's a farily reasonable suggestion for a new Knight disc which would enable them to survive spike damage without seriously threatening warrior raid roles, and not cause any of the potential drawbacks from making the encounters more Gerikable (New Word:  Adjective, meaning able to be accomplished at Bazaar levels of progression).<br />
<br />
With the changes in aggro generation, the justification for the wide spread between warrior and knight while the warrior is defensive has lost much of it's justification, and has brought to light another ABSOLUTE need for knights, which is to be able to acheive a significantly higher level of performance tanking than non-plate tank based classes.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I'm pretty much in line with the idea of introducing a new discipline for Knights which acheives the following:<br />
<br />
/disc whatever you wanna call it<br />
<br />
25% damage mitigation bonus<br />
35% melee damage output decrease<br />
25% spell haste decrease<br />
Uses Endurance, not mana, cost the same as warrior discs<br />
Refresh time same as Furious (40 min)<br />
<br />
Results:<br />
<br />
Pixxt Annihilator<br />
<br />
Appx DB = 80, Appx DI = 100<br />
<br />
Min Hit = 180<br />
Max Hit = 2080<br />
<br />
/disc warrior<br />
<br />
Min Hit: 130<br />
Max Hit: 1080<br />
<br />
/disc Knight<br />
<br />
Min Hit: 155<br />
Max Hit: 1580<br />
<br />
The difference between a max round of 8320 and the max round of 6320 is indeed crossing the threshold of success vs. failure, yet the difference between 6320 and 4320 is substantial enough to provide adequate &quot;reason&quot; to use a warrior.<br />
<br />
The other thing is it's NOT gear dependent, but to be able to tank it exactly like a warrior, it IS gear dependent qand DOES require some post content farming. The difference is noticeable between warrior and Knight, and the difference is noticeable between knight and non-knight. Also, as Graal wanted, it scales with content.<br />
<br />
On raid level mobs, it would indeed have enabled Nom to tank the time gods WELL before he was able to, which I concur is an absurd level of farming, yet because warrior aggro problems have been addressed adequately, the level of anger over this occurring would've been significantly less.<br />
<br />
The only sticking point I ever had was that I believe that any more than a halfway point would drastically affect raid level tanking throughout the game, yet this strikes a really nice balance in my eyes. It ALSO requires knights to do something they previously had not had to do, which is to consider aggro generation when selecting weapons/augs. <br />
<br />
In this vein, I ALSO wouldn't be opposed to lifting the WAR only restriction on Anger augs, although I do believe that Ykesha produces the same result. It seems only fair that you would need to consider aggro generation in equipment selection to perform the job of tanking, even with the initial aggro generation bonuses that you currently have.<br />
<br />
IN THAT VEIN... I ALSO believe that because the effect on the Raex BP is so crucial, AND because of that, a type 8 Augment, BP only with that effect should be available for use by War/Pal/ShD. I'm NOT opposed to that occurring Post-Uqua though.  Particularly because it appears that the warrior only BP does not have the effect that Raex does, and people will absolutely forego the upgrade without the ability to aug it with the effect.<br />
<br />
Now.... having said all of that, there's some things that I disagree with you about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaining Evasive espically when fighting a heavy concentration of kyv's/ukuns/ra'tuk's to lower dps intake a good amount by reducing chaos claws procs in addition to the lesser melee you would take, <br />
<br />
Evasive was the biggest casualty in this expansion in my view.  Kyvs don't fuggin miss.   Those bastards basically waste my endurance if I use evasive cause it simply doesn't help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Provoke to get mobs off the puller for less endurance useage<br />
<br />
I gotta say, while this may seem reasonable... the use of SL or Holy Light vs Complete heal has pretty much eliminated the idea that incoming aggro isn't an issue.   Provoke simply put will same me some endurance, but will leave a smoky corpse where the cleric once stood as soon as SL or HL lands.<br />
<br />
bellow/incite if you want more aggro on the tag,<br />
<br />
Well, Bellow/Incite is pretty much mandatory unless you need something from the cleric's bind point. <br />
<br />
/shield if you get unlucky on procs and the slower is unlucky on slow resists<br />
<br />
/shield is really an ability and not a endurance based skill, and while it's a cool ability that works REALLY nicely in GoD, it's not quite &quot;the equivalent of a spell&quot; unless you wanna call bash or kick the equivalent of a spell since it doesn't involve the use of autoattack.<br />
<br />
ae taunt/spirit of rage for aggro if required,<br />
<br />
Seriously?  I gotta say I almost never use spirit of rage, perhaps I should vs yellow con exp mobs in Kod/Ikk, cause those are &quot;Hahaha cleric you gonna die&quot; mobs. <br />
<br />
aggressive (this get its negative effect on tanking removed btw? <br />
<br />
It did have it's negative effect removed, although since the changes, no one uses aggressive any more since Fellstrike or Charge actually produce more DPS than aggressive, even with aggressive lasting as long as it does.<br />
<br />
charge, furious for a high dps/aggro burst emergency tanking or to get a small &quot;break&quot; in the fight, defensive for more mobility/lower dps and improved tanking, stonewall for more dps/less mobility and improved tanking[quote]<br />
<br />
Ok, the discipline section is up.... now let me state why I have a major problem with disciplines being called &quot;spells&quot;.   We have had them since prior to the existence of Endurance.   They werent' spells before they were tied to a limitation bar, and since they work DRASTICALLY differently than spells do, they cannot really qualify as &quot;spells&quot; simply because they were tied to a limitation bar and show up in spdat vs. melee tables.   Disciplines are disciplines, they're not spells.  If you got the discipline I recommended, it wouldn't be a spell, it would be a discipline.  You wouldn't cast it any more than you cast your other discs.<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]rampage for another hit of aggro when used right.<br />
<br />
Rampage rules, it's among my favorite AA's.   It IS an AA skill and NOT a spell though, and it isn't tied to endurance or related in any way with the SPdat.<br />
<br />
I realize I'm nitpicking here, but it's because the use of the terms &quot;spells&quot; when referring to warrior discs and abilities is provocative in intent.    It's real intent is to lower the perceived value of a spellbook and the flexibility and choices that spells have by their nature.   <br />
<br />
We don't have a spellbook, we DO have a lot of cool new abilities, but they don't have the versatility or even similar usage that spells do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frodlin, I actually agree with that disc you posted, it's pretty good for Knights the only point on it we might disagree with is the duration and disc timer it's on.  I'm not sure what you had in mind, personally I was thinking more of a lower duration (90 sec?) lower reuse (10-15 min) disc that was on the same timer as unholyaura/holyforge (under the condition that their refreshs were lowered to 15-20 min) but if it was on the say timer 3 with that recycle time and a higher duration along the lines of 2.5-3 min that would be good as well.  The only other comment on it would be where the disc actually comes from, I think we both agree that it shouldn't be aviable prior to plane of time progression wise because its post time where problems are occuring, personally I think the 2nd Ikkinz trial is a good spot to obtain it because its not too deep in progression and its not something you can do by making a jesus group to get through tipt before you should then zone into Ikkinz and just pick it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell me what you think that the negative impact of giving Paladins a 25% mitigation disc with a furious level refresh timer in which casting is slowed.  I don't see any dramatic gamewide negative impact whatsoever, except maybe on beastlord/ranger tanking.  The gap is still substantial enough to give warriors preference on pretty much everything that requires a disc, or is best used with one, the aggro issue is pretty much over.  I don't really see a major negative impact at all.   Best of all, the issue is pretty much permanently solved.<br />
<br />
I DO on the other hand see a negative impact if it's left as is.   I also see MANY potential pitfalls surrounding dumbing down the encounters or altering them in such a way that grants knights the ability to tank them, as it will come up again and again as content is explored.</div></div><hr />

Actually I don't.  I want the classes to maintain a unique role.  I seriously don't see knights being happy until they can tank every mob in the game though.  They can already tank 75% of raid-level boss mobs, and are preferred over warriors on some of them but they aren't happy yet.<br />

The problem is not that you can't tank, the problem is that mobs are too hard (especially for the trials relative to what you can bring to them).

<br />
 Reread this post. Especially the early pages. Knights were tanking this stuff with extra healing. Knights had valuable offtank roles, pre-charm nerf and after. AND KNIGHTS ARE GETTING FLAGGED.<br />
<br />
 Here is an older post, in case you missed it, I'm SURE you did.<br />
<br />
Once again, speaking from outside the GoD box ATM.<br />
<br />
Historically in EQ, Warriors have been the first choice for tanking raid level content not specifically tailored for Knights. This has been because the content was tuned around Warrior tanking abilities (i.e. discs)<br />
<br />
Historically in EQ, Knights have not been able to tank the toughest raid level content in a given expansion until said expansions have been progressed through. Examples include the aforementioned AoW and Quarm.<br />
<br />
Here are some facts we know so far:<br />
<br />
1) Warriors and Knights have both tanked this one encounter successfully.<br />
<br />
2) Warriors and Knights have both failed this one encounter, especially if they are not fully geared for it.<br />
<br />
3) It is currently easier for a Warrior to tank this one encounter.<br />
<br />
4) This expansion is less than two weeks old.<br />
<br />
5) No guild has progressed really significantly past this roadblock and are not at the 'gear farming' stage of the content that we know of whereby the top members of each class have mulitple loots of post-this encounter quality, and most members have loots of post-this encounter quality.<br />
<br />
6) No one likes to feel inadequate at what is considered their primary role.<br />
<br />
I sympathize with your frustration. It sucks to be of a level to consume the content and not be able, whether through gear, blind luck, or what have you, to tank this encounter. However, given that history shows Knights tank 'boss mobs' typically later in expansion life, the newness of the content, and especially considering that the first many times through content involve failure, I (and many other people, not just Warriors) don't see a compelling need to retune this single encounter yet. <br />
<br />
From the outside looking in, this is clearly a new form of timesink being implemented by Sony to increase the 'shelf-life' of the content. At some point, it's a given that it will become the PoJ trials of GoD: Doable, but requiring either great skill/gear and/or changes to group formation to deal with the mob. (Whereas PoJ trials demand high DPS, this trial seems to demand high healing.)<br />
<br />
 Too many Knights arguing about these trials being too hard don't even have a single Quarm loot, let alone more.<br />
<br />
 Too many Knights aruging about these trials being too hard don't even have a single TIME loot, let alone more.<br />
<br />
 Hell, a few of the Knights arguing about these trials being too hard ARE NOT EVEN OF A LEVEL TO ENTER THEM, LET ALONE GEARED TO TRY THEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Phantron, the gap is to large currently between War's and Knights and to small between Knights and chain/leather classes, espically now that Knights no longer have the large aggro advantage we used to that justified the worse tanking.  Whats overpowering about it?  You yourself said that Knights don't bring enough to these trials for their diffuculty this would allow us to.  If put into the game at the correct point it has no impact on doing content which doesn't consist of what is currently the high end of GoD which is the most important part in my opinion, since Knights still doing the timefarm or even elemental farm for progression shouldn't be having access to that type of ability.  Oh, and Uqua is just plain evil.<br />
<br />
Partha, I'm not one of those, the ones I speak to about it are at the correct level of progression, I am as well.  I did read this post in the early pages for some reason I've read the entire thing.  Don't know about you guys but when people who aren't at the correct level of progression to do something are complaining about it I tell them then ignore it from that point on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Adjusting trials is one thing. Even allowing some burst mitigation in the form of a weaponshield like ability is something. But giving knights defensive is another altogether. <br />
<br />
Aggro is NOT over as an issue for many warriors, Graal's delusions notwithstanding -- plenty of whom are running around with maybe a GSoT or epics or something and incite. Period. They don't have zillions of AA for Sturdiness or WA, so they don't have a big HP advantage over their paladin colleagues. But if those paladins get defensive, whole echelons of warriors in Luclin/LDoN/early PoP or whatever just got hammered. This is the point Graal would refuse to deal with, despite having it put in his face repeatedly. He'd just ignore it, declare victory, and move on.<br />
<br />
And who cares if Brael dies while winning 80% of the time? *I* die on many of the mobs I tank, including most things that are considered challenging for my guild. If it's tough new content for my guild, I expect to die. As long as the party/raid wins, where's the beef? Now it's not that knights can't win, it's that they can't win the way they want to?<br />
<br />
I went 0-25 or so on PoJ trials before getting flagged. Sometimes new things are supposed to be hard. Should I have demanded they be nerfed, and claimed it as a single group content, since there's both loot and exp there? Or demanded dramatically powerful new abilities that would have immediately gotten my groups through with not only a high success rate, but a high personal survival rate? I just accepted it as one of the hurdles of the new expansion and kept at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Brael, as was illustrated by the problem warriors had, tanking is not all about damage taken. <br />
<br />
Tanking = Survivability + AGGRO CONTROL<br />
<br />
Even if the gap between leather/chain and hybrid was too small compared to hybrid/pure tank, leather/chain melee can provide the sort of aggro control that the hybrids can provide. They're far worse than even warriors were before the fix.<br />
<br />
Between their superior mitigation AND superior aggro generation, hybrids are FAR AND AWAY better tanks than the classes you speak of.</div></div><hr />

You did notice the part where they mentioned the tomb dropping in ikk 2,where sub time level knight are unlike to be able to get this. This is stop from being in the hand of those not at that point in the game. Which make sense since balance issue doesn't come until this point of the game.<br />

Maybe you missed the larger context of the discussion, but there are any number of paladins on WoN demanding defensive generally at level 65 -- NOT as a GoD drop. <br />
<br />
I actually do not believe an ability of that magnitude should be a high level drop, since it would totally divide the paladin class into haves and have nots in a way that no other class has ever been divided by anything, not even shaman with torpor/malo (which was still tradeable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">It took 60 AAs to bring back the tanking advantage back to Warriors like it should.  I don't see why you get to undo the balanced established that costs a Warrior 60 AA to obtain from any kind of drops.<br />
<br />
Knights don't bring much to the trials is an issue with the trials themselves.  As they stand right now anyone who is not a DPS doesn't bring much to them because that's really all you need after your 4 slots are locked up on the prereqs (warrior/cleric/healer 2/puller).  And even amongst DPS that really limits them to monks (for mitigation with SoT)/rogues/wizards.<br />
<br />
As for Uqua+ content, I can't really say how tanking is supposed to be balanced seeing that no one has gotten anywhere and that's obviously with Warrior tanking.  Maybe after people make more progress in Uqua it would be prudent to reevaluate the tanking issue.  Currently, the only place Knights can't tank is in the Ikkinz 1 group trials, and those trials are just too hard for their necessity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so thats 3 discplines, and incite.<br />
<br />
the reason its not a spell is there is no regen spell yet, there are no focus effects for it yet, no spells greys out another (for example, if you cast 1 stun, your others are still there for casting) and that we only use about 6 of them because they are basically upgrades of each other, and they reach the same end result in most cases, mightystrike/fellstrike/aggressive do about the same damage when parsed, defensive/stonewall/evasive mitigate damage (tho depending on the mob there is a clear choice, such as to avoid proc's)<br />
<br />
i can go on and on about why calling them spells is about as smart as some of the things i say regularly on this board,( like we cant use them on every mob, but you can if you wish) but unless ya dont say it again i do not need to.<br />
<br />
this trail is one group of mobs used for progresson... in the part of the game only 1 percent or less are enjoying atm, what gives all the paladins and Sks the right to say the group mechanics are busted when its a progression mobs most people never see<br />
<br />
like ive been trying to put into words, a few paladins and SKs see this as a car they can pile into and drive from *pretty balancedvill* and arive in *godmodevill* and they are going to ride this steaming pile like flys hang on to frozen poo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">hell want a fix for this? make a new discpline for knights that cuts their ability to cast for 5 min and lets them take 20% less damage for 5 min, its not defensive but it should be enough to get you thru more than &quot;&quot;50%&quot;&quot; of the time, and by making it no drop non chainable  we wont have to worry about the wrong knights getting this ability.<br />
<br />
the long duration is there because they cant use spells to get aggro, so there will be a pause that the group will have to take to let the pally get and maintain aggro while using this discpline. (if it gets abused such as knights aggroing up and then using it, then there could be a instant reduction on the aggro list because the defensive pally looks like less of a threat to the mob)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">I'm aware of the different timers.  Your endurance is about as limited as my mana, both take roughly the same amount of time to refill from being fully empty (post gear change to add endurance to non GoD items) and take about the same amount of management to keep at appropriate levels.  You can use weaker versions for different results with your incite line for example you can vary the amount of endurance used for aggro to conserve aggro (btw Frodlin, open with a CH as your first heal, have it casted as the mob starts being brought into camp, you can get away with Provoke np then espically if the healer bought subtlety and you play distance aggro to your advantage).  Endurance is basically a melee manabar, spells use mana, see the connection?  It's more of a joke, obviously they aren't spells but they can be thought of as the same thing for you that spells are for me: abilities that augment combat performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">so your saying anything that isnt autoattack is a spell?<br />
<br />
here is the thing, you can use you hate stuns on every mob incoming, you can use your DoTs to up your DPS, you can use your pets to do that as well, on EVERY mob incoming, the only thing we can use per mob is incite, not to mention you have discplines AND spells AND tanking so stop the silly crap k?<br />
<br />
the meat of the issue is this: there is a mob that can not be killed with any regularity of the results by a paladin or an SK, and it is for progression, it is super hard time++ level.<br />
<br />
it seems silly that you all think that 1 mob that isnt even used for Xping keeps you out of a mainstream game role, untill you are left out hand over fist then you dont know what it felt like when your competition was in god mode thru out PoP<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
in a raid(such as vindi) you use clerics to CCH, you use enchanter for CC in the tactics flagging in the fight with MB, you use the best because only the PRIME MODEL is ment to be the most effective, and when there is .9% room for error you cant use much else, you have to get used to the fact we are the base model, rule of thumb that all others are judged by model, and in this hard core setting where mobs that could kill 2 partys of casual players then you have to wake up and think that maybe its MENT for warrior only tanking.(these things are &quot;six man&quot; raids&quot; imho because it require raid loot to be able to attempt and survive)<br />

No, it's not. At least, not unless you want to concede that warriors are only barely more survivable than hybrids, which... I'm kinda doubtin. =P Not only do you take bout 10% less damage, you have SIGNIFICANTLY more hitpoints, which means you last even longer.

Except in the VERY highest couple percent of the content, hybrids are EXTREMELY valid tank role. Even when they don't have MT role, they have the secondary tank role in case everything goes to hell, and added utility. Buffs, heals, roots, snares, atk buffs, mana and lifetaps, etc etc etc. You're making it sound like there's no role for them, that's just not the case. Whereas, what does a warrior do when he's not a tank?<br />
<br />
Yeah. Exactly.<br />
<br />
Remember, this damage taken difference between warriors and hybrids that you're making as such a big deal... that's ALL warriors bring. They bring NOTHING else to the table. If a hybrid takes 20DPS less than an equivalent warrior, all the hybrid has to do is either cause 1200 damage not to happen in the next minute, or heal it himself, and voila, there's zero difference between hybrids and warriors in day to day situations. That's not a hell of a lot.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't MT in a very small percentage of XP groups. does that mean we should be given nearly knight levels of utility to make up for it? I don't be thinkin so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">daem you have it right, its only a handful of mobs(that arnt even used for xp) that are causing the problems, its a train every hobo wants to hop on thinking it leads to a better life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the &quot;boss&quot; type mobs?  Yes, the survivability is about equal, the average time I live on those mobs is 62 seconds, the average time a Ranger lives is 50 seconds (and 20 of that is guaranteed).  Would like to point out that my lifetaps haven't seen an upgrade since PoP, neither have Necros, all other classes with heals have seen upgrades since that time thats an entirely different gripe however.<br />
<br />
Some non tank classes are hybrids, so I'm going to assume that you meant to say Knights instead of hybrids in your question.  Their aggro control isn't quite as good but does the job, monks with discs, rangers with flame lick and whatever else, rogues are more dependant upon having an ukun spine/jtfb combo and not evading so I won't count them, beastlords have slows, they're all capable of having high aggro and tanking these with discs.  Do I out tank them?  Yes, but it's not by a big enough margin in these types of encounters espically when compared to the other choice of tank.<br />

I thought I made it clear I was referring to the very highest content currently obtainable which is Ikkinz, Uqua, Kod'Taz, Yxtta.

Or, here's a concept, you could actually work with the ranger instead of against him, have him weaponshield the mob and take over with your unarguably superior survivability after a period of time and voila, your average time in surviving is gonna jump up 25% instead of the ranger dying at 50 seconds or the SK dropping at 62 seconds. Not to mention that that 12 seconds is a VERY significant difference alone, without even brining aggro generation in the picture. That is also assuming those numbers reflect reality, which certainly hasn't been proven at all.<br />
<br />
Would like to point out that my lifetaps haven't seen an upgrade since PoP, neither have Necros, all other classes with heals have seen upgrades since that time thats an entirely different gripe however.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean they're useless. Far from it.<br />
<br />
Their aggro control isn't quite as good but does the job, monks with discs, rangers with flame lick and whatever else, rogues are more dependant upon having an ukun spine/jtfb combo and not evading so I won't count them, beastlords have slows, they're all capable of having high aggro and tanking these with discs.  Do I out tank them?  Yes, but it's not by a big enough margin in these types of encounters espically when compared to the other choice of tank.<br />
<br />
so even you admit that the aggro control is worse. So... you're better at taking damage, AND you're better at the aggro control. So EVERYTHING to do with tanking... you're better at. Hell, compare warriors and hybrids and the chain/leather to hybrids... warriors were only inferior in ONE way, they STILL remained better at taking damage,and it was a big problem that needed fixing. Now chain and leather are worse in BOTH aggro AND tanking and you're trying to claim that they're all that and a bag of chips? Come on.<br />
<br />
I thought I made it clear I was referring to the very highest content currently obtainable which is Ikkinz, Uqua, Kod'Taz, Yxtta. I agree with you 100% that the problem is non existant prior to these areas and I don't want to see an upgrade to Knight power in them anymore than you do. [/B] <br />
<br />
If you wanna be the one tanking the big stuff , in the very highest content available, when an expansion first comes out, then you need to be playing a warrior. That's the way it always has been, and that's the way it's always gonna be. As has happened before, is happening now, and will again, hybrids will play a supporting role ON THE NAMED ONLY until mudflation allows hybrids to tank the named that were previously only tankable by warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lifetaps are useful for spikes but rarely save me, 820 hp every 12 sec where 1/3 of that time is spent casting is a huge hit to aggro, it's locking me out of 1 darkness or fear and 1/3 of my already woefully inadequete 1h aggro generation (a boc provides more aggro than a time sk 1h... something else to buy and throw ykesha on), I'm actually better off NOT casting lifetaps in these fights due to the time investment of them vs my other spells, I'm better off attempting to keep asystole on the mob, torrent of hate on it, aura of pain on me, aura of hate on my group, casting aggro spells, and that doesn't leave much time at all for lifetaps.<br />
<br />
I've admitted I'm better at tanking than chain classes, the thing is the gap isn't big enough... did you feel that tanking 19% better than Knights was enough?  It's the same deal here except in addition to that they have discs to guarantee living a certain amount of time.  Actually I should clarify it, they out tank me in short bursts over longer periods I will out tank them.<br />
<br />
Theres no mudflation yet at this point, items are equal to the top time stuff, Jointed Scale Greaves are 1% shielding, 1 ac, 10 hp more than their phase 5 equilavent, these items will just let people fill in some slots quicker than they will in time, they won't provide any type of power upgrade over people already in the phase 5/quarm stuff already have which means that by the time Knights can tank these areas their entire guild will already be through them making it as pointless as me being capable of tanking NToV right now.</div></div><hr />

Turgok, I wanted to respond to something that you brought up which is quite valid, that the acquisition of this as a tome drop would create a &quot;have/have not&quot; gulf.

 As has been pointed out elsewhere, and I'm almost ashamed to have to be the one to point it out, survivability is a binary set: You either have enough or you do not. If you give Paladins a /defensive like disc, even at a smaller percentage, it is NOT a given that all content will henceforth be tuned to that narrow band between what a Paladin brings and what a Warrior brings. The chance is much more likely that the content will be similarly easy in all cases, whether Knight or Warrior tanking. And once Warriors lose their raid desireability as MT because Paladins offer the same benefits with a bonus, that will be the end of the classes' viability.<br />
<br />
 You've been seduced by their arguments that there is no such thing as a 6 man raid. I will submit to you that group sizes have no minimum past 1 but a maximum; raids can and should work the same way.  Just because there has never been 6 man raids before does not invalidate the concept; that is like suggesting because there had never been a helicopter that one can never be built. The mobs in question (The bosses/named/what have you) are CLEARLY not XP mobs. Semantics over the size of the raid is what's blinding the debaters, that and egos.</div></div><hr />

I think they should also give warriors a clickie (like incite) that forces a proc cycle (2H or primary 1H) proc where all the &quot;Combat&quot; effects will trigger.

<br />
 Why would it not? If both tanks have roughly the same survivability, and one comes with extras which the other cannot match, WHY would you pick the second one?<br />
<br />
 I'll even boil it down to the simplest possible level and give you Knights ONE ability and this lesser defensive.<br />
<br />
 Now, you will have three tanks, whose survivability is equal (remember, it's not a sliding scale, it's binary; you can survive, or you can not).<br />
<br />
 One of them offers 25% mitigation and a one shot patch heal.<br />
<br />
 One of them offers 25% mitigation and a one shot burst damage ability.<br />
<br />
 One of them offers 45% mitigation, but adds nothing else of value.<br />
<br />
 Assuming that 25% mitigation is enough to ensure survivability of the three tanks, exactly WHY again would you pick the third? Not for lesser healing needed - healing on raids is a given in the time of 0 sec CH rotation and SL spamming. Not for better DPS - DPS is irrelevant to the MT proposition. Aggro generation? That's covered and more. Once again, it's a binary set, not a sliding scale. THEN add to the first two a spellbook that is chock full of useful items for both raids and XP groups. Explain again WHY people will want the third? As well ask for a Berzerker to tank your trials.<br />
<br />
 Lastly, there is the principle of class separation. EVERY class has something unique it does which NO other class can equal. For Paladins, this is the LOH - a mana free heal that no other melee class has. For SK's, this is HT - a damage effect that no other melee class has. And for Warriors, this is Defensive - a mitigation effect that no other class has. Want a parry disc like virtually all the melee classes have? That's fine - everyone has that one. Want Defensive? Roll a Warrior - don't take the ONE unique innate thing that Warriors have and farm it out because you're having trouble with a handful of the thousands of mobs in game.</div></div><hr />

Why would we need this?  We already have snap aggro with incite.  Aggro managment is completely trivial.  I don't ever lose aggro in exp groups unless somebody nukes it before it gets to camp.  Shamans hardly get  touched in a group with me, and I'm using Luclin-era weapons.  In most exp groups I bag my auged BoC, throw my BF in my offhand and mainhand an unaugmented greatblade of storms for slightly higher dps and still have no aggor issues whatsoever.  I don't think I need a  raex bp or a DBotW, not to say that I would turn them down, but I have near-perfect aggro control and I am far from uber.  Even low 50s have easy access to excellent aggro weapons.  The only way to make them easier to get would be to put them on decaying skeletons. <br />
<br />
Warriors don't need  more aggro.  In fact I would argue we have too much now.<br />
<br />
Why does mini-defensive for knights hurt warriors?  Because it dramatically reduces the need for a warrior on RAIDS, which are our one and only specialty.  Balancing classes around the Ikkinz trial will have much wider-reaching implications.  This isn't for exp groups, we all know how often you use defensive in exp groups.  We are talking about (so far) ONE trial that you have to do ONE time that is very hard for a knight to tank.  I know of paladins with 2 or 3  time loots and all the rest elemental with mostly empty augment slots beating Tipt, so I don't buy that it is too hard at all.  If it takes you 3 tries to get through the Ikkinz trials, who cares?  If you have to play second fiddle to a warrior in one trial that you have to do one time, who cares?  It's only once and then you're done forever.  Horrible thing to pick to balance the classes around in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

So yes, it's fairly safe to say I have gone through them, I have gone through them multiple times since then and know what I'm talking about when I say that this would be about as close to a good solution as you're going to get.<br />
<br />
Partha, raids will end up being tuned for a full on defensive, not for a weaker version thats why the survivability isn't there, what Frodlin is suggesting would give that survivability to us in non raiding scenarios however.<br />
<br />
Brutul, how would a 40 minute recycle ability that was obtainable only by Knights at a certain level of progression (where this problem is occuring) reduce the need for Warriors in raids?  Go in Uqua and tell me a defensive type ability would replace Warriors there, even on yard trash.<br />
<br />
I don't think it is fair to give (even 25 percent) disc defensive to pal/sk. I do think it is fair to move warriors to -5DI (or at the least -2DI) and move pal/sk to -1DI.<br />
<br />
Bad move there, it's a problem which is best solved through itemization unless you want to gimp the encounters to solve it, doing global changes such as this would impove Knights at progression levels where it isn't needed which isn't good overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In effect a bonus to tanking that gives a reduced chance to keep agro, in a group that is carefull you would be able to tank with some extra effort while warrior's defensive would remain the dis of choise, I personaly do not care much about the timer, I think 15-30 min as a final refersh time would keep things palanced.<br />

Saying Warriors are better is one thing they're supposed to be, but when the gap is too large then the other tank classes are incapable of fulfilling their role in these.  If mobs in these trials proced -1000 resist adjust fear spells as often as Chaos Claws I would be argueing that Warriors needed a change (or fear proc removed) because it would be making specific classes required.  *waits for you to say clerics are required in single group content so it's ok for Warriors to be*</div></div><hr />

<br />
 But the other tank classes aren't incapable of fulfilling their role in these. Your own flagging proves it. What you're asking is to throw away the entirety of Warrior historical use to tank cutting edge content because the cutting edge content is limited to 6 people in one particular instance, and an instance even where well geared Knights HAVE succeeded. We don't always agree in EQ on the size of groups or force it into one particular mold - you can have 3 man groups, 4 man groups, etc., as long as the number in a group does not exceed 6. Similarly, you can have raid content that has a variable number of people that can be involved maximum, whether that maximum is 36 or 42 or 54 or 72......or 6. <br />
<br />
 You can bring less than 72 to a PoP flagging - does that mean that it's not 'raid' content and should not have a benefit to Warriors tanking it? No one has EVER argued that - but they do here, because of the number 6.<br />
<br />
 Either you have a problem with Warriors being the choice to tank cutting edge content, or you have a problem with Warriors being survivable against 'raid' content. Which is it that would cause you to ask for the ONE unique Warrior ability to be farmed out to other classes for a handful of content? (Literally a handful - the number of mobs involved here is less than five)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horizon Mobs - One month into a new expansion giving Knights the tools necessary to increase their reliability when facing the toughest known content is pretty bad. I don't get parties for adaquate survivability vs. 99.5% of the known mobs, heals and buffs, I get them because my survivability is needed. <br />
<br />
Exactly how many mobs will I be needed for after such a change? Not any mobs that hit for 2100HPs and live for 90 seconds and below, that's for sure. How many are left in the entire game?<br />
<br />
My guess is that my survivability meant something when my name was called to MT a (one each) mob on any of my guild's remaining PoTime trips and for 8 other mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
Make the recommended change, and the number of mobs I tank on that horizon approaches 0 and stays 0 (guild #4 MT or so).<br />
<br />
For the entire trip to those 8 named mobs a Paladin's buffs, heals, roots, stuns, and Res insures that their party reaches the mob safe and sound. Since he can now reliably MT the named what exactly is the reason to include me? There isn't any reason - none.<br />

If the goal is ability to participate, then the trials are changed.<br />

Well, you may not be all warriors.  I have NO agro problems IF the slower waits until the first heal lands before tash/slow.  I have HUGE agro problems if I play with a RL friend (enc) that tash at 200 range (/assist and spam casting until oor goes away) and then when spell gems pops he casts slow.  About the ONLY place I don't have this problem is SolRo and that is only because I can incite twice before I get in camp.  He (the enc) doesn't want to modify his behaviour since he USUALLY has the paladin friend tanking (who when present everyone would prefer him to tank.)  There are various agro problems in between these two extremes when I play with people that may be used to Paladins (or if you prefer, more &quot;uber&quot; warriors with significantly more agro.)<br />

1 group content.  Thats the key, I'm not complaining about not being able to tank stuff in Uqua or Primal Insect or something.  Our role in 1 group content is the same, and that is tanking right now Knight tanking abilites combined with our spells do not make up for the deficency between us and Warriors in this regard, and leave us too close to chain classes when tanking.  What utility do SK's have?  Summon Corpse and Deathpeace?

It's useful in the same sense that 10 hp on their own are useful, it's more than you had but it's a minor improvement, my lifetaps are far behind the curve power wise.  They haven't gotten more efficent since VT level focus and have only gained 7.5% to their average damage since VT level focus as well, not to mention that they havent seen upgrades like other classes heals have.  Not going to speak for Paladins and I don't really feel like griping about my spells currently since SK's are far to caster oriented as it is (hence the reason for trying for melee upgrades, it's not easy when melees want you as an armored caster and casters want you to be worse at casting than a level 16 of your &quot;parent&quot; class, but if you're curious ToI is 297 mana, 597dd, 657 heal every 12 sec Light of Order is 387 mana 1615 heal every 6 sec).<br />

<br />
Those are anti tanking abilities, so they aren't the same thing.<br />
<br />
Give it time. Was there mudflation right at the beginning of PoP? No. Did that mean it didn't happen at all? Of course not.<br />
<br />
I guess the closest parallel that could be made using PoP references would be able to be made to this is Knights being unable to tank PoJ trials until elemental their guild is elemental geared or possibly time geared, that wasn't the case in PoP but thats how they would work if it functioned in a similar way.  At which point its pointless and chain classes could tank it as well.<br />
<br />
Hybrids having their own spellbook, plus a defensive that's half as good as ours, while we only have the defensive, and nothing else?<br />
<br />
What was proposed was half as powerful with a bigger drawback and close to 1/3 the recycle time.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned that they must be ok for Knights if I managed to get through them, thats because we botted Warriors to tank when it became apparent there was no way to win within a reasonable amount of time with a Knight tanking (waiting on the RNG to give all good rolls takes awhile).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Why does mini-defensive for knights hurt warriors? Because it dramatically reduces the need for a warrior on RAIDS, which are our one and only specialty.<br />
<br />
Brutul, this is a solid and valid argument, and one that needs to be considered.   While I am philosophically opposed to supporting something that would threaten our raid level role, I ran some numbers and I seriously don't believe for a minute that this &quot;threatens&quot; our raid level role.    <br />
<br />
While I understand that there's a threshold of survivability and once crossed, the &quot;need&quot; for a warrior to tank raid level mobs falls off sharply, I would maintain that with the recent changes, there's no real &quot;motive&quot; for, if a 25% mit bonus defensive went live, replacing a warrior as a raid main tank.   <br />
<br />
I ask myself &quot;What bonus would there be to using a Knight in place of a warrior in the primary tanking position&quot; and the answer is fairly straight forward, it's the differential in initial aggro on incoming mobs.  An incite from a distance doesn't hold a candle to 1-3 stuns or 1-3 SK spells initially.  The advantage in this area is in the Knights' camp, clearly.   This is the precise reason that I was initially opposed to many of the &quot;mini defensive&quot; ideas originally presented, but it was on the premise that they were asking for what I considered to be &quot;too much&quot; where the line was blurred to the degree that the benefit of using a knight offset the benefit of using a warrior.   <br />
<br />
Some Knights didn't agree, as would be expected from someone who has something to gain and nothing to lose.   The thing is, there is indeed a balance that can be struck which enables knight tanking at an earlier time than the rest of the classes, yet doesn't threaten the primary role of warriors, where the benefit of early aggro generation on incoming mobs doesn't offset the benefits of using a warrior.<br />
<br />
The thing is, that's a fine line... a very fine one.    Since the changes, and since we're dealing here with time+ level content, I dont' see how it's anything other than sheer hypocracy to say that a Knight needs to be fully time geared to survive these battles with any small measure of success, without invoking the opposite standard, that a warrior shouldn't have to experience some difficulties with aggro generation without a full time level aggro set.   How one can apply the standard of &quot;Full Time+ gear&quot; for one and not the other to compensate for their class weaknesses makes no sense to me.<br />
<br />
Now, that's all fine and dandy, so let's look at what happens in a raid level situation.   Aggro generation isn't the issue that it was before, that issue at this level of the game has been solved.   Within 20 seconds, the generation of aggro advantage begins to fall in the favor of the properly geared warrior.<br />
<br />
The question becomes... does the benefit of the first 20 seconds offset the difference in survivability at the level at which Brael and I are discussing?    I don't believe that it does.  It would if this were 30%+, but not 25%.    Particularly when one can furious for the first moments.    The difference in survivability is still rather large, and unless we're talking about special circumstances on raid level targets, such as the ones that already exist (CT in time, TZ in RZTW Script and Rathe Council TMing) I cannot envision a time when the skillset that either knight brings would offset the advantage of the still rather dramatic difference in survivability.   <br />
<br />
The benefits to those classes who would benefit are clear, a level of survivability and non susceptibility to the same spike damage as non-tank classes.   The PRIMARY benefit is the differentiation between knight and non-tank classes, which is a DIRE need in this game.   I believed that, and I was correct in this belief, knight classes last year were FAR too close to warriors and there wasn't enough motivation to use a warrior.  The ugly truth was, it wasn't just knights, it was everyone.   Knights were just a little closer to us than the others and tended to represent a greater threat to our primary group role.   Knights have the SAME claim about Beastlords and Rangers that we did between us and knights.    There's not enough differentiation between them.    <br />
<br />
Now, my questions when considering what kinds of courses of action to take boil down to these.<br />
<br />
1. What would result if nothing were done?<br />
<br />
Well, it's clear to me that Knights are very unhappy about losing their role as people who are perceived to be adequate tanks.   Regardless of anything else you may say, any &quot;suck it up&quot; speeches you give, it won't change their emotional response to the thought that &quot;I once was able to perform this task, but no one wants me to any more&quot;.    That produces unhappiness, and everyone knows that you will eventually stop doing something if doing it produces negative emotions.    I know that if I didn't believe that SoE would do something about our issues, I'd have stopped playing EQ completely last year.   I believed that they would, and that was what kept me going.  I'm fairly certain that those knights who are still going are doing so while clinging to a level of optimism that this issue will be addressed.   <br />
<br />
One thing is for certain, if the situation remains as is, SoE will get a black eye, and lose customers.    <br />
<br />
2.  What would result if the encounters were changed to enable knight tanks?<br />
<br />
Well, it would do one of 2 things:<br />
<br />
A. Simply toning down the bosses would be TERRIBLY bad, as it would lower the standard of success, and enable the skipping of content, which is the single best thing about this expansion is the &quot;Admission Requirements&quot;.<br />
<br />
B. Altering them to &quot;disable&quot; defensive (End drain, End/Mana drain), or to inflict much of their damage via spell procs would set a precedent that following mobs would have to follow.   Neither of us wants to be drained of endurance and have our primary class skill disabled each time that we would most likely use it, or better yet, to have it meaningless because the mobs were altered to deliver their damage via non-melee damage which makes our primary strength in essence, worthless.<br />
<br />
3. What if knights were given at the content that there's an issue and beyond, a &quot;bonus&quot; to enable them to tank mobs of this type reliably, yet at such a spread that there would be a clear durability advantage?<br />
<br />
Well, this could work, and AS LONG as the benefits of using a knight tank don't offset the survivability differential, it would have little to no impact outside of overcoming this single group content issue, and other nameds around KodTaz.   Knights would get a &quot;You are important too&quot; signal from SoE, something that they desperately need.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know, seriously, where, not vaguely or conceptually, but realistically and with some level of detail where the aggro advantage in the initial 20 seconds of a raid level target offsets the survivability advantage that a warrior with /disc furious then /disc defensive brings.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Balancing classes around the Ikkinz trial will have much wider-reaching implications.<br />
<br />
Such as?<br />
<br />
This isn't for exp groups, we all know how often you use defensive in exp groups. We are talking about (so far) ONE trial that you have to do ONE time that is very hard for a knight to tank. <br />
<br />
Two responses to this.  About 50% of the nameds in KodTaz I use /disc furious then /disc defensive on.    I dont' know about you, but when I'm exping, I LOVE killing nameds.   If I had the option of two different people, one who could enable me to kill the nameds, and the other where it wasn't a realistic option or it would be such a struggle and risk that there's a 40+% chance of a wipe, I'd pick the one who would enable it every time, because hell, I like augments and stuff.<br />
<br />
I know of paladins with 2 or 3 time loots and all the rest elemental with mostly empty augment slots beating Tipt, so I don't buy that it is too hard at all. <br />
<br />
I think EVERYONE agrees that Tipt should be left as is, or at least MOST knights that I've talked to who have done the content.    Tipt isn't an issue really, it's Kod named and higher (Ikk named) that gives real issues. <br />
<br />
If it takes you 3 tries to get through the Ikkinz trials, who cares? If you have to play second fiddle to a warrior in one trial that you have to do one time, who cares? It's only once and then you're done forever. Horrible thing to pick to balance the classes around in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I'm really concerned that while Ikkinz trials initially were considered to be a &quot;one person enables raid content&quot;, the raid content we're discussing is Ikkinz raids.    This doesn't say that the entire Kod flag leg won't be needed for Tacvi, including the raid content and the group content, only that SoE very likely decided that it'd be insane to have a &quot;flag first, then raid&quot; policy on Ikkinz Raids, but granted far more flexibility in the order in which flags were gained than early in PoP.   <br />
<br />
I REALLY dislike the notion that in a guild of 60 people, 6 of those people (The warriors typically represented) *have* to do the trials a minimum of 11 times each to &quot;carry&quot; the others through for the flag, and realistically 3-4 of them will do the trials 20+ times and the other 2-3 will do them a couple times, all because of some vague notion that something may be threatened on some raid somewhere, although we have no details and cannot come up with an example where this is likely.</div></div><hr />

[quote]1 group content.  Thats the key, I'm not complaining about not being able to tank stuff in Uqua or Primal Insect or something.  Our role in 1 group content is the same, and that is tanking right now Knight tanking abilites combined with our spells do not make up for the deficency between us and Warriors in this regard, and leave us too close to chain classes when tanking. <br />
Doom and gloom. In BoT, the mini named used to absolutely require a warrior to tank them. What do you see now? Knights tanking them just fine. <br />
What utility do SK's have?  Summon Corpse and Deathpeace?<br />
Oh, come on. Weren't you the one saying that you use your abilities to the fullest? How about Snare? ATK taps? aggro buffs, helping casters do more damage without getting aggro? Helping with pulls with FD? How about even returning mana and health to the entire group? That sure sounds like utility to me.<br />
<br />
  Those are the only two things I have that Warriors don't get through gear or more than make up for through improved efficency and that simply isn't enough.<br />
<br />
That's a good thing, because you're purely and simply wrong. Tell me, where do I find an attack tap castable at will? How bout those big lifetaps? How about Thule? Tell me, where do I get an item to summon my corpse or to cast FD? As for getting this all through gear... get real. I mean, seriously.... the amount of warriors that can do even most of these things in worn effects or unreliable procs ALONE on a server can be counted on one hand, and NONE of them can do it on demand.<br />
<br />
  People don't take a 2nd tank in single groups for emergency or offtanking you avoid situations where thats needed, espically when it puts a rather severe limitation on your dps.<br />
Are you claiming that people never take a second tank into these? And no, with a SK it doesn't really put a severe limitiation on the DPS at all... SK's do decent damage themselves, let alone what they add to the group with the above mentioned atk and mana taps.<br />
<br />
It's useful in the same sense that 10 hp on their own are useful, it's more than you had but it's a minor improvement, my lifetaps are far behind the curve power wise.<br />
Welcome to what rangers, beastlords, paladins, and even shamans are bitching about. EVERYONE'S healing curve has fallen behind. This isn't news here. If any healing is to be upgraded, it should be the entire spectrum.<br />
<br />
ToI is 297 mana, 597dd, 657 heal every 12 sec Light of Order is 387 mana 1615 heal every 6 sec).<br />
You're comparing your taps to a clerical, defensive oriented hybrid, as an offensive, damage oriented hybrid. Of course you're going to come up short comparing heals with them, just as a paladin will come up short vs a SK in the damage department. Hell, Beastlords and Rangers with their Druid and Shaman parentage still heal worse than YOU do, and you don't even have a healer as a casting parent.<br />
<br />
Those are anti tanking abilities, so they aren't the same thing.<br />
You mentioned abilities that guaranteed your survival for X seconds, saying that you don't have any. I have shown that you have. They ARE the same thing, they are abilities that guarantee your survival for X seconds. Next time be more careful in what you're claiming.<br />
Aside from bickering about &quot;what counts&quot; or not, I think we can both agree that Harmshield and paladin DA aggro needs to be fixed so that they can keep aggro while it is active.<br />
<br />
I guess the closest parallel that could be made using PoP references would be able to be made to this is Knights being unable to tank PoJ trials until elemental their guild is elemental geared or possibly time geared,<br />
You can't even make that comparison yet, there's no indication that you've even reached &quot;elemental&quot; content yet. noone's even gotten seriously into the last 5 zone's loot yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if the Ikkinz trials turn out to be something that everybody has to get through, you just have to get your guild through it once and it's over.  This is gonna be an issue for a couple weeks, and occaisional backflagging now and then, but it's not going to be an issue in day to day playing, which is why I think it would be a mistake to make serious class balance changes based on what will be a very temporary issue for your guild.  Don't get me wrong, looking at our warriors, when it comes time for my guild to do this (6-12 months from now heh), it will most likely be me and one other warrior doing the lions share of these things.  I'm not looking forward to that, but annoying timesinks are part of the game.  In early PoP when we were keying up for BoT and the mini-minis weren't in yet, I spent several hours a night for what seemed like a month killing those damn giants in Storms (and the mini bosses) with a couple groups getting person after person keyed while a lot of the guild was grinding AA in Valor.  Would it have been nice to share the load with some of the knights?  Sure, but in my mind it's not worth the risk of unbalancing other parts of the game over something that is really a temporary problem (for any given guild).<br />
<br />
Kod'Taz named?  Personally I am content to let mudflation take care of that.  They will be tough for knights to tank until they get geared up some, but I think it's safe to assume minis in Nightmare and BoT were much riskier for knights to tank in the early days of PoP but I don't think it hurt the class any in the long run.  A lot of people, myself included, thought that PoP fixed warriors, just due to how hard the exp mobs hit, people wanted warriors again woohoo!  But it didn't last long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What people don't get is that Knights being unattractive is a function of the difficulty not the class.  As it stands right now all DPS classes minus rogue/wizard are inadequate for the first 2 trials just because you need to drop the mob as fast as possible so you'd only take the top 2 DPS if you've a choice.

How far ahead would you consider &quot;acceptable&quot; in terms of should would need to be farmed to enable knights to have a reasonable chance at success?<br />
<br />
I tend to think that the only other thing I could compare this to is BoT nameds, which clearly favored a warrior in early PoP.   The &quot;point&quot; of farming though was that very content.  Once a group of people had level 65 and their spellset, which could be acquired from the very nameds which were giving problems, then the warrior &quot;advantage&quot; went away.    Would you consider that your group having GoD spells where the runes drop from Kod Named be acceptable?  Gear from Ikkinz Raids?   How far up should the farming have to go to have mudflation enable knights to tank these?  <br />
<br />
The reason I ask is because I haven't really seen anything that has come from Ikkinz raids, Yxxta raids that would enable this, have you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, because in reality, mage pets are better tanks of KodTaz and Ikkinz nameds than SK's and Paladins are.   A majority pet group can beat any named in Kod Taz because the pets enrage.   At enrage, you call in your held pet and go at it, and begin summonning another.   SK's and Paladins don't even have that option.<br />
<br />
Since I've beaten every PoJ trial in a 3 warrior, bard, cleric, druid group, I can confidently say that multiple DPS classes were nowhere near necessary for PoJ trials.    That was only true for the uncreative and unskilled.    It also didn't rely on the RNG for success.   I did EVERY SINGLE trial with that group, and the success rate once we figured it out was.... 100%.     This isn't an anomaly or luck, it's solid and repeatable.    There is nothing Solid nor repeatable with knights tanking GoD trials.  It's possible to get lucky is the best chance.   That's nothing like PoJ trials.</div></div><hr />

How far up should the farming have to go to have mudflation enable knights to tank these?  <br />

 Were Knights able to tank AoW reliably immediately after defeating AoW, or did they have to obtain either Luclin content or extensive Velious content to do so?<br />
<br />
 Knights seem to want to reliably tank 'raid-level' mobs without farming the same content even moderately. Has that EVER happened?

Yes, the failure of the Taunt button (RNG) and procs to occur when needed (RNG) was the problem, not tanking the final mob. RNG was the problem - a crap shoot.<br />
<br />
However the Phase 1 Melee Upgrade is not ancient history. The &quot;-1 DI&quot; change was intended to provide a scalable melee mitigation advantage for Warriors. While it did not add to Defensive (already quite nice) the principle was important - Warriors are to have a real survivability advantage, not some 380HP's after AoTC.<br />
<br />
That advantage is what makes Warriors &quot;unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; You know, those battles where parties die far more often if Warriors are not MTing.<br />
<br />
Should some other class be given a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; upgrade for the express purpose to allow them to survive the majority of current content known brutal battles, then the Warrior survivability advantage is meaningless. In simple terms 1 or 2 MT's will have that advantage in raids. That priviledge and 18% more DPS is what we get instead of a spellbook.<br />

To be honest with you, I could care less if they can tank these named. However, I don't my role on raids (or other special situations)  to be affected by granting Knights an ability that pushes them closer to my role on raids.. I am the supreme tank, Knights fuck off.</div></div><hr />

- No, many have been completed already, some even by knight tanking.  GoD is still new, lets not spoil it by completing the expansion in weeks.  It's supposed to be hard!<br />
<br />
Can Knights tank the harder trials?.........<br />
- Not in my guild they can't, but there's probably a select few from each server with the equip to do so.  As time goes on, and they get more equip, they'll be able to tank them.<br />
<br />
Is it fair that you &quot;need&quot; a Warrior to tank trials?.........<br />
- A warrior is in definition, the tank class.  You going to argue that it's unfair to need a cleric?  I think not.  It's not unfair, it's just using classes for exactly what they're meant for.<br />
<br />
Give Hybrids Defensive?.........<br />
- No, they have spells and other skills.  We have innate tanking skills and tanking disciplines.  Perfect balance, no, but knight defensive would be serious unbalance.<br />
<br />
If Knights can't Tank trials, how will they get flags?.........<br />
- Like every other class, fit into the &quot;spare&quot; slots of the groups after Tank Cleric Slower have been filled.  Situational, is the key word, you simply cannot expect knights to be able to tank everything - some things they do better than us, some things they simply can't do... this is a *good* thing.<br />
<br />
The trials aren't perfectly balanced in many ways, but the whole game isn't perfectly balanced, I don't know what people expected(?)<br />
Warriors are wanted once more to do our job - being the master Tanks.  In a few months, knights will probably be tanking all the trials, and groups might insist on using knights instead of us, for their utility.  <br />

Who cares, it's not that hard if your healer doesn't suck. 1 healer is plenty for trial 1.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I tried this with one cleric.  Furious to start, perfectly timed ch for 7k after furious falls then chain casting holy light with -worn spell haste -buff spell haste -marr's gift.  My cleric has 693 aa and 7390 mana total.  We got him to 60% and it was very obvious that you will never ever be consistent with 1 healer, you might get lucky yes.  1 healer isn't anywhere near plenty.  I won't claim that you can't win but you're simply hoping for crit heals at the right times which will never be consistant.  We nailed boss 1, this was a very short fight and I got a lucky 8900hp crit heal that landed for full.  DD does have more hit points greatly increasing the chances of failure with inadequate heals.<br />
<br />
If anything needs to be added it's a beter heal for clerics druids and shaman.  This would make knights more effective in the process.<br />
<br />
As for DD trial,  I'd like to see them scale his DPS to increase over time so high dps/ low heal power groups are as viable as high heal power/low dps.  To require a cleric and druid or cleric/cleric for a 6 person encounter is out of hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need a guild to progress past KT.  Or at least, a dedicated group working together.<br />
<br />
The flag for the KT 1 group trials gets you absolutely nothing unless you can complete all the raids to follow.<br />
<br />
My point, you're not going to need the flags from these trials unless you have a guild (or group of people that work together enough to act like one).  And if you have a guild, they're going to get these flags done for you provided they want to progress as a guild.<br />
<br />
So &quot;How will poor_knight04 get his KT trial flags?&quot; He'll get gimped through, much like a low HP/AC warrior who can't handle tanking it yet will.  This implies how that class rebalancing is needed?</div></div><hr />

The problem is, our natural mitigation bonus would also be as useless as defensive, and we still have evasive so things would get easier, and it's a lot more difficult for them to counter that.<br />
<br />
And this would also make AC not matter at all which is one of the key ways that warriors do tank better than some classes such as monks, rogues and rangers.</div></div><hr />

How long did you even try to win the trials by tanking it yourself?  Or was it just too hard for you and you threw in the towel after the 2nd attempt?  It was easier to win with a warrior, you said.

Then you aren't playing your class right.  I don't get where some of you knights get off saying &quot;oh my God, we suck, we're broken!&quot;  None of the knights in my guild seem to be having that problem.  They bring plenty to the table, whether it be single group or raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for how many times did I try them?  I put roughly 20 hours into each one tanking as a Knight before breaking down and using a Warrior (which then won first try no problem), Warriors are better tanks yes but all my other abilities didn't make up for that in the group at any time during any of the trials except for flesh hunters where there it could be argued that they were semi useful.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">The mainproblem with the trials is, that this trials are for 6 person only. Only the biggest FeF or idiot was able to design this. Because it give 3 classes the total domination over the other 13 classes and 13 classes have to ask 3 other classes for help to get them past it. There is no problem when this is a raid and 40+ people can join it and knights can not tank the mob. But in a groupe a knights should be able to tank it like a druid/shaman should be able to heal in a groupe. It is anyway more then stupid to make single groupe progression. The skill in this single groupe trials come from which classes you take with you. More and more classes will see that the need for warriors, clerics, enchanters etc. simple is to much to call this game fun. It isnt fun to wait on warrior, clerics, enchanters and hope they join you and not one of the other 13 classes which need them to. It is simple not fun. Call it what you want. If they made this trials that the named has a 3000dmg, 500range, 15 sec. AE which make that you need a paladin in every groupe to counter his AE you will not call this fun. Because you will have to wait on us and that isnt fun. It is okay when you are better but it is not okay when you are that much better that it dont make sense to take knights for it and this is for sure the case in GoD. <br />
<br />
There are many, many ways to fix this problem without touching knights and warriros skills. But to think there isnt a problem is the real bullshit you guys do here. Ether you are a total fef because you think it is okay that you have domination over the other 13 classes or you are an idiot and dont see how fucked up a system like this is. I dont think knight has it that worse there. We have tools which make us usefull. Not needed but usefull. But sorry i dont find it funny that most of me friends only sit arround and wait on clerics, warriors and i feel like a thief that i stole one of the 3 free spots from the other 13 classes and have to defend why i am there and not another one of the 13 classes. The system is simple fucked up.<br />
<br />
If you dont agree with it you really support the biggest bullshit they ever done. Simple because it help you. Do it but next time they will make something which will not help you and then you will be one of the 13 classes which wait on 3 other classes. I am sure then all which support this fucked up system will make a 180 turn and curse this system. Simple because it force them to wait on other classes and waiting is never fun.<br />
<br />
I dont want defensiv. I will that they make raids to progress where everyone can take part and make single groupe encounters open for ALL classes. I dont care when it is to easy to kill a lootnamed with a cleric, warrior and a challenge with druid, knight. But progression should come from the work of the guild. All the members and not the 6 which play the right class.<br />
<br />
Agree with it that the system is fucked up and we are a step further to show them that single groupe progression is bullshit and dont call this bullshit raids. That are not raids. <br />

<br />
Guilds that have farmed PoTime, Quarm and LDoN raids for months will of course be better geared than guilds that have not done so, and in having better gear their knights will be able to tank the trials succesfully, with adequate healing support which would and should always be more than a similarly equipped warrior.<br />
<br />
Warriors that are in guilds that have not farmed as much as the former group of guilds will still be able to tank the trials, with adequate healing support, and warriors that have been farming said content will breeze through the trials with minimal (relative) healing power.<br />
<br />
If you plan on tanking with a knight, get more healing power. If your guild is having such huge problems getting past these trials, then maybe you should go back and farm said content more until your level of gear increases sufficiently to match the trials.</div></div><hr />

As posted by Brael earlier he has ~1% risk of dying (I prefer to refer to it as a risk instead of chance).<br />
<br />
My chance of dying is ~1% every second Daemonwynd thats with an entire group playing flawlessly, at 115 seconds average to kill the mob, unless I'm lucky within 95 seconds I would still die.<br />
<br />
At that rate (1%) the chance of living through various lengths of fights would be:<br />
<br />
50 seconds = 61% chance of living (0.99^50)<br />
100 seconds = 37% chance of living (0.99^100)<br />
120 seconds = 30% chance of living (0.99^120)<br />
<br />
So basically, how much 'penalty' (as in increased chance of dying from war to knight) balanced by the sooner damage-dealing from having a knight tank over warrior. Is a 30% chance of success using a knight for 120 seconds enough?<br />
<br />
If you use 0.5% or 1.5% RoD instead, you'll get:<br />
<br />
50 sec = 78%@0.5% or 47%@1.5%<br />
100 sec = 61%@0.5% or 22%@1.5%<br />

For te Ikkinz group trials when I've lost them its almost always been a player error, or wrong group composistion (i bot other class's a lot to help people win),  If i've had a warrior tanking it has very rarely ever been a lack of gear that has caused the group to fail, sometimes lost because heaelrs went oom, but that usually only happens when an error happened before and furious isnt up, and the raids are stupiditly easy except for figuring out the riddles or keys but the mobs themself are really pretty easy besides for stupid gimmicks suck as kill this mob over and over until you kill it &quot;right&quot;</div></div><hr />

Now my guild isn't at &quot;the very&quot; top,we have an 11k HP Paladin but The SK is the top of the server at only 8k,this is just with Time farming,no Ldon raids.<br />
<br />
We only had one cleric healing him,and I was on the other priest with one cleric on me,We had no problem on this trial at all,Killed both priests together in less than 3 min.<br />
<br />
Probably even our top paladin would fail at Tanking DD,Assume though that we did in fact farm Ldon Raids and said paladin got a few HP augs from that,and that the Paladin also picks up a couple Augs from KT and Ikkinz Raids and then a couple peices of Gear and we have a 12k knight....<br />
<br />
2 Clerics on DD trial Alternating Complete Heal were hitting me with disc at around40-50 % every heal,A Knight without a disc plus two clerics performing the same healing strategy would probably be being hit at around 30-40% Which still leaves them a bit of room for the Odd extra Big round.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing about DD isn't so much the fight over the long Term,its the intial period of having the Adds + DD on the Tank,which warriors typically use Furious/Fort on till adds are under control.<br />

Yes those trials are fairly hard, but if you have decent stuff, AA xp, and have decent players, you still can make it with a lot of different setup ie, your group can have one weakness : dps, tank or healer.<br />

Point is its not out of the Question,It just means more Farming.When you had to kill Lords in Plane of Storms for bot keys you had to use wars but also needed a raid,so they moved them to the minis,and you could one group them,but you still required a warrior to do that and at the begining you also required two healers for such an excursion.<br />
<br />
Of course once a guild had famred the EP's for a bit ,a Knight could tank Storms minis just fine.And those keys were a requirement to progress then to jsut as ikkinz trials are now.The only difference I can see from then till now is that during that period of time the Whole Knights &gt; than warrior thign had not really gone into effect.I don't think there was a ton of Knights at the on set of PoP that expected to eb able to tank much of anyhting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do know that I get many times more requests to MT high DI mobs for others than all of the Knights I know combined. And since Defensive went live it has always been this way.<br />
<br />
Since I did the PoJ trials about 20 times before succeeding and did not even concider writing SoE, I am a little baffled by those &quot;high-level&quot; players that don't just get their flags and move on. Don't suggest I only had to wait a few minutes to retry in PoJ. There were literally dozens of groups lined up and it took me well over a month.<br />
<br />
Tune a few mobs to make them more balanced for any high level tank - that's fine. Suggest giving Knights Defensive or half-Defensive and that's complete unremitting total BS.<br />

Incidently, for all of Brael's uberness he could pick stand to pick up a few upgrades as well. Not that you're not pretty decked as is, but a few of your items have considerable upgrades, as well as getting some of the GoD augments. You could pick up a couple hundred HP with just shoulders, bracer, and 1 ear. Of course, you have focus considerations - but that's part of being a hybrid. Any knight with lesser gear than Brael can just STFU now because you haven't farmed enough.<br />

Farm shit until you have enough HP to tank &lt;insert mob name here&gt; and STFU. That is the way it has always been.

To upgrade that gear further without using LDoN raid augs (since no one raids LDoN anymore) what would be required is some Pauldrons of Devestation, Talisman of the Elements, Silver Hoop of Speed, and Jointed Scale Greaves/Greaves of Furious Might, in addition to augments for those items.  That would leave me with ft14 which is enough to not warrant an FT aug, so pick up a 70 hp upgrade and place it on Quarm ear, 50/50/50 on my spool, 30 ac on legs, and a 50/50 for my other ear, plus 2 10 ac ldon augs on the quarm neck/rz shoulder.  Thats some upgrades yes but its also with the very best aviable stuff currently (in every slot), thats with focusing on ac however, if the focus was moved to hp a more substantial upgrade could be obtained for that but then the ac would suffer and as I've known for awhile (and posted some parses of earlier) ac really does destroy hp for effectiveness even on a 8hp:1 ac basis.</div></div><hr />

Ikkinz single group trials are where the real fun is.<br />

KT/Ikkinz is not content designed or balanced for guilds that have time loot in every slot. Its parrell, or maybe slight delay  to PoTime. (Month or Two in at max) (How do I know this? because people with FAR less equipment then you'd find in Valon, AL, etc have completed beat the group trials, and altar of destruction)<br />
<br />
The raid content is easy, once you learn the scripts (which is gear indepedent)<br />

The single group content isnt particually challenging, as much as it is intolerant of errors, (and group composition)</div></div><hr />

This differs from the rest of EQ how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Exactly my point Brael. While you are undoubtedly one of the best geared knights on any server, there are still upgrades that would amount to a few hundred HP without hurting your AC.  Arguably, Kod'Taz, Ikkinz, and Yxtta are a single tier with the loot quality ranging from Time tier 1 to Time tier 5 with a few pieces being Quarm quality. Once you progress beyond this level, there will be considerable upgrades for you that will make tanking this level of GoD content at least much more reliable.<br />
<br />
The single group content isnt particually challenging, as much as it is intolerant of errors, (and group composition)And this is a problem? The stuff that everyone is required to do is either multigroup raids or completely knight tankable. No dispute here, been over this about a million times. The very few mobs that knights have a hard time with 1) CAN be tanked by the very top end knights and 2) is not required for everyone to progress. Again, why is it a problem that knights are not the tank of choice for 2 or 3 mobs? And how is this hurting knight groupability?<br />

As for the progression, I can't say for certain because we have not entered every zone yet, but you can progress right through Ikkinz without havig your whole guild do the Kod'Taz trials.

First off you have 0 avoidance..again this means jack shit unless you are tanking mobs and even a knight with your gear gets bitch slapped in these zones.  Ring of brutish beats id take over your ring of thunderous forces in a heartbeat, jointed scale greaves over your elem by a lot, sheilding seems to have a much larger effect in god than it did in pop just from my personal parses.  Get a platinum cloak of war, i doubt you understand the magnitude of avoidance on tanking, but then again that isnt god so not exactly relevent to this post.  Lastly blackstone is pretty nice, although not a huge upgrade from your sos, still worth having.  Again the avoidance is a moot point considering you really cant tank anything past tipt wo having 2 designated clerics, but they are upgrades from an overall dps taken standpoint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shieldings effect in GoD is fairly poor, Rav Interceptor for my example has a delay of 12 and ~450 of its damage is affected by shielding, that means that each point of shielding is worth 4.5 damage, at 2 hits/round average thats 9 damage less each round for a point of shielding or 7.5 dps.  Does that add up?  Yes.  It would reduce overall dps but the problem of spikes is still there and thats what gets me killed and in that case it's only reducing a possible 18 damage off of the spike which isn't much.<br />

As for legs, they would have to drop for us all we get are leather legs and ranger swords.  Upgrading SoS to Blackstone isn't an option since we have very few shields (Our luck on RZ was... strange).</div></div><hr />

I agree on most but healing for you is 100% useless.  There is 0 difference between tapping for 400 and tapping for 500, and the hot on bod is virtually nothing compared to the massive dps of god mobs.  Honestly healing focus is pretty close to useless in god while tanking.  It obviously is added dps when not, but dps wasnt my focus in replying to your upgrades.  As per shielding its pretty huge in god, sure its not on intercepter and annihliator and the gimp 1 group stuff, but once you get to the quad 4k guardian in righteousness it starts to add up fast.  Then again as a knight you wont be tanking that anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u212"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p212">Focuses don't affect recourses AA's do though, that means I can't focus the heal portion of BoD or Zev's Bite so it's just ToI/ToV, but it would just be those two in these situations anyways since Zev's isn't worth it in short fights and as you said, BoD is worthless.  I do have to design my gear around aviability of items, raid roles, group roles, etc however though which means I do need whatever healing I can get for things such as AE's, Rampage, Pulling, DPS.  Like you said the golems in Righteousness are raid mobs so they'll be Warrior only for the most part for the stuff Knights are tanking this expansion or appear to be meant to tank shielding is fairly minor atleast at this point, maybe that will change in Qvic or deeper Uqua.</div></div><hr />

No one knows if its for progression or not atm heh, and if you have 50 people after raids, 2-3 warriors in that bunch, then only 18 people at max can be doing progression.

3. Warriors have much better agro no so knights should get some sort of disc or the mobs need to be tuned so that knights can tank them reliably. Plenty of reasons why knights should not get any form of defensive were given so it turned to ...<br />
<br />
4. Just in case KT trials are needed for progression the trials should be changed so knights can tank them. Also, since knights have to consider focus, mana, and FT they can't go straight for the pure tanking gear so they are at a disadvantage.<br />

Druids work fine for backup healers on all the trials, even tho I think its dumb to need 2 healers (some say that htey can do it with 1 but that more of an outliner then the rule so i'll stick with the 2 figure) This is neither the cleric - or the druid board! So I really dont bring up the issue here.<br />

Apart from that the ikkinz raids are nice because they only require 35 people to beat them, and drop nice loot, so can pretty much do them in an hour or twos time with few people to catch up on flags, as opposed to shit encounters like rztw where you blow 2 hours, get shitty loot and have a chance of wiping during the 30 min timer once he is spawned.<br />

As for knights complaining, the issue is they have been overpowered for so long, you really cant expect them to not bitch.

I dont really consider hps as part of mitigation, so your theory really is flawed, but regardless you easily mitigate over 87% (depending on the mobs di of course) of what warriors do assuming you take tank gear and not focus gear like the stuff you have, and your hps are identical pregod, a bit lower with sturdiness in god, but again this doesnt change the fact that your spells are roughly 50% of what necros do.  In the end it still boils down to knights being overpowered in comparison to where they should be, although im not one to complain about a knight because i have no problems finding groups/out tanking them.  Basically theres no reason to complain about not being able to tank god mobs when you have focus gear and not avoidance/ac/shielding gear.

<br />
this doesnt change the fact that your spells are roughly 50% of what necros do. <br />
<br />
It's true that Death Peace, and Summon Corpse are the same spells as the one's necro's cast.  Aside from that, saying that shadowknight spells are &quot;roughly 50%&quot; of necros seems like hyperbole to me.<br />
<br />
Wandor, my guess is Brael is including ac from Aura of Pain Recourse.<br />
<br />
At my level in the game, I'm basically pretty happy, though I personally don't like the idea of any class being a &quot;necessary class&quot;, but that's the way the game is currently built.  I have no idea how to shift the emphasis away from clerics, so I won't comment on that.  As for changes in knights, I suggest the following:  Give each knight a disc, or even a self only buff that works similar to the Vie line of cleric buffs, but reflects the hybrid nature of each class:<br />
<br />
- In the case of the paladin, make the disc/buff absorb some percentage of incomming damage at the cost of a proportional amount of mana.  Percentage absorbed, duration, reuse time, and ratio of mana to damage could all be adjusted to achieve balance.<br />
<br />
- In the case of the shadowknight, make the disc/buff absorb about half as much damage, but do an equal amount of damage to the mob, similar to a damage shield.  The mana cost would be similar to paladin.  The same sorts of things could be adjusted for balance on this ability as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, something to chew on and spit out if you like.  To my mind the advantage of this is that it scales with content as a means of mitigation (unlike my taps, and proc taps), and yet comes at a cost to they mana side of my hybrid nature.</div></div><hr />

I could see why a Shadow Knight would like the second idea, IT IS INSANELY OVERPOWERED! <br />
You want to give Knights defensive Warriors DEMAND to pick abilities from your spellbook, specifically I want FD. Monks are a &quot;pure&quot; melee class and have it, I want it. Plus I want a snare ability, and some heal abilities. They all have to work with KEI also, so I can go pay 15pp, and have them nearly constantly working.<br />
Simply, the Knights posting for changes are the greediest EQ players now in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">I said all the values could be adjusted to balance.  If it truly is &quot;INSANELY OVERPOWERED&quot;, then it's not a good idea.  I don't want to be overpowered, I just scetched out an idea that might or might not work.<br />
<br />
If my idea is on about the level of the Vie line, I think we're talking about a 5% rune type mitigation, and a bonus damage shield representing about 5% of the incomming damage.  The damage shield might be way too high, I don't know.  For a 2k hitter, we're talking 100pt damage shield.  I can already get close to or excede that no problem with my gear and the right buffs/aa.  Adding that on top of my existing ds might be overpowering, in which case it should be toned down.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how suggesting an idea makes me one of the greediest in the game.  I put forward a suggestion that might help.  If it is truly overpowering, and there's argument to show it, I'll be the first to cast it aside.<br />
<br />
What happened to discussion, as opposed to ranting and raving at each other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u235"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p235">The problem right now the classes are as close as Warrior and Knights have EVER been balanced. Knights are ready to use 3 mobs as an excuse to break that balance. Thats all it is, an excuse.<br />
Anything that effects those trials can NOT trickle down to lower/lesser tiered Knights. The 99% then could give two damn craps about what the 1% do in their stupid trials. If you can't understand why Warriors don't want to be out of hand rejected from groups with your BROKEN balancing ideas, then you are incapable of rational thought. <br />
You have UTILITY (via spells) we have the ability to tank high DI mobs, if you can't see the balance in that, you are just another  Knight upset every group won't pass Warriors up to get you in the group.<br />
The Knights posting for the change in 99% of the cases, aren't even geared for the trials! It is simple GREED pushing this, nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">Show me it's broken, and I'll drop it.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about 10% here, at the cost of mana.  Let's take an example:<br />
<br />
Mob hits for an average of 1.5k per hit.<br />
<br />
With my proposed buff/disc, a paladin would take an average of 1,350 per hit, at the cost of something like 150 mana per hit, until mob was dead or mana ran out.<br />
<br />
With my proposed buff/disc, a shadowknight would take an average of 1,425 per hit, and the mob would take an average of 75hp per hit, at the cost of something like 150 mana per hit, until mob was dead or mana ran out.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, the benefits and costs would be less, because the mobs would hit for less.  You could adjust the reuse time, benefit and cost in order to balance it, if it was too strong or too weak upon testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it proved to be too powerfull for lower end knights to have said power, make the spell/disc drop in a respectably high end GoD zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want to make warriors rejected in exp groups out of hand.  If you can show how this would result in such a state of affairs, I would be more than willing to drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u239"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p239">So obviously you put a lot of thought into how to break the game. When you want to be a Warrior, use their abilities, and TEMPORARILY lose your spellbook. Then when its convient use the spellbook as a Hybrid. <br />
No, we aren't giving Knights a break on high DI mobs, it is Warriors SOLE role in the game, ie tanking high DI mobs. You wanted utility, thats why you chose the spellbook option. You lost SOME tanking ability. Thats the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u240"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p240">Five percent mitigation boost at the cost of mana makes someone a warrior how?....breaks the game how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">If you want 5% mitigation boost, go farm stuff. You don't even need to have the very best PoTime gear to tank these.<br />
<br />
It's hypocrisy to ask for an unbalancing 'balance' just because of single trial, that can be tanked just fine by top end hybrids, especialy since we are not even sure if we actually need to do them for the whole guild.<br />
<br />
If you need just 1 group to be flagged for those trials, then they are obviously too easy, and gimping DD was a mistake, and there is NO reason why a knight should even think of being able to tank them, it's a 'test of gear'.<br />
<br />
If you need to flag your whole guild for them, then they need to be made even easier, atm you can expect to spend an average 30 hours to get your flag, and you'll likely be spending another 30 helping other people, it's just too much, especialy considering it's 4+ hours session and that you need a balanced group, it's not like camping gimp quest items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u243"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p243">The main issue from a tank standpoint in ikkinz, is that the encounters are much much different than pop.  Pop encounters for the most part are fairly long duration fights.  By long i mean 7 mins for time inny..12ish for rz ect, where you are tanking the majority of the time non disc.  Ikkinz is pretty much straight up 1 1/2 to 3 min fights where disc makes warriors 10 times more desireable as mt for the trials.  The only encounter up to uqua that has lasted more than 3 mins has been diabolic destroyer, and thats just because i played the ds/control game as opposed to the zerg dps game.  2 clerics 1 war 1 bard 1 chanter 1 druid, and cranked the ds while controling adds.

<br />
Death's Peace was orginally SK only until necro's started whining about it.  Aside from the Aura, Torrent, Spear line, and Blood of Hate ALL SK's spells are watered down versions of Necro spells (ToInny anyone), or lower level necro spells.<br />
<br />
Doom,  Brael is a SK not one of those whining pally's.  <br />
<br />
You wanted utility, thats why you chose the spellbook option. <br />

Sorry I had to comment on this one also.  I didnt know shite about what class was supposed to do what when I started playing.  I picked a SK because it reminded me of D&amp;D anti-paladins, and while watching over my buddies shoulder I saw my first SK.  He was all in black armor and had a huge honking sword and looked absolutely KICKA$$!<br />
<br />
Thats why I picked a SK to play.  Not &quot;Utility&quot;, not &quot;god mode&quot;,, just to have fun.</div></div><hr />
