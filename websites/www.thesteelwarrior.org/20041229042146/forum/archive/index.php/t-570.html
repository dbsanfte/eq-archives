<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Below is the 2Box/wife computer's information from HP.  Now here is the situation.  It &quot;plays&quot; everquest.. but.. zoning times are HORRIBLE.. I mean from 5 minutes at the least to 15 minutes at times and logging on is a 20 minute ordeal.  I am actually a little puzzled since my main computer is only 800 MHZ and this one is 1.5 GHZ and my main one works flawlesly... now the reason for this post is.. I know I could just buy a crap load of RAM and a new video card and bam.. done... but is it really necessary?  I do not know.. hence my post.. <br />
<br />
Was wondering if someone could tell me here if its definitetly RAM/VIDEO CARD/RAM issue or 'maybe' the preloaded software?  if you guys's answer is simply.. get new video card and ram cause thats all the problem is.. then... which of those is top priority?  I am trying to spend the least amount of money to make it &quot;more playeable&quot;  Please any ideas?<br />
<br />
P.S.  I've had this computer for 2 years now.. I've used it to 2BOX but mainly to powerlevel friends while I was playing etc.. never have dared to use it on raids and such to zone cause I don't trust it... tried to get my wife to play and it was a failure due to the fact that if she died.. (which she learned to notmind too mluch)  she had to wait 5 minutes to the least just to start CR for herself..  so help would be greatly appreciated as I am in the military and might be going to a remote assignment (not with my wife) for a year... and if she could play EQ with me that would be great.<br />

Start there.  That's not enough.</div></div><hr />

I had this in my computer. I had zoneing issues along with lag like no other. I upgraded to a : GeForce 4 128 MB card. After installing it EQ runs a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RAM is definitely your problem,  get more, at least 256 MB, 512 if you can afford it.<br />
<br />
2 of my 3 computers have GF2's, zone times are not a problem.  It's your RAM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep ram, you're prolly running some of the new models too (another major ram hog) Get at least 512 if you want models on or the system will bog down bad anytime you think of zoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also defrag your hard drive once a month trust me that does wander's.. <br />
If your using dial up get rid of it and use DSl Cable<br />
One thing that also increased speed was in options you can have zones saved to HD for faster zone in, that takes up a bit of space but not that much.<br />
<br />
But 512 ram min, dsl/cable anything but dial up. and a better video card and you should be spanky</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lack of  RAM is probably your biggest hold up at the moment.<br />
<br />
Turning of Luclin Models<br />
<br />
Also if you run DSL or Cable in your EQ dir open up datarate.txt. If I remember right the number in there is 3 change that upwards with 9 being the max. This will also help with zone times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Gf2 64Mb and I have no probs with zoning. Once, one of my RAM sticks (was a 256mb one) kinda moved and was only using half of its total ram (so I was running at 128), the zoning difference was terrible (dont ask how a mem stick can use half of it's ram just cause it move *shrugs*). Anyway, I have 512 now, and like everyone said, its yours RAM, get 256 or 512 if you can and dont turn all Luclin models on, if you want, use yours, your wife's char ones, and a couple more like horses :)<br />
<br />
Also, if you notice a LOT of harddrive activity, its another sign of low memory :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As others have mentioned, RAM is your weakest link. When there isn't enough room in RAM to hold all of the texture and model info (and with 128, there isn't) then those textures and models have to be swapped out to the hard drive. I'm guessing the hard drive is also a bit slow too to get zone times as bad as you are getting. The easiest solution is to get another stick of RAM.<br />
<br />
Another thing to do is make sure you don't have a bunch of crap running in the background that is going to eat up RAM while you are running EQ. Close your antivirus software, messenger programs, etc. while running EQ.</div></div><hr />
