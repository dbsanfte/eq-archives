<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We are moving to a new house and getting DSL. We will have a bunch, like 8, comps spaced throughout the house. 3 downstairs, 1 in the game room, and 1 in each bedroom (4 bedrooms) the game room and bedrooms are all close to each other.<br />
<br />
My dad was thinking to use wires to connect the close comps (in the office) and wireless to connect all the rest.<br />
<br />
I remember there was some ups and downs to both, and it seems like wired connections was decided on the way to go, but I can't remember why. If anyone has any suggestions on how to connect those comps, please post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Went ta dis seminar once an it say dat ya gotta be careful o'da protocol an such fer security reason.  Is likes ifn ya no careful da wireless transmission can be broken inta easy by someone outside ya house.<br />
<br />
An example given was dat dis guy was wurkin on settin up sumpin fer local government.  Consultant dat was wit dem was able ta 'break inta' 7 local networks in da surroundin buildings cuz dey no were wurking wit right protocols.  Dey say da most vunerable ones were da types set up wit stuff most folks get at local computer stores.<br />
<br />
Dun ask me bout no protocols!  Jes memba ya gotta be cautious!  <br />
<br />
Dey also say sumpin bout da transmitter an how ya gotta position it so it it has least interferance an ifn not gotta do repeater stuff. Gotta figya out likes how many walls an such an type o'material an ifn dere any metal blah blah blah. Funniest thing da 'expert' say ta help someone is put aluminum foil in da back o'da transmitter so signals no escape.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. dat all m'knows bout it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on what the computers are going to be used for.. I also have both in my apartment, but only because I like to use my laptop anywhere in the place without worrying about cords..<br />
<br />
Wireless is only 10base speed, so if you are going to be doing any kind of data transfer, it sucks bigtime.. that, and like Azlana mentioned, if not secured properly, it can be a huge problem. Driving around Minneapolis one day with my laptop, I was able to pick free internet access provided unintentionally by people who did not secure their WAP's. Also have to take into consideration range - depends on what kind of walls your place has, etc..<br />
<br />
Let me know if you want any more info, kinda just wrote a brief thing here.. off to spend some time with the girly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Say the reception would be perfect, the protocols secured, and they would be used for a) gaming b) working from home* c) surfing. What are the advantages/disadvantages to Wired vs. Wireless?<br />
<br />
*word processing, email, surfing, faxes, etc.<br />
<br />
Btw shorty, when you said &quot;data transfer&quot; do you mean between the comps in the home or DLing stuff from KaZaA, etc.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Data Transfers refers to the size of your data link from computer/laptop to hub.  Im assuming you're getting a wireless router that acts as a hub right?<br />
<br />
Via RJ-45 or CAT-5 cable, the data speed can go up to 100 base.  Wireless max speed is only 10~11 base.  That means that Kazaa files will download slower thru the wireless than the wired computer.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion is to get a router that does both.  Linksys wireless routers run for about $70-$90 depending on where you are at.  They have 4 RJ-45 connectors and you can connect a ton of wireless devices.<br />
<br />
Wireless is great for if you have to move around a lot.  I used my laptop in my kitchen, tv room, and even bathroom (yuk).  If you go to college and you're college has a wireless internet system, you can use it almost anywhere.  Downside of wireless is that you have to buy a wireless ethernet card that costs a lot more than a regular Cat-/RJ-45 ethernet card.<br />
<br />
Anyways, try to get Cable Modem instead of DSL.  DSL uplink is only modem speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wanted Cable, but it's not provided in that area &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Also I heard that you can simply use the existing phone jacks in your house as a hub and get splitters to enable simultaneous phone/internet. That true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes but thats even slower than wireless.  Plus you gotta buy a while buncha hardware in order to do it.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to buy that one wireless/wire router from linksys (others make it) and connect ure DSL modem to it.  Its easy to configure for DSL and just split it whichever ways you want.<br />
<br />
You might have to buy a small hub for like $30 but that way u can split it to all 8 computers.  Try to use wires, its cheaper and faster.  If you want wireless it'll cost ya in speed and cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How much in speed? Doesn't sound like a big enough hit to effect EQ though, basically would only hurt when I am DLing large files from KaZaA or transferring between computers?<br />
<br />
Also, how do I set up the encryption code to prevent passerbys from being able to leach off my wireless?<br />
<br />
This is a stupid question, but how to the computers recieve the wireless signals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm wondering about this too. Someone in my house wants to go wireless, but will EQ run on it? Anyone here run eq on a wireless network? If so, how does it run?<br />
<br />
Would rather not go ld every 10 minutes or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have run EQ on wireless before.  You can run it and its all good and dandy.  Wireless is still about 5~10 times faster than 56k modem and people play at modem speed all the time.  The good thing about wireless is range and not needing an actual cable.  A good example is in your school courtyard in the middle of the field (if you're school has wireless lan).<br />
<br />
Download speeds arent too hot though.  You would need to buy a wireless card which will run you MORE than the freaking router.  Thats the main problem with wireless, the cards are expensive.<br />
<br />
Well Im assuming that you would only use wireless on a laptop (thus you can move around).  You would want to use it on a desktop if you dont want to run wires or drill holes, but 8 computers is gonna kill you money wise.<br />
<br />
You can connect hub/switches so that a cluster of computers can be connected vai cable and you only have to run one cable from the router to that switch.  For example, from your DSL modem to your router you would run a cable from the router to you're room of computers.  In that room you conect a Hub/switch that splits that internet conenction.<br />
<br />
As for price, routers run from $70~$100 depending on what kind.  8 port hubs run about $30~$40.  Wireless cards for PCMCIA laptop slots run $120~$140 EACH!  Thats where wireless is gonna kill you (esp with 8 computers).  Its cheaper to go cable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">baadan heres how we did it. in our house we have my comp in my room two downstairs and my dad's laptop<br />
<br />
we connected the back and front in the downstairs to wires going through the ceiling (this push out type stuff) then we used wireless for the other two. also when i get my lap top and my sis get there comp will get wireless for all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
What are some good wireless cards?<br />
<br />
I have Netgear ProSafe Wireless Firewall/Print Server Model FM 114P wired/wireless combo HUB. Any suggestions on a better one and cards to go with it appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My druid bot runs on a laptop through wireless.  Never have had any problems. My WAP &amp; wireless NIC are the D-Link Airplus variety, so I can get 20 mbps transfer rate compared to 10.  Its cool to go downstairs to the big TV while farmin :)</div></div><hr />
