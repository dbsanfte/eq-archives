New beta up to download. 2.8Gb. 1 day to go with their peer-to-peer patcher..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the stress-test 2 client and just dload a 20 meg patch afterwards. Torrents for that one seemed much faster for me then the blizzard homebrew version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing for a while.  I love the game, absolutely love it.  My devotion was cinched when I ran up a hill to Ironforge in the snow, noticed that the 7AM game time sun was shining off the snow like it often did for me in South Dakota (heh), I kicked up wisps of snow everywhere I went, and I left snowprints.   I think it's FUN, the world is exciting, the quests are engaging. <br />
<br />
I've felt this way with L2, FFXI, and CoH too, and quickly lost interest with all three...probably because my friends weren't playing.  But WoW has been so hyped for so long that my friends _are_ playing this game and it only adds to the fun factor for me. So far, in my measely 16 levels, I haven't seen much I don't like.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, I'm on Test 5, Central.  Look me up as Ravija or Muse.  It's a non-pvp server.  Even if I were ever interested in pvp I sure as shit don't wanna play it during open beta with all the bnet kiddies.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I'm having a lot of fun with the game.<br />
<br />
One concern I have is with grouping.  The players do so much DPS and the mobs have such low HP's that standard EQ grouping strategies don't really seem to apply.  Everyone tries to go all-out DPS, even the healers.  Because of this, the few times that I've grouped to finish some quest it's been a complete cluster fuck.  I expect this will improve as the game progresses and people learn their roles.<br />
<br />
One of the things I really like about this game is the quest system ... I can literally spend 100% of my time working on fun and interesting quests that actually advance my character.  At any one time you can have 20 quests added to your quest log, and there seems to be a decent level of overlap, i.e. you can work on a coupleof quests at a time.<br />
<br />
But ... because the game is so quest-centric, there really isn't much grouping that happens.  Unless you have a regular group of friends you play with, expect groups to stick together for 30 minutes or less.  As soon as someone accomplishes their quest objectives they leave.  This is different in an instanced dungeon of course, and then you can expect to be grouped with the same folks for a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
The devs recently introduced spell reagents, item durability, and a new death system that reduces item durability upon dying.  So far people really seem to hate it, myself included.  It will be interesting to see if it sticks around for very long.</div></div><hr />

You'll be grouping more once you level a bit higher. When you're low, the questing and random xp killing solo is quicker and easier for most people.<br />
<br />
Once they get higher and can't just overpower all the mobs, you'll find groups.<br />
<br />
I've heard the pvp aspect of the durability loss on death will be changed, i'm not sure about pve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm kinda disappointed that grouping isn't encouraged at any way in low levels, but I can get over that.  Don't plan on being low level very long anyway.</div></div><hr />

Anything i spent hours to get by quests or killing only to have it destroyed in the end is just wrong.  i cant imagine people in raids not wearing their best gear because they are  afraid of dying while wearing it.  Or taking aux gear with you wherever you go in case you dying you can just switch it out before dying.  I wont play WoW as long as this feature is around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From where I'm standing, item durability only looks like a penalty for being fucking retarded.<br />
<br />
You lose 1/10 of an items durability every time you die, they can be repaired easily in virtually any town for literally pocket change, and the item suffers no effects until it reaches 0. <br />
<br />
It's not hard to see that it's an additional death penalty, on top of the already very lax death penalty.  It's not a huge deal at all if you can keep from being a bumbling idiot and dying 45 times a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The items are not destroyed, they are just rendered unusable until they are fixed.  I thought I'd hate the item durability too, but so far I like the way the implemented it.  You do loose durability during combat and if you choose to have the spirit rezz you instead of running to your corpse you loose all durability.  That can get pretty harsh on the ol pocket book, but that seems to be how WoW penalizes ya instead of loosing exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Durability loss on PvP deaths has been eliminated as of yesterday/today I think, they went through patching all the servers.  Atm I can live with it in PvE just doing low level quests(21 shaman) but it's going to have to tweaked or something for raiding/instances where you're most likely going to die a lot.  I could see when learning raid encounters easily dying 10 times(100% durability hit), sucks to having to go to repair in the middle of a raid.  Only thing I've experienced so far that's really been a pain was when I died in a cave type area with respawn behind/on my corpse, dying two times trying to run back out of the cave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the death penalty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the death penalty?<br />
<br />
Well, the original death penalty was basically nothing.  You could run back to where you died from the nearest graveyard and you can self rez yourself for no real loss other than the time it took to run from the graveyard.  Then there's the spirit rez where you ask the NPC at the graveyard to rez you which previously would cause an exp hit but it wasn't too big of a deal if for some reason you really needed a spirit rez.  However these were the two original penalties now it's different.<br />
<br />
Now on deaths you take a 10% durability hit on everything you're wearing and that's in your current bags.  The spirit rez has changed from an exp hit to a 100% durability hit and I think some sort of rez sickness(I hardly ever use the spirit rez so I'm not sure, usually isn't necessary though)  Take into account when you do corpse runs you're in ghost form which means you can't see npcs and nothing attacks you.  Once you're near your corpse you'll be able to see where npc's are just so you can find a decent space to rez in without being attacked right away if possible.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoy the game a lot personally just there are still significant changes being done when it's supposed to be coming out in two weeks.  Paladins essentially got their whole playstyle changed around with the latest patch.  Take advantage of the open beta if you can get in(they're not giving out keys anymore atm but maybe later)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a dis on either the guilds or the game, just an interesting thing I noticed: but does anyone else find it ironic that FoH and AF left EQ to play WoW and now reports are that WoW is more casual?  Maybe they wanted more casual, or maybe they just needed something to fill their time; or maybe it isn't as casual as we think right now.</div></div><hr />
