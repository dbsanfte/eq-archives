<br />
And going there for the first time...soon.<br />
<br />
So what should a PoTac noob know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a Tier3 Zone.<br />
<br />
Which means that the average Valor group should survive easily.<br />
However if you go deeper in to tactics (take long stairways)<br />
You will get raped. 800+ Hitters, AE KB, AE Dispell,  Splits etc etc.<br />
<br />
Stay away from the Pit Area if u see 50+ people in the zone<br />
(usually they are doing RZTW and you dont want to agro RZTW)<br />
<br />
The zone in is safe, sometimes trash sees inviz.<br />
And it is not an LFG zone, it is a hunting zone (you go there with a group).<br />
<br />
There are 6 7 xp spots that people camp. Good xp <br />
Some rare Tradeskill stuff (BloodMetal Earrings).<br />
And nice loot off some named (some are BADASSES be warned)<br />
<br />
The zone feels like a cross between Kael / ToV / ST.<br />
I really like it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The average Valor group will be dead in 1 minute and will be waiting for their corpses to pop in the GY. Average Valor group to me means level 62 with a few AA. <br />
<br />
If you are going to hunt in Tactics you better be in a mostly 65 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tactics pre-65 will keep you on your toes....it's doable just don't be suprised when half your night is spent waiting in GY :D<br />
<br />
i started there at 63, and being at ToVN level with gear; i got beat down hard. but the exp came in so fast it was well worth it ( went to 65 there )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd say the adverage diaku does more damage than the typical BoT mob. not so much that they hit harder, but they land hits more often. also, some of them mitigate slows and have quite a few hp for a junk mob. if you're new to the zone DO NOT go near the elites, they quad in a heart beat and are designed for raid clearing. <br />
the adverage group can do the zone in area, above the pit, but there arent a whole lot of mobs so i doubt that area could support 2 full groups. if you do happen to brave the chance to go deeper in, you would need a high DPS group. the pit area would have lots of wandering mobs, almostt to the point that you dont have to pull. diaku, like i said earlier, have alot of HP and in the lower areas can be tightly packed. <br />
one more thing, if you happen to be in the lower area and you see a zone wide emote that says some like &quot;the grounds shakes.....&quot; you wnat to get against the wall ASAP.</div></div><hr />

You hear the pounding of hooves.</div></div><hr />

I've 2 boxed in both zones and roughly unslowed ogres = unslowed bot giant. I was able to kill either with about same mana left over.<br />
<br />
BTW Tactics was one of my fav zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone should experience at least one stampede in their EQ gaming life.   fun fun fun )  <br />
<br />
First time I heard the Changing of the Guard shout in HoH I was praying for something fun like the Tactics stampede.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tdog</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;You hear the pounding of hooves.&quot;<br />
HAHAHA first time i was in tactics hunting near the pigpen with aguild group.<br />
We hear the above and dont think anything about it and then we see Loading please wait. lol that was great trying to figure out what happen.<br />
<br />
I agree Faederya everyone should get to experience the stampede once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is the stampede zone wide or just in the one room?<br />
<br />
Never been to tactics here, can't ever find someone doing Behemoth to get flagged =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is the stampede zone wide  <br />
<br />
Well the /emote is zone wide but they only run a little bit of the area.<br />
<br />
The stampede runs from glykus area, out through the pit, back around near Overseerer, then back into glykus area.  The run pattern is like a square if you look at the map from glykus</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had access to Tactics for months, but never really went there more than once or twice other than or TZ/VZ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still have the hoof marks on my warrior's back from his first stampede experience.  We were fighting just outside the pit near the NW corner.  I had my back to the pit and the whole damn heard ran over me.  All I saw was read spam and then LOADING....  funny stuff.  :D<br />
<br />
I went back there to grind recently after doing other stuff for a couple months and found a group that was trying to call the stampeding piglet camped.  It ran right past my pit group, so we pulled it and killed.  They had a fit because we'd killed THEIR piggie.  Strange... in the dozens of times I'd hunted Tactics before, I'd never seen a group try to claim the piglet as camped.  They can camp right near where the stampede starts and thus have the first chance to pull it out of the herd, but all the times I've been there, that mob has been first group to aggro it out of the herd.  I tried to explain it to this group.  They were still pissed.  I gave up.  *shrug*  :p</div></div><hr />
