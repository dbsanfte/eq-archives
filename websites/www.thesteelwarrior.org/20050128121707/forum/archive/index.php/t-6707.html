5 years ago lucky people had fine steel weapons or pgt at your level and got by just fine, I think you will too.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

To answer the original question, if you've got something with a better ratio than a langseax, for 1h, and something exe axe or mith 2h quality or better for 2h, then you're fine for a long time.  At 37, ssoy's proc,  barnacle covered axe may proc around then(can't remember).  At 29, a couple of gnoll hide lariats are actually nice aggro and interrupt casters well (DPS is crap, but you'll probably hold aggro with them), of all the weapons I had way back in the day, they were the most fun. :)</div></div><hr />

Barnacle covered axe procs at 35.  Kunzar Ku'Juch procs darkness at 40.  The axe is probably the first decent true aggro weapon you will be able to get your hands on.  I can't think of anything else, in my 20's and early 30's I was using non-proc weapons like Centi SS and the Katana off the general (forget name).  Anything with a decent ratio is great in your 20's and 30's and then when you get in your mid 30's and 40's aggro weapons become more of a factor.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts exactly.<br />
<br />
When I started I had a PGT (given to me on the 2nd day of the server) I thought I was the shiznit. LOL I forget what my off hand was but I didn't get rid of it till 30 when I got my wak's.<br />
<br />
Yall remember when it took 2 weeks to gain 1 lvl hunting in Highpass? LOL<br />

IT WAS NOT A NERF IT WAS A  FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

I really don't think people know what a nerf really is these days</div></div><hr />

<br />
i still remember the dual SSoY's at level 48....Lammy's were like 20K each to buy in teh tunnel<br />
<br />
back on topic...eh, you're fine dude. just focus on levelling. once the toon hits 65 and you can't hold aggro than you can worry. have fun for now :D</div></div><hr />

IT WAS NOT A NERF IT WAS A  FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
The proc level tweak, or the overall recommended level damage fix?  Both made my baby BST cry, tho I agreed in principle.  I just wanted to finish leeching the big hits out of the bug first. (/whistles idly) Does anyone know if the non-proc aggro generated by a weapon reflects the full potential damage (the white number) of the thing, or the the potential damage of the weapon at the weilder's level (the red number)?<br />
<br />
At 29 ... I was weilding a Shimmering Partisan and um ... a Lamentation (or possibly still the Validus Costodius 1HS).  Holding aggro wasn't really an issue for me until 50+.  It was easier to hold over everyone else's spells or damage, and the consequences if I lost it were not too grim, most of the time.   Many times, the alts my alts group with seem to forget how gentle the game can be at the lower level, esp. with the toys available now.  You may just want to look for gear that gives you better damage ratios until you've levelled up to the Droga weapons, such as a Centi Short Sword, or a Lamentation.  I did weild a Barnacle Covered Axe and found it helped, and you may or may not find a Vampire Hunter's Stake (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45102) worth using ... they weren't around at the time for me to try, but they are pretty cheap in the bazaar.  I also used a Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=2745)  (and cheered when it procced the *first swing* after I dinged 35!) which I liked.  I was told then that it was premier aggro, tho I know now that other proc types are more effective.  Speaking of aggro proc types ... you could get yer hands on some Gnoll Hide Lariats (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5317) if you really feel the need for proc based aggro (but your DPS takes a huge hit).  Which should be cheap or trivial enough to get that you could test it out without any significant cost or effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but the warswords look soooooo damn cool! And the battlehammers are, eh. Least to me. I'm sure others' opinions will vary. <br />

A lot of weaps will be proccing for you then or very close to there. <br />
<br />
Then stop and catch your breath and see what your resources are, who your friends/guildies are, and what type of stuff you killing. <br />
<br />
And remember to keep your other weap skills up as you level :)</div></div><hr />
