Need a medium race (human illusion) high texture and a bmp to get a good look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gorkr Grk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">is that really a pic of the war epic?  Please tell me that's just a joke.  I'm not normally one to complain about looks, but damn.. that's pathetic...  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hm, concept is here in greater detail: http://everquest.station.sony.com/omensofwar/images/epics/WARRIOR_lrg.jpg<br />
<br />
The concept looks much...pointier, Maybe it's just his graphics settings. Judging from how close to the concept arts the other epics look, I'd be pretty disappointed if that's not just a settings issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Too small.  Looks like a GBoS.  Could definitely use a bigger pic tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yea, need a bigger picture of it please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">heh wow..what an....intimidating.....fearsome....awe-inspiring.....gorgeous....piece of shit looking weapon.<br />
<br />
oh, and wow....i just gotta say wow..i swear if that pic is true.....ya think SoE could have afforded a few more pixels? a_rusty_longsword06 looks better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Epic weapons should catch your attention when you see them.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't be able to pass a group of warriors and have to try and figure out about which one has an epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gorkr Grk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">WTF<br />
lol whatever.. <br />
I know as a warrior, I will be much better off with an extra 25cha.<br />
/giggle<br />
Still probably the best wep that I personally could obtain at this point, but I'm a little less than thrilled with it compared to the other classes.<br />
Oh well, it's not that difficult of a quest I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It'll probably glow orange in the 2.0 version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Wow...that truly sucks...very underwhelming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tarn Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think once a screen shot is taken of the epic on a medium sized character, or that char in an illusion potion, w/ higher graphic details, it'll turn out nicely.<br />
<br />
It's good to keep in mind that being a very short race really screws with the scale of weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Well, meh, I'd like to see another picture.<br />
<br />
I would hope that it's a bit heftier looking.<br />
<br />
But I like the concept art. Then again, I always liked the LoWs--simple, clean, sword-like. The trick is to get those qualities into a weapon that looks unique.<br />
<br />
without making it, you know, pink.<br />
<br />
Really though, I'd use a good weapon if it were shaped like a wok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well, given that short races weilding *any* of the other epics would still catch your eye, I'm tremendously dissapointed with our graphics.  Did they just run out of time and say &quot;Well, guess we'll just copy the Rusty Longsword graphic and throw a slightly-less-boring hilt on it&quot;?  C'mon SoE, people were complaining about the look even before OoW went live... you think you could make our epic look, well, epic?<br />
<br />
We'll probably get more &quot;What's that you're weilding?&quot; questions from our 1.0 epics than the new ones.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I would like to see it on a bigger warrior and with spell effects turned on (if the person on Prexus had them off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">If that's at all close to what it looks like at the best settings and shit, I'll weep.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yea, CHA on warrior gear is pretty scarce until Time.  The 25 CHA on the sword is nice to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Quick...set textures to high and get a skeleton illusion then take a new pic! Ogre or Troll will cover up to much of the hilt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ok, for sure our model looks like total ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I rather like the model for the warrior epic. I was always for the straight plain ol' looking sword over the incredibly fancy decorated looking weapons that would never be useful at all in any kind of real battle situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Well that's better.  If I looted that off of a mob I would probably say &quot;ooh, cool graphic&quot;, but it sure ain't the best looking epic.  It does look better on a DE than the halfling though, looks so tiny on him.  Hopefully the 2.0 will have a particle effect or something to make it a little flashier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Good, clean, functional looking weapon. Not the fanciest thing in the world, but sure beats the looks of a lot of GoD weaps. I could definately live with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I have a feeling that the sword is gonna look really good with the right particle effects.  I think a few of the epics are a little over-the top (SK) and this could look really good with the right particle effects.  Of course, I'll probably never own and epic 2, but oh well I'll be happy with the stats from the epic 1.5 and a mediocre looking sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">It looks rusty... would it have hurt to have some gems in the hilt? a silver blade and wooden grip?<br />
<br />
Jesus, it looks like they ran out of paint...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Tarn Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I like the simple design, color's could be a little more attractive I guess.<br />
<br />
The blade itself definately looks rusty. LOL.<br />
<br />
Looks like the Connan sword w/ the hilt though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Wtf, it looks tarnished. That hilt should be bling bling.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, that would be pretty cool.<br />

I don't like the SK sword much, it doesn't look like a sword, it looks like it's made of rock or something.  Ours looks like it could use some bronze polish on the hilt for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took a little while for the look of Innoruuk's Voice to grow on me, at least until I read through the storyline of the quest. Once I had, I realized that it would be out right wrong for it to look like a normal sword. It's not just a weapon, it's a living, thinking creature birthed of hatred and darkness. It really ought to do the sick, disturbing pulsing with hellish life thing that the growths on the walls in Doom 3 do, but EQ just can't support that~. Innoruuk's Voice being just another sword would have been really disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Grizraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I honestly *like* the look of the new War epic.  It's not gaudy, it looks antique.  It has style and class without being flashy.  You know if a sword's been around that long to look antique, it's gotta be well made.  So maybe it could use some polishing, but that doesn't detract for me at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Redmage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I think that the epic 1.0 is more visually appealing than the 1.5.  Wonder how long it took them to draw that one up?  ....I can see it now<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">It looks to me like a lot of people are seeing screenshots taken by people with video cards that don't support vertex / pixel shaders, or by people that haven't turned on those options. Dima's pic on the other hand looks like it does have those options on. So, that could make a difference looking at the actual weapon itself ingame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">at the end of the quest, i think the ogre mentions something about shining it up. it's probably not meant to look good until it's fully completed. if you look at the high res pics it looks like it's just dirty, with the dirt on the raised edges and corners worn away. if i had to guess, i'd say the full 2.0 will have a more polished look and have the fancy blue gemmed eyes in the concept art... or i could be giving the designers too much credit. guess we'll have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

SIR! Stop choking down that card, crank up the anti aliasing and anisotropic filtering!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">It is pretty believeable that the 1.5 epic may just be a simple &quot;hand-made&quot; weapon with no polish or special aspects of the weapon itself (Like it was thrown together).  Getting the 2.0 could include a better texture, plus nice particle effects, because the quest involves fine-tuning the weapon you just put together. (It seems to radiate the &quot;work-in-progress&quot; appeal)<br />
<br />
As for the size and everything, it looks to be about as big as other weapons (see the DBotW that many pictures show warriors dual-wielding with it).  Not counting textures, it does look to be a pretty solid weapon with a more royal warrior-type style to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">If it is intended that the 1.5 is a 'dirtier' version, and the quest to get the 2.0 involves 'cleaning up' the weapon, then I prefer the 'dirty' version.  Being a warrior I tend to get dirty.  No prissy looking weapons please, as a matter of fact, it would be better if there were entrails and eyeballs clinging to the 1.5   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">hopefully it looks a lot better.  youd think that since soe screwed us on the effects, theyd at least give us a weapon that looks ok.  but maybe therye just trying to get more people to play pallys...SOE = EVIL</div></div><hr />

<br />
..I don't post much, but after my initial reaction of &quot;this thing sucks&quot;, it sort of begins to grow on me. I still think its ugly..but its not as bad as I first thought.<br />
I'd suggest to make it a bit larger, make the sword tip pointy, not looking like a frickin stick on a rusty hilt and revamp the texture to improve quality. Work the coloring a bit. Give it some polishing..I didn't run all over, dealing with snobby elves and shizo dwarves  to wield a rusty broadsword with a fancy hilt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">This is how the heartwood blade was made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jim how is the ranger epic coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, how does &quot;Heartwood bow&quot; strike you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim you DUMBASS don't you check your email? we are giving them a blade now you dumbass.... god what a dumbass this goes live in a week.. dumbass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up already, easy fix! *backspace**backspace**clicktyclack*..... see? heartwood blade! all we have to do is go back thru the item database and delete the &quot;ow&quot; and paste &quot;lade&quot; on the end&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the ranger epic went live, and the bow hating rangers that live soly on the private dev boards (when the devs say ALL rangers wanted a sword and not a bow) happily proclaimed that a bow was never the intent, or was just an idea that they were kidding about... and all was golden in the lands....<br />
<br />
Until a ranger had an enchanter cast the identfiy spell on the wood and metal used in the epic and the lore said<br />
<br />
&quot;a fine metal that can be shaped to make an almost invisible bowstring&quot; the now useless heartwood the tree ent gives is even more proof... still sony insists they did not just throw in the sword.<br />
<br />
*laughs* oh well, up to the rangers to fight their battles with sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">this is how they designed our epic:<br />
<br />
1. soe hands a monkey a pencil and some paper<br />
2. soe takes back the paper after an hour<br />
3. they give it a name and make it live<br />
<br />
its simple and it involves no thinking on the part of soe...except the people in the so called 'customer support' area, they have to think of ways to dodge complaints by the warriors...</div></div><hr />

I just bought the OoW box; and there's a pic of our epic inside.<br />
<br />
<br />
Know what? It looks pretty f**king nice ( for those who don't have the box )<br />
<br />
There's even a Barb chick on the inside of the cover wielding the Warr EPic...Know what? It looks pretty f**king nice.<br />
<br />
Dunno what happened with it though. In Game it looks like total ass. They gotta go buy some Flitz! or something. It looks like they let the sword sit in a tub of salt water for a year.</div></div><hr />

It is very interesting to see how the EQ modelers interpreted the concept art ^_^ I myself have been working on my own versions of the weapons since i found out about the concept designs, and seeing this other interpretation of the designs is intensely interesting ^_^<br />

i hope to see even more, and even better pics of all the new weapons ~_^<br />
