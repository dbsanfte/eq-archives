<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My update (I hate those posts where they dont tell you what happened):<br />
<br />
Vindi dead to 19 people, avg. level 58. Only had two cleric mains and one alt. Clerics were 65, 56, 51 :)<br />
<br />
I died at 60% (fizzle and 2 second lag on re-cast) and the SA jumped right in, everyone used their heads and he tanked him through enrage till dead.<br />
<br />
The only people who died were me and the bard :)<br />
<br />
The fight ended with the 51 cleric completely OOM.<br />
<br />
/sigh proud of my little guild. Our Guildleader (the SA) did an absolutely killer job. He never lost agro when I died and not a single other person even got hit when he popped AET and waded in. Great spam heals, great job of laying off during agro switch, rampage tank never even got close to dying.<br />
<br />
I love my guildies. They may not be the most uber people I know, but they play smarter and better than 90% of the uber people I know hehe.<br />
<br />
p.s. was first attempt for 90% of the raid. <br />
<br />
Oh yah, wearing his boots now /grin.<br />
<br />
_______________________________________<br />
<br />
(PS THIS HAS TO DO WITH MY STATS AND AA'S MORE THAN VINDICATOR :)<br />
<br />
Trying to do some math here...<br />
<br />
I was level 60 and I had no AA's (maybe run 3 regen 3)<br />
<br />
I had about 6300 hps. We had around 35-40 people and killed him in under 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
I am now level 65 and I have about 37 AA's. I have around 7325 hps fully buffed. (the virtue way, not Kazaad+Po9)<br />
<br />
Among those AA's for defense I currently have:<br />
<br />
CS 1<br />
CA 2<br />
PE<br />
<br />
I would expect to get at least CS 2 before I fight him again.<br />
<br />
Now for the question:<br />
<br />
If I tried to kill him this time with just the following group, would I win? (I want to do this with my itty bitty group of guild only friends)<br />
<br />
62 Ench with DC pet (40 AA)<br />
60 Ranger no AM, no EQ<br />
60 Warrior (6 AA?)<br />
60 SK (10 AA)<br />
62 Mage (3 AA)<br />
60 Shaman (6 AA)<br />
60 Warrior (Few AA)<br />
60 Cleric (Few AA)<br />
56 Cleric (No AA) or he could play 61 Druid (100 AA)<br />
62 Druid<br />
59 Shaman<br />
52 Bard/52 Cleric/58 Mage<br />
56 Beastlord<br />
54 Beastlord<br />
<br />
I could stack at minimum 45 pt Mage DS + 30 pt Shaman Potion DS (not sure if bard could attend)<br />
<br />
My Math says that I have the following problems:<br />
<br />
A) Too short of clerics.<br />
<br />
B) Going to be under 150k damage before defensive wears out.<br />
<br />
C) Lack of high bard DS hurts DPS a bunch. Lack of manasong hurts Cleric Rotation a bunch.<br />
<br />
D) I lose the 100 AA druid because he is one of only people with a cleric. (No SotW or AA DS, no crit nukes, etc...Dont think he can keep up in Cheal Chain either)<br />
<br />
Am I missing anything? Other than just keeping all of us levelling and getting better equip/DPS, is there anything you can think of to try and make this possible? (besides two more clerics - I dont think they are going to pop out of the woodwork)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for reading this whole thing. Would love to hear what you guys think. I can always get PD to bump that up to 7625 over the next 9 AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, it aint gonna happen with the group you listed...healers mana pools are too low and you have a serious lack of dps.  I seriously doubt you'd get him to 50% with that group.  <br />
Below level 60 (which a decent portion of people you list are) there just isnt much access (unless you're majorly twinked) to high mana/ft items for casters and high dps weapons for the melees, which would be needed to do Vindi with a smallish group.  AA's can help in this regard, but no one except the druid has any to speak of.<br />
For a group that size to do Vindi, I'd reccomend leveling/gearing up and see where you stand in a few months.<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's my 2cp.  Good luck getting him eventually...he's worth the wait.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt you could win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why = I want to do this with my guild alone. :)<br />
<br />
Last time I killed him with our alliance and it was really darn easy. Killing him with just the people I have been guilded with for 2 years would be really special.<br />
<br />
I kinda left them out to dry when I started leading PoP pickup raids. They were all level 50ish and I was out killing Aerin Dar, Rydda, Grummus, Behemoth, etc...<br />
<br />
Killing him and watching the BP or boots go to someone who has been your friend for 2 years, only plays on a limited basis, and is not part of a raiding guild will be really worthwhile.<br />
<br />
That is my guild right there. There isn't anyone else. Just wondering how far everyone thought I was off. Was also wondering how much you all thought the extra 1000 hps and Defensive AA's could help my situation from the last time.<br />
<br />
Here's another question. I have three group spots left. What three level 65 people (friends maybe) would you plug in to help Kill Vindi if you could?<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
<br />
Oh yah, my math was ...<br />
<br />
50 DPS from each melee and caster (average, some higher, some lower) plus 100 DPS from hasted DC pet, plus 2 hits from Vindi a second on Damage shield = 180 DPS<br />
<br />
So I was thinking somewhere along the lines of 450 DPS from Melee, 100 DPS from Pet, 180 DPS from Damage Shield.<br />
<br />
Take that number times 180 seconds = 131,400 damage. Obviously short of Vindi Hps, but that leaves him around 35% health when Defensive wears off.<br />
<br />
(I understand that means people cant wait to engage, etc, etc...but I think it is getting close.<br />
<br />
Just adding 100 more DPS on Damage Shield (65 Bard Puretone), a 100 DPS rogue and an extra cleric would be around 167,000 damage total and a nice dent in Vindi's health.<br />
<br />
I guess I was just looking for some more mathematical discussion of how far off I was. I understand all the issues regarding Vindicator, just would like to know what type of time frame till I actually do this with my friends.<br />
<br />
My sister and her BF have a retired 65 cleric and 65 SK. Maybe I could convince them to come out of the woodwork :)</div></div><hr />

You need at least 2 more clerics, otherwise you are going to run out of healing power. You also need 2 more DPS people to insure he dies in 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Maybe 2 clerics and one of the following -<br />
AM3 EQ ranger with an uber bow<br />
another DC chanter<br />
wiz/rogue/mage/monk with a lot of AAs and really good gear<br />
<br />
Naturally I would recommend wizards since my main is one, but keep in mind that wizards do get an unresistable 2000 DD that works wonders against Vindi. Last time I went on a Vindi kill I pumped him with 42k total damage (16 casts, 5 crits). Vindi died just after defensive wore off on a 12 man kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now THAT is what I am looking for :) Everything is possible somehow. Just looking to keep myself and everyone motivated.<br />
<br />
Digging out the SK and Cleric and Getting the GAR to AM3 as well as having the level 50's at 60 might get me closer.<br />
<br />
We do have one Wizard alt in the guild. I have done the GB quest before, it's pretty darn easy. I think I could rep the 59 shaman with the wizard.<br />
<br />
I have a DC pet chanter alt someone could easily two box.<br />
<br />
Only one way to know for sure of course :) It's not like I am going to blow the spawn...<br />

If I had to pick 3 I would pick a 10k hp warrior and 2 6k mana clerics.  Do you have those available?  Probably not.  Of the level of play you're talking ? (Mid 60s non-raiding at the best)  Probably go for more DC Enchanters or a Rogue with a Tunare dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for log man. I read every piece of it.<br />
<br />
Couple quick comments/questions...<br />
<br />
1. No Bard / Shaman potion handy right? 46 pts was Druid+CoR? Can you use Mark of Karn/Redemption on Vindicator btw? Don't mean this in a mean way, but 120 DPS from the potion and one Bard DS would have killed him off during defensive most likely :)<br />
<br />
2. I never saw a cripple message?<br />
<br />
3. You said you got to 130 hps of 7900? Does this mean you had 530 hps left at one point? I couldn't find that full 7500 pt heal anywhere...NM I found it hehe 7266 heal. Lol nice :) You even turned off attack to avoid ripostes hehehe.<br />
<br />
4. Seems like ID 5 and CS 3 CA 3 LR1 = Derakor around 315ish average hit...and it seems like the estimate of 4 hits every 2 seconds is fairly constant. Anyone know how this scales? If I am around CS 2 CA 2 no ID, is there a number I should be working with? 350? 380?<br />
<br />
Responding to Mourning, I know people all the way up to the PoTime guild on the server, but you are right I was talking more maybe someone around that level. <br />
<br />
Bringing in a couple ubers wasn't really what I had planned on. If there was a family member of a guildie or a good friend, I might include them if I got too impatient hehe :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the log, it was very instructive.<br />

We had only three clerics there (two 65s and one 62) with a small ammount of FT items.  For DPS we had rangers, and a Bst, two or three warriors.  Really the real secret to doing Vindi is the healers mana pool, and making sure you have his back to everyone except the MT to cut  down on riposte damage outside of the MT.  If you have a way of getting the bodies afterwards, I would make a go of it anyway.  That way when/if you fail you can see more clearly what you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on;y thing though Jakle is that the 11 others with Wandor ( if they're his guildmates ) are pretty much the top_end of the server types.<br />
<br />
i ain't stoppin ya though; more powA to you :D just adding a bit of depth to wandor's explination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worst thing that can happen is you wipe out, do the CR, and go on your way.  Can't hurt to give it a shot, but I agree that both DPS and healer mana are probably too low to be successful.<br />
<br />
With the three extra slots, if you can get level 65s with good gear, I'd add one cleric and 2 wiz/rog (any combination of the two).  With that added to the mix I'd think you might be able to pull it off.  Would be a fun attempt anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did vindi one time with 15.  We had tank, a druid, couple shamans, 4 65 clerics with 4k+ mana pools, Necro for pumping, ranger for DPS, and some charmed mobs (two), I forget who else was there.<br />
<br />
Stack as much DS as you can, use your healers to your best advantage, and if you have any AM rangers, center Vindi, don't pin him.  With level 65, he's a complete puss to tank.  Add in the AAs and he should be gravy, just have a couple of differnt CH rotations ready incase it goes better or worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was about to say why not get some necros to pump mana to your healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably because a necro can contribute far more to the raid with his 400 mana than your cleric can do with 150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to your questions...<br />
<br />
1. No Bard / Shaman potion handy right? 46 pts was Druid+CoR? Can you use Mark of Karn/Redemption on Vindicator btw?<br />
<br />
<br />
Didn't have a bard with us, and by the time I remembered the ds setup I had tagged Vindi and he was inc ;p.  Didn't bother with MoK because the only 2 clerics there were busy keepin me on my feet.  I believe it will still land if you try, but you're probably better off with having your clerics concentrate on keepin you alive vs trying to land a reverse ds.....if you're doing this with a small group.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. I never saw a cripple message?<br />
<br />
Nope, didn't cripple him.  We had one shaman and one enchanter there, the shaman was being botted by me for buff purposes only, and the enchanter was being botted by the main cleric.  The best you can hope for with cripple on Vindi though is possibly slightly lowering his attack/rampages.  If you can cripple him, do it...every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. You said you got to 130 hps of 7900? Does this mean you had 530 hps left at one point? I couldn't find that full 7500 pt heal anywhere...NM I found it hehe 7266 heal. Lol nice  You even turned off attack to avoid ripostes hehehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I was closer to 7800 then 7900, but I can't remember if I used Bo9/Kazad or just Virtue.  Reason you didn't see a 7400+ heal is because the druid spot healing saved me arse just before that ch landed.  Turning off attack to avoid ripostes when waiting for a heal to land is something I learned to do real early in the game.  Mobs not gonna go anywher cause I've pissed it off quite a bit in the first place...plus I have low hp aggro.  As soon as the ch lands I usually hit taunt/slam turn attack back on.  I don't know how many times doin that has saved my arse....though it would be nice to never have to do that :p<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Seems like ID 5 and CS 3 CA 3 LR1 = Derakor around 315ish average hit...and it seems like the estimate of 4 hits every 2 seconds is fairly constant. Anyone know how this scales? If I am around CS 2 CA 2 no ID, is there a number I should be working with? 350? 380?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also need to count in your ac in this equation vs mine at 1440.  What I would assume though going into the fight is that he's going to pull more damage on you then me.  Vindi's dps for that fight was 418...I'd assume closer to 500 for you.  Probably an average hit of around 370 and assume you're going to take 5 hits per 2 seconds instead of 4 (LR+CS3).  But, you'll never know till you go do it :).<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya, the fight is a blast...still isn't old to me :).</div></div><hr />

Worst case you justy get an SoS rogue or a necro/SK to get your corpses. Vindi is a single group fight for the well equiped these days, there is no reason 3 groups of people can do this as long as you have the important bases covered.<br />
<br />
You have more than enough HP to tank Vindi, you just lack DPS and healing power. Vindi only has 150khp so DPS will be easy to find. Get your ranger some AAs and a good arrow/bow combo. Get 1 wiz/mage/ench/rogue/monk who is high end geared and they will be good for well over 100 DPS. The DPS thing is pretty easy to take care of.<br />
<br />
The healing problem is a little worse because you don't have the luxury of a 10k tank, but 2 well equiped clerics are enough to get you by. I am not even talking elem plane equiped, just decent gear is good enough. Find a couple of 4kmana ft4+ clerics to help out and you should be golden.<br />
<br />
Good luck, once you get Vindi down maybe it will motivate the rest of your buddies to level up!</div></div><hr />

My guild routinly does AOW with 8 clerics, 2 groups or 4 clerics and 2 necros. The necros mind rack and feed the cleric. A necro here to effectivly bump up the clerics mana pool helps a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
62 Ench with DC pet (40 AA)<br />
60 Ranger no AM, no EQ<br />
60 Warrior (6 AA?)<br />
60 SK (10 AA)<br />
62 Mage (3 AA)<br />
60 Shaman (6 AA)<br />
60 Warrior (Few AA)<br />
60 Cleric (Few AA)<br />
56 Cleric (No AA) or he could play 61 Druid (100 AA)<br />
62 Druid<br />
59 Shaman<br />
52 Bard/52 Cleric/58 Mage<br />
56 Beastlord<br />
54 Beastlord <br />
<br />
The BST and Bard are too low to put out any DPS (remebr Vindi is 70), so your looking at putting out 150k damage using a DC pet, Ranger, SK, Mage, adn another warrior.<br />
<br />
My guild does him with 18 people; 2 BST, 2 rogues, 2 rangers, 3 druids, 3 clerics, one shaman, one enchanter.  Rest is fluff.  Sure those people can kill him, he's a melee mob only, so just keep MT alive and don't run outta mana and you can take all day to widdle his histpoints.  I would suggest traiding out the BST's for 2 60+ rogues and getting a 62+ lvl shaman (or 65 BST) for buffs.  Make sure the mage uses water pet (they backstab).  Enchanter can chain Rune MT.  Worse case just run back and res and try again.  No harm done if failed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My update (I hate those posts where they dont tell you what happened):<br />
<br />
Vindi dead to 19 people, avg. level 58. Only had two cleric mains and one alt. Clerics were 65, 56, 51 <br />
<br />
I died at 60% (fizzle and 2 second lag on re-cast) and the SA jumped right in, everyone used their heads and he tanked him through enrage till dead.<br />
<br />
The only people who died were me and the bard <br />
<br />
The fight ended with the 51 cleric completely OOM.<br />
<br />
/sigh proud of my little guild. Our Guildleader (the SA) did an absolutely killer job. He never lost agro when I died and not a single other person even got hit when he popped AET and waded in. Great spam heals, great job of laying off during agro switch, rampage tank never even got close to dying.<br />
<br />
I love my guildies. They may not be the most uber people I know, but they play smarter and better than 90% of the uber people I know hehe.<br />
<br />
p.s. was first attempt for 90% of the raid. <br />
<br />
Oh yah, wearing his boots now /grin.<br />
