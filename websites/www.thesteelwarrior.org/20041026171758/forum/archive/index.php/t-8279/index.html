<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vendak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night on our 2nd attempt with this script we ran into some issues with the scripted adds.  That being that a Henden Shadow Master showed up (I'm 100% sure it was NOT a repop in our area) and fluxed an enchanter into AE Ramp range.  I think maybe 1 or 2 other &quot;normal&quot; trash mobs were in the mix too.  This many &quot;extra&quot; adds at this point in the script gave us a lot of problems especially when we only have 2-3 enchanters that regularly play.<br />
<br />
When we do Fake RZ we do him in the South East corner of the whole hallway system.  Let's see if I can't get this to work visually...<br />
<br />
<br />
      | to rz |<br />
      |*     *|<br />

   *          |<br />
&lt;-TZ         *|<br />
___*_________X|<br />
<br />
Hopefully that is somewhat readable.  The *'s being the 5 trash pops in that area.  The X being where we place RZ.  And I tried to explain where that corner is in the map, TZ pops about 30 feet West when he spawns from there.  Just north is where Decorin Grunhork pops.<br />
<br />
We station what ENCs we have and SHMs we have evenly on the North and West part of that corner to help malo/mez adds.  Those 5 are the only trash mobs we clear however.  Do we need to clear more? Is it just part of the script? I thought we only got non-caster Decorins as adds during this which is why I ask.  Then again I did RZ a long while ago.  I heard some people kite the adds.  I can see kiting the Northbound adds, but with a lot of trouble.  Just doesn't seem viable.  But anyways, any help with what went wrong and any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The way I've seen it done on raids I've been on is pin RZ (fake) in the SE corner of his room, not in the hallway outside his room. I do recall getting lots of adds of all types (not respawn, but just popping while we fought), but we had about 8 chanters on the raid so it wasn't much of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we position fake rallos in hall as well. i think anything but decorins would be repops, and decorns are part of the fake RZ fight. i played a chanter recently on an RZ raid because the guild doing it was backflagging one of our members and they needed more charm dps and the decorins during fake RZ werent hard to lock down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cronos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm positive that the last few times we did fake rallos some of the adds did gflux/debuff (not sure bout name, might have been Hendins tho)<br />
and very hard to control for bards/enchanters due to resists<br />
due to that and the lack of those classes, we now use warriors to take care of the adds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iyacc@work</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We were having issues with lots of adds during fake RZ part, so we started clearing back further down the hall where TZ charges from. Keeps them from adding in when the Decorins spawn during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vendak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea I figured out the solution.  We had to clear the next two ogres West of us.  I believe the explination for this is just that the ogres form RZ's script have a huge ass agro range, and &quot;agro&quot; when they spawn far down the hall, causing those 2 to come with them if they're up.  We killed those 2 prior to RZ pull (7 trash total cleared) and the RZ kill was very smooth.</div></div><hr />
