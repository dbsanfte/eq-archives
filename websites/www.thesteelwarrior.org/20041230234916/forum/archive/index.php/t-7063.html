<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering whether it's worth it to get weapon affinity 5, would anyone with the aa care to help out? I know ideal is having WA5, but the 8 and 10 aa costs for the last 2 levels are a bit harsh. Does spending 12 aa for just the first 3 levels of it make a large enough difference to justify getting them before ca3/cs3?<br />
<br />
I currently have all my hp aas and cs2, and am trying to figure out where to put my next 12 hard-earned points. What's the proc increase from WA3 like, is it a noticeable enough difference to make procs reliable inside the first 10 sec of combat, where they really matter the most?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With your weapons you should be able to keep agro in most situations. Go defensive AAs. WA3 = 30% more procs for 12 AAs, WA5 = more 20% for 18AAs.<br />
<br />
You probably even want to max CA before going for WA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd probably get CA1, WA1, then back to defensive AAs in your situation. 10% more procs for 2 AAs is a heck of a good deal. I'd be iffy about getting even WA3 before finishing your defensive AAs though.<br />
<br />
 Frankly, if you're worried about your aggro you should ditch that SBoD and pick up something with a proc. Also, the more procs you have the more WA helps. Right now, WA5 would increase your procs from ~2 per minute to ~3 per minute. With a second proccing weapon offhand, it'd be from ~3 to ~4.5 with WA5 and if you augment both with even anger 2 you'd be going from ~6 to ~ 9.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, yeah, but he hasn't finished his defensive AAs. Are you suggesting it over CA1 and the other various mitigation/evasion AAs?</div></div><hr />

No, get all your defensive AA's before any more offensive AA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you find yourself losing aggro a lot, having the wizard ditches the group when you join, finish WA.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself dying a lot, or having clerics ditch the group when you join, or having constant med breaks while exp'ing, get more defensive.<br />
<br />
No one can tell you which is more important but yourself (or maybe your groupmates).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am surprised by many of the robotic responses I see above.<br />
<br />
The only thing we do well is to take a beating.  We do it well with 0 AA, 100AA, or more.  The poster can probably not tank Grummus. But how often is he likely to be called upon to do so?  He is already fully functional in any Tier2 exp group.  So, saddle him with 60 more VERY incremental AAs before getting something that will improve his toon at a fundamental level? No way!<br />
<br />
I'd say, go for a few levels of WA (season to taste) and let the clerics worry about the heals.  The sooner he gets aggro, the sooner the Slow can land, and the happier everyone will be.  And when he's in a position to get aggro when he doesn't want it, he can use a WMBS.<br />
<br />
All warriors can take a beating.  Being known as a warrior that can also hold aggro will get you onto peoples' friends lists.<br />
<br />
I think that weapon affinity may in fact be one of the most important AAs there is. I believe this is SoE's adjustment to the aggro being poured out by Pallys.</div></div><hr />

The RNG is fickle, even with WA5 and DBotW+BF and all the augs and imbues with 305 dex you can still go a minute without a proc.<br />
<br />
As for your particular situation, I would sell that pile of crap ranger weapon and get one of the droga weapons in its place. Use the plats to buy some upgrades. I would get WA1, then CS3. From there I would start working on LR/ID. When you get tired of those, toss in WA2, then go back and finish both up. I would not go for WA3 or Sturd2 before finishing LR/ID. Oh yeah, get AET somewhere in there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you already have a BoC, I would think that your agro is fine and that you should do the defensive aas first.  Getting an anger 3 aug for that BoC will help you a lot more than WA5 will.  An anger 3 aug is ~100% more procs from your mainhand while WA5 is only 50% more procs.  Of course they stack and you will want to get anger 3 augs + WA5 eventually, but for now get CA/CS/ID and LR maxed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would say WA1 is extremely efficient. But it isn;t if you have only 1 proc.<br />
<br />
I would sell the split blade, get a copper hammer or sword of the bloodsworn. IF you have a boc and one of those it will be much nicer. Then pick up wa1 and maybe wa 2.<br />
<br />
I would try to do as many ldons as possible. Save up the points and throw anger3 on the Boc. If you are still useing chos/sotbs throw a yak proc from guk on it. <br />
<br />
But meanwhile lightning reflexes is fucking awesome. Same with innate defense. I would suggest doing all of both before getting to wa3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answer this question and you will know whether or not to keep going in WA.  Do you fight very hard to get and maintain aggro?  If you do you may consider putting more AA;s into it.  But read further before you do.<br />
<br />
Although I would agree with a couple of the posters here.  Sell that piece of crap in your offhand for as much PP as you can get to someone who likes the shiny stats it has.  I used that weapon for a while and while it is good DPS it is not good for aggro.  It is a cruel joke, awesome tanking stats, lousy aggro.<br />
<br />
Now buy a Copper Hammer of Striking or camp one if Haass isn't there still.  The offhand procing weapon will add the same number of procs as going from 0-WA5 with your current setup, ie 1 proc per minute roughly.  If you buy the offhander I would skip the WA for now.  I would however grind out enough LDON's to buy Anger III for your BoC (or at the very least, a Ykesha one).  While you are doing this you will be able to get more defensive AA's so you will live through the aggro you will have.<br />

<br />
I just maxed ID (as you can see in my magelo) do I go for sturdiness 1 next or WA1 or something completely different?<br />
<br />
Also please don't ask why I have the stupid Ingenuity AA - I got bored once and being a girl went on an aa spending spree  - have learnt to quell the frivolity now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just maxed ID (as you can see in my magelo) do I go for sturdiness 1 next or WA1 or something completely different?I am a big fan of getting the best bang for your buck. I would alternate between WA and Sturd, just get the once that cost the least to buy next. I would also recommend stopping at Sturd3 and getting some offensive AAs. The last 2 levels of Sturd are not very cost effective, save those for when you run out of resist AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everyone ;)<br />
<br />
Don't mind my magelo atm as I was screwing around with it (putting in lvl 58 &amp; all to see what I'd be like), but I did sell the split blade already and am getting real close to getting anger II augs in miragul. Gonna aug both my weapons and go with it for now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for dissuading me from blowing aa on WA before I finished my defensive ones, as I don't really have agro problems unless grouped with certain chanters (hey, look, warrior tank! let me tash, cripple, slow, all while the mob is still running to camp!). I will instead get defensive ones first and then, if I ever have spare aa, I'll get some WA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think that Weapons Affinity is one of our very best AAs and i absolutely love it and think its a steal for the amount of points it costs. but dont take aggro if you cant take hits, defensive AAs are generally more helpful but once those are done i recommend getting WA5 ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last 2 levels of Sturd are not very cost effective, save those for when you run out of resist AAs.<br />
<br />
I have sturd 3 now and I've held off going for 4 and 5 so far because of the extreme cost.  On the other hand, do I read you right?  Get your resist AAs before you get sturd 4 and 5?  I know the 16 and 20 cost isn't very effective, but neither are adding a few more points in resists and at least the sturdiness will help all the time, not just against AEs (spells too, but few mobs have spells that make much impact and can't be easily worked around).    15 AA for 30 magic resist, or any of the other resist types?  Nah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you have to deal with Time+ AEs/procs resists are indeed that important. When resists have -350 checks, or the new avg/lowest resist checks (I forget the names of those) then having 500s across the board is not enough. Sure, you can really pump up your resists with various potions, buffs, bard songs, but all of those take up valuable buff slots. The higher your resists are, the better. Of course, if you are not tanking anything with insane AEs, then you would probably be better off with Sturd 3/4. Keep in mind that tanks that are dealing with these types of AEs generally have 10khp+ so getting another 200hp is a smaller drop in the bucket than getting 30 more points in your resists.</div></div><hr />
