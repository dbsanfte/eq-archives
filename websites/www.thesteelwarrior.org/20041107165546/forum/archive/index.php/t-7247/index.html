<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well maybe not quite broken it, but missiosn of our level are just not challenging most of the time. Now granted we probably have an amazing level of team work for an on line game as we have gamed together IRL for 5+ years, but there is nothing that subtle that most groups can't do it.<br />
<br />
We have the most stripped down group you can have: Tanker (invul/SS), and 2 blasters (ar/dev and me, fire/fire). Now that we are 21st (and this has been true for a while) the tankers agro is good enough to hold mobs in my Rain of Fire without caltrops. In fact as often as not we are fighting in front of the caltrops as we are behind them (the do make a handy place to retreat). <br />
<br />
We have added some other classes to our core group: controlers and scrappers. From what we could tell, they added little or nothing to our group. Admitedly we have the tactical subtilty of a punch in the nose, but it works well. Excedingly well. <br />
<br />
Even cons don't stand a chance. Same level bosses don't stand a chance. Heck we did some pulls in Talos Island where the minons were orange, the lts red and the bosses purple. <br />
<br />
Which has made me realize something--I miss EQ because it was hard.  I admit some of design dicisions for making EQ hard were not player friendly--but I do want to be challenged by a game. <br />
<br />
A nice fix to see in COH would be a way to set mission difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I would say most content in EQ wouldn't stand up well to the kind of teamwork you describe.  What EQ typically does to challenge people is to pour on the damage until the players just can't deal with it any more, then require them to go farm a gazillion pieces of gear until they can.  Once properly geared, the content goes back to being relatively trivial.  If you can't get the gear for whatever reason, you are blocked.  And they make sure the gear is a serious PITA to get.<br />
<br />
Have you considered trying task force missions?  My understanding is that they're a step up in difficulty from normal missions.  And my limited experience with them is that they're missions with a Perez park flavor, rather than going up against a group of 2 to 6 NPCs, they come in groups of 6 to 12 or more.  Much harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also the Task Force Mission are a series of mission and usually ends with battling an ArchVillan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did Positrons TF until he was supposed to hand us off to synapse. Which was bugged. We ripped though those missions just about as easily as any others.<br />
<br />
If they were harder, I don't think any of us noticed.<br />
<br />
I think, more of what I was saying, is that in missions at least, its nearly impossible to die. You almost have to work at overpulling and have about 0 chance of getting anything that is above your level. <br />
<br />
EQ we would certainly get our asses handed to us. No healing :-p. But I have not run into something like LG (in the first year) were there was danger. Its more like LDoNing without an option for hard. (Then again I never tried a hard...)<br />
<br />
I do think there is a gap in content for EQ from 65 regular to 65 uber--that LDoN does not address. And I really felt cheated by GoD (which is basically when I quit). The guild I ended up in was not going anywhere content wise, there weren't too many others I was intersted in applying to, and from what I understood there was really no 1 group content that was harder than LDoN easy and easier than GOD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've managed to die a couple of times, mostly because I didn't run soon enough against something that just had too much DPS for me to take on easily alone.  But with your particular set up, I would imagine that the blasters cut most anything down so fast that the risk is fairly minimal.  Maybe you should gimp your group in the DPS area to make it more challenging? *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Its more like LDoNing without an option for hard. (Then again I never tried a hard...)&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow. I never knew that. We used to play on the same server too. I'd done about a dozen or so hards with gimpy ass Wubao. Heh. They were, eh ... hard to a point. If you got the right mix of people or dedicated play team that knew its stuff (like the one you describe in CoH) ... they really weren't hard at all. If you got some people who were not good at reacting fast and not good at managing their aggro, things went downhill pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well what I shoudl say is that I never did any 65/hard. I have done hard with alts in 27 minutes. Then had the same group do a normal, and I was pulling like I was insane. (Basically I would continously train our group, or it would have been too dull.)<br />
<br />
You are certainly right about changing our group compusition, but I just can't bring myself to switch to a gimpy class--or one I don't see a need for in groups (read anything but blasters and tankers) for now. <br />
<br />
I suspect there will be some prodigous use of the nerf bat on blasters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What you are seeing is the occurrence of a few things.<br />
<br />
1. 2 blasters with a provoke tank is the PL template (backbone)<br />
<br />
2. Groups of 2 or 3 seem to be the sweet spot for missions.  Not too many spawn yet it is fairly easy.<br />
<br />
3. The game is designed for play with people in a group that are not well oiled in their play mechanics.<br />
<br />
4. At level 10 my provoke is enough to keep the aggro on my tanker from my group fire blaster aoe'ing his arse off - I expect this to change actually - the provoke being that good.<br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Add people to the mission.  Even better, make sure you have 8.  It is completely different with 8 from 3. <br />
<br />
2. Go to Brickstown and patrol.  You want hard - there ya go.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are playing the &quot;perfect&quot; threesome for even to 1 above mobs.  The group I was in last night (levels 21-23) were fighting 26-29's.  It was dangerous and we were on the edge a lot.  It certainly was not easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;2. Groups of 2 or 3 seem to be the sweet spot for missions. Not too many spawn yet it is fairly easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very very true. The game really is well designed for going from solo (doable, but can get very boring very fast) ... to duo (pretty intense) to trio (really non-stop action) to a quartet (OMG, it FEELS like a super hero!)<br />
<br />
After that, it sort of ramps up kinda crazily on INDOOR missions and then tactics all start to rely on things that I fear are going to feel some nerf-bat loving really soon.<br />
<br />
I don't hunt much outdoors. Feels too much like a grind, so I don't know how that all works, but Bloodslake had a lot of good info on outdoor grinding in the other thread here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have done indoor/five and there is no real differance than indoor 3 but that I seem to about double the amount of damage I hand out with my AEs. <br />
<br />
To address #4) so far the 21 invul/ss tanker for my group can hold mobs in Rains (multipul rains tonight) without much effort it seems. And I still Aim+ FB^2 (firebreath and ball) and rain the opening of just about every fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh WTF is your toons name? i got both your chars listed and didn't see you on :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, wtf, fight harder mobs.  This is an MMORPG, you have that option.<br />
<br />
I don't walk around Sol B with my level 65 chainsaw of a toon and say  &quot;Damn, this game is fucking easy.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
While this is true outside, I believe part of the point was that there isn't an option to make this true in a door mission.  There, the mobs are the mobs, you don't really have a choice in making them harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Most of the online games I've played were very easy for group that nows how to work as a team. I imagine this game will be the same and a some content tuning is in order after the game reaches a level of maturity. Min/Max groups commonly own up on these games when they first come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So true.<br />
<br />
Imagine back when EQ was released.  Now think where EQ is today (content wise).<br />
<br />
CoH will have a shorter cycle to &quot;complete&quot; but content and some irregularities are to be expected.....people have to remember to /bug to get it fixed in a reasonable amt of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes this is largely aimed at the misssion system--where you have no control over difficulty. <br />
<br />
And sometime they come out mutantly hard too. Level 21 mission (timed) and we had multipul level 26 combat Master (tsoo bosses) in the mission. Person who got it dropped and had to go group shopping.<br />
<br />
Have been playing with bigger groups--and there is need (starting with groups at 6) for more rolls. And there is a holy trinity for 6+ groups, of tanker, controler and defender it seems.<br />
<br />
Main is Hot Pepper (two words) 22 fire/fire blaster (2 more pez and I can be in debt for the whole level) and Kailyn an BS/invul Scrapper (just ding her to 11th I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;And there is a holy trinity for 6+ groups, of tanker, controler and defender it seems.&quot;<br />
<br />
From what I hear, tankers and controllers are actually in competition with each other to an extent because their roles overlap (invulnerable tanker + provoke provides the same protection for the blasters that a controller would with AE lockdown).<br />
<br />
While I think there's a holy trinity in this game, I'm noticing it seems to be more along the lines of Tanker, Damage Dealer, Healer.<br />
<br />
And in the role of damage dealer, it's either blasters with AEs and DEVICES as the secondary ... or Burn Tankers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I do regularly group with an invul tanter. With 6+ in a mission there seems to be a need for a second CC type. We seem to start having issues with uncontroled agro once we break 5 team members.</div></div><hr />
