<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deadraaxilea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i recently made a warrior to tank some named with friends (usually the only class we're ever waiting on).<br />
<br />
looking to tank seru, cursed, aow, VT level named, maybe even ep xp groups (will get flagged pretty easily, and keyed for vt without much hassle).<br />
<br />
i've got about 50k left, and can sell off my salindrite for another 150k+ if it comes down to it.<br />
<br />
will farm what i can with friends, but looking for some decent bazaar loot or something i can farm easily in the meantime.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />

Sell the CCoM for starters.  its junk.  the CoF is really nice for all intents and purposes.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1024559  All this stuff is easy enough to get in the bazaar, and the targets that drop it are 90% 1 grpable, so you could just grab a random tank and do them ::shrug::<br />
<br />
Beats the hell out of dropping all the cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to add to your bazaar-geared toon:<br />
<br />
Boots to Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites<br />
<br />
guantlets to Velium Encrusted Gauntlets<br />
<br />
Ornate BP and Greeves would be better then listed BP and greeves.</div></div><hr />
