At L65, Healing Will sucks down about 3 bubs of my endurance bar.  That's obviously a very hefty cost for 1k hit points over 1 minute.  But what's more, being in combat cancels the healing will.  So is this just supposed to make us able to solo a little bit?  In an experience group I almost never have a full minute to just stand there doing nothing, especially a full minute when I need health.  I guess if I come back from a rez and have a full endurance bar (or is it empty after rez?), I could use it while I wait for others to med.  The cleric will probably heal me anyway though and if he/she doesn't, well, my 1k isn't enough anyway.  They'll still have to heal me.  <br />

Soooo... ah, trying to figure out what this disc is for... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it also works while you move and zone, so if you need to make a break for it, pop it and end up with a little safety hp by the time you zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eh, with run speed 3 and whatnot, I can run to zone anyway in most zones where it's at all practical to do so.  So this will hardly get used.  I might make room for a different disc on the 8 key bank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this skill would be very nice if they were to add some AA skills to extend its duaration to 3 minutes or lessen its stamina cost by a factor of 3.<br />
  <br />
To test it out, I went to the Deep and soloed a dark blue shroom right by the zone (completely unbuffed) using stonewall and then used healing will to partially recover after the fight.  That pretty much used up all my stamina but I had regened it all back by the time stonewall was ready again.  The downtime is at least less now and therefore better than it was before but still not good enough to solo quite yet.  I was kind of happy that I was able to solo a dark blue con mob though, its been a long time since I could do that.</div></div><hr />
