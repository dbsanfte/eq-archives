<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My first character in everquest was a warrior... I switched to playing a druid due to ease of soloing, but now I'm itching to get back under the helm and swing some metal.<br />
<br />
I spent a good amount of time saving up by wheeling and dealing in the bazaar. I made a wood elf warrior and hooked him up with all the equipment I purchased. Before anyone bitches at me for choosing a wood elf - I like a challenge.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you all could give me any advice on future upgrades. Right now I'm down to about 1k banked, but that can change very quickly - So suggest away.<br />

I went for high hp, and high stamina. I subbed out certain heraldic pieces for pieces that had a good combo of stamina/resists/hp/etc (Ex: Bracelet of fortitude).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. Any advice given is highly valued by me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not much to add to that.  I would try to find a better shoulder item, -10 str will hurt your DPS and carrying abilities.  Pick up a few decent weapons for working your other skills (ie 1hb, 2hs, etc)  Then grind out the lvls so you get more benefit from all that Fierce Heraldic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Challenge and twink are opposing viewpoints.<br />
<br />
And get something else for your shoulders 76 str is so not good ( I think there is a FH shoulders I may be wrong on that though )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jezzibell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">mmmm dun ditch the shoulders, they are pretty dope.  <br />
<br />
55hp + 15stam*6hp/stam(at 60) = 145hp<br />
<br />
Worth holding onto in the long run<br />
<br />
In a couple levels get some Valorium Rings of Gallanty<br />
<br />
I would also drop the twisted ring loop in the long haul, get a blood metal or mosquito leg<br />
<br />
SS MQ gauntlets are 90hp and pretty nice<br />
<br />
LSoEE is suck agro, snag a willsapper if u got a guild or a wavecrasher if you just searching bazaar.  <br />
<br />
In the shortrun, get a 65hp 65mana neck, long haul maybe a clattering bone necklace<br />
<br />
Goodluck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FYI  sta does next to nothing for you at 13, its a waste.  The hp from sta is your lvl/10 till you get into AA's so at 13 you get 1.3 hp per sta.  Drop the sta stuff and get your str up, will serve you much better at your lvl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe you will be better using something like crusty till you go up in lvls, the recomended lvl on Heraldic makes those stats kinda bad, and many sets of armor give you better stats and are much cheaper *ducks*<br />
<br />
Oh and maybe you can change that LSoEE for something with better ratio/stats, dont think a Willsapper or Frosty will proc at your lvl, but I dunno *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ACK!  I suggest adding some strength gear post haste!  It truly sucks when you are nearly encumbered with just your suit of armor and weapons!  (This coming from a wood elf who wore a full suit of bronze as a young 'un waaay back in the day.)  Perhaps bank that FH bracer til past 45 and use a bracelet of might (str bracer from UP)?  I'd also shelve those pauldrons til strength is no longer such a severe issue for you.  I'd also get rid of that etheral weapon, 5 neg str and sta ain't so good.  I'm not sure what you'd want to replace it with.  I'd browse your local bazaar and see what's on the block.  <br />

(Btw, in my 61+ levels of experience, wood elves aren't much different from other warriors. ;) )</div></div><hr />
