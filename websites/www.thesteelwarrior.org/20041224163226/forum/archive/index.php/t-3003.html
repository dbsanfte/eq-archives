<br />
By this I mean random_paladi01 casts the 34 stun 100 times, 6 times it will incite aggro. Cast the lvl 64 stun it will incite aggro 15 times.<br />
<br />
Obviously the proc rate would need to be scaled in accordance to spell level and mana used. Other spells would cause normal aggro due to other effects, Festering Darkness 1000DoT/Snare is going to cause aggro either way.  The idea being that yes a knight could cast the low mana *aggro* spells, but their is no guarantee that they will work. So you can sit there and cast till you runn OOM or you get a few lucky procs, or you can cast the higher lvl ones with a greater proc rate using more mana, and greater casting time. Either way you begin to loose DPS, and any secondary function you had in the group will begin to suffer. <br />
<br />
My 2 cents take it or flame it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ie 90 DD = points of hate<br />
<br />
Then a check for the stun component would go off, stun procs the spell equals stun aggro + DD component. Stun doesnt go off, then pally_01 just nuked for 90dd.<br />
<br />
I see this as a way to elimnate the aggro lock that knights have ( I use paladins as an example). This set up would allow knights to still off tank well, it takes some of the dumb component out of the game, and brings everyone on to a somewhat level playing field. Most importantly it doesnt touch Warrior aggro which appears to be the absolute last thing SOE wants to do anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dark would only snare some of the time? Terror spells would become like EB procs except instead of a free cast or three every second you'd have to pay mana ever 2.5 seconds?<br />
<br />
Stuns would only stun some of the time? Seriously?<br />
<br />
Should that apply to heals as well? After all, group heals are high aggro.<br />
<br />
And would this be across the board, or just a knight nerf?<br />

Why would anyone bother to play a knight again if their spells went off only 5 percent of the time?</div></div><hr />

You'd almost guess that that ability might be, oh, important to getting groups?  You may even think that knights who complain when warriors want to take away our one advantage in grouping remember the days before that advantage was important when knights didn't get groups. Gosh, I can't understand why knights are being so unreasonable and wanting to have something unique to offer a group, why can't they just step aside and sit in PoK while the warriors tank.  Damn them for wanting to enjoy the game too.<br />
<br />
Guess it will be different for knights once the warriors nerf aggro lock because they have fewer hit points, lower AC, or maybe having less DPS will get us group slots.  I'm sure that's it.  Or maybe the mysterious &quot;utility&quot; group slot in the group that's tank/healer/slower/DPS/DPS/DPS will open up for us to group in.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I misunderstood the comment.  So, basically, we're going to totally revamp the spell code so that no spell generates aggro except when it procs aggro? Or is this just a knight nerf? I'll comment further once I'm sure I understand what's being said here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Kinadorm <br />

<br />
I never claimed it would be a great solution, but it is an idea.  <br />
<br />
Ok, now I'm totally confused.  Aside from the SK terror line, no spell produces aggro directly.  Aggro is a function of the effect of the spell.  Damage spells cause aggro based on how hard they hit (presumably just like meleeing). Heals cause aggro based on how much they heal. Lifetaps do both. Stuns cause a lot of aggro because being stunned is really annoying.  Same with snare.<br />
<br />
If you want to remove the aggro, you have to remove the effect (except for the terror line) - which is what I thought you meant.<br />
<br />
-or- you decouple the aggro from the effect.  That is, spells do no aggro by themselves, but will sometimes cause aggro based on what they really should (when they proc).<br />
<br />
So.... A wizard crit nuking for 8k can do so with zero aggro unless he procs aggro.  And since procs are ~5% of the time, you've pretty much taken the cap off wizards.  You thought their DPS was insane before? Just wait until that goes into game. You've pretty much driven a spike in the heart of every rogue and monk in the game with that change.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, you just make that a knight only nerf.  I can't speak for paladins, but it's not going to effect shadowknights at all.  Even though every old school SK won't touch the terror line of spells because they have better aggro spells, it works.  Pretty damn well in fact. Just for reference too, those spells are pretty new, put in game a month before PoP came out.  <br />
<br />
I guess it might slow the paladins down some (the ones that don't know how to use root for aggro anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct!<br />
Its important to have that ability if others have it too or it would be an uneven playing field.<br />
Its like if two groups get into a fight and one group only use knifes and the other use guns.<br />
Either the group with knifes upgrade to guns too or the group with guns downgrade to knifes.<br />
<br />
I do not want &quot;guns&quot; in EQ, ie. failsafe instant agro lock, because it lowers the skill requirement to the groupmembers and remove alot of the challenge in game.<br />
I want &quot;knifes&quot; in EQ, so the groupmembers need to show some skill to make a group run smoothly, which is why I want the somewhat randomized spell agro proposed in the link in the 2.post. I want knights lowered to a level closer to warriors, although they would only be lowered to &quot;swords&quot; and not the warriors level of &quot;knifes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinadorm</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kiznet please look again, yes it is Knight specific.<br />
<br />
It would only affect spells that generate aggro that is really out of proportion to the spell, (Clinging darkness for example). <br />
<br />
It wouldn't affect SK as much, and it shouldn't. SKs should be the masters of aggro, they should be able to grab it and hold it or drop it whenever they want. That's a big benefit of being a SK.  Paladins should not be able to grab and hold aggro at will. <br />
<br />
It woulndt affect Chanters, randomchanter_01 wants to chain tash, let him he will grab aggro like naked assling in the trolls version of turkish bath. He's fucked is what I am saying. <br />
<br />
The truth is Paladin stuns generate obscene amounts of aggro for the mana/lvl, the same can be said for a few SK spells. I just propose that the aggro they generate is brought to be in line with the lvl of spell. In this case the spell will affect a mob as normal, MINUS the aggro, unless it procs. <br />
<br />
As for root aggro I am sure the rogues will love when you start rooting every mob in camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a different between something aimed to nerf knights (and may or may not have unintended side effects) and something that will chance how knights and only knights cast spells (or more accurately land spells).  Both are knight specific, just curious which you are after.<br />

<br />
Won't solve your problem, really then.<br />
<br />
If SKs are the masters of moving up and down the aggro list, warriors will still have the exact problem you are trying to fix (knight aggro lock). <br />
<br />
Just to put it in perspective again, EB is 700 hate, KEI is 14 mana/tick, terror of thule is 600 hate and 60 mana.  That means that every 30 seconds a SK with KEI will regen the mana for a free EB proc, roughly. This spell was put into the game just before PoP. I hate to say &quot;working as intended&quot; but, well, it is.<br />
<br />
Aggro lock is overrated because of the nature of PoP encounters (must slow on incoming).  I still think trying to fix exp encounters to fix that (or tank stacking) is a better path to follow, not only because knights are supposed to have the aggro advantage they do (judging by the fact that SKs got new pure aggro spells just before PoP), but because it leaves knights with an advantage (albeit a blunted one if the slow on inc issue is alleviated) instead of anything a group could want a knight to do a warrior does better.<br />
<br />
Tank Stacking:<br />
<br />
Consider LDoN.  Splitting takes important time, so I've found (and I guess I'm not alone in this) that being able to handle a multi-pull is key.  This means, either an insanely good enchanter or two tanks. Voila.  LDoN just doubled the number of slots for plate tanks.<br />
<br />
Only the MT on a raid is useful? The second and lower warriors just contribute lag and sub-par DPS? I guess if you're ok with that, you're ok with that.<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Kinadorm <br />

<br />
Any melee who is not MT should be at max melee range anyway :p<br />
<br />
Tunare sword procs root, SKs consider it a funny way to make sure people watch their range in melee. And yes, the rogues do complain.<br />
<br />
I found last night with my enchanter that root is a great way to keep aggro on someone with inferior taunt (monk in that case), and paladins have root.  You could remove all the aggro from paladin stuns only and paladins would still have a way to keep aggro reliably during slow/debuff. That's what gets them groups.<br />
<br />
As I've said, you're solving the wrong problem.  Push for encounters that let a warriors strength's come to the front, don't try and take the knight's one advantage away - it's all they had for years and they know lots of tricks besides the brainless wack cease on pull. <br />
<br />
Point nerfs won't work. SKs had 3 consecutive patches where aggro was stripped off their core aggro spells.  They moved to new ones and still won't touch the terror line (and the terror line alone works well enough actually, I've played aorund with it some).<br />
<br />
Demanding that you do everything a knight does only better is ill considered. SoE doesn't want one class with a monopoly on a given function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mahalito</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kiztent spare me the sob story on your lower hp/ac, with itemization a 65 pally/sk  has a insignificant amout  less(assuming similar equpment/AA/buffs) , and warriors are not a dps class either.  So, yaeh you heard me right, your taunt is only 10 less than mine, but hybrids are so dependant on their push button guarantee'd agro lock, the only reason they couldnt get groups is cause they probably wouldnt know how to play without it.   And so what if 3 years ago your classes couldnt get groups, get over that, SoE has taken very good care of ya since then.  <br />
<br />
i agree with you to an extent, just moving hybrid classes back to where they are back into ballance(what you refer to as &quot;nerf&quot;) isnt the answer,  SoE has done so much for you all since kunark, that a simple one time fix would just be undoable.  Some form of moving hybrids down and warriors up and meeting in the middle would be more the option i would choice, even know i am not exactly how i would implement it, again the push to make hybrids better has been going on for so long.<br />
<br />
<br />
But i will put this question to you, i have posted it in several other forams and never gotten a logical answer....<br />
<br />
 I still havent heard a reasonable argument to this fact: Warriors only function is to get hit and keep others from getting hit...not heal,rez,buff,snare,root,  ect. ect. ect. in addition to being able to tank.  Why is it unreasonable to expect that since they only have ONE function that they should be CLEARLY the best choice to provide that function?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by mahalito <br />

Why is it unreasonable to expect that since they only have ONE function that they should be CLEARLY the best choice to provide that function? <br />
<br />
I know I've thrown this out time and again for consideration, so I'll do it again:<br />
What do warriors except knights to bring to real groups? By real groups, I mean provide logs (pre-PoP preferably) of someone asking for a knight in a group for any purpose besides tanking* . Or you can explain, using pictures if needed, what factor that knights bring to a group that will make them an improvement on another DPS class that will cause REAL people to invite them to a group.  Even apocryphal comments like &quot;we invite SKs to group all the time for snare&quot; will suffice assuming they don't make me laugh too hard.<br />
<br />
I know I've said this time and again, but in a world with 4 roles in a group - tank, slow, heal, DPS - having warrior as the CLEARLY the best choice for tanking leaves paladins and shadowknights with nothing to make them desirable in groups.  What about utility? is the usual warrior reply.  Show me the group slot for utility, I'll be quiet.  You can't, because there is none.<br />
<br />
Does this mean I give up my spell book to play a warrior? Not a chance in hell. I wouldn't when it didn't get me groups, and I won't today. I like the choices it gives me.<br />
<br />
So, we have the warrior vision of balance:<br />
Warriors get groups.  If all warriors are grouped, a knight might get a group.<br />
<br />
Until you modify your vision of balance, expect to be very disappointed with what Sony does for you. That's not balanced.  Is the current situation balanced? No, it isn't either.<br />
<br />
Reverting back to the pre-PoP status quo is not the solution. Quit trying to propose changes to do that and you might get somewhere.<br />
<br />
Ideal world? There's actually a meaningful tradeoff in picking the warrior for mitigation and the knight for aggro.  Glatius' point about a warrior needing 20 percent fewer heals if the shaman needs 2 supernal elixirs and the monk a complete heal as well most pulls is telling and true.  The tradeoff isn't a tradeoff now. Just like every warrior proposal isn't a tradeoff either (&quot;ok, we get more HP, more AC, slightly better damage (not that anyone cares), disciplines to grant us a total monopoly on raid mobs, and we ought to have the same aggro.  Seems fair to me, yeah.&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your idea is not so much a Knight nerf as it is a Paladin nerf.  Having stuns and Flash of Light randomly 'proc' aggro would put a dent into the way Paladins play.  We would figure out alternatives, but our aggro generation would be reduced.  I think Paladins are a more attractive target for this because there are more of them, and nerfing them would open more spots for other tanks.<br />
<br />
This would be a mere inconvenience for Shadow Knights.  Admittedly I don't know a whole lot about their spells, but I know they have pure hate spells in addition to spells that affect the mob in such a way that they should cause aggro based on your descriptions above.<br />
<br />
I can understand limiting (or eliminating) the aggro caused by spells that do not have a chance to affect the target (like Cease, low level stun).  I don't think that having spells that land on the mob needing to 'proc' aggro (Force of Akilae, level 62 stun).  Furthermore, nerfing aggro on Paladins stuns without changing aggro for other classes with the same spell line is just silly.  And making all stuns 'proc aggro' invites other classes with stuns to use them with impunity.<br />
<br />
I think that there are other ways to address class balance than completely gutting an ability that Knights have had since release.<br />

Well you still didnt answer my question.  You just offered the typical hybrid response. if warriors can do the ONLY thing they can do better than a jack of all trades chr, then mr jack of all trades crh will only get groups if warriors are all busy.  Still dont give a logical explanation of why a warrior should do his only role better than someone that can do lots of stuff  IN ADDITION to tanking.<br />
<br />
The fact that you may not get groups is your only argument, well guess what, warriors dont get groups now unless hybrids are busy,  and i really dont see any hybrid toons too concerned about that, so it is unlikely if your only argument is if things are corrected to where this ought to be that you may be unlikely to get groups easy is gonna buy ya much sympathy here.  <br />
<br />
And since kunark sony has only improved hybrids(in a massive way i might add) and done nothing for warriors, i really dont think anything sony may or may not do will disapoint me,  i really dont see how they could screw us over much more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My arguement is from a game design perspective, not a role playing perspective.  If you are going to quote fluff at me to show you point, you're missing mine.<br />
<br />
My arguement was that warriors being best tank isn't balanced.  Every class should contribute something necessary to a group with enough desire for that role in a group to insure a reasonable chance of getting a group.  That's balance.<br />
<br />
Given that a standard pre-LDoN group has (1) opening for a tank, if the warrior is the only (that is, best) choice for that opening, it's not balanced.<br />
<br />
For it to be balanced, a knight would need to be able to contribute something to another slot in a group (slower, healer, DPS) with sufficient ability to command a slot in the group for that role.  Except, of course, there's already 3 classes that can slow, 3 with complete heal, and a passel of damage dealing classes.<br />
<br />
You could argue that the current situation is unbalanced.  I'm not aware of anyone whose opinion I particularily care about that disagrees with that.  The point is the perceived warrior agenda (we are the only tank) is just as unbalanced as the current imbalance.<br />
<br />
That is, your suggestion might be nice for warriors, but since game designers have to worry about the other classes, it's not going to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
And I did think of an easy example for paladins:<br />
group of druid, shaman, ranger, ranger, ranger is looking for a tank.  Since paladins have a 90 rez and can also tank, this is a situation where a paladin would be a desirable choice over a warrior in pretty much any knight/warrior balance scenario.<br />
<br />
Alas, since the SK is a necro hybred and necros don't have any essential group functions (unlike clerics, the parents of paladins), I can think of no example where a SK would be better than a warrior if the warrior had more HP/AC and the same aggro.  I still contemplate it to see what I can come up with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, your error, is not that we are the only tank, it's ALL WE DO IS TANK, not cause groups dont  understand how to use us inother roles....that's all we do...i didnt say nobody else should be able to....just (maybe this time i'll say it slower ) that since that's all we do, we should do it clearly best, the specialist should never fall 2nd in the only thing he does to a jack of all trades toon</div></div><hr />

If y'all argue utility won't get you a group, how in the world can you argue functionally equivilent AC/HP's and mitigation, inferior taunt, and no utility at all will get a Warrior one? Unbelieveable.<br />

The only answer is a level playing field and that means lesser, but still adequate snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro for Warriors. It's exactly the same deal as lesser, but still adequate AC/HP and mitigation for Knights.<br />

If there's virtually no functional difference in our ability to gain aggro (like there's no real functional difference in exp damage taking) then all knights will instantly loose most of their mitigation, they'll hit worse, their weapons will become fine steel, all the spells they recieved since Kunark will disappear, a exp penalty will be applied against a group for inviting a knight, and everyone will conveniently forget that they've seen proof that knights tank well. :p<br />

<br />
You realize of course that warriors generally WANT to have Shadowknights in their groups because SK's that know how to play make their lives MUCH easier.    Can't say the same about SK's wanting warriors, and clearly, you've shown that you want the warrior's JOB not the warrior to group with you.</div></div><hr />

Let me re-phrase that:<br />

It's how we get fast agro on the additional mobs that might be pulled.  Stuns allow us to work with caster classes to get CC done so the party doesn't get wiped.  Without stuns we could not do this job.<br />
<br />
The whole purpose behind stun was to allow warriors to concentrate on a single mob while the paladin is working with the softies to get the other mobs under control.  A secondary reason for stun is to help a paladin offset the weakness they have in mitigating when compared to a warrior.<br />
<br />
Now, we have PoP and it's changed the game some.  Very rarely do you have multiple incoming mobs.  Once you get certain gear the difference in mitigating is made less and less.<br />
<br />
The way to solve this issue is by fixing the gap in mitigating by boosting warriors some, and by redesigning PoP exp areas so that you have a greater chance of multiple inc.  <br />
<br />
LDoN is an area where you have several mobs on most pulls.  A warrior/paladin combo works will in these area.<br />
<br />
Changing stun will not fix the core issues.  Just as enraging blow weapons was a band aid on the agro problem, altering stun would be just another band aid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's easier not neccessary. To claim a class is specifically designed around offtanking in such a way is a little disengenuous (sp?) Stuns mitigate damage agreed, the aggro is not the reason for stuns existance.</div></div><hr />
