<br />
Was soloing OJ con's with ease last night in 1k needles.  Looks like we get full rage on a block/dodge/parry and it &quot;seemed&quot; like we're getting more rage per hit.<br />
<br />
Thunderclap is much much nicer now imo.  Last rank will be a 30 second 10% slow with better damage.<br />
<br />
The HS boost is nice.  Not overpowering though imo.  But its an option to consider for dps, especially for the non-MS builds =)  For the Fury builds, Imp. HS might just be worth it now.  I couldnt really tell if the off-hand not swinging while HS was being used bug was any different though.<br />
<br />
The biggest change I saw was the client bug that was reporting mob defensive moves as misses.  A lot more parrying and blocking, and seemingly fewer misses.  It takes a little getting used to for sure.<br />
<br />
Our opponent dodging abilities lighting up Overpower is a BIG boost imo.  It &quot;seemed&quot; like it was lighting up as often as revenge did.  I've got the Imp. Overpower talent and it was reeeeal nice to crit an overpower when the buggers dodge my sunder *big grin*<br />
<br />
I didnt get to try out the Execute fix personally but I loved that ability before hand, it can only be better.<br />
<br />
Looks like the Imp. Sunder talent has lost its worth.  The Imp. Thunderclap doesnt look like its gonna be useful either now that getting rage isnt a challenge.  <br />
<br />
To me at least, this puts the warrior class back where it belongs.  What'd you guys think?</div></div><hr />

I depended a lot on Improved Saunder for aggro control. That is its main function to me, in a group. I also spam it during solo. I really would rather have it back to 15 rage points with all its effects.<br />
<br />
However, I tried to solo a quest before the patch and couldn't complete it. After the patch, I could. There was defintely more luck invovled the second time around, but it worked.<br />
<br />
So overall, I am happy. We'll see what happens in the next group I join for depending so much on Saunder for holding aggro.</div></div><hr />

In the long run you'll probably find you like the new version better. 12 Rage, and produces generally the same aggro as before if not exactly so, so you should be bale to spam it faster, etc. <br />
<br />
However the main issue everyone hated about improved sunder before, was 1 #$#hole with it could ruin raid tank/aggro control, since those without it couldn't stack on top of someone that did. As far as raid capacity goes, you just won't get lynched now for using it ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'll give it the time it deserves. Especially since I have not actually been in a Raid instance, so I know nothing of the stealing aggro thing. I'm usually trying to steall all the aggro of everything around me in a group instance. I expect to be the main tank when I start doing raid instances. If I'm not, i will feel like nothing more than a tag along.</div></div><hr />

I very rarely was not the main tank and I got tired of it, especially when the gimpier warriors won stuff over me.</div></div><hr />

Just went to Tanaris and finally the shaman started getting shouts.  Looks like battle shout is self only in instances, works fine outside.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like possibly a bug.</div></div><hr />

I got battle shouts in Zul last night when I was grouped with a warrior.<br />
<br />
/bug it... Oh snap! They took that feature out!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did WC and SFK this morning with a 24 priest and 30 hunter.  No dice on the shouts.  I figured it maybe got level capped (i'm 44).  <br />
<br />
Finished up SM this afternoon with my 44 shaman bud...no go on the shouts.<br />
<br />
Hopped over to Tanaris...shouts worked fine.</div></div><hr />
