You should probably re-word that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Brutul. Any monk who thinks he should tank as well as a knight is nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Monks shouldn't = knights for tanking but definitely should be superior to a ranger or beastlord.  Other than that, yeah, they're on the right track.  For the most part the monks are expressing themselves without too much lunacy either.  Definitely, all 3 pure melees need to feel the love.<br />
<br />
New disciplines, revisions to old disciplines, unhooked discipline timers, better itemization would all be really good things.  Monks need that, rogues need that, warriors need that.  Heck, the hybrids could probably use discipline revisions too but the pure melees need it more.<br />
<br />
Taunt has been fixed, it is called the mudflation of CHoS, SoB, GSoT.  That is the fix, accept and deal.  Knight-esque snap aggro will never, ever happen.  We are better served by focusing on things that could actually change.<br />
<br />
While they are at it, warrior piercing needs to be moved up to 250.  It isn't like we're all gonna run out and get piercers if that happened, but having piercers as a viable option would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks out damage a Beastlord and Pet? hmmmm, no.  (Maybe this is because I play a Beastlord) but Monks should be able to out tank a Beastlord, yes, have all their cool special attacks, yes, but out damage me, yes, and my pet? I don't think so.......<br />
<br />
Monks.......haha</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's taken a bit out of context (and rightfully so, since the one post in the whole thread that's raising eyebrows is Lord of Kaos' post which does spark that kind of reaction).<br />
<br />
Monks want to either have their mitigation restored, since it's a complete JOKE that they have a mitigation penalty in light of the ITEMIZATION changes in PoP solving the entire issue ...<br />
<br />
OR they want their AVOIDANCE to actually count for something.<br />
<br />
In other words, SURE, let me get raped when I get hit ... but if I gotta run around in silk pajamas I should probably dodge better than a plate tank. EQ doesn't work that way though.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks out tanking a Ranger......lets think about this.....chain &gt; leather, there's a reason for that, and a reason why the two classes are different.&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Wonderful how convenient this argument is when making THAT statement ... but when talking about DODGE or the fact that neither warriors, knights nor rangers SINK when swimming around in all that chain, somehow that argument gets LOST in the shuffle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks out damage a Ranger......WTF? Do they think they're all high and mighty, and better than everyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Monks, as described by Scott Hartsman, are supposed to be the best melee damage dealer from &quot;any angle.&quot;<br />
<br />
As it is, monks fall behind rogues and rangers in many encounters.<br />
<br />
So it's not an issue of being high and mighty. It's an issue of HYBRIDS doing what monks do, BETTER than monks do it.<br />
<br />
If you'd like an analogy, think of it as PALADINS TANKING BETTER THAN WARRIORS.<br />
<br />
Ah, now do you see why monks want to outdamage rangers? The exact same reason why warriors want to tank better than paladins. No one accuses warriors of being high and mighty when they run around with the thought in their head that being a &quot;tank&quot; means they ought to be a superior tank to a hybrid.<br />
<br />
Same holds true for monks, regarding Damage Dealing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks out damage a Beastlord and Pet? hmmmm, no. (Maybe this is because I play a Beastlord) but Monks should be able to out tank a Beastlord, yes, have all their cool special attacks, yes, but out damage me, yes, and my pet? I don't think so.......&quot;<br />
<br />
Monks currently CAN'T out-tank a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Their mitigation is worse. AND, of course, they can't taunt nearly as well as a beastlord can becauase they have no aggro generation other than their DPS, while beastlords have slows and debuffs to &quot;taunt&quot; a mob.<br />
<br />
Since beastlords will always be the superior &quot;tank&quot; ... it stands to reason that the DAMAGE DEALER class, the monk, should probably have the edge in actually dealing out, well, DAMAGE.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks.......haha&quot;<br />
<br />
Right, really funny isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, as one of the two other classes with no magic whatsoever - what should they consider themselves? They sure arent a caster or a hybrid. That really only leaves one thing.</div></div><hr />

Dude, it's not even worth arguing with you, because in the end, I'm gonna have some valid points, you're gonna have some valid points, and both our classes will still be broken.<br />
<br />
I will say one thing though:<br />

&quot; &quot;Monks.......haha&quot;<br />

<br />
You ever try playing a Warrior?  You ever read these boards, and all the threads about how f***ing broken we are?  See you guys have one majore job, DPS, yea, we have one major job too, Tank, but see, right now, we (as a class) pretty much suck at it.  Holding aggro over a Pally/SK = Mission Impossible (unless they try to let us keep aggro), vs Our Migtation + HP is so slightly better than theres, it doesn't make a difference in an Exp group.<br />
<br />
My whole point with this is, You guys can still do you're job, we can't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jat5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hopefully we can avoid the whole magic pj’s vs. a Buick strapped to my chest bs. It’s completely irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the mathematics behind each class.<br />
<br />
The Monk class was once balanced upon the same mitigation table as warriors using items with significantly lower ac and a smaller hp pool. Meaning they could take a hit just as well as a tank class with crappy gear for a short period of time requiring more heals. <br />
<br />
After a couple expansions worth of really stinkin poorly balanced itemization the monk class got too close to tank class ac / hp and started causing problems, for which they got smacked down. Unfortunately, itemization errors were corrected with a change in the classes core functionality that doesn’t scale fairly across levels, but it helped in the short term.<br />
<br />
Now, with mobs hitting much harder and more reasonable itemization, you are looking at monks having ~ 1700 ac and ~ 6k hp’s compared to warriors with ~2200 ac and 9k hp, with knights weighing in around the ~2100 ac and ~7k hp mark. (eq rankings) It’s not surprising they would be complaining about getting the double whammy now that they’re back to the low ac / small hp pool situation once called balance with higher mitigation.<br />
<br />
Who could take the damage better used to be important, now the main thing is who can honk the mob off faster. We know how that stands at the moment, adding monks into the mix means adding a class without spells or eb weapons and no taunt button, and as broken as it seems to be at times it still works when it works. <br />
<br />
Knights and Warriors need some balance, Monks aren’t in the ballpark at the moment. If improved mitigation is on the table that’s fine as long as the ac / hp numbers give the advantage to tank classes. Avoidance would fit the class ideal better, keeping them squishy but streaky would be kinda tough to work out since avoiding a 600 hitter is better than mitigating one.<br />
<br />
In the end, balancing 3 pure melee classes based on offense / defense is always going to leave one somewhere in the middle ground. Monks went from not quite as good to not nearly as good defensively and have remained not nearly as good offensively. Put that with the general melee problems and you’ve got a class with lots of venting to do.<br />
<br />
All I can say is try and keep the discussions out of the flame pits, it does none of us any good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think a monk should be roughly equal to a beastlord and a ranger in tanking.  Of course they can't get aggro like a hybrid, but they should take damage about as well.  I think with pure melee, they should do significantly more damage than either.  Not as much as a rogue that can backstab of course.  Monks have never been tanks, they are pullers/dps.  They were obviously not meant to be tanks, you can tell that by looking at their class loot pre-AoW pants.  The problem in Velious/Luclin was itemization, and unfortunately Sony chose to address an itemization problem with a class nerf, because they couldn't really put the all/all itemization screw-up back in the bag.  <br />
<br />
I think monks need a boost in both pulling and DPS to put them on par with other classes, but I don't care if it's aviodance or mitigation, they should not tank as well as a &quot;tank&quot; (war/pal/sk), or even close.</div></div><hr />

Whats that monks name? LordofKaos?  He's the mother of all morons.  Seems as if he wants to trivialize the monk class...  20% more dps than rangers??  Give me a fucking break....  Learn your damn class....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;I think a monk should be roughly equal to a beastlord and a ranger in tanking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
Problem is ... we currently don't. What makes that extra sad is ... beastlords are a hybrid version of monks ... and are also a LEATHER class ... and mitigate better than us.<br />
<br />
That's worth a :( face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think monks need a boost in both pulling and DPS to put them on par with other classes, but I don't care if it's aviodance or mitigation, they should not tank as well as a &quot;tank&quot; (war/pal/sk), or even close.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed. <br />
<br />
I, and a lot of monks, don't wanna stand in front of mobs as they beat the living snot out of us. I'd much rather let the tanks do that.<br />
<br />
I just don't want to keep taking max damage every hit on those times I get to pull because some numnutz couldn't keep it in his shorts when he decided to ITEMIZE the North wing of the Temple of Veeshan and AC 35 greaves, sleeves and BP for ALL/ALL got added to the game.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The thing that really bites for monks is that they have adjusted the itemization in PoP now, so most PoP monk gear has considerably less AC than Velious/SoL gear, but the mitigation nerf remains. It's basically a double nerf for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ViteGreves</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why should a ranger deal more damage than a monk? <br />
<br />
YES, he should deal MUCH better ranged damage than a monk can do from a distance. But, a monk takes the risk of ripostes and rampage, and AEs, when the ranger can safely sit a nice distance away and ping away with arrows dealing more damage in 6 or 7 rounds than the monk might do the entire fight. <br />
<br />
The list, at least in my opinion, should look like this in terms of DPS.<br />
<br />
Caster burst DPS (carries the risk of getting your ass summoned and slaughtered in 1 round)<br />
Rogue <br />
Monk <br />
Warrior<br />
Ranger bows<br />
Certain pets<br />
Hybrid melee (I lump them together but there should be a hierarchy within this division as well...ranger and a SK shouldnt deal same melee damage)<br />
Other pets<br />
Caster melee (hehe)<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do people get the idea that a ranger should do more damage than ANYONE else on a raid? Yeah, the ranger should definitely deal more archery damage, but why should he deal more damage than the 3 PURE melees who HAVE to sit in the mob's reach to deal decent damage?<br />
<br />
<br />
Most monks don't want to be tanks. We want utility, yes. We want you warriors to get your preferred tanking role back. We want hybrids to represent a portion of the power of their parent classes, not an excess of it. <br />
<br />
Monks don't want to tank. I know I have NO problem taking full damage EVERY time I get hit, but I better get avoided a hell of a lot....it's how monks work. I should be seeing &quot;You Dodge, you dodge, you block, you block, you dodge, your opponent misses, you riposte!&quot; not &quot;A clockwork golem hits YOU for 450! A clockwork golem hits YOU for 450! A clockwork golem hits YOU for 450! A clockwork golem hits YOU for 450!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the whole mitigation nerf. The dev's looked and said &quot;Whoa. Monks can get the exact same AC as a warrior....let's make their AC mean 25% less then.&quot; With the very next expansion they said &quot;Put 25% of a warrior's AC on all the monk items.&quot; So now, not only can we only get 75% (these numbers are just used for example btw) of a warrior's AC, but that AC that we do get only has 75% of the worth. The old 1-2 punch. The effects of these were cumulative.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up: I don't want to tank. I want to deal a shit load of damage, and preferably look cool doing it. I would like to be able to have some utility for the group (I still feel like I do have SOME,  in contrast with other monks who say they have NONE).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks, warriors, and rogues should all be agreeing we need to be better at our one or two things we do over our hybrid offspring.<br />
<br />
I think monks should have the mitigation of a knight. But they still won't be better tanks do to the HP advantage knights have. This wouldn't be overpowering, in any sense. Knights might bitch about how it'll make them unwanted in groups, when they know it wouldn't be that way.<br />
<br />
I also think that monks and rogues should get a substantial damage increase over rangers. Ranger's wouldn't be cast out of raids, since they can still incredible damage, can do those nice atk buffs.<br />
<br />
The warrior issue is a hard one to solve. More HP would only give us a bugger cushion post 7500hp, and once you break 7500, HP doesn't matter that much. Snap-aggro would be viable, but it would dumb the game down and we'll see more lvl 65's that can't play their class. Nerfing knights would be possible, but then knights would complain. So it's hard to come to a conclusion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">arf arf<br />
<br />
This is how I pictured it:<br />
<br />
Wizard burst DPS <br />
Monk<br />
Rogue<br />
Ranger bows (/disc trueshot)<br />
Beastlord (pet + melee)<br />
Mage / Necro (pets + spells)<br />
Warrior / Ranger<br />
Shadow Knight<br />
Paladin<br />
Bard<br />
Ranger bows(normal)<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
Druid<br />
Silk classes<br />
<br />
Wizard DPS being burst, Rogue DPS being smeary with backstabs, and Monk DPS being fairly consistent beating, I think it would be pretty much even between these three over the long haul.<br />
<br />
Bows are the defining weapon / skill for  a ranger ... in full /disc mode, it should be as high as non-wizard nukes, with the same aggro concerns that a nuker would have. <br />
<br />
Then the pet classes ... I'd put the beastlord over the other two, although close enough that they'd almost be even.  Standard encounter, Beastlord + pet would be significantly high melee DPS ... one angry critter + one skilled fighter should add up.  But a Necro in full &quot;burn&quot; mode should be able to top him with all the DoTs and such, and a Mage has decent baby nukes too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense ...&quot;.  I take that to mean that I should be able to give some and take it, too.  &quot;Rangers are primarily a melee class ...&quot;.  Both should be decent fighters, imo.  I'd like to see the Warrior class bring a little more DPS to the fore, as something we can offer to a group. <br />
<br />
Shadow Knights ... as the aggressive knights they should be near to us in melee DPS.  In full &quot;burn&quot; mode,  spike higher than us.  Overall, even to a warrior for a night's worth of DPS.<br />
<br />
Paladins, higher than us v. undead, and below us normally ... all that &quot;no dirty punches&quot; stuff should slow them down some :p.<br />
<br />
Bards, with songs / dual weilding, I would expect reasonable DPS there, too.<br />
<br />
Insert none-trueshot bow DPS closely below, or slightly above Bard DPS.<br />
<br />
Shaman DPS ... probly should be higher than this with DoTs and such in full &quot;burn&quot; mode, but overall somewhere here in the list.  There is much that defines them as a class besides damage.  Were this a list of &quot;relative DPS&quot; ... factor in their slows on the MOB and I'd put them higher up.<br />
<br />
I regularly group with a cleric who off-tanks, and does it well.  Not massive DPS, but we're near the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
Druid.  Added for my g/f, who's melee skills are maxed, and who gets into the mix when she can't sit down to med.  She hits reasonably hard, too.<br />
<br />
Silk ... those annoyingly high ratio caster daggers should be good for something :D.<br />
<br />
Factor in the RNG and different itemization choices and play styles, and that list jumbles up a bunch - enough that I can re-order it significantly 3 or 4 ways without changing my view of the classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Maelissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A very long thread, some interesting points but a lot of stuff that is just overpowered. <br />
<br />
No solution which requires the nerfing or downgrading of another classes abilities is really viable.  Hybrids are currently balanced with the power level of casters.  Pure melee needs to be brought up to that level. <br />
<br />
I don't think Monks should mitigate as well as any Paladins/Shadowknights.  They are not a tank class and were never intended as such.  They definately should mitigate as well or better than Beastlords.  Even with the chain/leather differences I don't see a problem with them mitigating as well as Rogues or Rangers.  I also don't have a problem if their avoidance is increased to the point where they can tank comparably to a Paladin/Shadow Knight in streaks.  Without any ability to taunt, they're not going to be a main tank class but it's a good thing when your puller can take a few hits.  (Monks are really situational pullers, in exp groups they're often too slow ... but they're really nice when you need them).  <br />
<br />
Damage output of Monks definately seems to be lagging from the parses I've seen.  I've always understood that Monks are supposed to be a significant DPS class, but the numbers just aren't stacking up.  AA abilities / Disc improvemnts along those lines sound like a good idea.   They should have sustained melee damage comparable to or better than Rangers.  Burst damage that puts them slightly below Rogue's backstab damage wouldn't be unreasonable.  <br />
<br />
The improvements to Feign Death Monks are asking for don't sound too out of line either.  <br />
____________<br />
<br />
Now for a similar standpoint on Warriors.  Aggro is the main issue with Warriors.  Improved aggro is needed and it currently looks like we're getting it through itemization.  Something less subject to the RnG would be nice, but we'll take what we can get.  <br />
<br />
Warriors need more class-specific flash abilities.  Monks are nothing but flash.  Rogues have backstab and genuinely useful non-combat abilities.  Warriors are about as impressive as a brick wall.  Admittedly, that's our class function, but we need a way to visably demonstrate just how good of a brick wall we are.  Shield is cool, but it's too underused to make an impression on the player base.  More hitpoints would be nice.  Not because we need them (although the gap between warrior and Shadowknight/Paladin hitpoints is narrowing), but just because a massive number of hit points looks really impressive.  Maybe a class-only upgrade to Planar Durability?  <br />
<br />
Maybe a Warrior-only improvement to critical strike?  This has traditionally been one of our flash moves, but it's more or less been taken from us by giving the AA ability to all classes.  I've even heard someone mention that Rangers crit more than any other class (I assume he meant with a bow, it would be really really sad if Rangers crit more than Warriors in melee).  Maybe an innate class-ability aggro proc that we get around level 40 on every crit.  Give it some sparklies and chat-box spam for high visability.   Ok ... it's a bit corny, but we need some sort of class ability that combines utility with high visibility.<br />
<br />
____________<br />
<br />
Rogues ... hmm.  I haven't really heard that many Rogues complaining.   They have the same problems as all pure melee in that spells have been outpacing itemization and class abilities for some time, but their innate class abilities have, if anything, gotten better over time.  They're still top of the line in terms of situational damage (backstab) and have several really useful non-combat abilities.  I'd say at the very least they probably need the same improvements to the /disc system that Warriors and Monks do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">1) For pure melee, give us the mana we would have had ( from gear or spells or stats ) as HP.

Amen ! Pure melee VoQ = regen, the Mana regen vs HP regen line has been so blurred its lame, KEI = 2 hrs 40 mins or 18 per HP regen a tick, now that works. wanna be a hybrid caster, bam you get less regen since mana regen = HP for &quot;PURE&quot;   melee only.<br />

I would prefer to see avoidance class based, and mitigation armour based.  Perhaps it ain't gonna happen in this game ;).<br />

Leather classes avoidance:<br />
<br />
Monk &gt; Beastlord &gt; Druid.  <br />
<br />
With Monk avoidance being quite significantly greater than the Beastlord (maybe tied into the weight bonus), and Druid avoidance being on par with silk classes.<br />

<br />
Mitigation is self-evident, but to be thorough:<br />
Plate &gt; Chain &gt; Leather &gt; Silk.  <br />
<br />
AC rating would be a combination of these two factors (might be that way in the code, iono) ... the trick would be to balance avoidance and mitigation, and that would be tweaked on a class by class basis.<br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />
<br />
Approximate Avoidance Comparisons:<br />
<br />
(Monk = Warrior) &gt; Paladin &gt; Shadow Knight &gt; (Rogue = Ranger = Beastlord) &gt; (Cleric = Shaman = Druid = [All Silk]) <br />
<br />
This could still be tweaked for each class, or even modified class by class on a secondary or tertiary statistic.  (For example, a Monk could receive a wisdom based bonus to avoidance, using their spiritual training to &quot;sense&quot; the attacker's intentions and dodge accordingly.)<br />
<br />
Using these lists as a computation matrix, I imagine an inherent defensive capacity that stacks something like this (over the longer haul, streakiness aside):<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Paladin<br />
Shadow Knight <br />
Monk<br />
Ranger<br />
Rogue <br />
Beastlord<br />
Cleric<br />
Shaman<br />
Druid<br />
All Silk<br />
<br />
Intelligent class play and spell use, as well as oddball RNG, would affect this stack a little bit, but not so much that one would depend on it.  Also, assume that some of the gaps in the list are greater than others (some gaps being nearly &quot;0&quot;).<br />
<br />
I see it in the Velious armour quests, and some of the newer itemization, and I think it's a good thing - grouping classes by &quot;type&quot; and &quot;armour&quot;, and setting equippable classes appropriately. I notice it more for my g/f's druid ... weapons which are priestly (her Soulstripper ([http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40007]), and armour which is leather (her Waterlogged britches [http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40200]).<br />
<br />
Perhaps this sort of itemization has always been the case, and I just noticed it now :D.<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually KEI is 2 hrs 30 mins standard but this is understated. For 3k any enchanter audacious enough to sell C3 should have an Amulet of Insight with Extended Enhancement III on it (+15%) so KEI is 2 hours 52.5 mins.<br />
<br />
At the higher end game, enchanters worth their raid salt have Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery which stacks with EE3 so C3 lasts 4 hours and 7.5 mins.<br />
<br />
Finally, the enchanter should definately get the 8th shawl for maximum extension of 70%. My main's C3 lasts 4 hours and 15 mins.<br />
<br />
Hybrids are curently balanced with the power of casters<br />
<br />
I think that this is a dangerous statment. If you mean that melee should be elevated to the same level I wholeheartedly agree. I think melee have been ignored for far far too long. Take this expansion. ALl other classes gained utilities to use and augmentations. Warriors ONLY gained augmentations. At best that means that the extra proc off-hand dual wielded 1h'er is the ONLY thing thing warriors were given that other classes were not. <br />
<br />
What does that mean? Assuming 1 proc per minute with the off-hand, that means 2.5 DPS and 1 extra stun per minute. <br />
<br />
..As to what rogues and monks were given I don't really know.<br />
<br />
But if you're saying that other classes should be nerfed, I can't say I agree. Once you've given somebody something it is VERY hard to take it away.</div></div><hr />

Monks are hurting, you know how I know this?   not because I play one, but when I'm putting a group together, and one wants to join, I ask myself &quot;well, WTF can this guy do that can't be done better?&quot; and the answer is 'Well, it's a good thing he's my friend, otherwise, he'd be out in the cold'.   <br />
<br />
This from a fuggin WARRIOR who knows this situation all too well.    I'll tell you my view of what monks need:<br />
<br />
1. Monks need Tactical mastery AA... and they need is ASAP.     <br />
<br />
2. Monks need warriors to have better aggro so that they DONT pull aggro from warriors and get forced into the tanking role (which is how the tanking monk problem started cause warrior taunt was fucked).<br />
<br />
3. Monks need mob POSITIONING skills..... i.e. grab the fucking mob and move it, flip it, whatever where he or she wants it.   This way, the monk can have something of value with which to bring to both a group and a raid.... Raids manage to &quot;tree&quot; mobs even if there's only one godam tree in the whole zone.    One class with the ability to alleviate that situation can add a WHOLE LOT of value.<br />
<br />
4. Resisted spells should NOT EVER break feign death... EVER.   it's the most retarded thing I can think of that a FDer resists a spell and it causes feign to break.<br />
<br />
5. Monks who stop 50 feet in front where they told a raid to stand and start fighting mobs they've pulled need to be auto-deathtouched.<br />
<br />
6. Monks need better weapon selection, and better DPS.<br />
<br />
7. Beastlords need a weight restriction or worse mitigation.</div></div><hr />

Itemization is the absolute worst way to deal with balance issues. As time has shown again and again, it just takes one or two stupid devs to mess up class balance.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, yes. Crits were ours first after all. :D Having our crits add extra aggro is a good idea. One thing I always wanted was a message others can see when Flurry and Rampage go off. I was very disappointed when I found out that only I would see the Flurry message. I was tempted to hold off on that until after defensive AAs just for that fact alone. I know it would be more spam, but there's a lot of spam already and many ways to filter it. <br />
<br />
Hmm, how about an extra chance to crit when attacking from behind in addition to the extra aggro thing? This might seem to infringe on rogue territory, but I don't think so.  Having a real penalty for turning your back on a warrior (above the mobs inability to dodge/riposte/parry, etc.) is one way to represent our role as a tank. Note that the extra aggro from crits would kick in and so it is not something that would really be a dps boost as the mob would feel the pain and turn back to the warrior.<br />
<br />
I could see that being a potential problem on raids, with the non-MTs getting aggro when they don't want it, so maybe add this as a discipline or triggered AA? That might work well. You turn it on, indicating that you are going for the soft spots that cause a lot of pain, rather than just doing damage in attacking from behind, to get its attention, and the mob focusing on someone else allows you to be that precise with your attacks.<br />
<br />
I never saw taunt as what its name implies. It might work that way for relatively dumb mobs, but an opponent that's supposed to be highly intelligent, whether some low level caster in a lvl 20 zone or a boss mob, is not going to say, &quot;Oh, I better kill the warrior first because he insulted my parentage!&quot; One part of a tank's ability to hold aggro is supposed to represent his/her ability to be a physical barrier between the mob and whoever he wants to kill at that moment. The other part is that the warrior convinces the mob that he/she is the most dangerous threat. The mob would not turn its back on someone wearing a lot of steel with lots of sharp pointy things to stick in it, for that would be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just the 2 cents of an unwilling warrior retiree. **having to work for a living sux sometimes**</div></div><hr />
