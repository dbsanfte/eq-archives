<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I get in a PoN group today, a quick exp romp before work. I'm a 56 warrior, figure I have decent agro weapons (the standard CHoS/SotB combo) and 31% haste. 3885hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
The group invites a 58 sk with 21% haste and 2400hp unbuffed. They tell *him* to tank and me to pull.<br />
<br />
So we do that. Since I'm the puller, have better haste and those two weapons do tend to generate decent agro, the sk is having trouble keeping taunt over me and we're both taking damage (I'm not taunting). Fun.<br />
<br />
Was I right to get kind of... annoyed?<br />
<br />
(/em stalks off muttering curses and foul language... something about WTF is the point of getting hp gear and taunt weapons if they'll let any gimp take over the first chance they get)<br />

Sounds to me like the SK didn't know his class.</div></div><hr />

Was in a group in valor today tanking and keeping aggro just fine. Well, I had to leave so I told the group I'd find a replacement, 3 or 4 people immediatly told me to look for a pally/sk......:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's kind of an unfair assumption. If that SK had no mana regen, aggro generation would be so-so.<br />
<br />
Anyways, sucks to have ping pong groups like that. I think you should speak up next time ya see a situation like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, or have the SK do what he is good at, pull and snap agro when you loose it. Piggy backing off SK agro can be a dream!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, PoN has some weird aggro issues for me.  Anyways when I was fighting there, the highest lvl tank was usually the one for the job.  Ive had SK's and Paly's tank instead of me, even though I had better stats and all.  Lvl's adds to damage mitigation, so higher lvls take less damage.<br />
<br />
But that SK prob didnt know what he was doing.  I tend to find Paladins are usually better tanks than SK's.  (generally, imo)  I just use my dps weapons if Im not tank, no big deal.</div></div><hr />
