Now, I wonder, I always understood that Dex increases chance to proc, with the higher the dex, the better chance to proc. So is 2 per minute just the base, and dex helps it proc more than 2 per minute, or is dex useless?</div></div><hr />

It's just the way the random number generator works in EQ like we all know.<br />
<br />
I have had fights that last about 1 minute with 7 or 8 procs in it as well but when I calculated the average over 4 hours of effective fighting time (about 8 hours in play time), it really was about that forementioned 2 per minute rate (my dex was not maxed at that time).<br />
<br />
By the way, my parsings showed that off-hand seems to proc about 1 per minute. I was using CHoS and SotB and I even swapped them and re-did the parse and still main hand was ~2 procs per minute and off-hand was ~1 per minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 procs per minute means average over time.  Over the course of an hour, expect about 120 procs.  Short bursts aren't indicitive of proc rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The CHSD seems less streaky.   I can't recall not getting a proc on a mob, much less going for mob after mob like the Primal.  (Of course, what REALLY matters is getting an early Aggro proc, and this is where multi-aggro-proc weapons shine.)</div></div><hr />

Give that man a prize! That is EXACTLY why more agro procs are better. Really, once you get good agro, the mob will likely stay on you unless you have retards in your group/raid. It's that initial few seconds at the start of the fight that are so critical. Having 4x hate procs will result in about 6 procs/min at max DEX so the chances of not getting a proc fairly early in a fight are considerably lower. It can still happen, I went an entire mob last night without a single proc out of 4 possible, but on the next mob I got like 12 procs in 30 seconds. /shrug RNG goodness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, Haass is the tricky wordsmith!  Yes, it is true that since the results come from the RNG, the RNG must be responsible for the streaks.<br />
<br />
However, in the context of the discussion, I was implying that the CHSD seemed to proc more reliably than my Ancient Prismatic spear.  I don't know of any parses on it, but it is possible...  Haass himself points it out in this thread  <br />
BoC/SoD proc rate parse (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3506&amp;highlight=weapon+proc+rate) that at least one weapon is known to be proc-ish.<br />
<br />
If I get into an exp group with another tank in the near future, I'll try to get a parse of Prismatic+dagger. I have some CHSD+dagger parses already, I believe the hammer &quot;Rages&quot; and the Anger procs &quot;Anger&quot; so I should be able to ignore the Anger augs.</div></div><hr />

Put whichever you feel is most agro on the mainhand. You get 2 of dem :)<br />
<br />
For me, the best thingy happened to be Ykesha and CHOS.<br />
<br />
CHOS has 179DD plus stun. Ykesha is 100DD plus stun. Can't remember the SOTB, but I belive it was lower DPS too.<br />
<br />
CHOS beats out Anger II SOTB for me every time.<br />

Maybe its the amazing DPS boost from ingenuity /snicker.<br />

<br />
Thats the way I read it.  Also thought he said there is precedent for SoE apprantly modifying the RNG on proc per the thread he linked (although the exception case was only for Bloodfrenzy?). /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I made it pretty clear, Haass.  While not really on-topic, I would say, yes, from my observations, the prismatic seems to proc less often than the CHSD.  And yes, I understand probability, that the RNG is streaky,  and that in small time increments we can see things that are not so, and so forth.  If you have specific questions, please don't hesitate to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, if i had a primal, this would be over in an hour as I parse it and prove you're wrong and haven't learned anything from that thread.<br />
<br />
ALL WEAPONS PROC THE SAME.  You can not judge a proc rate by a &quot;Feeling,&quot; only thru parses.  If you have not parsed it, I can feel comfortable in saying that you're fucking wrong and that's all there is to it.  People have asked me multiple times &quot;Oh ya, what about weapon XXXXX?&quot;  Last time I went out, got that weapon, parsed it and proved them wrong in an hour.  I have zero doubt I could do the same if I have a primal, but since i don't, all I can really do is tell you that your baseless ranting isn't correct, won't be correct, and I eagerly await the person who can spend an hour with the Katta banker and post it here just so you can try to packpedal your argument and save some face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If all weapons proc the same, why did YOU say otherwise in the thread I referred to above?  I'll help out, here is YOUR quote. And no, it isn't out of context:<br />
<br />
People who say the BoC proc rate sucks are using a bloodfrenzy, which has been proven to proc more, which is why they say it sucks.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could explain how &quot;all weapons proc the same&quot; and &quot;...bloodfrenzy, which has been proven to proc more&quot; are consistent.<br />
<br />
This means that the mechanics are in the game for different weapons (or perhaps, the procs on said weapons?) to proc at a different rate.<br />
<br />
And I of course I could be wrong regarding the Ancient Prismatic.  I don't have any problems admitting it.  It could be that I want that Avatar so badly that a typical delay seems like it is longer than it is.  Sure doesn't seem that way.  But let's get a parse, and we'll see.<br />
<br />

The bloodfrenzy, the Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, and the cleric hammers.  I'm sorry that i need to state the exceptions, which do not apply to your questions, every time someone asks.  If you really read that thread, you'd already know that.<br />

See, while all you guys are assuming I've got like a vein sticking out of my forehead while I'm typing, I really just talk like this.  I'm a harsh person by nature, it doesn't require any anger on my part to convey that.  What makes matters worse is that you can't tell my tone just by reading what I write, so while what I write may seem like I'm trying to refrain from throwing my computer out the window, I'm really kicked back, talking to the offline guildmates on yahoo, probably stuffing some raspberry Zingers down my maw and going thru TSW finding stuff I can refute.  I enjoy it immensely....you think I have 2100 posts because I'm fuckin angry?  You couldn't be further from the truth.  I enjoy the time I spend here, and I know I make some other people's lives more interesting too.  Hell, all Iskander really does is follow me around and tell me to knock it off.

To clarify, you said all proc the same.  He brought up the conversation that shows that all do not proc the same that there are some exceptions.  If there can be 1 or 3 exceptions, how can you irrefutably claim there are not 4 exceptions without any proof.  He has said he will parse it at his first opportunity.  I don't see any idiocy in that.  I see a valid question that is looking for an answer.  He found no one had parsed it yet for an answer and so will do so himself.  Only idiocy I saw was jumping on a guy with a valid question.<br />

Every exception procs more.  Furthermore, the exceptions are ones that everyone knew about BEFORE we knew the proc rate.  People that had Bloodfrenzies and BBotE's knew what was going on and knew they procced more.<br />
<br />
What we've had since we ran the tests is a lot of people saying &quot;Man, I never liked that weapon, it didn't proc for shit.&quot;  So we go out, get that weapon, run a test and find out &quot;Hey..it procs EXACTLY the same as what you're comparing it to.&quot;  Blade of Carnage sucks, it doesn't proc enough.  Sceptre of Destruction procs more than that. Sword of the Bloodsworn doesn't proc as much, Whip of Strangulation procs all the time.  It's all stuff that we've proven here.  There are 3 exceptions to the rule that we are aware of.  If people are just going to keep coming here with &quot;Ya, well what about XXXXX&quot;, then we're just gonna spend more time arguing about it.  Trust me, there's not anything that you've seen that no one else on this board has.  You're not bringing up any weapons that a large number of us haven't used, and it's just in general aggravating to people who actually DID the work to prove what we know.  Come here and tell me I'm wrong? Not gonna go over so well.<br />
<br />
I guess in the future instead of just saying that all weapons proc the same, i'm gonna have to include a fucking disclaimer that states that there are weapons that you're not using that proc more than the weapons you have just to get the point across.  It's just making things more complicated than it needs to be.  If fuckin joe noob comes here and asks whether his obsidian shard or his PGT procs more, we can tell him that virtually any weapon he's gonna get his hands on is going to proc at the same rate and not confuse him with &quot;Ya, except for this, and this, oh and this weapon that you can't use.&quot;  I guess some people just have to make things complicated tho.</div></div><hr />

It's just too much of a pain in the ass to say - All weapons proc 2 times/min except BBoE, BF, and cleric hammers. Anyone new to the board can find this exact information with a simple search - we have proc rate parses out the wazoo. Maybe we should make a post and sticky it so it is easy to find. Actually, that's not a bad idea, someone want to go sticky the proc rate thread I am about to make?</div></div><hr />

Part of the issue is that you get people who refuse to search on a subject before spouting off about it.  The poster of this topic had a question, and thats fine, but for Ahz to come along and say, well, my primal procs less than my chsd, but i dont have parses for it, thats rediculous.  There have been a plethora of parses proving that the rule is 2 / min, and also proving the KNOWN exceptions to that rule.<br />
If you want to add to the content of the board, step up to the plate and do the parses ahz over an hour or 2, and we will thank you.  But for continuing to propogate anecdote as fact, and saying how your hunches are truth is not what we are looking for on this board.  Something objectlve like proc rate that can be directly observed SHOULD be observed directly if you are going to claim an exception to the rule.<br />
<br />
Additionally, anyone who reads the boards regularly and keeps themselves informed KNOWS about the exceptions.  Haass shouldnt have to assume that every person who is going to step up to the plate and make a definitive claim is an idiot.  That he assumed someone was well informed when they were willing to make a claim like that is reasonable, and that Ahz didnt know about the exceptions to the rule just says that he needs to read more, talk less.</div></div><hr />

Someone please go out and do a parse with the katta banker and a primal or let this thread die.<br />

I do agree though that if SoE messed with the RNG for 3 weaps they could again but that only speculation for primal unless someone actually cares enough to go do a parse (which I personally dont).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is logically invalid.  Haass does not define truth.  Truth is defined by parses.  What we know is that people like Brutul have shown that 2 procs/min is the default.  Nothing more.  Any weapon in this game - if it has not been parsed - might not fit the pattern.<br />

Ahz...and saying how your hunches are truth is not what we are looking for on this board.<br />

Truth is defined by parses. What we know is that people like Brutul have shown that 2 procs/min is the default. Nothing more. Any weapon in this game - if it has not been parsed - might not fit the pattern. <br />
<br />
I suppose there is a small amount of logic here, but here's some more.  Look at the 3 exceptions.  Look at them real hard.<br />
<br />
Notice anything?<br />
<br />
There was not a procrate exception weapon until Luclin.  Ssra Temple to be exact.  Furthermore, there has not been one since. <br />
<br />
EVERY time a new weapon is found during an expansion, people immediately go &quot;Wow..how much does it proc?&quot; and we have yet to see anything else that changes the rules.  Trust me, in a community this big, we'd fuckin know.  It's not like it's just me and Wandor here telling you facts based upon the 20 or so weapons our twink warriors have used.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and by the way, you forgot a name in that little quote there.  Guess who's?</div></div><hr />

/beer the knowledgable people on ths board.<br />
<br />
What motivates me is 1) observation 2) hypothesis 3) parses, in increasing order of strength.<br />
We're all pretty comfortable with the 2 procs/min thing.  But when my observation doesn't match The Rule, I am inclined to find out the truth, and not stick to dogma.  Too bad we didn't have an Ancient Prismatic parse laying about, woulda saved some time.  But we will soon, I have one in progress.<br />
 <br />
Interesting observation regarding Ssra procrate weapons.  Does the cleric hammer spell drop there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, all 3 of the original cleric hammers drop in Ssra.<br />

And you know, questioning things is fine, but coming out and telling us that we don't know what we know while you don't have any proof to back it up is what gets us irritated.  I know how your parse is going to turn out, even if you don't.  I've had weapons before where I wasn't impressed with my PERCEPTION of the proc rate of it.  You can't percieve a proc rate tho, it has to be parsed, and every time anyone has parsed anything, it's fit the mold.  Hell, I saw a dude slap a cheapo augment on a Weighted axe....2 procs per minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's part of the irritation on my part too, Haass. You don't know how the parse is going to turn out.  You have not parsed this weapon.  You don't know of any parse of this weapon.  No one who reads this forum has offered a parse.  That's not a slam on you or any other TSW participant. That is the plain truth of the matter.  Now, do I think your suspicion about the results of the parse are correct?  Yeah, I do.  But until I post them, no one knows.<br />
<br />
Extrapolating the rules that govern a subset to the superset and taking this as the Truth simply isn't valid.<br />
<br />
If someone posted on TSW, &quot;This never-before-seen weapon procs 2 times a minute according to my observations&quot; would you rip into them also?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the parse is imminent, I'm tired of waiting.</div></div><hr />

Katta banker from behind, 285 DEX, Ancient Prismatic Spear on-hand, blue epic off-hand, unbuffed except for Avatar which is the Prismatic's proc.<br />
<br />
1. hits = 3505, damage = 178854, average/hit = 51.028244, Elapsed fight time = 2599, DPS = 68.81647<br />
2. hits = 7932, damage = 402167, average/hit = 50.70184, Elapsed fight time = 5777, DPS = 69.6152<br />
******************** totals (augmented by (0))<br />
Hits = 11437, damage = 581021, time = 8376 seconds (2h19m36s), dps = 69.367355<br />
There were 0 anger procs, which is one every Infinity seconds<br />
There were 274 avatar procs, which is one every 30.569344 seconds<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-<br />
The only oddity doesn't affect the parse.  Now the 1. and 2. above - that means there were 2 fights, not one.  With my parser, if you go 5 seconds without getting a hit, it treats the next hit as the beginning of a new fight.  It happened about 1/4 of the way in, so it wasn't a false start on my part. That means that I missed a green-con from behind for 5 seconds (or more) consecutively.  Or maybe I lagged. No clue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainhand= 2 PPM<br />
Offhand = 1 PPM<br />
2Handers = 2PPM <br />
<br />
This is a  F A C T . <br />
<br />
Of course there may be a FEW exeptions out there (we know 3 for sure)<br />
But these are VERY VERY VERY RARE.<br />
 <br />
There are so far 3 well know exeptions with HIGHER PPM :<br />
- Bloodfrenzy <br />
- Blasphemous Blade of The Exiled<br />
- Darblade of the Warlord<br />
<br />
There is NO OTHER known/parsed warrior weapon has been know to<br />
drift away from that 2 PPM figure (305 dex 5+ hour parses).<br />
<br />
Some caster weapons have insane proc rate (10+ PPM)<br />
But these are caster weapons with tweaked proc rates.<br />
(Just like the 3 warrior weapons listed above).</div></div><hr />
