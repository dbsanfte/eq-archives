<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its bugged. Unless you get extremely lucky and no one has touched it since the last server reset (which appears to be the only way to reset the script) then the script will be in various stages of screwed-up-ness. In answer to your question though, yes you probably could do the script with that many people, I know I tried it with 12 or so the one time I did it, and that was overkill for the trash. Dont know about Tiorpat though I heard he just has a large load of hp and otherwise isnt very hard.<br />
<br />
Basically, the bug as far as I can tell is that tiorpat will call the blue colored mobs to him...before he's even attackable. Killing them screws the entire script up, and it will not work. When we did it we didnt know this, and we killed the blue colored mobs because they were the only ones that became targetable. The concept is that killing the red colored mobs will make him targetable, and then he will call the blue colored ones to him to assist him in combat.  <br />
<br />
As of yet though, its reset and the script itself is bugged.</div></div><hr />
