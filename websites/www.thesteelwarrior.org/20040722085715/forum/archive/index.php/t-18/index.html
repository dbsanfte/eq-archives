--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Warriors are those who take matters into their own hands, and venture out into the world to seek new dangers, perils, and treasures.<br />
<br />
We are those who walk in the van of an army, bravely leading the way. The warrior is the basest, most simple of the heroes. Any man or woman has the ability to be a warrior, from the highest noble to the lowest commoner. So, fellow warriors, the world is yours for the taking, what route shall you choose?<br />
<br />
Quests are opportunities for a warrior to gain status in the world. There are many such epic journeys for a warrior to undertake, but here we shall undergo to delve into those that are most prominent in the life of a warrior, from his earliest days, to the days of the battle-scarred veteran.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crafted Armor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/qgen/SouthernKarana.html) <br />
<br />
Crafted armor is the first and most basic type of warrior specific armor, and the quests can be found in the Southern Southern Planes of Karana (http://www.eqatlas.com/southernkarana.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
Trooper Scale Armor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=76) <br />
<br />
The Iksar Pike (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=96) <br />
<br />
The Iksar race has been placed in a rather precarious situation. Their scales, which provide a bonus to their armor class, also prevent them from wearing a good portion of armor that is available to the warrior class earlier on. To compensate for this, they have been give the Trooper Scale quests, which provide an alternative to crafted. These quests begin in The Overthere (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/overthere.html) <br />
<br />
Also awarded to Iksars is the set of quests for their weapons, long pikes that can be worn on either the back or wielded as weapons. Each quest is more difficult then the last, and as such the reward is more worthwhile. The first pike is awarded to an Iksar when he gives his note to the trainer in the Cabilis (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cabilis.html)  Warrior's guild<br />
<br />
Also inhabiting the continent of Kunark are the sarnak. Relations with the Sarnak can be quite rewarding, however, it is also noted that a neccesary part of the Warrior epic quest must be acquired from none other than the Queen of Chardok, and it is sure that felling her will not be considered a great service to her people. A well-written guide to Sarnak quests can be found here (http://how.to/chardok) .<br />
<br />
<br />
Luclin Armor: Armaments of the Soldier (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/luclinarmour.html) <br />
<br />
<br />
Another alternative to crafted armor is the Twilight Sea (http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/twilightsea.html) quest set, which rewards similar armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Velious: The Frozen Isle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/veliousarmour.html) <br />
<br />
The continent of Velious opened up all new options for warriors. Three factions exist on the icy landmass, and each has its advantages.<br />
<br />
The Coldain provide the invaluable Coldain ring quests (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=110) , which return an extraordinary piece of jewelry which improves with each progressive quest. To begin this quest, head to the Coldain encampment in Eastern Wastes (http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/easternwastes.html) <br />
<br />
The Dragon Kin, who reside in Skyshrine (http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/skyshrine.html)  give one of the better suits of armor, as do the giants of Kael Drakkal (http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/kaeldrakkal.html) <br />
<br />
To find more information on these suits, merely click on the link above.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Plane of Sky (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=70) <br />
<br />
The Plane of Sky, home to the great Crystalline dragon, is a great undertaking for any warrior. Within are housed great prizes for any warrior... if they can prove themselves worthy.<br />
<br />
Allakhazam's Temple of Veeshan Quests (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=116) <br />
<br />
Halls of Testing Quest Spread (http://www.phantomraiders.com/open/tears.htm) <br />
<br />
The Temple of Veeshan opens up a whole new world of power high-end items to a warrior. Here, a warrior can face some of the greatest perils ever, and should he prevail, prove his worth in the eyes of dragonkind.<br />
<br />

<br />
Allakhazam's Warrior Epic Walkthrough (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=768) <br />
<br />
Korby's Epic Compendium (http://users.easystreet.com/korb/epic/) <br />
<br />
- I'd like to thank MrKorby for creating this very thorough warrior epic walkthrough . <br />
<br />
There is also the single quest who’s very roots sink deep into the history of Norrath, stretching back into the rivers of time to give us adventurers a glimpse of the old world as it once was, and to prove our greatness to our fellow adventurers.<br />
<br />
This quest is a profound journey that stretches across the entire multiverse of Norrath. It is this quest that marks one of the highest points in a warrior's career, for while the reward may be surpassed, the prestige is colossal.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic quest is the history of an ancient blade forged by the God of War, Rallos Zek. A complete checklist of all the steps can be found in the &quot;Questin’&quot; section of the Steel Warrior board. At the present time, all known steps that require two items can be multi-quested. Please inform me if for some reason one of these steps does not, in fact, work. The beggining of the warrior epic quest, in its true form, begins in the Eastern Planes of Karana (http://www.eqatlas.com/easternkarana.html) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There also exist a myriad of mysterious characters, hidden amongst the multitude of taverns, inns, and homes in Norrath, who speak of the fabled Realm of Heroes. These heroes speak of a place where the gods send forth their most faithful champions. The heroes say they will accept coins which hold the virtues of their deity, but these coins are incredibly rare, and only a few mortals have ever come to hold one...<br />
<br />
Should you come across an item in your travels that you seem to think would serve some greater purpose, but aren't sure or can't find to find any information about it, various information about quest items can be found at...<br />
