I am in a guild just starting BoT towers and also doing some OOW stuff.  At what point should I start sinking some exp into AA's, or should I just grind all the way to 70 before I do that?<br />

Also, assuming I have no AA's at all, what should I spend my first 40 or so points in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakokorin</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say, at the minimum, get Run3 soon, maybe go 50/50 until you get that.  That is very helpful for PoP zones.  After that, you may want to go 90/10 xp/axp just to start getting some saved up.  For the final 3 in General; if you use stat food, I have found metabolism3 to be really nice at saving food (or rather not accidentally eating it when you forget to force feed/drink).  The last 36, since each of the 3 here are 12 to max, I would start with ND, then do CA and CS.  It is up to you which you want to do first or split them as you invest.  That is how I bought my AAs.<br />
<br />
Some people would recommend going 50/50, others might say get those AAs now.  I am of the school that levels &gt; all.  Once you hit 70, you have all the time in the world to get those AAs, although Run3 is definitely one I would go for now.  In the end, it is up to you and your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I can't really speak as a warrior yet as I am only 56, but as my main I didn't grind out levels then work on AAs, I mixed 'em up some. <br />
<br />
I don't see any reason in getting to level 70 if you are going to walk into a zone and get shredded by the monsters there. A tank with all his Luclin/PoP defensive AAs filled out will take about 34% less damage than one without those AAs, and have 16.5% more HPs, not to mention usefull AAs such as Area Taunt, etc. Some people will say that levels &gt; all, and that's true on one level. But I think I read somewhere that the amount of XP to get from 66 to 70 is equivalent to 56AAs for a race that doesn't have any XP modifier. With those 56 AAs you could get CA3/CS3/ND3/PE and area taunt and, in my opinion at least, be a better tank than a level 70 with the same gear that didn't have any AAs. I'm sure that a level 70 will tank the same critters better than a level 65, but I'm not sure if he'll do it 24% better (with 12% less HPs). <br />
<br />
The AA XP at 65 isn't that much slower than it is at 70 if you fight in such places as Dranik's Hollows and WoS. It also gives you time fighting monsters that stay at the same power while you get better gear and become more powerful. That's how I see it at least, YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend getting:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen or Innate Metoblism<br />
AoE Taunt (ASAP.... it may save your group/raid many times over)<br />
ND<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
LR<br />
ID<br />
and perhaps a few other HP AAs <br />
<br />
BEFORE you move from 65.... if you're the MT, people expect you to not only to hold your aggro but to be able to stay upright without being a mana sponge. (Mana sponges=lots of medding downtime=lost xp for the group). If you level to 70 without the above AAs, groups will be few and far between as those inviting will EXPECT that you have those as a minimum (esp in WoS and MPG groups). The other thing about lvling straight to 70 is that MUCH other than GoD or OoW zones become trivial and you get little to no XP anywhere but those areas.<br />

<br />
My mage is 68 and the Cleric Bot is 56 they both required 6 AA’s so I 2 boxed them in PoN, PoV and WoS (Wos was Hairy) as a duo and rarely in a full group. The results were in the time it took my Cleric to get his 6 AA’s the Mage had achieved 3 and 30% of the 4th.<br />
<br />
None of this is very scientific but I wish I had hung onto level 65 and done a host more AA’s with my Mage before starting to grind up to level 70 were AA xp is slower. This may not be a problem in a busy guild but in small family guild were you are left alone for ages by yourself it may become frustrating the pace of AA xp past level 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you level up to 70 you can get MPG groups and then your looking at better XP then WoS offers at any level your gonna get a group there. Or if your EP flagged there are some nice camps in if you know where to go etc....<br />
<br />
As a tank MPG can be kind of rough, but if your DPS / Healing /Utility MPG is gonna be the same for you as it is for anyone else with gear remotely close to you.  My sham has less then 4.5k mana and keeps up there just as fine as a 6k mana shammy etc... BUT if your tanking your gonna need some decent HP, I consider myself to be the lower end of acceptable tanks in MPG.  I know 6k tanks who say they have no problems there, but I have a feeling if you asked their clerics they would beg to differ!<br />
<br />
Personally I have always gone the route of LEVELS &gt; AA.  As a level 70 war I can tell you one of the first things i noticed when I level'd was it made a VERY notable difference in how often mobs missed me in WoS/MPG....<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say this with 315 AA i am sure you had most of those going from 65 to 70.  I am not trying to start any thing but a 65 tank with no AA should hold at 65 or 66 and do some grinding in my opinion.  Wos aint hard much like bot but MPG sucks hard if you dont have the Def AA.  The mobs will chew you up and spit you out with 117 aa and 11k group buffed,  If you dont have the right cleric slower behind you.  And if you do have the right crew it is still tough to grind there.  I am not trying to say dont do it but be ready for alot of growing pains if you go to level 70 with less than 104AA (all pre God/OoW def aa + AeT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to be of the opinion that levels &gt; all; however, with the way to post-PoP content is, I would have to suggest getting all defensive/evasive AAs up to the PoP level finished before moving upward from 65 to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Busstin1</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest going 100% AA for about 30 of them then go back to 100% regular exp untill 70 and then go back to AA again. You can get 30 AA in about a weeks worth of exping and those AA are going to help you ALOT over like 1 level. Cause in about a week if you are average player your only going to be able to get about that. <br />
<br />
<br />
these are the ones i would get first <br />
<br />
run3 <br />
regen 3 <br />
CA 3<br />
ND 3 <br />
CS 3<br />
AT <br />
<br />
<br />
After i got these i would go back to regular exp and get some levels you are going to be a much better warrior with them.<br />
<br />
P.S. This is just my 2cents  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because Busstin's post was right above mine, I'm going to pick on what he has said a little bit:<br />
<br />
run3 <br />
regen 3 <br />
CA 3<br />
ND 3 <br />
CS 3<br />
AT <br />
This means that you will run faster, regen 3 hp more, dodge/mitigate 10% more, have about 10% more hit points, and be able to AETaunt.<br />
<br />
Now, if you level to 70 without any AAs, you will most likely:<br />
Dodge/Mitigate 10% more due to your level<br />
Have 500 more hit points<br />
Put out more DPS<br />
Be able to get an exp group easier<br />
<br />
It's really up to you which you prefer -- even though I'm nearly 10k and over 2000ac unbuffed, I still do understand a thing or two about the low end game (I threw that in for all the &quot;but you're so uber, Daabu, you don't understand!&quot; naysayers out there).<br />
<br />
People seem to forget that leveling will increase your AC, dodge/parry/riposte caps, will give you a level advantage in general against the mobs (ie you'll land taunt on the same mobs more often, you'll hit the mobs more often, and the mobs will miss you more often)...you'll gain more hp as well, and in general people will pick you out before the 65 warrior who, while he may have all his tanking AAs, probably wont even be looked up for that MPG group.<br />
<br />
The reasons why I suggest going to 70 before you start grinding out any AAs:<br />
- higher skill caps<br />
- more dps dished out<br />
- less dps taken<br />
- more hp due to leveling<br />
- groups looking for an MPG tank will do /who all war 70 before they'll do a 65 70 range<br />
- you can sit in riftseekers and try to get a DPS spot in a group -- ie they have a tank, you just beat on the mobs back (this happens *ALL* the time late at night!)  A level 65 doesn't have that luxury, and the mobs in Riftseekers are arguably the best exp in the game<br />
- Groups hardly ever ask you how many AAs you have.  You *may* get asked for your hp/ac though.  <br />
.....- You will have roughly the same hp if you're LVL70/0aa as you will at LVL65/300AA<br />
.....- You will have more ac, as your defense skill goes up<br />
.....- A level 70 is just more impressive than a level 65<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's just me playing Devil's Advocate for a minute :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are still just a big ugly yellow troll to me Daabu!<br />
<br />
I agree to a certain extent, but it is probably worthwhile to get run3 early, and to stop at 65 to get 3 regen3(or metabo3, or Innate CHA3), ND3 and AE taunt.  I do not think I would do more than that, for the very reason Daabu mentions.  Just being level 70 has enough power gain to make it worthwhile to hurry there, all other things being equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Busstin1</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point i was trying to make is that he could get 30 aa in the time it would take him to get about 1 level, so now back to the stats you gave for the AA are gonig to be &gt; the 1 level you got in that time you were exping  :D <br />
<br />
P.S. And i think the AA would make  you a better raiding warrior but then again this is just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forget the actual number, but some people did the math and it worked out to about 11ish AA's taking the same EXP as leveling from 66 to 67.  That is give or take a couple AA's...been awhile since that thread, and I am far too lazy atm to look it up.  I honestly beleive that 1 level is a greater increase in power than 11 AA's, and can state for sure that group slots will come in faster, and in better places, at higher levels.  <br />
<br />
To my mind, getting to AE taunt might  be worth delaying leveling for, but not much else.  Easiest way to tell probably would be to ask yourself:  'I am able to tank the content that I am getting group invites to?'.  If you are, keep grinding levels.  If you are starting to get beat down too fast, maybe it is time to hold up and grind a few defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />

Any high end guilds that I've spoken with won't let me apply until I have ID5 and LR5.  They don't care if I'm 65 or 70, but the AA requirement is set in stone.  In the NW caves I was getting about 3 blues of reg xp for a 4 hour time period.  I switched to 100% AA and in the next 4 hours I got 7AA.  So as a 67 I think AA gives you much more return on investment time wise.  But that's just my 2 cents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">levels &gt; all but beware ! a lvl 70 with no AA sucks hard because lvl70 zones are deseigned for lvl 70+100AA.<br />
So get to lvl 65 then get all your requiered AA (up to PoP at least, and some from GoD) then lvl to 70 then finish your AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rheven</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked this discussion. Learned about AA and leveling. I just finally got to 60 a while ago. 58 and 59 took me forever it seemed. It was just so much easier to get groups and Xp with the cleric (now 67 and 60AA).  <br />
<br />
I had paused and got Run3 and Regen3 at POI while I was still getting decent Xp there. It was at about 55 or so. I wanted to be a baroness and I haven't ever regretted the runspeed. I can tell it's noticeably easier to tank at PoV at level 60. <br />
<br />
My thinking now is the turn AA back on and move to 62 right at POV with about 50% to AA. Then move on to BoT for the run at 65. Have  CA3, ND3, CS3, and AT completed by the end of that time. I'd probable also need to upgrade my equipment before trying to get much higher than 65 even though the cleric got her ornate bracer and guantlets at BoT and a couple things from WoS. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally put more into AAs than other people. If a group invites me I want to be a solid tank for my level. Most people inviting lvl 65+ warriors to WoW content are going to expect them to have at least the base defensive/HP AAs, because that is what they are used to. WoW seems geared to players not only one a level-scale, but also under the assumption that they will have at least some AAs on top of that. When I get an invite, I want to leave that group with a good impression on everyones mind for the future, it may be the thing that distinguishes me from another potential warrior in getting another invite. If that means I have to slow down leveling a little bit, that's fine with me. It gives me more time to get loot, LDoN points, augs and upgrades at the same time. That's my view on it, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think in addition to the factors so far raised for and against putting some AAs in before going to level 70 are a couple other things to consider.<br />
First, there's a large group of warriors who were level 65 for a long time, because it was the max level; they had time to get a bunch of AAs, and thus the expectation of other players was that a level 65 warrior would tank like a level 65 warrior with some AAs; I don't think that expectation is entirely gone.<br />
Second, it very much depends on who you're tanking for. Are your friends your level, level 70, or level 60? If your friends are level 70 and you are level 65 and you are trying to MT for them in groups, you're probably having some hard fights. On the other hand, if you're level 65 and you're tanking for a group of friends who are level 60, there's much less cost turning on the AAs and letting them catch up to you before you level.<br />
third, I'd evaluate my Augment situation with respect to LDoN points. Anger III/yeksha augs are still important to warriors, but getting enough LDoN adventures to get them can feel like you're going to be doing collects until the sun burns out. So, ask yourself what level is easiest for you to talk the folks you know into doing LDoNs.<br />
Fourth, the size and strength of your guild is a factor. If you're in a non-raiding guild, or casual raiding guild, you might find that gearing up adequately to your level is in fact more difficult than leveling. If you have acess to a strong solo/farming class that can earn you some plat for warrior gear, you're in a much different situation than if you're trying to farm plat with your warrior. If your guild is strong and you're not MT, the gear/level issue might not be as hard to keep in balance, and you may be more valuable to your guild if you go right to 70.</div></div><hr />

If it's bot i won't care, but in oow it will make my life so much easier.<br />
And i'm following the same rute at the moment on my main also. Stop at lvl 65, and then grind aa's untill i have my healing max and procs maxed...<br />
<br />
So grind the defensive aa's as has been suggested, then get yer levels and grind the rest of the aa's</div></div><hr />

They make a huge difference in tanking, and if you have a set group on normal exp nights, then they can tell the difference over time.<br />
<br />
Remember, the higher you climb in levels, the less number of zones you can get good exp in.</div></div><hr />

1) you cant go back. so before you level up to 70 take a step into oow and i guess god and make sure you like those areas. because at level 70 you dont have a huge amount of choices outside those zones.<br />
<br />
2) get run3 period. it's cheap as can be and it makes a huge difference in a lot of respects. i remember when my druid got run3 at about level 58 and i wondered why i ever waited so long. &quot;oh! because i can cast sow!&quot; well if it makes that much difference to a druid the difference to a warrior is far far greater. how embarassing must it be to ask for sow on a raid and have the group say &quot;but sir .. it wastes a buff slot!&quot; and you have to admit that while they run you crawl. get run3 immediately. the rest of the aa i wont voice an opinion on because im not familiar enough with oow.</div></div><hr />

Well, I started doing AA at 58, went 50/50 for a few levels, at 61 I went 80% aa and 20% xp (this split varies day-to-day depending on what I'm tanking and how I'm feeling, but it's generally 80/20), I'm now 63 with ~45 AA.  I'm confidently able to tank content for the groups I join, in BoT, NC, 66th Dranik's Hollows expeditions, etc.<br />
<br />
I feel I've got the progression right, with enough AA to support my tanking.  I would not be a viable tank in NC with 0 AA, even if I was 65th or possibly higher, and I wouldn't be getting decent AA in BoT at 70, regardless of how many AA I have.<br />
<br />
Warriors more so than any class, IMO, need to work AA early, to get at least the basic defensive AA, and some aggro-AA's depending on your gear setup.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with my progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My 2cp: Hit level 65, and grind out Run3, WA5, CA3, CS3, LR5, ID5, ND3, and maybe possibly Planar Durability and Planar Power. That'll give you a huge jump in your tanking ability, both aggro wise and defense wise. If you can stand to stay 65 for AE taunt, do that too, then move on to 70 and then hit the OoW defensive AA, with reflex first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of good stuff here. In my opinion who you play with and where you play will have to dictate what you do. If your friends (and you) mostly will play in zones with level 65+ mobs (thats tipt/vxed+ in GoD, wos+ in oow, ele in pop) then I'd say you're best off shooting straight to 70 like daabu said. <br />
<br />
However, if you're gonna be doing LDoN's, BoT and NC groups, or if your friends aren't level 70 in general, I'd think REAL hard about hitting 70 before maxing out aet, cs, ca, nd, pe, lr, and id. XP in those zones at level 70 is pretty sad. In fact, you might even want to stay at 63 for a while...  You'll get aa fastest when you're fighting  alot of white cons, and at 63 you get incite.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
If you're reliant on pickup groups, you'll probably be taking them in OOW, and you're gonna want to be 70 in order to get picked up. Be very wary of MPG without a stacked group if you have no aa though.</div></div><hr />

I'm confidently able to tank content for the groups I join, in BoT, NC, 66th Dranik's Hollows expeditions, etc.<br />

<br />
Do neither.  I'm well aware of how XP works, and for me, at that time, 50/50 worked well.  I earned several AA while earning one level.  Over time it doesn't matter if you do 100% xp for half the time and 100% aa for half the time, or 50/50 for the entire time, you still earn the same amount of xp in both real xp and aa over that period, but one of them, for me, at that time, moves both bars and keeps me more interested.<br />
<br />
I refuse to laugh at how other people play the game, as long as they're making an informed choice.  On other toons, my mage for example, I burned through to 62 on pure XP, went 100% aa in BoT, and then went 100% xp again when i was happy with my AA's.  But then the way I play a mage doesn't require much in the way of defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
I would not have been able to tank efficiently in BoT with my warrior if I had just gone 100% XP until 62.  Even more importantly, I would not have been able to tank efficiently in any zone which gave decent XP at 58-61 to *get* to 62 to go to BoT and tank inefficiently there as well.<br />
<br />
When I tanked in PoTorment and then finally in BoT, I did so with enough AA to make it efficient and enjoyable for other people to group with me.  I have no regrets about how I earned those AA.<br />
<br />
Now, at 63 and on 80/20 aa/xp I'm tanking some of the 66th level mobs in NC and earning 4% aa per kill, and doing it without any excessive load on the healers.  Now. I'd be even better if I was 65th, but I can promise you, I would not be better at 65th without the defensive AA I earned before I got there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason people say its better to do 100% xp to one area or the other isnt because it wastes xp or direct time overall. Its because levels and AAs are awarded at caps (e.g. You dont get any benefits of the next level or AA until you have 100% of the bar.)<br />
<br />
On a 50/50 split, it takes you twice as long to earn each AA and level individually than if you had 100% to one or the other even tho the total time spent earning your total AAs and level is the same. That means if your goal is something like Area Taunt and CS3 before level 65, at 100% to AA first you could have the benefit of *all* those AA while your grinding XP to level and not take any longer to do it over all.<br />
<br />
Basically, dedicating 100% xp to one area or the other gives you the benefit of the specific area sooner at no loss to the time it takes you to split them.<br />
<br />
Now if you just want to see both bars moving at the same time, more power to you, but it really is more efficient to do one or the other.</div></div><hr />

I am not trying to start any thing but a 65 tank with no AA should hold at 65 or 66 and do some grinding in my opinion. Wos aint hard much like bot but MPG sucks hard if you dont have the Def AA. The mobs will chew you up and spit you out with 117 aa and 11k group buffed, If you dont have the right cleric slower behind you. And if you do have the right crew it is still tough to grind there. I am not trying to say dont do it but be ready for alot of growing pains if you go to level 70 with less than 104AA (all pre God/OoW def aa + AeT). <br />
<br />
Definately a valid point there.  I can see both sides of the coin on this one, and having not tried to level from 65 to 70 without any AAs I think we should try to find someone who has traveled that path and see what they think.  We may find it was the most painful long pain in the arse thing they've done in this game.  And it may well be that it was fairly easy to grind it out in WoS. It probably highly depends on your current gear as well honestly....<br />
<br />
IMO, if you choose to go the AA rout, get all your luclin/PoP HP/Def AA's then go to WoS at 65 and get groups, the AA xp there at 65 should be killer! And with those AAs you seriously should have no problems. <br />
<br />
Whatever you decide, GL!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me, I know that.<br />
<br />
But it totally depends on why you're doing the AA.<br />
<br />
If I'm trying to earn a AA that will benefit me *now* on the mobs I tank all the time, I'll grind it out at 100% as quick as I can.<br />
<br />
if I'm trying to earn AA that will aid me later, tanking stuff I'm anticipating tanking later, then it doesn't make a blind bit of difference if I do 100% for half the time or 50%/50% for the whole time.<br />
<br />
At 59, when I was 59, I wasn't getting groups in PoV/PoS, I was building a warrior that would be able to tank efficiently in BoT.  I didn't need the defensive AA in the groups I was in (or when I was duoing), because I was already more than efficient enough for the healers to be able to cope (including when that was my 56th level duo shaman).<br />
<br />
So as I said, for *me* at that time, 50/50 was a good choice, it kept my motivation up to know that kills were all helping leveling and AA xp.  There wasn't an immediate need to have a specific AA to assist with the tanking I was expected to do, and I wasn't being rushed by friends to get to 65 so I could join them (since I was tanking for guild groups, who were levelling at the same rate).<br />
<br />
I have no objection if people go 100% xp and then 100% aa, or any other approach, as long as it works for them at the time.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with splitting xp and aa, as long as it's an understood and informed choice.<br />
<br />
I understand the arguments, I've levelled different toons using different routes, I was offering another option.<br />
<br />
I think the key thing is that unless you've levelled a warrior to 70 and then tried to earn AA in normal groups (i.e. not groups prepared to carry you since you're a friend), it's not going to be possible to say what it's like tanking MPG without any AA.</div></div><hr />

I currently have 9 aa's I started working at level 55. I'm now starting to find out that I really wished I had gotten more aa's before getting into these harder zones. There is nothing more embarrasing than being a warrior and not being able to hold agro. I'm not going to lie, i'm having a hard time holding agro these days. My gear is good, i'm using a Velium Gemmed long sword w/ a 75 point aug proc and a copper hammer of striking in the other w/ a 155 - 179 point proc. I would have thought that these proc weps would without a doubt hold agro but I was wrong. I can have my group wait till the mob is at %80 before they start slowing but they eventually take agro. The 9 AA's I put points into where: 1st - run 3, 2nd I put 3 points in General in the sta, 3rd I put 1 in dex just because I thought my dex stat could use it, 4th went to ND1, which raised my HP by %2 which was 100 HP. ATM i'm doing straight AA's to solve this agro problem i'm having. So now i'm doing straight Wep Mitigation in Class. My taunt is at 230 atm and it kills me that it doesnt work most of the time. I know i'm off the subject alittle but is what i'm trying to say, dont go in &quot;half-cocked&quot; - get these aa's when you can I think - maybe just the ones that give you more HP and hold agro better for when you get to these uber zones, you hold agro better than a shaman or chanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Likzz, this is not a flame but you should read the many threads on agro weapons. The VGLS w/75pt aug proc is NOT a good agro weapon (DPS, yes). Move the CHoS to mainhand and get a Sword of the Bloodsworn (cheap) for offhand. Or, use Greatstaff of Thunder (really cheap). Also, try to get a Yak or Anger3 augs (read the threads for more on those 2 augs).<br />
<br />
BTW, it's the stun component that really pisses off the mob, not so much the dmg proc which is why the VGLS isn't holding agro well.</div></div><hr />

I did all the CA line and reflexes first  , on the grounds that avoiding being hit was better then taking a bit less damage , however on raids where mobs AE or Rampage , more HP and mitigation is important too , if you do more group orientated stuff then get the avoidance stuff , if you get hit a lot anyway (ie on raids ) then mitigation works nicely too  :p <br />

I have been on deployment for the past 6 months (in the Navy here). Well I come back 2 weeks ago and log in. At the time I was lvl 65 with all avoidance/mitigation AA, 120 total. In my guild we have another Warrior that is now lvl 70 and has 63AA. As soon as I log on I get a tell from some guildies, telling me to get my ass to NC. Well I already got the expansion so off I go, with a Ranja to lead the way (they are good for something ya know). So we get to the Ferans/Bazu camp and start grinding it out. I'm there about 30 mins and I ding 66. As soon as this happens I get a tell from the other Warrior asking me how I got a group at 65 when he can't get one at lvl 70. I tell him I have no clue. I ask the group, all of which are in my guild, why they don't invite him. And they all start LoL'ing at me saying there is no way they can keep a group going with him as the tank. <br />
The next day I am in another guild group in RCoD. Was in the group for about 2 1/2 hours, was alot of fun and only had 1 death the entire time. Then I had to go take care of something, and got the lvl 70 Warrior in guild to take my spot. When I returned an hour later I start getting tells from the group, they are telling me they are on their 5th CR. I'm like WTF?? how did you guys die that many times. The Cleric procedes to tell me how hard it was to keep him up, and how he would steal agro from him with heals. This Warrior has better weapons and gear than I do, so now I'm a bit confused. So I go to the Boards real fast on the second box and take a lil peek at his Magelo compared to mine. He has me by 1k hp and 90ac. Then I find out the reason, all his AA are going to HP and he has not 1 Tanking AA. <br />
Now every day I log in and I see him LFG for hours begging for a group. Not even people in the same guild will take a chance on him, and pretty much the entire server knows to stay away from him for a tank. He was all about the E-Penis and gettin all those HP and was always talking shit to me when I was grinding out those defensive AA's that he had more HP. Now the only time he gets a group is on a raid.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Bustauff, that post really made sence to me. I now know the way to go. I've asked a few peeps their opinion's on spending these aa's and of course all said something alittle different. I'm working on becomming the guild MA so it's crucial where I spend mine. At 1st I had thought that maybe I should get all the HP I could get with aa's but it's makes just as much sence to get these defensive aa's going so that you dont get hit as much. I would like to get people's input on how they use their taunt button and berate decsipline. Like, does everyone taunt rapidly when fighting a mob or just let the swords do the talking. Any input is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we first broke into time the zeks used to bounce my little life meter like a pogo stick.I blew like 10 plus di's on VZ and TZ consistently.Never mind RZ below 50 pct.Those fights were very hard for us to keep a tank up.Even doing stuff like p3 clearing the effect has been huge.Our knights used to get wasted if they grabbed a named now it's np,almost boring.In the time we leveled I might have got 1-2 upgrades and no aa.In any case those 5 levels made a massive difference.I was over 350 aa or so at the time,but, I've never seen aa account for that kind of trivialization for raid tanking.Perhaps taken in much larger quantities...For a target that is several levels higher than you tanking at 65 the difference leveling to 70 is huge.<br />
<br />
Lots of threads here about tanking,taunt etc.You'd be better off doing a search and seeing stuff broken down into detail.Taunt is for when you lose aggro,or,think you will by the time you press the button hehe.Don't spam it or you won't have it up when you want it.Timing (er and luck)is everything for a tank.Delay of assist,position for you and the dps(range esp),people taking care of themselves(ie no moving a mob with low hp) all factor heavily.Using your incite disc is situational.Generally, you should save it for when you have aggro already.After a successful taunt to gain aggro is a good time to incite as your lead is small.It's extra hate tho,so if you have tons of end and wanna tank use it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 I have found I can get an aa/hour to an hour and a half killing gobs in PONightmare. At 3%aa/kill every 2 min that's better xp then I could see for a while in most higher end zones. I tried the same gobs duo but at lvl 62 and my xp dropped to 1%aa  a kill. This is because the gobs are within 5 lvls of me and that makes all the difference.<br />
   <br />
Personally I have to recommend you find a place you like to grind in that you enjoy and grind as many aa's as you can stand to. With just getting my 50th aa I can notice a huge difference in my tanking ability. Most people say get 65 or now 70 and then aa I say get it ASAP. Even as early as 51-56.<br />
  <br />
 It may take you 3 months of grinding to get your first 50-100aa's but once you have them the remaining LVL's you need to grind will be sooooo much easier. And will give you a much better reputation on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is wrong on so many levels.  LR5 is 15 AA's, CS3 is 12 AA's, both I believe will reduce incoming damage the same amount(some say CA3 actually reduces it more), therefore, CA3 &gt; LR5 in terms of value for AA's.<br />
<br />
Mitigation AA's shift incoming hits on you to the left(towards min hit), while avoidance AA's increase your chance to not get hit.  Mitigation has nothing to do with a 'chance to avoid damage'.<br />

If you are going to state things as fact, please at least check your facts.  All the information is easily available right here on TSW.

As far as the &quot;raising the soft cap&quot; stuff, your AC would have to be abysmal to not see a difference from it. If your AC is that low, you should be getting better gear, not buying LR5.</div></div><hr />

Small nitpick, but it's more efficient to rotate through CA and CS.  Since CA3 is 3 times the points of CS1 and probably less damage saved, it's more efficient to rotate through those two.  CS1 and CS2 are the same points as CA3 etc.  No big deal though.</div></div><hr />

That's the normal time for POP zones. The mobs will not yield good exp after 65 til 70 and by then there are few zones to exp in. I can grind about 5 aa per night in POP zones at level 65. Raids won't get you much aa til you reach Elemental zones. So if you plan to exp in pre EP then 65 is a good place. If you plan to exp in OOW then 70 is better but you better have gear for it and friends. If you like pickup or have scattered friends then it's a good idea to grind at 65 in LDON or POP zones. There are better zones in OOW at 70 but keep in mind that the top tier players are fighting you for those camps at level 70 since their guilds demand they level up. If you have a choice to stay 65 for at least 100 aa do it, it will make you more desirable. Get anger II augs for dual wielding with copper and bloodsworn, it works great with the WA aa ability til you get a nice raid type weapon.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, thats true, although when I was calculating out the hp/aa for ND the effect per point was roughly the same all the way through, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did it the same way for the defensive AA as well.<br />

In the last month and a half or so I have spent a lot of time grouping with her and other tanks up through mpg and this is my opinion.<br />
<br />
Casual content up through BoT can be tanked by casual warriors or raid enchanters.  All they have to do is break 5k hp buffed and be able to keep agro.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro and up, basic defensive aa's start becoming more important along with ornate or better gear.  Less then that and grinding is difficult.  Omens up through NC is about the same.<br />
<br />
WoS and RCoD is where things become noticably more difficult.  Mobs become closer on par with Fire Castle mobs.  There level is higher and most casual tanks have a difficult time without some aa and good gear.  My wife just now became able to reliably tank WoS mobs on the west wall.  I would recommend at a minimum ornate gear and basic luclin defensive aa (CA, CA, ND, PE).   AoE taunt and the like are gravy.<br />
<br />
FU camps (MPG side) are noticably harder and casual tanks will have a very hard time regardless of aa.  At this point most of the tanks in decent groups are from elemental raiding guilds, have matching aa and usually 68+.<br />

MPG, the only good tanks I have grouped with there have been from time+ guilds or else raid main tanks from less guilds.  The stuff here is too nasty to expect a casual player to tank without elemental level gear and the PoP defensive aa.  Even then it is going to be difficult without a good cleric.<br />

These are my basic expectations from a tank at these locations.  Yes, there are exceptions to the rules.  One of the best groups I ever had in WoS was with a non-raiding 66 ranger who just happened to have max defensive aa and a good bit of Omens armor to make up the difference.<br />

As for when to stop leveling, my opinion is that it depends on your guild.  Exp slows down in casual exp zones noticably at 68 and it gets worse at 69.  Unless you are fighting in MPG or higher there isn't much reason to level past 68.   High end raiders will get more benefit from the levels in a raid situation and can group in the places where exp is good at 69.  For casual players, you are doing yourself a favor by holding at 68 while exp is still good everwhere and your abilities are sufficient to keep up.  Grind out the 100+ aa you need and then try to join a high end guild.<br />
