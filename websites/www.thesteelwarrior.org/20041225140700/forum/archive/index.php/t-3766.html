<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fistosaurus</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure I remember awhile back that the warrior piercing skill cap was to be raised to 250, to be equal to that of other skills.  Was this indeed the case?  I thought they justified it with the reasoning warriors were masters of weaponry or something along those lines.  Am I misremembering?  Was this perhaps in some non-patch communication from SOE, but never implemented?<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antaran</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a quote from my EQ evolutions game manual<br />
<br />
Warrior:  A warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its forms <br />
<br />
Seems piercing isnt armed combat.  I'm getting tired of having a lower skill cap in my two piercing weapons, especially since there is no logical reason for that cap on the contrary everything I see leads me to beleave that warriors should have the same cap in piercing as other weapon forms.<br />
<br />
I could well imagine the devs have forgotten about this cap or just don't care about it since we don't bitch about it.</div></div><hr />

=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The piercing cap has been around a lot longer than any of the current Devs I think.  It kindof makes sense in a roleplay point-of-view.  Piercing probably requires alot more finesse than chopping, bashing, cleaving, and mauling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be willing to guess that our piercing caps lower so that presumably we won't bid on the rogue piercers out there.  <br />
<br />
Yet they put SHD, PAL and RNG as usable classes on hate proccing weapons /boggle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That has been the commonly held answer for years now. Its seen as basically an indirect itemization tweak, keeping the piercers in the hands of rogues.<br />
<br />
I guess they figured that Rogues HAVE to have 1hp so people should be incentivized to let them have them.<br />
<br />
Unless I am mistaken, before Backstab was dramatically scaled up, NO ONE wanted a Rogue within 2 zones of their group, and this itemization tweak was part of how they balanced them later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 reason I hope they don't up our piercing.<br />
<br />
Because it means the knights will probably get their weapon skills upped over their 225 cap which would overbalance them even more.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with a 240 cap on piercers....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it seems a slight that we only get 240 piercing, I don't see a big difference in how it affects our play. My main weapon is a 2HP and it's better than any of my 2HS or 1HS combos.  I've broken 500 on a crit maybe once. Usual best is in the 300's with an occassional low 400. With triples I can hit in the 750 range... sometimes depending on the mob.<br />
<br />
With no proc on the weapon, I can hold agro decently in most places. <br />
<br />
I'm not in an elemental/time raid capable guild. I can play 2 to 3 hours a night during the week and occasionally up to 8 hours a day on weekends. Been playing 2 years.<br />
<br />
There aren't a lot of piercers out there better than the 2HS and 1HS weapons we can get.  <br />
<br />
My point? It's not that big a deal for me. There are a lot of other things I'd like to see first. Like improved taunt, more health regen items, more damage on mobs would be nice...  a warrior magic arrow summoning item... all that and a big bag of chips!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think rogues' piercers are safe.  Raise the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's rogue weapons that proc some nasty shit that I'd love to use... Of course those are all ROG only, because god forbid we could generate lots of agro some way other than knocking the mob around or by just adding pure hate. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The DoD from Time is WAR usable.  Once they start rotting (I think all of our rogues, and inactive rogues) have them now, they will possibly goto Warriors, laff.  Mostly just for DPS/deaggro for when we aren't tanking.... it hasn't happened yet tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quoting this ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Warrior: A warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its forms&quot;<br />
<br />
as an excuse to make piercing max at 250 is pretty weak. if 240 skill in piercing is not considered &quot;mastered&quot; what is?<br />
<br />
Only 250?<br />
<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
That qoute does not say they are the best at it, it says they are a master at it. Well guess what, so are rogues.<br />

That is insinutated by my quote and I want it simply to be real.<br />
<br />
Now give me a legit reason for not raising the cap smartass since your obviously against it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norim the Stump</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">remember, master is anything over 101 skill =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antaran</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok why not put that quote in every melee class description?  Since every melee class can be a master in weaponry.  <br />
<br />
Grats on not getting the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norim the Stump</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">waah</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antaran</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No irony there, I get the point that 101 skill = master.  The thing is that it has actually nothing to do with my original point.<br />
<br />
It is insinuted that warriors are masters of armed combat in the sence better then the rest of the classes.  Thats how I read it at least and thought it was one of the things that defines the warrior class.<br />
<br />
That is not the case with the piercing skill and I want to know why.<br />
<br />
Saying that they were meaning that warriors are get at least 101 skill in all weaponry and are therefore masters is like saying in the class description that warriors can jump.  Everyone can jump.  So whats the point in listing it? <br />
<br />
So again I say, grats on not getting the point.</div></div><hr />
