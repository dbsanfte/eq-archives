When I first tanked Fennin (after the upgrade) I had 9280 hp virtue buffed.<br />
<br />
The field after the castle (field of gib) is a great exp spot. We used to get an AA every 30 minutes and that was pre-LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For xp until you get to POF(my fav atm) Earth is an easy start.Move down left on the wall from zi until you hit the ledge It's a common good spot you can single pull with a little care.You can clear to it while learning the area(best),or, run high with lev and drop down to the ledge if you're careful.Water is good too.I'd bring a bard<br />
or chanter though and stick with the higher up blue and even stuff for a start.POA with 1 group  just scares me. :)</div></div><hr />

Plane of Fire - First castle off the minis:<br />
<br />
Charm of Defense Slot: RANGE +5% Parry Mod<br />
AC: +28 Sta: +10 Agi: +30 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Magic Resist: +10<br />
HP: +100 Mana: +75  <br />
Classes: Ranger Shaman Cleric Paladin Shadowknight Bard Rogue Warrior Berserker  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
 <br />
It's a heck of a range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah charm of defense rocks, we had a lil grind in PoF one night at hamburger hill, not sure if it's called that on other servers, but that's what we call the area between the fort and the charm birds. We had 4 Charms drop in that one night, so there pretty damn common. Pretty nice rot item IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That first fort in Fire has 4 named PH's for the 'So-and-so of Fire's.  The rare from that camp is the paladin pet weapon, so you won't have *any* trouble getting paladins to come help you get xp/camp for the charm (uncommon drop off the same mobs).  Just beware of those phoenixes beyond the fort are up...had some monk get charmed and bring one into our XP group.  Unfun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Amazing. I suggest Earth or Fire in or beyond the first fort. Water is fun too, and also great experience, but the bobbing gets old. Also, the trash can hit over 1k, which kinda hurts. Alot.<br />
<br />
and are there any mini-named i can hunt/camp/kill that drop any gear which can upgrade me? <br />
<br />
  PoFire has some easily accessible mini-named that drop fine loot. First or second field. Also, PoFire has the warrior pet sword, if you want an ungodly awful camp. I'd seriously suggest finding out what tradeskill items are valuable as well, they will come in VERY handy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, Earth (almost anywhere) or the deep part of Water is by far one of the best exp grind zones. Someone suggested the &quot;ledge&quot; area in Earth and I agree. This is one of the better spots due to the ease of the pulls and overall mob numbers. It's hard to run out of mobs to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 6900hp unbuffed you should be able to tank anything in any elem plane assuming a competent healer. Other than a charm of defense and maybe the pet sword, most everything you want is going to be a raid drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the input guys ... i will be trying hard to finish up my solro minis and solusek ro for fire.  i did a few grinds in earth tonight and this morning .... 2 word ... HOLY FUCK (pardon me french).  the xp is phenomenal.   it is above the xp rate i see in vxed, and i dont have the headache of trash mobs that triple/quad for 1100.  i think i'd rate it right around the same as Hard Ldon, but max dmg on non named is only 650ish, which makes for a lesser degree of dmg spikes.<br />
<br />
DPS i can deal with and dont mind .. but spikey dps makes me and my healer very very sad pandas.<br />
<br />
Farmed several named in PoEarth ... all caster shit so far, but i'm going to look into the warrior 1hs when i can get into earth, and the war/pal/sk lance from earth and the big hitting 2hs from water (1groupable names) in the near future.<br />
<br />
thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno....just a couple of Idea's.</div></div><hr />
