I know several 60+ warriors who tank with the windblade now.<br />
<br />
With the 20K you have, and the extra money you getting from selling all that weaponry, there are several upgrades you need.  Haste would probably be the biggest one, you can get a rune branded girdle for around 20K these days, at least on my server.<br />
<br />
Then you really need to upgrade your wrists.  Silver chitin wrist bands would probably be your best bet.  A bracer of defense is a cheaper alternative.<br />
<br />
Head, you'd like a helm of Raldukan, but that can get a little expensive.  The gigantic leaf helm is a cheaper alternative.<br />
<br />
Ear, trade in the griffon fang and upgrade to the earring of the solstice.  Some people think it's just for casters, because of the flowing thought on it, but with AC 5, STA 5, and HP 55, it's great for pure melee too.  <br />
<br />
That should keep you busy for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when aggro isnt an issue, use the windblade for damage.<br />
<br />
Keep the ToD when you dont have a slower, or soloing.<br />
<br />
Sell the rest.</div></div><hr />
