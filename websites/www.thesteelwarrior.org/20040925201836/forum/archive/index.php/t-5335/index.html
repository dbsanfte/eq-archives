<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not the one that found this, just posting where more of us can see it. This is taken from an old patch, you can read the original post on TNZ here: http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057431.html <br />
<br />
I guess depending on how you look at it, it could mean different things to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement* <br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher skill caps on Bash and Taunt. <br />
<br />
The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over level 25. This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the same HP base, which upon further consideration is not compatible with our vision of those classes' roles. This change will basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and warriors of the same race. <br />
<br />
The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks. <br />
<br />
Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't switching to two-handed weapons, choosing instead to continue using the bash skill. Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, do not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the same skill. Paladins are typically the only characters who use a shield throughout their lives.<br />

 They still do not equal us in taunt they surpass us by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember that patch... I remember how all of a sudden we weren't the tanks anymore... Pally and SKs were</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They said paladins and sks would never equal a warrior in their ability to taunt, they didn't say anything about getting aggro.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If ya read the whole patch message it becomes apparent that when they say taunt they mean aggro in general, at least that's how I read it.</div></div><hr />
