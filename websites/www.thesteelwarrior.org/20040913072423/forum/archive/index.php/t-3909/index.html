<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone noticed how many DPS classes use a CHoS as a Primary/Secondary weapon?  Last night I had to give the ranger in my group my crystalline spider fang to offhand.  Apparently carrying around a few extra weapons is a warrior only thing:rolleyes:  His CHoS was proccing every 3 swings and I couldn't keep agro off his bleeding arse.<br />
<br />
I had to explain to him 3 times that the proc is 179dd and a 0.0 second stun.  And then I had to explain that stun is a very high agro spell.  I needed to compare it to snaring a mob 3x on incoming before he finally understood how much agro each proc was building(its probably an exageration, but it finally made that 5 Watt lightbulb in his head turn on:D)<br />
<br />
I see almost as many rangers, monks, bsts, and even rogues running around with one of these as I do warriors.  Are people that ignorant as to what the proc does?  Or do they just think that its their uber dps that is making the mobs turn every time it goes off?  Or is everyone just that acustomed to how well a Knight can lock agro?<br />
<br />
/em wanders off, utterly baffled at how clueless some people can be when it comes to agro control...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, a ranger lived long enough to swing three times with agro!  :p <br />
<br />
But, yeah, I've seen that too...just like casters, agro management is very important when you're not the MA...and just like lots of casters, lots of melee don't seem to understand this one...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You'd be amazed at the number of people who play melee DPS classes and have no clue about aggro management.  They don't even have any idea about which weapons have aggro procs.  Which is why they continue to use 1handers that proc stun, debuffs, and dots, then bitch and moan about how they always pull aggro and they don't understand why.  If you sit them down and explain it to them, it may piss them off a bit to be told how to do thier job by a &quot;big dumb meatshield&quot;, but it'll make them a better player. And later they may even thank you for it.</div></div><hr />

The ranger decided that they didn't want the weapon because it also had knockback. <br />
<br />
Just the other night i had another guild ranger send me a tell asking me how easy the CHoS is.  She wanted one to interupt casters.  Keep in mind she was willing to give up the DPS of her Greatstaff of the 4 Winds to have a snowballs chance at procing stun while a mob is casting gate....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slayerofwurms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have to defend the Rangers name, I am a ranger at heart, though retired, and my dad is a warrior (hence why I am posting here). <br />
<br />
Sadly, it has been gone over many times at RangersGlade how too many rangers are getting high level without knowing thier agro managment. It is not a fault of DPS classes, in general, but rather of the rapid leveling that players are able to do today, causing many high level PCs without proper knowledge of how to play thier classes. When you are using FS and banded, you have to have a lot more skill of how to play your char. <br />
<br />
So, to clear Rangers' names, it is not we that do not know our aggro- in fact, there are many posts and discussions of methods of controlling aggro, root parking adds, use of jolt, when to back off, and what weapons have bad procs for rangers. <br />
<br />
It is too much of an inflated economy, and too easy of a leveling path. Just as there are a lot of DPS classes that cant control aggro, there are a lot of higher level warriors I have grouped with that still dont know how to keep aggro. I had one that didnt know what taunt was.... I have also grouped with Clerics that DD'd instead of healing, and Druids and Wizards that nuked mobs as they were inc, thus ensuring a quick death. I have had chanters that couldnt keep Mobs mezzed, and would forget about charm, and have a charmed mob break and kill them in the middle of a big fight. Monks that thought they were tanks and didnt FD, Shamans that didnt ever use slow.... the list goes on and on. <br />
<br />
I am sorry to see a game that used to require real skill to play- and once you were a level 50 or 60, you had earned it- turn into a game where 50 and 60 and even 65 with AAs are pretty easy to obtain without real knowledge of the game, the weapons, the stats, the NPCs, spells, procs, factions and quests. <br />
<br />
Its like the newbies you used to hit in orc groups.... only now, they are fighting in PoP.... and KC.... and Velks.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">there are a lot of higher level warriors I have grouped with that still dont know how to keep aggro. <br />
<br />
I think the problem isn't the warriors but the other 5 people in the group being so used to knights playing with aggro like a child would with a slinky. <br />
<br />
I've had 3 groups in the last couple of sessions where I couldn't keep aggro even when I used AE taunt after multiple regular ones and proccing to boot. <br />
<br />
Group 1 consisted of a monk with a copper hammer and an augmented other weapon that procced the 150dd. Ping-pong everywhere, and he wanted NDT to boot.<br />
<br />
Group 2 had a druid with the glowing orb that snared on incomming and once he stopped doing that, decided to cast sunstrike instead.<br />
<br />
Group 3 had a ranger with the slow proccing epic and something with a 150dd proc. I don't know if it had a stun or not, but I'm positive he's never heard of jolt since he never cast it.<br />
<br />
All 3 groups had miserable DPS because of this, and the cleric and CC were working overtime all the while people in group were commenting on aggro being all over the place. I won't even go into the casters nuking their little hearts out when the mobs where at 95% health and ping-ponging everywhere also.<br />
<br />
I like a challenge in the game, but with all the level 65 nimrods out there it makes it more like baby-sitting while I get blamed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why couldn't they have just made SoTB and CHoS warrior only weapons?  I mean, c'mon, everyone knows they were just another bandaid fix for warriors.  It disturbs me that the two easily obtainable aggro weapons that were touted as the &quot;fix&quot; for the warrior class, indeed they are practically the only bone we as warriors have been thrown in the last 3 years, only make the problem worse in certain situations with certain idiots due to poor itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Feel like I've been beating my head against this wall with guildmates recently.  Had a couple of rangers and monks in their 50's askign for PC's on them.  I finally just flat out told them if they were going to be wielding those weps, I would not make any effort to pull aggro off them.  That was the only thing that seemed to get through to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Group 2 had a druid with the glowing orb that snared on incomming  <br />
<br />
And whats wrong with that? Make the druid pull with snare, when the mob is inc to the camp, move a bit ahead and taunt the mob while its walking to the camp, if taunt works you jump over snare agro (higher than shammy slow at least) and not even slow will take agro from you, meaning the shammy can slow at 99% without getting summoned.<br />
Of course, you dont find druids that pull with snare often and that taunt on inc can fail, but what the hell, it can also fail at any time.<br />
This is all from my experience and how I dealt with it, and the shammy was quite impressed he could slow so soon and never get summoned :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He wasn't the puller. He was just casting snare after I got a couple of rounds in is all. It's not like the mob is going to run off at 90% health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fury Edged Short Sword main (procs more than the CHoS does)<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking offhand<br />
<br />
Works fairly well with my self damage shields.  That'll be coming to an end soon though since bow AA is &gt; ID5/LR5 :/  In the meantime however, I LIKE being able to use them on multiple chars.  It's a fairly decent shammy weapon in the 40s and low 50s, and it's a good way to get yer INT caster's 1h blunt up.<br />
<br />
<br />
For groups though, I break out the non proc weapons and I keep Jolt loaded.  I don't taunt, and if I need snap aggro to save the chanter, or cleric, I can use snare (or root if the mob can't summon)  Many of my warrior's weapons I buy with RNG/SHD usability in mind.  Like the WMBS.  My ranger is my for fun and relaxation char.  My warrior is going to be the same as my rogue.  Married to having to have a group and slow grinding AA.  :/<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran into a ranger last night in an LDoN group.  I was wielding both the CHoS and SotB.  4 rapid procs from the CHoS and 2 from the SotB and I STILL couldn't get aggro off the ranger.  The chanter had to mem blur it.  Generally I don't have aggro problems per se, but this guy just had a death wish.<br />
<br />
It looked like he had Defiance and Swiftwind.  He was casting or proccing some fire based spell like crazy.  I have cast msgs off because of my rogue (too much spam) and I haven't quite yet made a multiwindow warrior setup since the patches keep invalidating my UI lately.  It's possible it was Call of Fire, but he could've been using flame lick and immolation too.  More than likely, the latter. <br />
<br />
<br />
He caused us to flee the LDoN zone once because he was too intent on stealing aggro to snare one of the pigs we were fighting.  It ran off.  6 friends came back.  /disc evasive and &quot;ZONE NOW!&quot;  After zoning he's like, &quot;Where the heck did those come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
At one point, he asked me if I needed arrows because I was prox aggroing mobs.  I tried to explain to him I was trying to get only 1 or 2, instead of the whole room.  I guess that didn't click because later he ended up bringing a train of 4 onto us.  Fortunately the chanter was pretty darned good.<br />
<br />
Finally we get the assassination mob spawn emote.  I had a good idea where the boss would be, so I'd been clearing to that point anyway.  The ranger immediately pipes up and informs us he is going to use Trueshot on the boss.   I had to remind him, as I called him, &quot;Mr. Trueshot&quot; to keep up on snaring the mobs because we almost had 2 more train instances with runners.  Once we engage the boss, I never saw his bow cackle.  Ah well, no biggy.  The necro and shammie pets were in the way anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the cleric and chanter were saying anything to the guy in tells, but they sent me quite a few.  It was actually amusing.  I don't think they'll ever group with him again either haha.  Consequently, he never once casted Jolt.  I didn't have msgs on, but I had particles on.<br />
<br />
Monks, SKs, or Necros, I just tell them to FD.  Smart rogues will tog attack off and evade a time or two.  The dumb ones, I explain to them what DPS means.  Wizards I just tell them to burn dots for their self rune because if they're that intent on burning the mob down, they're gonna need it before I get aggro back.  In the 50s, the idea of using dots makes them think twice about overnuking (/shrug, don't ask me why)<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation guys, rogues get pissed at the same kind of thing (my main is a 65 time rogue.)  We hate ping-pong.  We hate getting riposted.  We hate missing backstabs.  We hate dying due to LHA because someone else couldn't control their aggro and the AE and ripostes knocked us into the dead zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll start carrying around a copy of Jolt or two and offering them out, even on raids (don't laugh)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also grouped with Clerics that DD'd instead of healing <br />
<br />
I've run into a few of those too and literally have to plead with them to CH me before I go and do another pull.  I don't want them to get instant aggro because I'm down 2500 hitpoints and they wait till I've got incoming to heal me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have reciently had Rangers tell me that the Great Blade of Storms is not a warrior weapon. <br />
<br />
Traditionally, it's a rot drop that rangers get if the guild's usually got BoCs or better for their warriors.  But I'd rather see a warrior with one over a ranger.  They get their fancy DD proc thingie from Torment, and TONS of Sparkling Shortswords will drop in Air.  <br />
<br />
I seem to recall some RNG only toy from Bert as well.<br />
<br />
Another rot drop that they tend to pick up is that Obsidian Scimmy from Tactics.  I have the dagger version which I call the aggro magnet (it procs like mad even in offhand) and I snicker whenever I see a ranger with one.  By and large, rangers who main gear aggro wepons, are dead on every single raid encounter unless they Trueshot.  I'd laugh, except they end up taking a bunch of others down with them.  Ranger melee raid dps 5%, first wave of cleric pet dps 8% before the AE kills them (when they're allowed to use them)<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues have a saying.  Dead rogues do no damage.  The rangers and some of the knights, haven't figured this out yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the real problem is, not so much that these weapons and such have flooded the market.  It's that EQ's learning curve isn't as harsh as it used to be and that the newbies read about the exploits of the EP and Time geared, high AA folks and think they can do the same.  There's a HUGE difference when you have 6k unbuffed HP, ID5, LR5 and 1600ac vs the average ranger of say 3k hp at 65 with maybe 1100ac (that's being generous) and no defensive AA.<br />
<br />
The hybrids are going through now, what the monks did pre-nerf.  All the new goodies are enabling them to do now, what only the really skilled could do before.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the otherside of the coin, I see warriors picking weapons purely from the XP dps point of view (or more notably for 2boxing) with less aggro management in mind.  When their turn is up to tank in Time, I make sure my Escape hotkey page is up because I KNOW we're going to wipe.  All the clerics are going to be dead before said tank gets aggro for a brief 10 seconds before he's dead  from no heals.  XPing with these guys is on par with a level 60 warrior still using 2 lammies.  It's futile for any kind of DPS class to effectively play with them.<br />
<br />
SKs go for that Hedge sword, which is great for tanking.  Not so great when you're not tanking.  A Heavy Windrider's lance beats the Windblade for the same reasons the WMBS does.<br />
<br />
So it's not just a ranger thing (I'm not deliberately trying to bash them, they just abuse it the most because the ranger population is huge nowdays)  It's across the board.  The solution?  New AA maybe.  Or perhaps new non AA based skills.  SoE should have learned by now that the item fix hasn't worked in the past.  It's not going to work now.  I honestly believe the reason SoE's been so reluctant about giving rogues high damage daggers outside of EP and Time is directly tied to how and where they want warrior aggro to be at.  We're limited based on the tank's limitation.  Our class is entirely built around that.  So the only conclusion I can come up with is, this is in fact SoE's intention.  The anger augs, and the new LDoN weapons are merely a cork to plug up the dam.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see very few new warriors playing.  The vast majority I've run across are twinks who for the most part will NOT be replacing warriors leaving the game in other guilds.  And when I say that, I mean players who stick with it to hit 60, then 65.  Instead, I see tons of hybrids because soloing for them is 10 times easier than it was last year.  50 times easier than it was the year before that.  And so on.  That hits a brick wall in the 60s, but by then it's too late and they're pretty set in their ways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">ranna's post about rangers reminded me about something that happened to me loooooong ago. i was playing my ranger, he was lvl 18 at the time and just got a group in oasis at the orc highway. this other *twinked* ranger with maybe like 200 more hp than me at lvl 14 insists on tanking. i endlessly tell him that i should probably do it since i'm a higher lvl and most of the mobs to him are red. he goes on and on, blah blah blah, until i just tell him to go for it...so 2 mins and 6 mobs later we're running. he dropped like a rock (and was a crappy puller). i explain to him that even with his extra hp, the 20 extra points i have in dodge, parry, and defensive will make me take full damage less often. anyhoo, he has a hissy fit and disbands the group. <br />
<br />
point being, in 2 years, these guys are now lvl 60+ and with the better gear out now (i learned tailoring and MADE armor for my ranger) it's just that much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Man, the point about knights soloing is so true. I remember playing my wizard in LDoN once; he was 55 at the time, with a 55 pally tank.<br />
<br />
For some reason, the pally could NOT keep agro. He tanked maybe 1 mob out of 10 (until we wiped and decided that we won't win with everyone BUT the tank taking hits and gave it up).<br />
<br />
Now, mind you, this was after the pally was repeatedly told to chain stun. He still couldn't hold agro. Everyone in the group disbanded, then reformed without the guy and his friend (who was a 50 warrior) a few minutes later when we all ended up LFG anyway.<br />
<br />
Now, this is the funny part: the pally's warrior friend was giving me grief, something about wizards always overnuking and then blaming others for their mistakes. I set about explaining how agro works to him, and in the course of the conversation it turned out that the pally was chain stunning. He was indignant when I suggested otherwise. <br />
<br />
You see, he had his lvl 52 stun up, Force, and was chain stunning! You know - cast Force (2.5 sec cast), wait 18 sec for it to refresh, cast it again. Not the 54 stun (12 sec recast), that one was useless since it did no damage! Not his fault that stuns has a long recast, and don't tell him how to play his class cause he soloed to 55 and never had a problem holding agro.<br />
<br />
My jaw dropped. Never had a problem holding agro when soloing? No shit. What's more, he had the nerve to tell me not to blame him and give clear instructions next time when I ask him to chain stun. I mean, you can't expect a lvl 55 paladin to have multiple stuns up, can you? <br />
<br />
We all added a pally to &quot;do not group with list&quot; that night lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To a warrior, the Droga weapons are pure aggro getters, and that's that.  The stun effect is incidental; nice when it interrupts a caster, otherwise, yawn-worthy.  You see, when a warrior wants to interrupt a caster, she can kick, or bash, or slam.  What really matters about those procs is that they create hate.<br />

To a monk, the Copper Hammer of Striking is a chance to interrupt casting.  (Yes, there's the Dragon Punch AA skill, but that's a way in the future for most monks who would use a CHoS.)  The only other weapon they can realistically get in these level ranges which interrupts casting is a T-staff.<br />
<br />
And in all honesty, if Mend (and later Stonestance) is up, then it sometimes makes sense for a non-pulling monk to take aggro.<br />
<br />
However, if grouped with other people who can stun and it's important to focus aggro on the warrior, then I'd say your monk should be bagging her CHoS.<br />
<br />
Rangers using Droga weapons is something I don't understand at all, but then, I've never played a ranger past level 25 or so, so I won't judge them.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;carrying around spare weapons&quot; - that's about the player, not the class.<br />
<br />
The type of person who reads messageboards about their class is usually the sort of person who's interested in acquiring and sharing knowledge and techniques.  That puts them in the upper couple of quartiles of EQ players almost automatically.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of pickup group weekend warriors out there who have one or two weapons on their person in total - maybe another if you count their bow.  Those aren't the sort of people who visit their class messageboard, though; if they had, they'd have learned about the benefits of having all the funky weapons in their bags and would probably have made the effort to acquire them.<br />
<br />
I'm no great fan of monkly business, but if you popped over there and asked, I'm sure you'd find that most of the posters had at least one stun-proccing weapon in their bags at all times - because they're the thinkers.  But in a pickup group, you'll get plenty of monks who are one weapon combo wonders.</div></div><hr />
