<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took down Glykus in PoTactics last night with a single group, but took like 4 attempts.  We ended up jus getting pissed off and grabbing 2 clerics, 2 encs, a drood, and me, and ended up owning him with 3 charmed pets, but it was still tough and we almost wiped out.  Is there any sure-fire way to take this guy down with a single group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like you have already found a good strat :p.<br />
<br />
Seriously you HAVE to understand, that some things weren't DESIGNED to be done with a single group. So, by this deduction, doing it with a single group is going to be risky by definition. The only way to do him with a single group is pretty much with charmed pets. There's always a bit of luck involved with this (charms not breaking at bad times and eating people). <br />
<br />
Any kind of strat requiring the very minimum of people is going to rely heavily on luck. That's why you usually bring more people: to eliminate the possibility of bad luck costing you your time and effort or what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Twinblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One way to get it done safe is..... kill him fast. No, stop the boos and throwing eggs, I mean, kill him really FAST.<br />
<br />
Forget about how to handle those pigs when this 'pig master' HP gets low, just focus on taking him down, all melee with offensive disc on, wizzy/amge/whatever starts nuke like hell when it's 60%. Once he's down, those pigs are gone, and u will have a happy time to loot the wand (common), silk robe pattern (uncommon) and most important....Splitblade of Destruction;)</div></div><hr />

Braeorn</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why not Chatja?<br />
<br />
PoP tier 3+ issues only please.<br />
<br />
As for Glykus, bring DPS and have a dr00d or a wizard kite the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's another good point, what defines a tier? ;)  <br />
<br />
Tier 1 I would assume is the zones that you get when you start out...<br />
<br />
Tier 2 would be the zones that you unlock from those zones right?<br />
<br />
PoS/PoV from PoJ, CoD from PoD, PoNb from PoN, and Umm Tactics from PoI?</div></div><hr />

Last I checked, cash farming single groupable mobs is definately part of the &quot;high end&quot; gamer's agenda.  Not to mention that Glykus is found in PoTactics, which happens to be tier3.<br />
<br />
Oh and P.S.  he dropped silk robe pattern and I landed it with a 95 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is really a battlefield thread.  Moved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Twinblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, those spawned porkchops will despawn when their master is dead.<br />
<br />
On top of that, if u not kill the Pig Master fast enuff, those pigs keep grows in a incredible rate, their name will change, harder and harder for chanters to mezz and finally not mezzable.<br />
<br />
My group lastime (b4 knowing this) decided to play with the piggies and see if they drop anything good. We turn up finally with a near wipe (thanks for the druid who decided to nuke Glykus dead instead of healing me!):o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Couldnt 3+ be viewed as 4 included and above? Can in my langauge anyway p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seeing as this is my first post, a round of ale for all. :)  I have viewed this board for a long time now and this mention of Glykus has moved me to finally post.  He is the only Tactics mini I have yet to defeat.  You may think I am BSing you, but I saw a group of 3 people take him out.  It was an enchanter, cleric, and druid trio as I recall.   During this fight the pigs never came.  It really baffled me and ever since, I have been playing with him trying to figure him out completely.   Soon Glykus, soon you will die.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The pigs came for us, we just had 2 encs mezzing, and a druid kiting em away until they were mezzed.  with 3 pets he went down fairly quick, but I still needed both clerics casting nonstop heals to stay up... it just seemed quite problematic, and thought there might be a better way /shrugs<br />
<br />
Thanks for the insight, apparently there's no better way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's another good point, what defines a tier?  <br />

PoS/PoV from PoJ, CoD from PoD, PoNb from PoN, and Umm Tactics from PoI?<br />

<br />
Except that the quest way to get into tactics is from a tier2 zone (PoS), just like the BoT key (which I haven't ever heard classified as tier2)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tactics is really tier 2 and three both.  It should have been tier 2, but they scrapped the plane of war right before PoP was released, so now Tactics is a tier two plane with tier 3 content (RZ script).  It is harder to get into than the other tier two planes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i dont think u can do this without a real tank anymore since the pet nerf, but its still one groupable, you shouldnt lose anyone at all.<br />
<br />
defensive tank gets chain chs, runes, druid heals - some melee person runs the piglets around. hasted pets ownz named. i believe the group makeup was me, 2 enchanters, druid, ranger and a cleric. if you can get other buffs before doing it, would help too, i might have been raid buffed, not sure. shaman or mage would be real handy too, charm works so much better with sinia.<br />
<br />
if you get some duel wielding warrior pets, he will die. forget the name, one of the ogres is a rogue, hes not as good dmg as the warrior, but close.</div></div><hr />
