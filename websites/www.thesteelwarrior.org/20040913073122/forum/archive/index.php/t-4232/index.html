<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I disagree with the more radical Wariors and Knights in this whole discussion. IMO Warriors should not have substandard aggro or be the only choice to tank.<br />
<br />
Unlike some, I like Knights. However, I don't want SoE to have them eating from the Warrior bowl. We have always been The Tank. With all of the aggro abilities Knights have, it was never unbalancing until they had Warrior-like survivability against mobs.<br />
<br />
Tank = survivability + aggro control<br />
<br />
Allow Knights functionally matching survivabilty and superior aggro control and Warriors are not competative - even leaving out the rest of their spellbooks.<br />
<br />
I believe all three classes should be effective Tanks. That means at least enough survivability and aggro control to get the job done to their group's satisfaction.<br />
<br />
In principle I think if any of the three classes can not achieve 80% (number pulled out of a hat) of the best survivability and aggro of the other two it's not viable.<br />
<br />
I believe that beyond the two fundamental Tanking characteristics are the differences that should distinguish one class from the other. These differences should encourage stackability and a raid role while not giving any one class dominence.<br />
<br />
While they should have aggro control at least 80% as good as the other two Tank classes, Warriors should have limited ability to manipulate aggro. They should be able to exchange DPS and  defense at will with only something like Defensive being their hallmark ability and having a long refresh. In a group or raid where they aren't MTing Warriors should be able to select greater melee DPS output. They should have little &quot;utility&quot;. In exchange for this, Warriors should have a substantial survivability advantage. &quot;Beef&quot; should be the Warrior's distinguishing characteristic.<br />
<br />
Knights should excell at utility - they have spellbooks.<br />
<br />
In my view Paladins are very very well constructed. The only thing I can think of to give them is a short duration (1 minute?) self buff with a long refresh (20 minutes?) that gives them Defensive and a simular group buff that increases their group's melee DPS with a refresh limiting it to every 2nd or 3rd fight - maybe a three minute refresh. A better heal, falling far short of CH, would also be useful.<br />
<br />
SK's are in bad shape IMO. They need Unholy Forge and Slay - capabilites as melee-centric as the Paladin abilities. I think they should get the best Necro pet. Finally I think their ability to debuff a mob shouldn't be a paltry 50AC - it should be 10% of the mob's AC. (I'm probably going overboard - but SK's need an adjustment).<br />
<br />
Knight's spells should not be just a sub-set of their caster parent classes. Their utility should be sufficient to offset the Warrior survivability advantage (&quot;Beef&quot;) when it's ALL (except for spells needed to attain aggro) used for that purpose. When not MTing, their spellbook should make them very group friendly, encourage stackability, and give them a solid raid role.<br />
<br />
Tanks should share the same fundamental ability to tank. SoE needs to design named mobs around the special abilities of each and use Knight spells and Warrior offense/defence flexability to encourage stackability.<br />

Hmmm let me guess: <br />
Paladin.<br />

Dude, you are *not* the tanking class... *We* are the tanking class.  reread your post, and while you are at it, make sure you give yourself 2 pats in the back.</div></div><hr />

You need to do your homework on SKs. For example, on Xate's last 1 on 1 run in with Zlandicar, he healed himself for 30,000 points of damage dealt in just taps/disci. SK's are monsters. A very, very powerful class, and one I've been powering up for the past two weeks. The two hybrid tank classes are actually quite excellent when compared against each other. They both have very unique traits and abilities that are very useful to raids, experience groups, and soloing. Any kind of upgrade like that to SK's would give them massive advantages over Paladins. <br />
<br />
Their advantages over Warriors should go without saying, it's been beaten to death on these boards.</div></div><hr />

Are you crazy? They are a puller/snarer/tank in one slot,  can out solo and  dps both warriors and paladins as well as provide mana regen and attk buffs.<br />
<br />
Best necro pet? Jesus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yehan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well now time to eat crow, because I can't read and play at the same time :)<br />
<br />
I do apologize to Battleblade as I have found out that he is not a paladin after all lol.<br />
<br />
His post  here however, appears to favor the paladin class far  far more  than it is at the present time.<br />
<br />
So I ask, what gives??</div></div><hr />

For further examples of these stages, see pretty much everywhere else in The Outhouse.) He's bargaining with the knight classes hoping that something will get done.<br />
