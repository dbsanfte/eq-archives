<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vord</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an amazing fight monday night, our guild won the Barxt encounter in our first attempt. We knew a little about it, including the waves of adds (we werent sure how many) and that the named went live, then quiet, then live again. The rest we just winged it, and the rush when we won it was huge :)<br />
<br />
Some highlights included a 12600 LoH on me while tanking him, numerous crazed kiting efforts and lots more I wont go into so others can experience this fun event as we did.<br />
<br />
My question is, has any other guild had the luck we did in a first attempt at this? With so many variables in this really well thought out encounter, we were wondering whether we were the only ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, just posted about our 8th failure in the Outhouse.  Been a tough learning process, most of our attempts have been understrength, and failed at several times due to wipes on the trap mobs.  Took us a few times before someone noticed what the text was saying about doing the enraged and furious mobs.  And our first real shot at Barxt ended early because we assigned the healing wrong, not realizing the relative toughness of Barxt and the Golem.  Tonight, our second real shot at him ended with the last raider dying with Barxt still on his feet with 0% health...<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you had a little more info on this zone than we did when we started.  Grats though, its a tough event, takes a lot of good players to make it through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vord</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant the Barxt event, the rest of Uqua took us weeks of painful exploring, learning it all. Its a very unforgiving zone, and to finally have defeated it is a huge relief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, other guilds have done it aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vord it was most likely due to one of your more talented warriors shitting his pants and hitting AET/Fort when he saw a fuckton of adds pop... wonder who that was?  Yar Uqua is hella fun to learn.. but FFS I need to do some more regular exp. =/  Soooo glad to have it figured out finally!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Barxt event isnt really hard in the technical sense (Ok gets tricky with the adds).<br />
<br />
1st Try : 24%<br />
2nd Try : Killed<br />
3rd Try : Killed<br />
4th Try : Wiped 8% (still had the AE Going)<br />
5th Try : Killed<br />
<br />
After spening weeks in various stages of &quot;Uqua Prenerf&quot; the zone seems like a walk in the park now.<br />
Its a LOT easier, and actually enjoyable because very unforgiving.<br />
(Euro server = Funky patch Rythm, we usually are for 5 to 45 days behind).<br />
<br />
To me Uqua remains probably the most enjoyable zone ever made.<br />
That ended up in the absolute Clusterfuck, because they had to cockblock guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we beat Barxt on our first attempt and were elated. Made our second attempt last night and we made a fatal error. We tried to maximize flagging and swapped in too many people. We inadventently set ourselves up with the minimum required classes and blew it. Live and learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistiv</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some guilds used a charm exploit to beat it the first time. gimps</div></div><hr />

Or the Uba Pet bug :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was waaay smoother than our last attempt, and the end loot isn't half bad either.<br />
<br />
Qvic ahoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vord</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats Nayl!<br />
<br />
We didn't have the same luck our second attempt. We got him to 15% then wiped, which made us realise how fortunate we were the first time. <br />
Ah well he dies next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very much a learn over time zone.  Still hate that last add trap, bastards never path the way ya want them too :\  Thinking back to the barxt learning &gt;&lt;.  attempt 1, 24 adds + channelers + barxt dosen't go away at 33%.  attempt 2-8 &quot;good job guys, but it dosen't look like barxt will re-aggro, let's punt out and we'll try again when lockout is off, maybe it'll be working then...&quot; what a waste of a month and a half</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gundahar</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We needed 3 attempts for Barxtt itself to take him down. It's just a matter to do stuff in right order. Once you learned the script it's a cakewalk and uqua becomes a farm zone if you are bored enough.</div></div><hr />

Heh welcome to Uqua. Fun thing is it really stresses a lot on your tanks ability to work together and peel off those trap mobs fast. Theyll get the hang of it soon enough.. .</div></div><hr />

/nod.. this is the most tank demanding zone I've ever seen :)</div></div><hr />
