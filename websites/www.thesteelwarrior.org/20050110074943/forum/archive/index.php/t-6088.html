Bertuzzi should get suspended for the rest of the season, including playoffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for hockey itself the rules put in over the last dozen years have taken all the honor out of it. You used to settle a beef with someone with your fists face to face or better yet by beating the other guys team. Now with all the instigation penalities and such the cowards get to take cheap shots and get shielded from retribution. If that had happen ten years ago the next puck drop would have had an enforcer mauling the guy with the refs swallowing the whistle. <br />
<br />
If he's paralyzed the bastard should go to jail. And better yet his team should be fined. Not because they did or didn't tell him to do it. But just because a message has to be sent.</div></div><hr />

I've heard people arguing for a shorter penalty by using the defense that Bertuzzi snapped, but listening to other guys who have done 'revenge' moves for a teammate that was cheapshotted, and all of them basically confronted the other person face to face.<br />
<br />
 Basically when Matt Cooke fought Moore in the first period, that should have been the end of it. The funny thing is, if you watch the entire ESPN segment from last night's sportscenters about it, who was the guy blasting what McSorley did to Brashear....good ole Todd Bertuzzi.</div></div><hr />

His head snapped back when he hit and as they continued sliding across the ice Bertuzzi KEPT HITTING him. The man's unconcious and his neck is broken and he keeps hitting him, there is no way Bertuzzi should ever play in the NHL again.</div></div><hr />

Damn man I didn't know it was that bad.  I just heard the follow-up blurb this morning on ESPN on my way to work.  Taking a guys career away is just wrong.  Just glad he didnt get killed (just a bit of bad luck mighta done it).</div></div><hr />

But this?  This is savagry at the very worst.  It's one thing to give a guy a bloody nose.  It's another to break his neck and beat him while he's unconcious.  Give the fucker some real jailtime.  It's hockey, not fucking mortal combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Bertuzzi did was unforgiveable.<br />
<br />
He should be banned from the NHL period.<br />
Indeed, hockey should drum him out and use his name and image as a warning to young hockey players everywhere.<br />
<br />
A hit is a hit... and a cheap shot is a cheap shot...<br />
I am all for taking you man, and doling out the punishment that the game of hockey is based on.<br />
However, Bertuzzi broke the unspoken and unwritten code that all hockey players live by.<br />
<br />
The other team should be bruised and intimidated... but not permanenetly wounded.<br />
Any attempt to directly wound someone permanently is beyond the game, and thus against the code.  This code is often bent...  but rarely broken.  It is a very sad day to see hockey besmirched so.<br />
<br />
If hockey players did not obey this code, and they all behaved as Bertuzzi did, there would be many deaths per MONTH in the NHL.<br />
(You guys realize a hockey player in equipment is a collection of deadly weapons right?)  Its nothing short of a miracle that serious injuries aren't the norm in hockey.  Only the code and the armor these people wear stand between hockey players and a great deal of blood.<br />
<br />
Luckily for Bertuzzi, he wasn't powerful/crazy enough to do any permanent damage.<br />
<br />
Drum him out...  fine him into bankruptcy...  heavily fine the team that let him have so much leash.<br />

<br />
 Bertuzzi to be suspended for the rest of the regular season, and the playoffs this year. He must apply for reinstatement with the league office prior to next season, which isn't a guarantee that he'll be reinstated (see Marty McSorley), and the Vancouver Canucks were fined $250,000.<br />
<br />
 Woulda liked to have seen them give Marc Crawford some sort of penalty for the whole 'bounty' issue on Moore before the game, and like I said before, for the fact that teams coached by him just happen to regularly be involved in nasty incidents.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back it up a step or 2 here...<br />
<br />
No one knows that Moore's career is over: from the media reports he has shown zero signs of any nerve/spinal cord damage. He HAS shown syptoms of post concussion effects/syndrome (which has led to some players retiring but not usually form the first shot).<br />
<br />
Now for all you people that want to trash hockey as a cesspool of violence, how long since you have seen a bench clearing brawl in any sport? About the last 10 I have seen have been in baseball. How many of you watch boxxing? I caught some comments in an intermission on ABC's NHL coverage and Bill Clement and John Davidson brought this up. How is throwing a baseball at 90mph at someone's head, or spearing someone with a football helmet less dangerous? <br />
<br />
Bertuzzi did a stupid and reprehensible thing for which he recieved an open ended suspension: he is gone for at least the last 12 games of Vancouver's season (and the forfeiture of $500K), their entire playoff run (which with him in the lineup would have been at least 2 rounds, maybe 3 depending on who they played) and he has to appear before the NHL commissioner before he can be re-instated... which IF Moore's recovery is prolonged may be a while.<br />
<br />
I think the thing most people are missing here however is the fact that the NHL's officiating strategy (or lack thereof) led to the hit: the NHL refuses to enforce their own rules with regards to interfernce, obstruction and stickwork. Bertuzzi's hit was in retaliation for a cheap shot, by Moore, that put Vancouver's top player, Markus Naslund, out for 3 games, for which Moore was not penalized. The NHL needs to grow some balls and either call the infractions more consistently (they have 2 linesmen AND 2 referees FFS), or do things like remove the instigator rule so that players can police themselves without hurting their teams.<br />
<br />
And to those who said this was worse than McSorley's stickwork: go get some new glasses.</div></div><hr />

Hockey will never get very big as a sport as long as they allow as much fighting and grabbing as they do. They need to tone it down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hockey's at its best when there is fighting and brawling. When it was allowed more it instated a code of conduct. If you cheap shot someone expect the biggest brawler on his team to come gunning for you next puck drop. You hit someone clean on the other hand and its all in the game. Point of fact a lot of the known fighters in hockey will go out of their way to do another guy's team a favor and drop the gloves to get the teams and the crowd fired up. Sounds crazy but some of the most exciting things in sports happen when two player collide, be it at home plate or against the boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm the deficiencies of NHL officiating does not rationalize grabbing someones jersey from behind, suck punching them to side of their head, knocking them out and then riding their head into the ice with no other support with your weight on their back. Thats just whacked.  Not saying the NHL doesnt need better officiating; just saying you can't pin completely out of bounds behaviour on it.<br />
<br />
If he had come at him straight on and had cleaned his clock, good hockey.  That cowardly crap is just that; gutless.  And multiple cracked vertebrae is no joke...I'd not downplay his injuries.<br />
<br />
I went to a Devil's game the other day; the skills of Hockey players is just unreal in person, the hand eye coodrination, skating skills and just plain toughness makes for a great damn live sport.  The sad part is most folks only see the kinda crap this idiot pulled and will never see live Hockey.<br />
<br />
About the last 10 I have seen have been in baseball <br />
<br />
Name one fight that actually threatened someone's life.  And Don Zimmer don't count :D<br />
<br />
They should cancel the guys suspension and let him play. Think about all the other players gunning for his head he will get his ass kicked in every day guarantee. <br />
<br />
Waiting to see someone get seriously isn't a sport; its Rollerball (the old movie from the 70s with James Caan).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Moore hit on Naslund was a bit late and was elbow to head contact (Moore crooks his arm and the elbow goes out before contact). It was worth a 2 minute penalty at the very least. It DID show a flagrant lack of respect to one the NHL's best players and sent him out for 3 games with a concussion. In a game without the instigator rule, Vancouver would have been able to respond pretty much immediately, however they were just expected to grin and bear it, as their leading scorer and team captain (i.e. Meal Ticket) is put out of the game.<br />
<br />
This does not excuse what Bertuzzi did, anymore than Donald Brashear's taunting of the Boston Bruins excused Marty McSorley whacking him upside the head with his stick,  BUT IT CONTRIBUTES TO IT. And both cases were at least minor violations of the rules triggering the more serious events (elbowing for Moore and Brashear's little hand dusting after each fight he thinks he won is taunting thus unsportsmanlike conduct).<br />
<br />
If he had come at him straight on and had cleaned his clock, good hockey. And why do you think Bertuzzi followed him up and down the ice? He wanted a fight. Denied that (Moore had fought once in the game previously and got the best of I think Matt Cooke), he took a shot, hoping to provoke (another) one. I don't think it was as much driving his head into the ice as it was being off balance and trying to keep swinging at the same time (anticipating that Moore would fight back not be out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The guy was going to get payback for the Naslund hit, there's no doubt about it. This went overboard, suspension was given, all the parties involved got punished. Case closed really, but the media won't let this ratings cashcow go away. Even after the fact we're slowly being told the injuries are nowhere near the &quot;BROKEN NECK&quot; that flagrantly blasted all over the media (including every daily morning talkshow that probably doesn't even know how to spell hockey) they're finding every bit of dirt there is to print.<br />
<br />
It is really just a media wildfire in a league that's largely devoid of &quot;trash content&quot; for the media to goto town with. Sadly it is also a league being run into the ground by mr. basketball bettman so I just see it getting worse and turning into a progressive dungfest that inhabits the NBA and NFL media coverage weekly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Moore's going to make a full recovery, and at least one spinal expert said he'd be able to return to hockey after some rehab. But yeah the core of the issue is that the NHL created a bunch of unnecessary rules that led to the current state of the game. <br />
<br />
 Stupid rules like moving the nets forward from 11&quot; to 13&quot;, dropping the tag up rule, the instigator rule, etc.<br />
<br />
 Thankfully they've begun to rescind some of these idiot rules beginning with the next season that actually happens. It's kind of funny to see people talking about how useless 'enforcers' would be today. If there has been ANY benefit to the instigator rule it's that those who would be enforcers, were forced to prove that they had more of an all around game (defense, some sort of scoring touch etc.), but it's pretty safe to say that dropping the instigator rule would while having a short term increase in fighting, be a long term solution to a lot of the stickwork and interference that goes on a nightly basis.<br />
<br />
 Regardless, the problem in Bertuzzi's case as was in McSorley's case is that he should have either shoved Moore so he was facing him to get him to drop the gloves, or just flat out skated to catch up/pass him to challenge him.</div></div><hr />

Both relativily boring unless theres a fight.But that kind of incident is an excellent example of sumeone who needs lubbins from Bubba.Totally uncalled for.Riding someone into the ice like that deserves serious penalties to prevent it from ever happening again.<br />
<br />
Btw.The only baseball game I watched in 2 years just happened to include the Don Zimmer/Pedro Martinez Incident.Talk about good timing.Otherwise Baseball is about exciting to watch as watching paint dry :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
??<br />
<br />
an entire NHL's team ( minus detroit ) prob equals 2 or 3 plaers on any random baseball team. and this is after! player's salaries were increased during the boom of the 80's or so when hockey started becoming mainstream.<br />
<br />
Baseball can die a horrible death and i wouldn't even blink an eye i'll agree; but hockey is finally getting the media boost it's needs for exposure and it's coming into the mainstream is a good thing..how many time growing up as a little kid i'd go to my friend's house and listen to game on the short-wave radio on 'hockey night in canada' because the only games you could actually watch were once a year or so ( not counting stanley cup ) here in the US.<br />
<br />
unfortunately, it's costing canada their teams. /mourn winnipeg and quebec. their dollar is so weak it doesn't even pay to play in canada for a NHL team when you can play on a US team and reap the profits of a better salary and marketing/economy.<br />

<br />
 Typical football game has between 120-140 plays and runs ~3 hours.<br />
<br />
 Typical baseball game has between 70-90 plays and runs ~3 hours.*<br />
<br />
 Typical hockey game will run about 100-150 actions from one end of the ice to the other and lasts ~2 hours.**<br />
<br />
 There's not THAT much to differentiate in a typical sporting event as far as events as far as I can see, outside of baseball's slower pace, which is offset by the larger strategy component. Basketball I won't throw in any analysis because they take what's normally a well-paced event and if it's not a complete blowout in the 4th quarter, the last 5 minutes of play take a good 20-25 minutes to complete.<br />
<br />
 *assuming average 1 baserunner per inning minimum.<br />
 <br />
 **assuming 20 shots per team and 30 plays broken up in neutral zone or offensive end without a shot minimum.</div></div><hr />
