<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did not change any NPCs.  I did change your character into a toad, tho.<br />
<br />
The spell vendors are not there at all.  Those other NPCs are there for other reasons.<br />
<br />
I feel safe saying that here, since no casters will come and turn me into a toad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tells from the NPCs is just a way to reduce spam.  While it is nicer to have NPCs talking so that the world seems alive (you know, it's pretty eerie to see five people sitting there, staring at each other, but you KNOW they are talking, you just can't hear it), in places like Abysmal where there are a LOT of NPCs with stuff to say in a tight place, sometimes we have to reduce the spam.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its a good idea, but i feel like a dumbarse for tryin to send one back! haha</div></div><hr />

absor &quot;no you didn't...&quot;<br />
told absor &quot;i like GoD so far, just have a problem with the boat being so slow, i want to see the ship city, happy release day&quot;<br />
absor &quot;thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
absor tells the zone, &quot;where are the boats&quot;<br />
told absor(tell) &quot;bard code is close to the boat code again -_-?&quot;<br />
absor tells you &quot;hehe thats my secret plan!&quot;<br />
i tell the zone &quot;stop trying to break bards, you messed up the boats this time&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
hail trena pereira /trena pereira focuses on you<br />
<br />
trena pereira says(tell) ' you must be the one De'van[side note: GET THE TABLE] spoke to. i'm not looking for any of your help. i know that the mighty absor will return someday and until i am proven wrong i will continue to wait for him to arrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
told absor &quot;what is up with %T (trena pereira) sending tells to PCs, she knows you somehow heheh&quot;<br />
absor tell you &quot;top secret&quot;<br />
<br />
hope you dont mind me posting this absor, just see quite a bit of humor in it (like logging in to find my armor changed to pink)</div></div><hr />
