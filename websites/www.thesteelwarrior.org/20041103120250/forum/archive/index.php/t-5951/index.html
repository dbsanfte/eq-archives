<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kebilal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild is in VT...we are AoW/SSra capable...my goals for aggro weapons are BoC/BF/HG/GBoS. Current mainhand would then likely be my offhand.<br />
<br />
Just curious though on getting opinions about doing this:<br />
<br />
Club of Mad Researcher (15/20 + 75hps and 15agi + saves)<br />
auged with:<br />
<br />
the 3 damage + 2 cold damge aug <br />
Anger 3<br />
and +8dex/sta <br />
<br />
Total cost is 3750 points, and you would end up with a weapon like this:<br />
<br />
Damage: 20 (18+2)<br />
Delay : 20<br />
Proc: Anger 3<br />
Hps: 75<br />
AGI: 15<br />
DEX : 8<br />
STA: 8<br />
plus saves.<br />
<br />
Alot of points, but is it worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'ed want a weapon with more HP but if you wanted a DPS weapon for when you weren't tanking, that'ed definately be it at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could be I missed something but when I did research on what to put on the pointmerchant bought LDON weapons I did not find a 3dam/2cold damage augment, make sure you're not looking at an augment that only goes on two-handers or weapons with a delay higher than 30-40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IMO, the best possible path for you is:<br />
<br />
Pimary/Secondary<br />
Blood Frenzy(Force of YKesha)/Wrath's Edge(Anger III)<br />
<br />
Get Aten's gloves in VT<br />
BoW(Anger III)<br />
<br />
Get Ambidexterity, Tactical Mastery and WA5<br />
DBoW(Anger III)/Blood Frenzy(Force of YKesha)<br />
<br />
Other plaers use different setups. But the real point of my suggestion is that BF and Aten's gloves are very nearly PoTime quality and there is no need to replace them. Only because of heavily reposting mobs will you want to get a BoW.<br />
<br />
Wrath's Edge is a candidate for replacement before you get a BoW. But the most likely choices - CHSD, SotBS, BoC etc. aren't going to be that huge of an upgrade.<br />
<br />
I'd save my LDon points for weapon and 40HP augs. You're going to need them.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kebilal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The aug in quest Wolv is a Miraguls called Flattened Permafrost, type 6 applicable to weapons with a minimum delay 40.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses guys...was just an idea, because I am really set on a BF, but with the rarity of the drop am always looking at options. :)<br />
<br />
And for 3k+ points, saving it for other things is sound advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was in a hurry when I posted, meant to say:<br />
<br />
pointmerchant bought LDON onehanded weapons<br />
<br />
I know that augment existed for twohanders. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well if your guild is anything like mine you will see 10 blades of carnage for every hategiver or bloodfrenzy.  So figure on getting a BoC augging it with anger 3, and putting any other weapon you can in the offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Often overlooked is the weapon I mainhand, can be gotten with like 12-18 Level 65's people and not in demand. It has a 25% &quot;proc rate increase&quot; over normal and a solid inate hate proc (say 400-600 hate points as a wild guess).<br />
<br />
I'v offhanded my BoC (with AngerIII) for this weapon in the main.<br />
<br />
OSoW (AngerIII). <br />
