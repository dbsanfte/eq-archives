<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilwee Beasty</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering what is needed to open up the Ikk raids once you've beaten the three trials. We have one GM tradeskiller thats collected all the ground spawn drops.<br />
<br />
Now I hear though that there are things the entire guild needs to farm in Kod before people can do the raids? I've heard everyone who wants to go on a raid needs some drop off the ghosts....everyone needs to complete the summoner ring etc. Just wondering if anyone could clarify what all the entire guild (anyone who wants to do Ikk raids) needs to do, and what our people who have passed the three trials need to do.<br />
<br />
BTW, not looking for super spoilers, just what we need to complete...I.E everyone needs A and B, your raid getters need to have A, B, C and D.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinmari</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just did our first Ikkinz raid last night.  I don't really have much information, but I do know that only a group or so have passed 7, and only 1 has passed 8 and 9.  I'm pretty sure we only collected enough things from Kod`Taz for one person.  So, that leads me to believe not everyone needs to do these things to raid Ikkinz.  However, I don't know what &quot;everyone&quot; is required to do to progress further than Ikkinz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just have them do Trials 1-3 in Kod'taz and then follow the NPC text for the rest of the steps.</div></div><hr />
