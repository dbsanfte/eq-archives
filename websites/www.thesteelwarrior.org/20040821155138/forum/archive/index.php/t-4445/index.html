<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm amused by the comments I see about not wanting to have anything random when it comes to tanking.  Why is that bad??  Yes, knights can get initial agro via spells every time (not counting fizzles)...so what?  As long as we get compensating abilities I don't see that as a problem.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, it's a huge problem now because we don't have any compensating abilities...but it sounds like Sony is at least trying to address this imbalance.  Just because our abilities may (or may not) rely on RNG doesn't mean they won't be just as useful to a group as the initial agro lock knights get.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid of change - yes, it can suck sometimes, but it can also be very good...<br />
<br />
Give Sony a chance before you start bi***ing.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The fact that a Knight controls his input into the group is precisely why knights are favoured over warriors - because their aggro and spells are a 'sure thing' whenever they are needed. <br />
<br />
Even when a spell fizzles the knight can cast again within a second or two. When one of your skill opportunities comes up it can and will fail on occasion and then you wait until the next opportunity comes up in 10 seconds or 10 minutes to have another go at influencing combat. <br />
<br />
The knight is in control throughout, you are never in full control, people prefer the sure thing to the 'wow, if we're really lucky he might do some cool stuff'  character. <br />
<br />
THAT's why RNG abilities suck big time in comparison with stuff within your control. <br />
<br />
For random occurrances to make a big enough impact that people will take you over the sure thing will require the bonuses to be absolutely unmistakeable, not 'stunning a goblin for a combat round' at some unknown point during the fight.</div></div><hr />

So it's pulled, you fight for a few rounds and hurt your clerics mana a bit.  Shaman slows, it's a resist, and the mob goes after him.  You taunt, and taunt, and taunt, but it keeps failing.  Cleric can't heal shaman fast enough, and he dies.  Now, where did anyone do anything wrong?  The fact that people can die when they do nothing wrong is why it shouldn't be RNG based.  I've had this happen more times than I'd like to count.  Didn't proc, and people got killed.  This is the reason we are in the situation we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So what, things don't go as planned and maybe they go extremely bad...that's the way things go sometimes.  <br />
<br />
I've said it before and I'll say it again, auto-agro-lock trivilizes the game.  <br />
<br />
Playing a game I know I'm gonna win every time if I get the right setup is boring.  I want a challenge.  And, yes, I'm willing to deal with the fact that sometimes the luck will go against me and bad things will happen.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree there is currently an imbalance and as long as knights get insta-agro-lock and warriors don't get something that gives us equivalent utility, there will continue to be a problem.  I'm just not set on the only solution being to give us the same instant agro capabilities as knights.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 copper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with you, however so long as there is that alternative you're gonna find it pretty hard to get together a group that's happy with your lack of control. Therefore it certainly does matter. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Show me where I said I didn't want a challenge?  It's not there.  I'm not one of those people who want an easy game, as you make me out to be.  The point is, skill should go into it, that way it is primarily you who screwed up, not bad luck.  Theres a big difference between asking for a challenge, and hoping for good luck.  A difficult mob = challenge.  Relying on the RNG is not a challenge.  Why?  Because a challenge is something you can work through, not just sitting and hoping.  Anyone, gimp or very skilled, can sit and hope for the RNG, and succeed or fail, there is no challenge in that.  Whereas with a challenge the skilled person would succeed, and the gimp wouldn't.  Depending on the RNG basically lets gimps act as good as skilled people, if they get the right weapons.  Too many bad players out there as is, don't need to keep things where they do just as good as skilled players with the same weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't feel comfortable with your aggro capabilities, and don't want to rely on those random skills then:<br />
<br />
Either fire up Defensive disc on inc, and dont have the mob slowed straight away. The changes might allow you to reuse defensive fast enough for every mob.... as long as you don't waste Endurance on any &quot;openings&quot; or whatever else...<br />
<br />
OR maybe use up that Endurance based new skill we might get, that hasnt been announced yet.<br />
Since all that was announced are the new ideas... and some &quot;openings&quot; may be controlled,<br />
and some new skills may not rely on &quot;openings&quot;<br />
<br />
This is why the chat is happening, making sure we're contempt with this change.<br />
So instead of being pessimist, try being optimist, and looking for ways they could implement things that you think would fix us,<br />
and suggest it at the Chat, incase they havent thought of it yet.</div></div><hr />

us pessimists've suggested a very important change - Give us more control like what knights have! :p</div></div><hr />

I don't need to be lectured about an attitude I don't even have.  I'm slightly optimistic about the upcoming change, this post was about why the current situation is bad.  I know what I can do, been doing this for a long time.  My aggro is fairly good for a warrior, but everyone can have bad luck that can get people killed, no matter level, gear, or skill.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression your example with the shaman dying, was a glimpse of what would still happen once the upgrade went in.<br />
Ya, randomness sucks. But there's still a lot to be announced...<br />
<br />
but with the new LDoN procs, new decent weapons AND this change with openings and new skills...<br />
the chances for Warriors to gain aggro are leaping forward.<br />
We still won't have absolute control of it, leaving that advantage to Knights...<br />
but we won't be handicapped by it either.<br />
<br />
Using my BoW and Ykesha augment, I'm already quite pleased with my aggro, so I'll be lucky enough to use openings mostly for damage or whatever else we can do :D<br />
Those still less lucky with equipment, may be able to use openings to bring their overall Aggro to BoW equivalence.</div></div><hr />

As long as we get an equivalent utility to what knights currently bring to the table, I'll be happy.  (and as long as that utility is obtainable by casual gamers like myself...not just the upper 5%)<br />
<br />
I still don't mind the RNG idea, but I understand the posts for those that are against it...I think it just boils down to personal preference.  (again...RNG does decrease the value of anything that relies on it, so I do believe this should be taken into consideration when trying to balance the classes.)</div></div><hr />

If all classes had the randomness it wouldn't be as big a deal, but since only the warrior has random agro effectiveness it makes them overall worse than the Knights, even with a slight hp and avoidance bonus to warriors.<br />
<br />
Also, people don't like fighting once every 10-15 minutes in exp groups. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&lt;&lt;Playing a game I know I'm gonna win every time if I get the right setup is boring.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
i have a druid and a warrior. the warrior doesnt win every time and he is not boring. frustrating absolutely. not boring. my druid pulls 10 or 15 mobs at a time SO THAT it wont be boring because he could quad kite for months without dying. MONTHS. AND he would level twice as fast as my warrior in spite of the fact that he gets NO grouping bonus and no dungeon bonus. what is wrong here? whats wrong is my druid considers melee to be stupid becaue why should anyone take 3000 damage to kill one mob when my druid kills the same mob with zero damage?<br />
<br />
sony thought the problem was that soloers got too much experience so they upped the exp bonus for groups. but you never see 6 soloing druids group up and &quot;solo&quot; while getting the group bonus. why? because they would occupy half the zone if they did that and the lack of communication would lead to strife.<br />
<br />
whats wrong here?<br />
<br />
whats wrong is melee is broken. ALL melee is broken. palladins are like better than warriors not because their melee is better but because they get to cast spells. they have manna. warriors are the slime underneath scum (all melee are scum but the warriors are beneath them) because they have the double loss of being melee oriented AND not having manna.<br />
<br />
solution. improve all melee. improve warriors doubly.<br />
<br />
i always prefer 5 caster one warrior groups when playing my warrior because i know that since we only need one tank we should only have one tank.<br />
<br />
yes i play a warrior. im not trolling against you guys. im standing side by side with you guys frustrated that while my druid can work wonders my warrior can die in less time than it takes to cast  one heal.<br />
<br />
there was a thread about a chanter tanking a high end time encounter. my druid has been run over by snared groups of blue con mobs numbering 15 and lived. so how come my warrior can die before a heal comes in? because his mitigation is only probably 25 percent better than my druid thats why. that makes no sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">To the original question about whats bad with the RNG and the Challenge theme.<br />
<br />
When I was in my mid/end 50th fighting and pulling in Sebilis ( Kunark to Velious time ) beeing an experienced puller/tank was something to be noticed by others. No CR to D2 or chef was always better than begging for a summon corpse ..... . There it was a challange to be good to try new technics splitting ( with pumice ... ....  ) and all the stuff.<br />
<br />
This form of challenge is hard to find now in the game so all ppl. do most times is <br />
<br />
Pull one mob ( maybe 2 ) ( only interest is to pull fast not how .. )<br />
Tank them<br />
Kill them<br />
Next one.<br />
<br />
Risks ? Bleh <br />
<br />
The only risk you can have today is to choose a warrior as your tank cause it would be possible that someone is dying cause of the RNG. Therefore ppl. choose knight cause they do not want any form of risk. Maybe they take a warrior but it must be normally a &quot;fat one&quot; aka someone with a BoW and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Challenge ? Ha ... I remember ( long time ago ) when I was in a group in PoV chain pulling skeletons ( mostly 2 to 3 ), frogs (mostly 2 ) and worms  and group was going fine, chanter has fun, that one ( spanish one ) out of the group said. &quot;Here is not enough exp&quot; and after saying that 2 times he quitted the group. ( He had no flag for better zones )<br />
<br />
Lots of ppl. today do not want any challenge while exping. They want the max exp to gain out of their time.  Thats it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how randomness constitutes a challenge. It only generates frustration. I can see how dps abilities could be based on random openings, but utility abilities cannot be random, that simply doesn't make sense. What is the use of root if you cannot choose when to root for example? Very close to useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Playing a game I know I'm gonna win every time if I get the right setup is boring. I want a challenge. <br />
<br />
Randomly failing abilities does not present a challenge, just an annoyance.  Especially if those same abilities when used by another class do NOT randomly fail.  Would you consider it challenging if xp zones just randomly DT'd someone every 10 minutes or so?  You might fail because of it but I wouldn't call it a challenge...<br />
<br />
With predictable abilities, most groups have a 0% chance of losing an XP encounter unless someone screws up.  If you want a challenge you don't just make their abilities randomly fail, you take the group to a harder encounter where there is a chance of failure even if nobody screws up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the key point here is that the new melee abilities that are important for balancing things out are not attached to openings, and won't have any randomness to their use.<br />
<br />
Those abilities that are a part of the opening system, the reactive abilities, will allow the attentive melee player to outperform those that are not so attentive, and it should provide something engaging to do.<br />

The reason I'm asking is last night I was in my regular group and I was killed on the last mob because slow failed to land 4+ times in a row and the healer couldn't keep up with the damage.  This is with a group of people I've grouped with for almost a year, so we know each others playing styles and we work well together.  The mob was debuffed and slow normally lands on the first attempt and 95% of the time by the second attempt.  But, in this case it just would not land.<br />

<br />
RhevenClasses get a number of disciplines, activated by typing /discipline &lt;name of discipline&gt;.  Warriors get a bunch of 'em, and defensive is one we use often; probably the one we're known for.  Many raid mobs are designed with defensive in mind. (Tho non-warriors with other classes can tank the big raid mobs too, with appropriate gear and support.)  Different classes get different disciplines, and I believe they are limited to melee and hybrid classes.<br />

ON TOPIC::Originally posted by  Abynormal777<br />
For those of you that feel RNG should be effectively removed when getting agro, what do you think about chanters and slow?I thought that the complaint was that the RNG was too smeary and generally unreliable for random abilities, esp for something as class-defining as Taunt.  And esp. since the aggro component of spells is not random for some spells - resisted, immune, or landed stun pisses the critters off, all you gotta do is cast.  (True for all spells?  Although my understanding is that the SK Hate line is unpredictable.)  Add to that, the common perception that warriors cannot sustain aggro - after all, when taunt fails and procs don't proc, people playing other classes only notice when they get smacked and it's the disastrous failures that get noticed.  If there was a slowing class that could slow 100% of the time, first cast, that is the class people would want to group with for slowing.  There are tanks that can aggro a MOB 100% of the time (using spells), and warriors have been considered non-viable for their purpose by many.  It looks to me that this is going to be addressed, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I personally think the opening system is a welcome change. As it is right now I have to pay attention to everything going on now that i'm XPing in planar zones I don't have time to be sidetracked, I can't just hit 'a' and play GBA or watch TV like most of you can.<br />
<br />
The opening system will reward me for paying attention to the battle, with various nifty utilities such as stunning the mob, doing extra damage, avoiding damage, and whatever else SoE decides to add to it.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that thanks to the provoke line I'm (practically) guarenteed to never lose agro on INC when debuffing/slowing is occuring.<br />
<br />
Of course my utility is still random, and the provoke line is NOTHING compared to the 100% agro lock knights get, but its a step in the right direction for those of us who aren't dual wielding enraging blow weapons with anger 3 procs in them and a raex BP :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">(snipped part about example where slow failed to land after several tries, despite it usually landing after at least second)<br />
<br />
This is an example of another class (chanter) failing to do their primary job because the RNG went against them. For those of you that feel RNG should be effectively removed when getting agro, what do you think about chanters and slow?  There's a difference...no class has a guaranteed slow that doesn't take resists into account, not even the shaman (although they do have one for disease resist as well, it can still be resisted).  If a class had a guaranteed ~60-70% on-demand slow they could always land no matter what, then it'd fit the example perfectly.  You'd also have all three slowing classes who are subject to resists complaining louder than warriors did.<br />
<br />
Knights have guaranteed agro on demand, even if it's resisted.  Warriors have nothing of the sort, and is entirely based on RNG, whereas an alternative exists (Knights) where there is no random aspect at all.  It's the existance of the alternative that is on-demand, guaranteed despite resists, and requires less tradeoff in tanking ability now that makes it different than anything else in the game.<br />
<br />
Hopefully these changes will give Warriors an actual foothold they can use to hold agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Originally posted by Kaesorn <br />
There's a difference...no class has a guaranteed slow that doesn't take resists into account  <br />
<br />
Good point.  <br />
<br />
I guess the bottom line is I don't like anything being 100% guaranteed (including knight agro) which is why I'm ok with the concept of RNG.  As I think I stated earlier, I agree the current situation is not balanced since knights do have the guarantee and we don't have any compensating abilities...hopefully these new changes will alleviate this discrepancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I am generally against something that can wipe your group and force you to do nothing for the next half hour, even though you did everything right - And do that on a completely random basis.<br />
<br />
It's a game, such a thing should not happen.<br />
<br />
If something happens, we should be able to interact with or against it in and thereby affect the outcome - Even if you fail after that you will have the feeling that it was a challenge rather than &quot;oh, damn the RNG, it killed us .. again&quot;.<br />
<br />
There should be more focus on skill than on the RNG.</div></div><hr />
