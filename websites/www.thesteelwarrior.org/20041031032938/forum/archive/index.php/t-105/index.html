<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kravitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've currently followed Shikarii's advice and have done Dawnshroud up to my current level.  I could stay there and maybe get 44 but there are a lot of light blues now.  I'm thinking about trying sol b in the window area to see how that goes.  Are there any other places you guys might know of that I can find an abundance of dark blues at my level?  I can't find that post where Shikarii listed his leveling path or else I'd just use that.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

hmm, if i can remember proper my 40's to 50's i spent  in CT ( the old cazic, not this one now ) at the pyramid or the gumball; did the grind in SolB KPC camp; or soloing I was able to just take down the 2 troll guards in Rathe Mountains. One is a SK ( long as he doesn't fear ya you should mow him down easily ) and the other is a Shammy who can be a bit harder IMO if she gets a slow off on you. Also I did the ogre bashers inside Oggok who were a bit rough until nearer to 50; but the coin and stuff made up for it. Kunark-wise i'm not too keen on ( i was deep into my 40's before kunark was released ) but i'm sure some static spawns are available for you. the key as in most soloing is to not generally pick on caster mobs who can fry your ass faster than a bag of microwave popcorn. Velious I have been levelling my cleric and found the wolves have been pretty easy to take down ( melee too; no real dd's or heals and hardly twinked besides my tarnished driveshaft and acrylia armour/giant scalemail armour ) and supplies are easy to get if you run low ( that is if you're going thurg faction ) and the faction there is easiest to raise. Only thingto remember is that back than I was wearing crafted and bronze armour as a warrior and dual wielding a langseax and SSoY and was pre-kunark in my 40's...so i'm sure you're a lot better off than I was back than.<br />
<br />
Basically the key to soloing as a warrior is controlling the mob. you don't want a zone where you're 100% reliable on rooting/snaring a mob, and can pretty reliably single pull along with any type of regen item; the more regen the better. Most outdoor static spawns can prove the most beneficial for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Out in front of ME in DSP theres a few rocks with monkeys hangin out there.  They should still be dark blue, i dinged 51 soloing those.  Could give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did Eastern wastes solo from 43 to 45. In the northeast corner of zone, up by the shore, theres lots of ulthorks/walruses to kill. The walruses are lowest level, followed by ulthork hunters, then the warriors. <br />
<br />
Fairly simple to solo- just go pull one, run it back towards the tree on the edge of the shore ( Only one there is, cant miss it, it's near the dorf huts) Just hack at the thing til it starts to run, finish it off, then bindwound back to 50% health. <br />
<br />
My favorite way to do this was to break out my weighted axe. Jboots/sow potions are helpful here. Just take a swing at the mob, hitting upwards of 200+ in a round commonly, run away and wait for your delay to refresh. Do another run past the mob, take 1 swing, run away again. Worked really well, I only lost maybe 3% of my health per mob.<br />
<br />
I soloed them with around 2200-2300 hp, 880ac, and my troll regen. Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe now i am taking my own advice plus everyone elses who have added to the thread here and back on EZjunk...dinged 27 and hanging out now in Netherbian .. working great :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i got the perfect zone!! get BoA and HoS and a regen. at that point head to DSP and go to the hopper caves, when you get there their is a area south of that were wolfs wonder around, you can solo those to 46, i did that in 2 days and they only take half a red bub each, take alot of band aids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kravitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey thanks guys for the info and ideas.  I played around with most of them but decided on Sol B.  I basically did 43-46 in the window room.  Now at 46, the kobolds are about half light blue so time to find a new spot.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>linor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">why go solo? you can get a grp in DL in a matter of minutes. chain pulling there beats any solo exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kravitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DL chain pulling beats any solo exp?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I tried exactly that with a full group (all members equal or less than my level) for over three hours during one stretch.  The exp totally sucked.  Then I thought, well maybe I'm just reaching a point where exp comes at a much slower rate.  So, went to Sol B and solo'd the exact same 3 hour time period and nearly doubled what I'd gotten in the same time in DL.  Not to mention, I was ONE LEVEL HIGHER when I did my Sol B soloing so the exp should have been even slower.  <br />
<br />
If I ever have another character I need to level up, Sol B is where I'll go straight after DSP begins to turn light blue.  DL is a wasteland for rotten exp and boredom....even with constant chain pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kinadim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would get a cleric or shammy friend and head to DL after 46 but dont waste your time over by KC...go straight to the skellys near the wizzy spires and kill them till lvl51...my paladin did it from 46-51 solo easily just have to watch out for the wraithbone champion and I plan on doing the same for my warrior.<br />
<br />
Note* its best to do it with a cleric or even paladin tho because there undead dd spells can single pull them, ive seen a druid get aggro from a few others before from snare pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yisue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ppl said solo in SOL B is nice. but I found that's hard to single pull there and always got added mob while mob is running. Any advices pls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I managed to solo in Dawnshroud Peaks at level 46-47. Fights at 50 pct health and bandages and sow potions.<br />
<br />
I assume you were fighting Lightcrawlers ?<br />
<br />
Large zelniaks and Wolves should all con blue to a 46. Some become lightblue at 47.<br />
<br />
I was pulling to the campfire and tents  somwhat SW of Netherbian (i.e. going towards Sanctus Seru).<br />
<br />
Once I was CH'ed there by a NPC ! It was the first time it happened to me and was really surprising. <br />
<br />
What happened was I pulled a wolf, and another wolf popped, which aggroed on the sitting gnome.<br />
<br />
They fought the 2nd wolf, and when it died apparently they decided I was a friend because i was fighting another wolf, and I got CH'ed as I was close to 10 pct health :)<br />
<br />
I have asked the only Cleric in zone and he didnt know what I was talking about also I didnt see any xxxxx casts CH on you, so it really was the pally NPC there (or the high elf is a cleric, not sure).<br />
<br />
I chose that spot because it seems somewhat safe.<br />
<br />
There are wandering lightcrawlers but us Halfling Warriors can Hide :D So I was targetting the gnome, Hide, and /con to make sure it works.<br />
<br />
After a while I found that the best trick to avoid add wolfs was to pull behind the cam,pfire near the NPC (carefull not to target em).. then when a wolf pops or passes by it is likely to jump the NPC's instead of you.<br />
<br />
I was getting close to half a blue per kills.. otherwise I wouldnb't have had the patience for it.<br />
<br />
I also need to mention I had upgraded my AC past 950, and had gotten an LSoEE in offhand. I could deal with most of the wolves.. but I think I was toatst before my AC upgrade.</div></div><hr />
