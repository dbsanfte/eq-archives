I use a BOC in mainhand currently with A3 on it.<br />
<br />
Either horror shard blade or CHoS?<br />
Thank you for the input.</div></div><hr />

The CHOS will hold agro and cost you 1/10th as much if it's anything like the Karana server.<br />
<br />
If looks really matter or money doesn't so much the prices from OOW are dropping so fast you'll probably find an even better toy from there for dirt cheap as well soon.</div></div><hr />

ok but will the hooror shard perform as well as the CHoS? I have both of these weapons in my possesion. I just want to know what one is better, are they the same?</div></div><hr />

They started at around 200k at the beginning of PoP, now they down to around 125k.   Never made sense to me.<br />
