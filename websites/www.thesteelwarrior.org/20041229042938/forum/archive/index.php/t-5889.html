Innate Regen 3<br />
Natural Healing 3<br />
Convalesence 2<br />
<br />
Naked regen is 7+3+3+2 = 15<br />
<br />
Worn Regen is 35<br />
<br />
Thus giving 50 regen a tick standing.<br />
<br />
My next question how far would spell effects take it?<br />
<br />
Replenishment = 25 a tick.<br />
<br />
So is my thinking correct that max standing regen is <br />
<br />
Naked 15 + Worn 35 + Spell 25 = 75 regen a tick?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your question is partly why I inquired about max regen standing.<br />
<br />
75 hps a tic, and if we take a tic to mean 6 seconds(correct me if I am wrong), then in one minute(Ten of those 6 second intervals) would equal 750 HPs.<br />
<br />
750 hps to me a minute has some merit even in experience groups. On raid encounters where mobs take considerably longer I could see this benefit stacking up(again this is personal preference).<br />
<br />
I'm attempting to aug the items I won't be replacing out too soon; Legs, shoulders, ear, back, etc. No doubt regen vs. attack vs. a combination of the two has weighed on my decision process for those slots where AC or HPs are not available/or multi slot items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druid P9 gives 9 mana/hp regen as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbo</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pot9 is just mana regen.  Natureskin has 4 or 5 hp regen, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so the real question is buffs aside, how much warn regen can you have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also wanna point out that level 65 normal LDoN mobs usually do an average of 25ish dps throughout an adventure, depending on how quickly they get slowed, and how many I'm tanking at one time. With Replenishment and a few regen effects on my armor, I regen around 36 hp a tick... thats 6 hp a second, which basically lowers incoming DPS by about 25%. That's a pretty significant amount in your everyday pickup groups, which is where I think regen shines. On raids, with multiple clerics/spot healers, and mobs tearing you up, the extra few hp doesn't make much of a difference at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done a lot of parses and math on this topic in the past.  I'm at 40/46 regen atm (Troll + 19 worn).  Plus I can toss on a Fungus Vest for 35 worn regen and 10th ring for 10 more regen.  Most of my testing has been done soloing.  This was done in order to formulate how much DPS I could 'mitigate' from mobs through regen while soloing to achive the least amount of possible downtime.<br />
<br />
After all of my math and parsing, the best I could really do with high uptime is still PoN mobs, at around 30-50 DPS slowed.  Moving to PoV, Tactics, Elem etc the DPS just goes up too fast to be able to compensate for while solo.  Regen just doesn't happen fast enough (6 seconds).<br />
<br />
I should also add in this was with CoW and SoPP both aug'd with Lifetaps.<br />
<br />
It seemed like a real nice solo setup in theory, but when put to the test, it's managable, but certainly no where close to the exp you can get in a normal Elem exp group.  And no where near overpowered.  Too bad.<br />
<br />
For raids/groups:<br />
Like has been stated you can get buffs that give more regen and stack:<br />
<br />
Nature's Recovery 30 per tick<br />
Natureskin 4 per tick<br />
Spiritual Dominion 9 per tick<br />
Replenishment 25 per tick<br />
Chorus of Marr 20 per tick<br />
<br />
So max standing regen unbuffed is 61.  You can get buffs that add up to 88 regen.  Add in these buffs and you're at 149 max HP Regen.<br />
<br />
This amounts to 24.8 DPS 'mitigation'.  If you are not at full health for every single tick, which is unlikely.  So you might cut this number in half, or at least 3/4 of it.  For a realistic tanking DPS 'mitigation' of ~12 DPS.<br />
<br />
I suppose that's pretty useful.  But not everyone is a Troll/Iksar, and finding 35 worn regen w/o giving up a ton of HP/AC is difficult for 99% of all warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Bard regen can go much higher.  Chorus of Marr is base 20, but it can be modified with instruments and AA's.  So, an uber bard with proper gear can get it up to 80/tick (roughly - not sure if cap is still 3.9 with GoD AA's).  <br />
<br />
Plus, if you were truly concerned about it, there is another song they can sing with chorus of marr, 47 Niv's preservation.  Most bards will slap you if you ask 'em to play it, but it's base 9, so, roughly another 36 or so.  <br />
<br />
So, for theories sake, you could add another 115 (or so) with a bard.<br />
<br />
Math, the other white meat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the MT perspective there is no benifit.<br />
Incoming damage and healing is so prevelant that regen is a benign factor at most. Click off regen for more important buffs.<br />
<br />
Non-MT situations, it helps to mitigate DoT's, gives your healer less to worry about from AE's, soloing, and more mana for the cleric after he click sticked everyone.<br />
<br />
Regen is a novelty item at best and of no true value for the serious warrior, but really nice if you felel like goofing off and soloing the Priest of Discord, Efreeti in SolB, etc etc.<br />
<br />
If you have the buff slots available, why the hell not?<br />
<br />
One or two buff slots left?<br />
Better pass.</div></div><hr />
