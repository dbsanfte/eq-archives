<br />
=====================================<br />
Oh, joy... a pet buff window, that is SOOOO crucial to the game, and deserved to be put in ASAP. *sigh* :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The functionality was there and this was something that really will help pet classes get at a glance what buffs their pets have on them. *shrug* I don't think it took that long to use a (probably already existing) window template and make it a &quot;pet buff window&quot; when all the coding and such was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">guess it took them all of 30 minutes to make... if that.<br />
<br />
better UI stuffs = good. love the &quot;Link all&quot; button on test's loot windows (i do loot on raids sometimes if i ninja into it fast enough)<br />
<br />
(edit: it was just a small buff bar added to the already existing pet window anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the problem lies in that, elsewhere, it had been said no more caster tweaks till they dealt with the melee issues. Granted, it's probably not a big change to add it, but it is annoying they continue to add things for non-melee, with no signs, *yet*[have not seen the patch message] for helping out the melee. Just seems like its easier to fiddle with the non-melee classes than devote some real time to a truly crucial issue in the game right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oogmol, I feel your frustration, but if it really was just a few minutes to add (or a couple hours with testing), I'm fine with it.  As long as they really are looking at the pure melee issues...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd have thought stuff in this patch was on the table and being worked on prior to the fan faire. When they don't come through after having a full month to work on it - THEN scream abuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That stuff has been on test for quite a long time.</div></div><hr />

Where exactly did a SoE rep say no more caster tweaks til they dealt with the melee issues? I find it hard to believe that that someone from SoE would actually have said that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">fan fare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Indeed that's been on test for a LONG time, and it's long overdue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, the pet buff window was indeed on Test before the Fan Faire when they made the statement about focusing entirely on melee.  It only shows you, in the UI, what buffs are on the pet.  You can learn the same thing by a command (/pet report health) and they didn't even add any functionality (we still can't click the buffs off).  I'm not even sure the UI people (or the tradeskill people even) are the same people as those who would be working on any melee improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Besides, I like the little window when playing my Beastlord :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who wouldn't like it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heck I love it myself with my 25 iksar bst.... still, it gets tougher to watch a patch come out, and still no real melee changes. Still, I can't overly complain, I am building a good rep with folks in my level range in LDoN, last adventure I was on, group leader had the pally pulling, and the cleric started griping about how many heals, so I got returned to pulling duty, and lo the cleric was happy, instead of 3 heals per pull, he only had to  CH me once every 3 pulls. Granted at the high end, pallies have truly narrowed the margin, but at lower levels, a well equipped warrior still mitigates better it would seem, that or it just the    hp total, lol.</div></div><hr />

Had a fun one yesterday too...I couldn't find a cleric so I got 2 druids for healing.  The plan was one druid would heal and the other nuke and spot heal as needed.  A little ways into the adventure the main healer said he was gonna start nuking too because I wasn't getting hit enough :D .<br />
<br />
(although I've also seen what a well equiped pally can do at my level...:mad: )</div></div><hr />
