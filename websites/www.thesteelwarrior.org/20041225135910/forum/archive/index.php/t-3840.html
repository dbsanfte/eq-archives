<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zamnov</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, my name is Zamnov and I am a Barbarian Warrior on the Zebuxoruk.  I have played UO, DAOC and SWG so I have some experience with online games.  Just curious the best way to spec a warrior.  I am Level 5 right now and my skills are:<br />
<br />
1H Slashing: 30<br />
Offense: 17<br />
Defense: 9<br />
Bind Wounds: 1<br />
<br />
I have 11 practices I have not used yet.  Any advice on template, leveling or anything that would help would be great.  I have read some of the warrior guides online, but the ones I have found have been pretty lame, perhaps there are better ones I have not found yet? I also have some $$$ to spend, what is the best kind of weapons and armor to get as I raise through the levels?<br />
<br />
Any way, thanks for your time and help.<br />

<br />
Skills in eq are based on how much you use them, and the cap is dependent on your level.<br />
<br />
So your skills will automatically go up when you use a type of weapon, etc, use a skill, no real worries about specs as in other games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaluas</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey,<br />
playing a warrior can be hard. Because you need to focus on HP / AC. You have to spend a lot of money on gear.<br />
To gain HPs, you need high Stamina and HP items. To gain AC you need always the items who have the highest AC.<br />
Also concantrate on your weapon skills. Keep 1h Slash and 1h Blunt at the cap all the time. You will need it later when u get Dual Wield. Also try to have taunt at the cap all the time and if you play a small or medium race keep kick up all the time too. Later on kick can interrupt casters.<br />
<br />
Edit.: A cheap set of armor is prolly the Crafted  Armor stuff.... it was good for me up to lev 40 - 45. <br />
At the beginning i used a Centi Short Sword and a Centi Warhammer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gladious</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you got a little bit of PP just surf the bazaar and find deals on decent armor, ie.. crafted, crusty, or low grade mith items, even LDoN is a great place once you get a bit higher to get upgrades as you go on.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xebokan</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like you have been playing UO since you mention &quot;template&quot;. There are no templates in EQ - All warriors are more or less alike and people expect you to act in a certain way in groups. Skills go up with use, so if you hit a monster with a sword, your 1 handed slash goes up togeather with your offence. The skill cap for your combat skills is: 5 + 5 x level, so at level 5, it would be 30. Your 1 handed slash is at 30, so I guess you have more or less been using your newbie weapon all the time.<br />
Try find a mage and convince him to summon some bandages, since they will be your friend in the early levels (they're used togeather with bind wound skill).<br />
Save your practice points for now, until you get more insight into skills. They can always get handy if you neglect a skill like 2 handed slash or blunt or you want a kick start in duel wield or double attack. If you're interested in trade skills, spending 20 prac points initialy is recommedable too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">taunt hit it every time it refreshes to skill up(this is not the same way to use it when grouped)<br />
<br />
slam/bash wont go up till you get lvl needed to train skill but will still hit most of the time till then.<br />
<br />
no need to realy put points into melee skills unless its one you have to train then 1 is normaly enough.<br />
<br />
training poits are good for lauguage and trade skills</div></div><hr />

I have only been in Halas and the small area around it.  What is LDoN and how do I get to the Bazaar?  I had a Lev 50 Warrior in DAOC so I know how the leveling goes and how a warrior can get a little borring.   But I am totally addicted to being the best swords man I can be.  Everytime I try to play a different style of character I get borred.  The exception being a Shadowblade in DAOC, that was a blast :).<br />
<br />
Thx again for all the advice.<br />

Lev 5 Warrior on Zebuxoruk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you familiarize yourself with www.eqatlas.com and www.allakhazam.com.  EQAtlas has maps for all the zones that you will spend time in, for the foreseeable future.  Allakhazam is a treasure trove of information about gear, quests and the beasties that inhabit the different zones.   <br />
<br />
Train Sense Heading.  Remap it to your left or right movement key.  Sense Heading is your friend. (Thus speaketh the Perpetually Lost Ogress).  Train one point in Swim.  If you pass a body of water during your travels, jump in and swim.  Train taunt and mash it when you are soloing.  This is not how to play in groups, however.  <br />
<br />
The easiest (safest) way for a level 5 Barbarian Warrior to get to the Bazaar is:<br />
<br />
1.  Find the PoK book in Everfrost (I think it is on a EQAtlas map).  Click on it.<br />
<br />
2.  You are now in Plane of Knowledge.  A lot of people hang out in PoK while LFG (looking for group), or to do banking, or to get buffs.  The PoK books have made travel in EQ very easy.  EQAtlas also has a map of this zone, so you can get familiar with where the different books are located, and where the different vendors are located.<br />
<br />
3.  Find the Nexus book in PoK.  There will usually be a ton of people clustered in front of it.  Click on it.<br />
<br />
4.  You are now in the Nexus.  Take the corridor to the south (turn right) and you will enter the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
If you wish to look for equipment while in the Bazaar, type /bazaar.  You will get a window to pop up where you can either type in the name of the equipment you are looking for, or type in the race/class/equipment slot/stats and it will filter the appropriate equipment for you.  When you find something that you want to buy, highlight the name of the trader and click the &quot;find trader&quot; button on the bottom of the window.  A &quot;mystical path&quot; will take you to the trader, and you can purchase your item, just as you would a NPC vendor.<br />
<br />
If you wish to sell items in the Bazaar, you need to purchase a trader satchel (less than 2 platinum) and then stand in one of the trader stalls.  Type /trader.  A window will appear in which you can set prices on any goods inside a trader satchel, and then add them to the list of goods you wish to sell.  Now hit the &quot;begin trader&quot; button.  You can go AFK, and your trader character will sell your stuff for you.<br />
<br />
I sincerely reccomend that you do NOT vendor sell any low/medium/high quality animal pelts, or any spiderling or spider silks.  People use tons of these items for trade skills, and will usually buy them in the Bazaar, rather than going back to the &quot;newbie&quot; grounds to kill the critters themselves.<br />
<br />
I also reccomend that when you outgrow the twisty canyons of Everfrost, you venture down to Blackburrow.  This will be your first real dungeon.  Know it, like it, and save the gnoll fangs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;and save the gnoll fangs.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a captain of the Qeynos guard in, heh, South Qeynos (a town south of Everfrost, south of Blackburrow, south of Qeynos Hills).<br />
<br />
This captain wants the gnoll fangs.<br />
<br />
Give him them one at a time (do not stack them).<br />
<br />
He will happily reward you with faction, a very good amount of XP if you are level appropriate to be killing the gnolls, and an orb of something or other (forget the name, moonstone crystal maybe?).<br />
<br />
Take the orbs to Fish's Tavern, also in South Qeynos. Go to the back. Find the bartender in the back of the place (forget the name, you can find both of these quests at Allakhazam's). He will reward you with more faction, more XP (but not much more) and some ale for giving him the orbs.<br />
<br />
Sell the ale, get some money for foods.<br />
<br />
Or drink the ale and be manly.<br />
<br />
Have fun. That's how I spent my early levels.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

Its not like the games you've played before.  Pretty much, you are based on your equip, stats mean very little, and a cleric/shaman would be a good person to make friends with.<br />
<br />
Man, my newbie days were so much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when I thought DE guards would be civilized and let me talk with em... but they didnt like my cute lvl2 half elf self :p... those days rocked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also turn in the gnoll fangs to the female head of the warrior guild in Halas for faction, food, and torches.<br />
<br />
Also, save your white polar bear pelts.  There is a woman in Halas who gives you patchwork armor for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have plat or real $$$ to spend?  Check out www.PlayerAuctions.com, where people trade plat for cash.  I know this may be an unpopular opinion.  And I can appreciate how many would view this as &quot;cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
But personally, I play EQ to have fun, and I don't have much free time outside of work.  I would rather spend $40 for 25k plat, than the 80 hours it would take me to farm the same amount of plat.  If you break it down to simple economics, is your free time worth more than $0.50 an hour?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I find the no drop quests to be very fullfilling, and I don't recommend a newbie spend $200 for equipment.  But a reasonable initial upgrade, may make the game much more enjoyable for you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xebokan</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A set of banded armour and cheap weapons can take you to level 35 - 40. You don't need 100k pp to start a new character. Part of the pleasure/skill comes from learning the game from scratch - Don't make the mistake of listning to Saeborne.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's true.  Alot of the pleasure in the game is the pride of developing a character set of equipment, from scratch.<br />
<br />
To be fair, I never purchased anything for my character until lvl 53 or so.  This char was my first on the server, and was created with zero twinking.  And when I did buy plat, it was to specifically purchase an Obsidian Tomahawk, and a horse for my RL girlfriend.<br />
<br />
As I said, I don't recommend everyone go out and spend hundreds of dollars for platinum.  But Zamnov's case, it seems to make sense.  He's got extensive experience in other oline worlds such as DAoC, and UO.  And according to him, he's got funds available, which he wants to invest into EQ.<br />
<br />
Not trying to start a flame war.  Just some thoughts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xebokan</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And this gear will help him in what way? He will get no feeling with mobs at lower level and about level 40 - 45, he we start to see a dramatic change. I've met alot of warriors that only know how to hit their taunt button (that's about it) - some of them were high level. Most of them either e-bay, powerlevel or just take the &quot;challanging&quot; route of Kurn's, PC, DSP and DL.<br />
<br />
The only case you could maybe buy plat, is when you have made it past level 51 and have a good feeling about your class and the gear and tactics important to this class, or if you're starting fresh on a new server, but have characters on other servers.</div></div><hr />
