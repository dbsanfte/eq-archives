According to Sony they are rumors.<br />

There was a new suit released by accident (and later removed) that was slightly better than royal att.  The devs said &quot;you can use this gear, we will not remove it.  If the gear gets released, we can not tell you if it will be better or worse.  If it is released you will be able to keep this version just as the people that bought the original royal kept the 2,2,3 versions when 1,2,3 versions were released.&quot;  That is a close paraphrase of what was said.</div></div><hr />

In another thread here, it was mentioned that LDoNs would not go beyond 65.  That does not mean later on LDoNs will not be adjusted.</div></div><hr />
