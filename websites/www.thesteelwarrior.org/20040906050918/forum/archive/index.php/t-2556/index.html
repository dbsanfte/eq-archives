<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We know warriors are superior in battle, but it seems that a large portion of the public think all we do in our spare time is hate pallies and make fun of rangers.  While I sit at work and wait for experiments to finish, I take the time to browse through and study my art a bit.  I have come to the very simple conclusion.....the public is wrong.<br />
<br />
Between Brutal's taunt thread, the GSoT and CHoS/SOB parsing and hate tests, the ubah mob tanking chart, haste items, and rampage explained.  All of Warriordom is at your fingertips from raid to exp.  I pitty any new Trooper in Cabilis, Wolf in Halas, or Guardsman in Kaladim that does not take the time to review the basics about taunt, aggro, armor and strategy.<br />
<br />
Personally I want salute Brutal and all those who have contributed to the Wisdom of our art (and to grimmlokk for that great avatar), for we are the most skilled of the tanks, our casters life is our lifes work, and the fall of our blade comes with more then just strength, but precision.  I have learned from your work, and have become better for it.<br />

Thanks to all of you.</div></div><hr />

Thank you all for this outstanding board. The information you all have provided here has had the most impact in my career as a warrior and I know that I am a much more competent warrior than I was before I discovered the Steel Warrior. <br />
