Ok, Im sure we have all heard of this nice little overthere proc'ing weapon. Heres my problem: I have read every post I can find and basicly I havent found any real way to complete this quest. I collected around 120 War Braids but could not turn them in because I was still KOS to the outpost. The only way you become non kos is by turning in war braids. I  had 2 enchanters lv65 attempt to tash, charm, mez, pac Captain Rottgrime with nothing really working. When I finaly attempted to hand the braids in while he was pacified he said he would not deal with me. I tried ogre illusion but that didnt help, I heard DE might be better but I havent found an essence potion yet. However I read from several posts that DE potion wont work if you have a deity anyway. Im a Brell - Dwarf and have never hunted in KC. I was curious if any good race warriors with deities have completed the quest without killing dragons first? If so how was it done? I would much rather spend the time completing the quest once, than to spend 3k everytime I need another 10 cast gate potion. Any Ideas or information would be appreciated. I figured this could fall under questing or faction - if its in the wrong area please move it.</div></div><hr />

They have right click insta cast charm, which will put you at amiable (since he is your pet), and you can then turn in the jade for the hammer.  If you do it on your own, there is a good chance it will resist a few times.  Do it with people who can debuff mr (chanter, bard, shaman), and it is very unlikely you will get a resist.  I guess having a chanter charm the braids turn in guy, would allow you to turn them in, but I haven't tried that so I can't confirm it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a peice of jade or a jade shard?  I got a set of puppet strings in the bank and wouldnt mind usinga  few charges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's name is exactly &quot;jade&quot;.  Buyable from gem merchants for a bit of gold iirc.  Just need one of them also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 2 parts to this quest. First would be to get your faction to amiable turning in the braids to the captian and once thats done your good to go and can turn in the jade to the other npc. Otherwise everytime you proc OT your still KOS and get one skeleton agro and the chance of dragoon agro which ends up pulling most of the outpost - which isnt so bad unless you were using the gate to escape a bad situation and then you are more or less in the same boat as you were before you gated. I was hoping to somehow get my braids to give me faction hits, atleast enough that I could continue to give them untill I have high enough faction to do the rest of the quest. Can anyone tell me about these puppet strings? I think I heard they either dont drop anymore, or they cant be recharged... I dont remember exactly what I heard about them but it was something that was going to make them a lot more rare. Anymore ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got mine about 3-4 weeks ago so they were still dropping then.  Not sure if they can be recharged at all either.  As for increasing VS (OT) faction I dont think there is any way you can outside of turning in war braids =\.  Sucks for me as I spent alot of time grouping/soloing in KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use puppet strings here are a couple things to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you have the jade immediately avialable. Heck even in an open slot in place of a bag.<br />
<br />
I say this because after using puppet strings I ended up fumbling in my inventory and the charm wore off.<br />
<br />
2. Malo then malosini the foreman. Even with resist debuff I blew all charges save the one above.<br />
<br />
3. If you can get another player to do the debuffing go for it.<br />
<br />
4. Pull the foreman to the wall of Skyfire in the killing field. Atleast that is where it worked easiest for me.<br />

I have no idea if the puppet strings can be recharged(seriously doubt it), but I missed out on a grand opportunity unless I get more strings or do some serious faction work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's only one part to this quest.  Turn in the jade for the hammer.  It does require amiable faction though.  How you get the amiable faction doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Puppet strings do still drop.  They are not rechargable, but that is the rule, not the exception, for charged clicks (unless tinkered).  As I said, do all you can to make sure it is fully mr debuffed.<br />
<br />
As far as getting faction, it's not worth it.  Takes a ton of braids, they give very very little faction.  With bottomed out faction, the only aggro I ever get is the skelly you pop next to.  If you swim far out in the water you can avoid all other aggro.  Or you can just run out the near gate, and train anything that is on you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get positive faction every time I have killed Fay, Gore, Sev, Talendor. It's been a few months since I touched any of these, but I still think faction exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, killing any Kunark dragon increases Venril Sathir faction.<br />
<br />
I suspect that most &quot;good&quot; races still can't get to amiable on Venril Sathir, though.</div></div><hr />
