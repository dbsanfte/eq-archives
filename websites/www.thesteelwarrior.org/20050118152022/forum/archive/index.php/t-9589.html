Your weakest points to me are your neck, wrists, arms, chest, and legs because of low ac. 6hp = 1ac, search for items using that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, you might be broke, but so far you've spent your plat pretty wisely. At this point, I'd normally suggest cultural, but eh, you're a Karana wood elf, heh.<br />
I think I'd consider a new chestplate first, mainly because given your STA and hitpoints, they're relatively good for your AC, and it's quite possible to get more AC on a BP than what you have now.<br />
I'd suggest three things (given that I know nothing about wood elves): first, do the standard bazaar search by race, class, religion, chest slot and AC. See what's out there, and see how much it costs.<br />
Second, if you know folks who are raiding Kael, there might be a possibility of MQ-ing velious quest armor. The easiest set to get is the champion armor, and the bp is 47 AC/10 STA/90hps and some other stuff. I wouldn't suggest this, but the folks who loot the quest drops in kael nowadays probably aren't in need of the armor, so you might be able to cut a deal on it. You and any healing friend can kill enough giants to get the Thurg faction you need in short order. So, it's a possibility, although a little involved.<br />
Third, talk the situation over with warriors/friends in your guild. they might have some suggestions, and it's likely that some of them have their own gear needs, so you help them, they help you.<br />
Maybe you're carrying stuff like this already, but I'd also start paying attention to what's in your bags. I'd start with some stat food and drink (halas 10-pound meat pies and Grobb liquised meat would be nice, and should be fairly cheap) and right behind that a few gate potions, because at lvl 52 you'll soon be getting into places that are really hard to get out of. If cost is an issue, go with some of the zone-specific gate potions rather than gate-to-bind-point potions: the zone gate potions are cheaper. Potion of the Frost is the one I use and it would work for you just fine. Fennin is a fairly old server and there are lots of shamans on it who can do the work. also I'd carry some cloudy potions (can be bought in PoK in building near the soulbinder).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some suggestions for items that would be nice upgrades for you:<br />
<br />
chest: Architects bejeweled chestplate (54AC 60HP) around 4k on my server<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23154<br />
<br />
hands: Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets (23AC 45HP + some stats)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21133<br />
<br />
Bracer: Fine Heraldic Bracer (25AC, 30HP) generally cheap<br />
everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12309<br />
<br />
Arms: Fine Heraldic Vambraces (26AC 30HP)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12363<br />
<br />
Neck: Serpentine Necklace (15AC 65HP)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26494<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cultural Smithed armor is generally cheap compared to the stats it has. Unfortunately you cannot wear &quot;Fierce Heraldic&quot;, but &quot;Fine Heraldic&quot; will still be a nice upgrade for some slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">varill</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry for late response guys but thanks 8 )<br />
 Ediet: any other advice is always welcome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forget my suggestions about Fine Heraldic armor.<br />
Only Human, Half Elf, Barbarian can wear it. No Wood Elf.<br />
Sorry, my mistake.<br />
Smithed armor that you can use would be &quot;Full Mithril&quot; armor. Stats are similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">an oldie but goodie -  you could also save some money and get a group and do the bracelet of benevolence quest in western waste. the quest npc should be practially always up now. best thing is you can get both as not lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">varill</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kk ,,, im still working on some of the stuff you guys suggested but a friend dumped a buncha stuff of me so .... plz say if the stuff is worth keeping<br />
( sta is rele 246 and ac is rele 1003)<br />
 ( on not of )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, with the new stuff the weakest slot you have is the chestplate, I think. Haste is good, weapons are good, nonvisible stuff is very good for lvl 52.<br />
As a general rule, if I were you, I'd start taking a hard look at weighting AC heavier than you have in the past. Your STA and hitpoints are quite high for your level, particularly considering the lack of cultural plate options in your case. But it's possible you've had some AC tradeoff to get it. The Architect's breastplate linked by Elfried above would be a very good upgrade indeed for you. Consider attempting to increase AC so that you have approximately 20 AC/per level as it's displayed in-game.<br />
Beyond that, it's early on a Friday morning and I've not finished my coffee yet and hence and in a grumpy crusty mood so I am compelled to point out that my preference is to see the word &quot;really&quot; 1) used sparingly, and 2) not spelled &quot;rele.&quot;</div></div><hr />
