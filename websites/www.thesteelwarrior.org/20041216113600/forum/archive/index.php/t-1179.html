I hope it's not the supposed &quot;warrior fix&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was allready disscussed back when the changes went on test over at PoN.<br />
<br />
<br />
GD you people need to read other boards sometimes :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pino</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually none of that listed spells ever worked on 55+ mobs, so nothing has changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Those changes dont actually mean anything i believe, just messages now properly reflect how the spells were working.<br />
<br />
Lol if paladins were really nerfed, believe me, we don't need a warrior coming to give us the news because you will hear about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please change your post. <br />
<br />
<br />
Some people will not read past the first one and will make everyone dumber in doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Cease and Desist still land, or what are you saying?<br />
<br />
My understandind was that they will be unaffected, thus forcing them to use the higher lvl spells. Which was one of the biggest gripes, because they could virtually chain cast a manafree lvl9 Stun spell for aggro. They can still aggro using the appropriate higher level and more mana costly versions, correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant remember all the mechanics of it. Basically i think the lower level spells werent landing anyway but were still causing aggro so can still be used. <br />
<br />
The long and short of it is that nothing has changed in terms of how the spells work or the amount of aggro they generate.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the idea that nerfing them would cause pallys to use more costly spells is also slightly flawed, seeing as they still have relatively cheap stuns in their 60s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its just a message that the stuns wont interupt/stun anything over 55, aggro is the same..... Shoot someone with a rubber bullet they still get pissed at you =p...<br />
<br />
Be careful what you wish for about stun immune and aggro... /point stun based warrior aggro weapons</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it only means that the spell info is updated cease and decict will not stun the mob over 55 but it will hit and get the target is not stunned but if it has a knockback component it will knock it back (sorry I was not thinking when I originally posted :) ) but still causes aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it that they will be resisted or they won't land?  I have some spells for my druid like Harmony that says something like &quot;your target is unaffected&quot; if I try too high of a mob.  Hopefully that is what the /55 is meant for in the Lucy info.<br />
<br />
Not trying to stir the pot or anything, just curious as I have never looked at that kind of spell info before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Low level stuns simply will not stop a mob over level 55. <br />
<br />
The spell now states this.<br />
<br />
They still piss mobs off however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True Var, but that should have been added ;) Not like it'd change things a whole lot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does not change a thing.  They still cast and maintain 100% aggro 100% of the time.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Us Warriors usually use duel wielding weapons.  Duel wield is poor in damage compared to two handers and we can keep up with the actualy damage dealers (rely on procs).  Knights can use two handers that do nice damage and have the added bonus of spells.  Thats where we go wrong.</div></div><hr />
