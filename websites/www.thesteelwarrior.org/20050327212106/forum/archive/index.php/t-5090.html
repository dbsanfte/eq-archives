<br />
I am looking to lead a raid to do Paffa.....if I can get the bad boy located and there isn't guild #265 already there.<br />
<br />
How do you check if Paffa is up in CoD?<br />
<br />
Is he trackable from ZI?<br />
<br />
What is the respawn on him from death?  <br />
<br />
Any special advice on the encounter?<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slav</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use eye of zomm to see if he is up. go left at first intersection and he is at the end in the last room.<br />
<br />
Advise DONT Step on the ramp to his room before you are ready to begin pulling.  Not even a SOS rogue.  it will trigger the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, he's trackable from the zone, for any class that can track. Give it a try. If you fail, it will reset in ~30 minutes or less and you can try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll find him a delightful encounter.  My prediction will be that, as your first try is wiping, someone will say, &quot;WTF?!?! Where did all those Greater Puslings come from!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the replies.<br />
<br />
Any idea respawn time from death?<br />
<br />
I frequently obtain information on death time.  So I could at least be sure it will be up at a given time.<br />
<br />
Inny has some overcrowding issues.  Everything is contested it seems.<br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Findra</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure Paffa is a 24 hour respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paffa's 3 days, almost certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 1 or 3 days he was up last night.<br />
<br />
We gathered the forces and got in CoD to buff.  Crawled our way toward Paffa.<br />
<br />
We set up in the room outside his lair.<br />
<br />
When we pulled we got 10 puslings.  Well, we killed 7 before we were effectively wiped.  Thank Agnostic for SOS rogues.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Paffa &amp; da boys reverted back to the untouched state (the way they were supposed to be) and we reassembled.<br />
<br />
5 warriors were tanking w/ cleric on each tank.  When Paffa got targetable we rushed on him.<br />
<br />
It went very well as now the guild is Tier 2 on Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the information.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikkorak</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">24 hours.<br />
It's fun, and one of those things you can do with less and less people as you learn it well, and it will still stay challenging.<br />
<br />
Earring ? what earring ?  Done him 30 times + and 3 or 4 capes, rest all masks.  Not one earring.<br />
<br />
Poor necros.</div></div><hr />
