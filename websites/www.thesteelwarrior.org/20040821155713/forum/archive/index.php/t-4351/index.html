<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warriors are supposed to be the masters of battle, right? So lets say that after using a weapon for a set period of time, and having it proc over and over, that after a while, the warrior learns to focus that proc thru ANY weapon that he chooses to weild?<br />
<br />
Lets say we get rid of that wortless stamina bar, and make it into a &quot;charge-bar&quot; for procs.  Each time a proc goes off a set number of times, it gets scribed into a melee spellbook, and it has a set number of &quot;charge points&quot; (CP) to use, with a .1 second cast, and a set recast.  Each point of melee damage adds charge points, so lower level toons cant learn a high-damage DD proc, and use it ecessively, as its CP cost would be too high. <br />
<br />
Max STA increase &quot;CP&quot; pool, and mana+ items add to it as well.<br />
<br />
Include ranges on all CP cast procs, and procs that are cast by a player character class will remain as if cast by that class, except for the .1 second cast time.<br />
<br />
This shouldnt add too much to warrior aggro, but allow aggro at range, add MUCH more fun, and a bit of snap aggro to add pry mobs off the skirts.  Even in an emergency, a warrior could unload his CP pool with aggro spells, DD, or lifetaps, depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Aggro based spells would have to be tuned to be the staple of whats cast, with dd/dots second, and utility third by far, otherwise a warrior could proc a ToD till he learned the spell, and use it every pull, which would unbalance things, so spells of that sort would need to be costly CP-wise.<br />
<br />
What this would allow is basically the same gameplay as current, with more interaction, more character-development, and less reliance on the RNG. <br />
<br />
So, with this, a fight would go as follows:<br />
<br />
Pull inc, warrior hits it with EB on inc, then maybe a planar stun or anger3, using 25% of his CP points, which take the rest of the fight to regain.<br />
<br />
Now lets pretend somethin goes wrong, and the chanter pulls aggro (3 resisted slows lets say), so the warrior hits EB and Anger3 again, then hits planar stun, then /sheild and finally tepid deeds, and uses 90% of his CP, and gets back 10% during the rest of the fight, leaving him at 20% and needing to play it VERY careful until it is earned back some.<br />
<br />
or, <br />
<br />
Warrior engages boss_mob01, and unloads all 8 of his highest aggro procs, then hits EB when it refreshes to maintain aggro....all this did was make his assist call come 10 seconds sooner, or immediately, and casters can engage at say 80% rather than 70...not a huge difference, as warriors holding aggro at raids isnt broke or even that hard as it is.<br />
<br />
For monks and rogues, make DD and aggro-reducing spells cost less points, and make their CP bars fill at a proportionatly faster rate.<br />
<br />
Now.....to aggro as supposed to be a &quot;limiting factor&quot; on how much dps other classes do etc etc...<br />
<br />
Tuned the CP cost of spells to allow for limited usage of certain spells.  Say EB costs too little, and warriors are chain-casting it now, and holding aggro like pallies could only dream of...increase its CP cost, and make warriors have to manage it more, etc etc....class and game balance acheived by what we all know SoE is good at, changing spells and thier mana/&quot;CP&quot; cost.<br />
<br />
Considering the hints at the changes that may be in store, I dont see something like this being that far off.  It seems SoE's intention to give more versatility and fun and group-ability to melees, and adding something like this would be a easy way to do it, and all the coding for it is there for the most part.</div></div><hr />
