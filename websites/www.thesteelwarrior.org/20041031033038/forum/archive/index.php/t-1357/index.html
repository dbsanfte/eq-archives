<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
I'm just curious.  Once I hit level 65, what are my farming options for just straight up loot, solo?  Also, what are my options with a lvl 65 cleric in tow?<br />
<br />
in case you wonder, I've been working on trade skills thinking that's where the money will be at when I hit lvl 65, but I'm starting to wonder if I&quot;m wrong.  I mean, if I can make anywhere near the cash at lvl 65 by farming that i could with, say, 250 smithing...  I'm going to forget the smithing and just level.  Any ideas on what I should expect at level 65 for plat farming?  Thanks in advance!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a 65 Warrior i've found I can solo the Mooto spawn fairly regularly, and with almost total success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isn't he like lvl 10 and drops only a quest piece for a low level quest? lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh, umm, chardok maybe for straight coin ( nice part about chardok is no silver and copper coins exist there; just plat and gold ) and the occasional goodie. you can single pull pretty much all the way down to the captain or through themain fort to the overseer.....mobs hit about as hard as the chuckle patch on the magic garden.. downtime minimal with a ToD and/or fungi...<br />
<br />
even easier would be to level ya up a druid or wizard and go quad kite sh*t.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I chuckled at the Motoo post, and then thought &quot;Well that was useless&quot;<br />
<br />
Mebbe it wasn't.<br />
<br />
What's the chances that a 65 Warrior could not farm places like Sebilis (with a healer) Mebbe Crystal Caverns (Without, perhaps), Hill Giants in RM/NK, etc.<br />
<br />
Isn't the world your playground at 65?<br />
<br />
By World, I mean, Not the planes. Hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hell, i was about to say Shikarii ( my original toon ) used to farm the hell out of runnyeye at 62...mow the entire zone down, had a bank in the zone so you didn't have to keep dropping copper and silver...and every now and than the alloy medallion or BA coif would drop and net a quick 500-600pp that night in the bazaar. raked in stupid amounts of coin and hardly blinked. worst part was running out of food and drink really.<br />
I started farming it at @55 or so and it basically funded his entire Fletching career ( 210 skill )..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can definitely kill as many Hill Giants as you want at 65 :) You probably wont find enough up to make a ton of cash if the druids/mages/Necros are there...<br />
<br />
You can do all of Seb with a healer. Even Juggies if you can pull em.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say the world is your playground (especially if not part of a raiding guild) but with a Few fun toys ToD, Heal BP etc, you can have a ton of fun in places it was not possible to in your 50's :)<br />
<br />
I could break down to and pull the Chief in Droga for a free Idol of the Thorned for instance without any problems at all by my little lonesome, and I never had uber anything.<br />
<br />
The problem is more that there are not enough Seb-like fun dungeons to work your way into by yourself. It would be great if you could plow through a bunch of stuff on the way to a fun final fight where you could get solo loot, but for the most part, EQ dungeons aren't set up that way :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TrendosGnomeWar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Few days ago i was soloing in Veskar at lvl 65. The mobs conned light blue, i was getting 1% AA per 3 kills which was awesome. Well anyways about farming, each mob i killed dropped about 3-6pp each kill i thought it was amazing. An idea for alittle EXP and some loot. Was slowing them with ToD and BP healing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm sure everyone gets these tells when they're sitting in the nexus or PoK... the ones that go &quot;can you spare a few plat so I can buy my level 4 spells?&quot; or &quot;do you have a good weapon you could give to a new warrior?&quot;<br />
<br />
When ever I get these tells rather than telling them to fsck off I usually spin out some advice about farming tradeskill components - spiderling silks / pelts - and selling to tradeskillers.  Usually suggest some good spots and occasionally recommend some people to look out for who I know are buying that sorta stuff.  Best way for a newbie to make money.<br />
<br />
Well the same goes for us who have been around a little while.  Farm stuff that other people want, especially with all the nice stuff out for trade skill quests now theres loads of people spending alot of plat to get their tradeskills up.<br />
<br />
Some stuff that sells well: <br />
Velium blocks - go to crystal caverns (or Velks) and beat up orc miners for Velium.  Its used in the new cultural armours aswell as for the 8th shawl.<br />
Essense of Sunlight - from sand giants and chromadracs.  Can sell for 400-500pp each on my server.<br />
Acrylia blocks - kill grimlings in Tenebrous Mountains or in Grimling forest toward the AC zone.<br />
Essence of shadow - drops off shadowed men.<br />
<br />
Just like in the real world, the best way to get money is to find the people who have lots of it and work out what they are willing to spend it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shikarri, because I'm lvl 57, I went and tried your runnyeye idea.  Umm... I must be missing something!!  There were two lvl 50+ in teh zone doing the same thing, maybe that was the problem.  I found the bank and spent over an hour killin da gobbies, fungis, and eyes.  I didn't explore the entire zone but what I did find dind't drop very much plat.  Most I ever saw was 1pp and the pickins were so slim that I walked away with a grand total of 40 pp in one hour.  Am I doing something wrong?  How much should I expect per hour if I'm the only one in the zone?  Is there a particular area to hunt in ?  thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>viiperan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to find sol a/b better for farming plat.  Mobs drop several plat most of the time and fine steel weapons / bronze armor bits and some other vendor trash.  If you got faction with the gnome you can sell in there or just go outside to the vendor by the druid circle.  Used to make 500pp an hour or so pre 60 days.  With new weapons / lvls / aa would just mow that place down.<br />
<br />
Sebilis can been done solo for good gem drops and the occasional random item that can be sold for some good coin. I got a shroud right off one of the first two at zone in once.  TOD / bp heal help out alot but dont forget about the esk (embalmer's skinning knife).  Having endless bandaids works great and is faster than bp heals.  You could even dump a few aa into being able to heal yourself to 100%.  Also has a side effect of keeping your piercing up if you didnt work on it.<br />
<br />
If you got a cleric/dru/shaman to partner with there are some very good farmskill items to farm in PoP that I have found to easily net 5k to 15k worth of items a night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gain An'Sydnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Try SSeru if you want plat.  Mobs drops over 10pp each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seb, bug camp should be easy with a healer, just bring a snare whip.<br />
You didnt show a magelo so it kinda hard to make suggestions for PoP.<br />
CoD was always nice for me, tradeskill stuffs selling quite well.<br />
Yesterday morning i duod a bit in Tactics near entrance and had a highly polished gem drop (for bloodmetal earring of engagement), selling easily for 20k.<br />
But its not easy, ToD is a must, snare whip as well as roots tend to get resisted a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seru like Gain said is good.<br />
<br />
 Fungus Grove actually is good. The shroom chunks sell pretty well, especially if you get lucky and score a lot of pristine caps. And at 65 you can handle any individual patch in there no problem. Was screwing around there the other day. At the big patch near the Shadel Bandits. After about 15-20 minutes I stopped slowing them and moved into the middle of the camp to kill them all faster, 2-3 at a time. Got boring pretty fast, but I'd expect that anywhere.<br />
<br />
 Seb seems to be the best suggestion. But I haven't solo'd there since I first hit 60. You could probably mow through Katta guards. If yer patient and have lotsa inventory room the weapons will sell OK, sheer volume should make up for the lower prices.<br />
<br />
 I fooled around in the Deep some when they first changed con ranges. Some OK vendor trash in there, but pulls aren't always single and the mobs do a bit more damage than some easier spots.<br />
<br />
 Archers in Echo Caverns drop bows that sell pretty good also. Just don't disarm them during fights or they hit harder. Sorta long repop for only two mobs though, can probably whack scounds there between spawns for a little more plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You are really asking several questions here. Let's address everything so you can make the best decision for you.<br />
<br />
I mean, if I can make anywhere near the cash at lvl 65 by farming that i could with, say, 250 smithing <br />
Well, first of all, to get 250 smithing is going to cost you a ton of plat to begin with. I don't care what anyone says, trade skills cost a bundle to get to 250 with very few exceptions. You can get brewing to 250 very cheap, but then you really can't make much off brewing unless you are dealing in massive quatities. You can probably sell Grobb Liquidized Meat or Kaladim Constitutional but you will have to make hundereds of stacks to make good coin.<br />
<br />
All other trade skills are going to cost you a bundle. Most you can get to the 180-200 range pretty cheap, but you won't have very good success making items that sell well at that skill level. Once you get to that level you either have to spend a truck load of plats for skill ups (40K+ for the cheap ones, 200k+ for the expensive ones) or, you will have to farm greens endlessly for weeks at a time to do your skill ups inexpensively. Plus you have the disadvantage of not having 355 int/wis with your normal gear. You will have to invest in some tradeskill gear so your skill up/attempt ratio doesn't kill you.<br />
<br />
The problem with most trade skills is that you need to be a GM in a trade when a new popular item comes out. If you don't get in early, you are not going to make nearly as much money as the guys who get 10x the normalized price the first few weeks something sells. Not only that, but the trade skill market has gotten hammered by people doing the Aid Grimil quest. Instead of 1 or 2 people in a guild doing most of the trade skilling, now you have dozens of people who all have 220+ in every trade.<br />
<br />
Basically, there are very few good options when it comes to trades now. The first is to have very high skill in all trades so you can cash in on what ever the latest trend is. You need to be able to make what ever the hot seller is regardless of what skill it takes. It really helps a ton to have Tactics or Elem access because the best trade skill items are mad from drops in those zones. You will have to farm them yourself because anyone in those zones knows what the drops are used for and knows how hard they are to come by, so they don't make it to the bazaar very often.<br />
<br />
The other way to make money on trades is to cash in on the laziness of the people who are working their trade skills. It doesn't take much research to figure out what trade skill items you can sell for a good profit. These items usually take considerably less skill to make so you don't have to spend a fortune getting your skill high enough to have a good success rate. You still have to farm a lot of green stuff, but at least it is pure profit. On my server spider silks (10-20pp EACH), silk swatches (20-30pp EACH), Imbued emeralds (30pp each), Celestial essence (5pp each), Leather padding (20-30pp each), Acrylia pieces/blocks (25-100p each), and Velium pieces/block (25-100p) each sell very well.<br />
<br />
As for making money at 65, Sebilis is one of the best zones to do this in. Tons of cash drops and the occasional loot to sell. You will have a hard time finding another place that will yeild so much plat.<br />
<br />
However, there is a better option at 65. With a small group (3-6 toons) there is a ton of stuff you can do that drops gear that will sell for a lot of plat. Would you rather spend hours making a few kpp in a night or would you rather spend 30 min-1 hr each night and make 10k+? You have to set aside the time to check certain spawns (having a dru/wiz port bitch helps a lot here) and you will have to track spawns so you can get an idea of when mobs are due, but this is not very hard to do. Even if you only get 1 target a week, you can still make a ton of plats if you pick the right targets. I will leave the target selection to you since you will have to determine what mobs you can effectively take down with small groups.</div></div><hr />

PLEASE don't do this. Monks like to solo exp in this zone, and just kicking the crap out of the zone really ticked off my monk. I depended on that place for exp, and again it bugged me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah, and when I was 55ish I used to like to group in Velks but monks liked to solo there too.  *mumble mumble*<br />
<br />
Im sure just asking people to have the courtesy to respect camps should solve this problem anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are literally 20 zones monks can solo in at that level, and there are only 2 where velium drops in any quantity.<br />
<br />
Don't be pissed at people because SoE forces us to plow down your zones for stuff we need.  If we didn't have to be there, we wouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The grimlings in the mini mines in Tenebrous (sp?) mountains drop some high cash gems (comparable to CC ? ) and should be soloable. I think the mobs are level 35-37 there. Heard stories about 5 k per day but never found the time to actually spend longer than 2 clearings there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just take your cleric with you and plow through Veksar.  There are some pretty nice drops from easy easy mobs that sell for 5-10K each in Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uthaar60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">solo recomendations for me would have to be...<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns -plat/velium/minor gems/ vendors and bank all near by. i used to make 600pp an hour just doing this...plus once you killed about 50 orcs you should be abel to sell to the vendors there..... also you said you where a smith so you could smelt the velium into sheets/rings/boning if you had the tempers to do it.<br />
<br />
sol a ...fine steel/minor gems/minor magical items/pp ... vendor gnome....drop the copper and silver and you can farm for hours.<br />
<br />
sol b ...fine steel/royals/minor gems/herbs/pp...youll have to zone out to sell at gypsies tough.<br />
<br />
grimling mines in tenebrous mountains....assorted gems/runes/acrylia<br />
<br />
just some suggestions...also if i where you id take some 10 slot bags for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Kill various city guards, depending on your choice of faction(s). A few possibilities: High keep (very weak, 2-3pp swords everytime), Oggok (pretty weak, less than 2k hps I believe, FS sword everytime), Neriak 3rd gate and commons (11.5pp sword every time, guards have 4kish though), Felwithe (21pp sword every time, guards are pallies though and LoH/heal themselves. Kind of long respawn too). Sseru is good as well. Don't know about Katta.<br />
<br />
In addition many city guards drop a 1.5pp shield. Almost all I've fought (possibly not HK) seem to on occassion drop various other junk - usually research items that vendor for about 1-3pp and cheap gems that vendor for about the same. Also many (possibly not HK again) sometimes drop a FS weapon in addition to their regular weapon and shield. They will often dual wield this which makes them quad though. <br />
<br />
You'll either need a mule or a way to maintain good faction with merchants (most guards give a small local merchant hit) to sell stuff and bank (something I love about guard killing - sell and bank right there). I'll leave how to get good merchant faction in a particular city up to you to find out. <br />
<br />
Seb is good too, but mostly the gang (aka iksar jail on some servers) and necrosis camps are where the nice trinkets drop (bugs and iksar necros seem to have a much higher chance of dropping gems than frogloks or golems). I'm sure a 65 warrior could solo the ZI or ZO, but I'm not certain about gang or necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">most ppl make good money off gems solo in seb, just make sure your cleric dispels a few times on the sow frogs. if you lucked out on a haste belt/cloak, theres another 20k+, but you can rake it in pretty good with just the gems. load up on the cha gear before selling, good enchanter/shaman cha buff, and make sure you are at least indifferent to the vendor.</div></div><hr />
