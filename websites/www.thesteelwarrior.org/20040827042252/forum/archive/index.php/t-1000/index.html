<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bardimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont want to sound stingy, lazy or anything so i dont do any /ooc WTB MQ for armor quests...but, my guild is not so good and i am 54 now and in need of armor fast...around how much do ss and/or thurg armor mqs cost, what do i kill to get better ss faction, where are the turn ins for ss armor...i prolly need a key right, and where/how do i go about finding a MQer.  Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am multi-questing armor on Rodcet Nife, But after months of killing giants I have a whole ONE plate BP. Someone offered 1k pp for multi, I laughed at him, will twink another char before I sell it for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does your server have an ezboard? Ask on there, I get smart assed replies when I tried on RN. The only thing better about the Tunare (when I played on that server till the disgusting ebayers pissed me off) board is they remove smart ass posts off anything but the flame board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bardimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im on druzzil ro, how much does the bp mq go for usually...thanks for your responces and i hope to hear from more of you and learn from your knowlegde...PS if anyone on druzzil is doing mqs for thurg or ss armor send me a tell pls lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bp is about 15-20k here i dunno not seen one lately<br />
legs are 3k<br />
rest 1k or less<br />
helm 3k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would also check with the larger guilds for SS armor, they occasionally part with it for badly needed plat. BP for 15-20k is about right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why is it that I can remember seeing /ooc WTB Thurg MQ BP 55K<br />
<br />
My things have really changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its simple, cultural armor ruined the market for MQ, and most guilds end up kos to the dragons after NToV when progressing to Ssra/VT.<br />
Cultural is about the same quality on average (some pieces better, some worse) than skyshrine, so prices should be around the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Buying MQs is tricky, I always tried to steer clear of it when I was lower level... there's way too much trust required of one party or the other, and it's almost always the buyer that is forced to go out on a limb.  I would recommend you be very hesistant to buy a MQ from anyone you don't know (and trust) well.<br />
<br />
Not tryin to make you paranoid, I jus hear stories every day about people gettin ripped.</div></div><hr />
