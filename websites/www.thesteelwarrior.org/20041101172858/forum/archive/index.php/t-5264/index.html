<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilodar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a woodelf warrior the other day and it has been fun playing him. He is only 13 right now but he is leveling fast so I figured I had better look into some better armor. Right now he was a few pieces of crusty, acrylia BP and helm, SCHW, orc fang earring, and a spider fur belt.<br />
I am going to get him another orc fang earing, 2 65 hp rings, and a sword of the bloodsworn, but I am unsure of what to get armor wise. The only warrior armor i know is good is Fierce Heraldic armor but I worship tunare and cant use that. Any other ideas on what I should get? <br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i hear the crafted gothic steel armor from LDoN is pretty good for low/mid lvls. other than that, it seems like you know what your looking for, you just need to find it. you can always go to the bazaar and search by slot, or go through magelos for ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i second that; i got a little wood elf bard in gothic steel armor and the stats for the price ( i think the BP was the most expensive piece i bought; at 250pp ) is incredible.<br />
<br />
latr on, i think you can use the fine heraldic stuff ( kinda same as the deity imbued stuff ) when you're in your 40's but the prices go up a lot</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think I can use fine helardic cause i didnt see wood elf on the race part.<br />
