PlanetSide 7 day Trial.<br />
<br />
The 7 day free trial has been opened up again for anyone who wants to sample the game, or if you're an ex player and want to see the changes that have been made. You will need to make a new SOE station name - you cant use this offer with old characters if you've played PlanetSide before. <br />
<br />
Whats PlanetSide? Watch this video (http://www.marcopolo.me.uk/PSMovies/PS_AD_LARGE.wmv) <br />
<br />
Get hold of a free 7 day trial CD key from http://cmt.ubisoft.fr/planetside_pcgamer/<br />
<br />
And a complete download (1.6gb!!) using this installer http://www.marcopolo.me.uk/psinstall.exe<br />
<br />
You'll find an great FAQ about this trial and PlanetSide here (http://www.marcopolo.me.uk/PSFAQ.html).<br />
<br />
PlanetSide seems to have turned a corner over the past few months - it's become a whole lot of fun again! <br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />

As far as i can tell, this is an unofficial marketing campain lead by current players disgusted at the lack of advertising given to the game. For those that don't know about this game, its a first person shooter with rpg style character progression thorugh certification that let you use various weapons, armor, and vehicles. I played for a few months way back when, but never went back because I cancelled my all access subcription. Since I've never actually bought the game (I activated my SOE account through a promo trial that let me keep my key after paying at least once after the trail expired), I don't actually own a CD of the game. Since then I've wiped my system and lost the client download I had gotten from fileplanet when it was free for download.<br />
<br />
The current promo makes you pay fileplanet for a client download and cd key @ $9. So you can see the problem. The unofficial installer is basicly the Planetside Launchpad, which will allow you to patch the full client onto your system. I'm looking forward to getting this downloaded (gonna take me about 1.5 hours) as it appears much has changed in the game since I last played. Considering the fact that the game was fun then, and I've only heard good things about the later improvments, I'm hoping for the best.<br />
<br />
Planetside currently has one expansion (Core Combat), and one action pack addon. You haven't seen big battles till you've played this game. Its full PvP, there are no NPCs, no quests, just pure action. Its really easy to get into, and I encounrage you guys to check it out, especially if you've already got all access, although you can pay separately. Its a great action packed break from traditional MMOs. Think Counterstrike on a massive scale, without the cheats and hacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also, may I appeal for a general forum for announcments and discussions that are not game specific. Currently most people tend to put their off topic discussions here as there is nowhere else for them to go. Call it the Command Center or something lame like that.</div></div><hr />
