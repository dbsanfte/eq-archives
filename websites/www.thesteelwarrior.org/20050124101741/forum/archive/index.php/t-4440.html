<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">devlok</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Win XP Pro vs. and was wondering if their is some type of program that detects hardware change? Awhile back I bought a 512MB of Geil Goldendragon series PC3200 DDR Ram. <br />
<br />
Well when I put it in my computer started going crazy.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Computer Hardware &gt; Memory (System Memory) &gt; GEIL &gt; N82E16820144609 <br />
GeIL Golden Dragon Value Series DDR 512MB PC3200 400MHz MODEL# GD3200-512V - OEM <br />
Specifications: <br />
6 Layer Lower Noise Golden Dragon PCB, bulk pkg <br />
5ns WLCSP <br />
Pin Count: 184 <br />
CAS/Timing: 2.5/7-4-4 2T <br />
Voltage: 2.6v-2.9v <br />
<br />
<br />
So I fugured it being since it was a different stlye than what I am currently using that it didnt like it so I sold it to a friend who was building a new PC..<br />
<br />
Then I upgraded my video card from a GF4 TI4200 to a Hercules Radeon 9800 PRO. Worked great when I first installed it. Then the next da when I turned on my PC everything went crazy, from my PC locking up on boot-up to finally fixing that to not detecting my modem any longer. <br />
<br />
So I did a fresh format and install of Win XP and bought the Norton 2004 System Works. Well when I first installed it it detected a WIN32 Blaster.Worm. I was surprised seeing how this was a fresh install and all and havent even connected to the internet yet. Well got the tool removal and got rid of it. <br />
<br />
So another week draws by and I decide to buy the Ram I wanted, seeing howw Newegg has them back on stock and all. So I purchased this:<br />
Computer Hardware &gt; Memory (System Memory) &gt; GEIL &gt; N82E16820144304 <br />
GeIL DDR RAM 512MB PC-3200 400Hz Ultra- CAS 2, 1T CommandGL5123200U. DDR400, CAS 2, 184 Pin Dimm, 6-3-3 1T Timings,6 Layer Low Noise PCB. Pure Copper Heat Spreader with 3m Patened Thermal Tape; Clear Acrylic Retail Package - Lifetime Warranty More... <br />
<br />
<br />
Same memory as what is in my PC now. I got it today, went upstairs opened my case and put it in. First boot up crashed, said something about Hardware change. So I re-booted again and got to the desktop. Two min later another bluescreen. So I started thinking maybe the ram was bad. So I took it out and swapped it with one of my other sticks, leaving the other out of the PC to be sure and worked fine. I left the new stick in slot 1 and took out the stick in slot 2. So I know the memory and the Ram slot is good. <br />
<br />
What else can I do? They are all 512MB PC3200 DDR sticks. Not to mention the other problems I had with the other ram and Video card. I really do not wis to try another format seeing I have to re-patch everything for EQ. Only takes about 12 hours or so on my dial-up. <br />
<br />
My Mobo is an ASUS A7N8X Deluxe<br />
Running it with an AMD 2500XP Barton processor. <br />
<br />
Please help as I want to get that ram in there. I run 3 instances and really like to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He upped the voltage on the memory slightly (very slighty, be careful) and it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

You can fry your system if you screw something up.  Here is a website that I go to when I have a problem. <br />
