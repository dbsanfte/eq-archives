(thinking about how it compared to the red epic which is 500.)</div></div><hr />

What do I mean? Mob inc, I start to whack him, friend shammy waits like 5 secs to slow it, I remember proccing Frosty and the mob (if I didnt taunt just as slow landed) would still go to slower (even if proc landed). Now, if I compare it with a CHoS proc, proccing it once on those 5 secs, it does seem to keep the mob on me and have no reason to taunt other than than the ocassional 'taunt to be sure'. So, I have no idea how much raw hate it generates, if you happen to know how much does a  65 shammy slow generates, its around that or lower :)<br />
Just tried to toss my 2cp according to my experience :)<br />

  Hmm...and here I was thinking that most of the agro from the proc was the AC debuff.  I know Shadow Vortex (a SK AC tap, now on some bows) gave a ton of agro because it was an ac debuff.  However, they killed that when the whole Recourse thing went in, it wasn't assigning the same agro as it used to.</div></div><hr />

I recall a long time ago, the epic proc was a 12ac and other stats debuff (and they changed it to raw hate and DD). So debuffs were always a good choice for agro imo. But it seems that stat debuffs &gt; other kind of debuffs, cause there is this sword that procs a resists debuff and I heard its not that great agro *shrugs*.</div></div><hr />

just wanted to clean up my info ;)<br />
