<br />
Here is my magelo profile http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=562351<br />
<br />
Please don't laugh :) <br />
<br />
I also am platinum challenged (I only have 1.4k in the bank right now) but would like some suggested upgrades to shoot for. My primary use right now in guild is as a SA, but eventually I would like to be a MA. I also would like some opinions on which is the better combo<br />
<br />
I have the snowchipper (primary) /JBOM (secondary) for 1HS combo <br />
<br />
or I have the Thorneblade of the Ykesha as my 2HS. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Especially a fellow warriors. My own Magelo would have looked alot like yours when I was 53. You are in a very difficult area of a warriors life, you are pre 55. It is also going to be difficult to get upgrades. My suggestion is to rely on your guild ( if that is possible ) and try to get some Thurg/Kael/ armor. You could also take the guild into the Plane of Growth and try to get some Berserkers armor.<br />
Once you 55+ then you can start to hunt in ToV and get some Skyshrine armor.  Upgrading at your level is going to be difficult: as you never really have any money unless you are a serious trader type ( i never was ) and almost all the gear that upgrades you will be dropped off mobs you require alot of people to take down.<br />
For weapons try taking a group into the new Droga and try getting the drop off King Dronan: the copper hammer of striking. He is level 61 so it would be a hard fight for you.<br />
Best of Luck in whatever you do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelor</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Naralli, I appreciate the thoughts. It has been hard upgrading. What's even more depressing is the inability to hold aggro (I won't go there though, a whole nother rant). I see some of this armor going for 10KPP plus and the most I have ever had was 2.4K...depressing. But warriors are the best and I am going to keep at it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A suggestion for a weapon additionally is to Hunt the named Seer in Droga as he drops the sword of the Bloodsworn. Drops off this guy:<br />
 http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12542I actually think you could take a single group of 55ish level all the way to this camp and hold it rather effectively. This mob spawns above where the King room is  located above area #1 on the map at this link:<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/templeofdroga.html<br />
He is somewhat rare, I see him about once every 2-4 hours.<br />
The sword would be a significant upgrade for you. Ensure you take a Chanter there for crowd control. The only real issue is can your group handle it? The mobs down there are all 60-61 in level..so it will be a damn hard fight.<br />
If you can handle this camp you could try to get the King Dronan camp below. Is alot of mobs in King room all closely packed together tho so it is a bit harder.<br />
I really recommend Droga for many upgrades for you. have a look through the bestiary and pour over the named mobs to see alot of excellent and attainable drops for you.<br />

Thanks again for your comments. We have been in droga but not made it to the King's room yet. I will try to get my guild to head there. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The least expensive upgrade I can see atm for you is the Velium Fire Wedding Rings, 6AC/65HP's.  I am guessing they will run 350-400pp each so it will eat up a considerable share of your hard earned pp.  After that I would try to get your guild into Kael to farm armor.  At times when you are hunting for experience, take a healer and maybe another melee or damage dealer and hunt seafury cyclops in Ocean of Tears.  The exp won't be that good but the cash and gem/jewelry drops helps the pp situation and you get a little exp along the way.  Seb could be another alternative to that as well although more difficult.<br />
<br />
As far as campable upgrades, I will suggest a few more.  Take a full group to Burning Woods and kill the named monkey (Gullerback?) there for a tattered mantle, shoulders ac12/20hps.  Go to Maiden's Eye and kill the robed figures for Axeroths (sp) belt of defense, AC20/15STR/15WIS.  Crystal Eyes in Velks lab drops a nice face piece, 8AC/35HP's (good exp camp).  Giants in Frontier Mountains drop a 10AC belt if the one from ME is out (those ME mobs are fairly high level).  Can't remember the name of the mob, but one in Scarlet Desert drops a bracer of defense, AC15/3STA/20HP's (not sure on exact stats).<br />
<br />
These all could be possible things you could get with a full group or two (not sure of your guilds gear/levels/etc.)  These won't be extremely easy mobs so don't underestimate them, bring plenty.  Like in ME there are some nice drops for many classes I think so maybe a guild could make a day of it.  If ME proves to be easy I would take them to Umbral Planes right next door.  There is Moktor armor that drops there and some pieces would be upgrades for you.  There is armor there that drops for all classes although the shammy armor from there sucks for some reason.<br />
<br />
Hope these ideas help.  Before I would try to kill these I would research them a lil bit on Allah's for possible drops, levels of mobs, etc so you know how many to bring.  But to me it looks as if your guild should start heading to Kael to get armor if the rest of your guild is similar in level for equipment.<br />
<br />
As far as aggro, a Frostbringer is a very good weapon, unfortunately will be out of your price range for a while I think, 5-7K probably.  I have heard that a Black Blade of Tormenting has a good aggro proc on it and is fairly cheap I think &lt;1k.  A quested no drop weapon Praetors Blade of Debilaty (sp) is suppose to be similar in aggro as well and it is free.  Some other cheaper alternatives for aggro might be a Journeyman's walking stick (tash), Silken whip of Ensnaring (snare), Kunzar Kujuch (engulfing darkness) or even a 3/20 whip from Blackburrow that procs Stun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudaan</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are acrtually quite a few upgrades you could do.  As earlier posted, get a couple of velium fire wedding rings.  Crested Spaulders would be a nice cheap upgrade for your shoulder slot.  Put a Goranga Idol in your range slot.  Goranga idols are very cheap nowadays.  Smiter's girdle for your belt slot.  Spider Fur cloak for back.  There are still quite a few cheap upgrades available to you.  If you need plat, then get out there and farm spiders in EK.  For a few hours of your time you could come out with 1000pp of silks to sell(server prices will vary).</div></div><hr />
