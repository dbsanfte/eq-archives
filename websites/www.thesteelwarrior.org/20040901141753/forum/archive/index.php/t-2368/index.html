<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Really tough call.  I'd have to go with either Mall Rats or Dogma, but I'm not sure which.  If I can decide for sure I'll come back and vote. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tough call between Clerks and Dogma...<br />
<br />
But Dogma introduced Buddy Christ, so Dogma it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clerks. Don't even kid on the genious of that movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I too had to go with the Buddy Christ.<br />
<br />
You're an innocent.....you've actually led a good life....but you didn't say God bless me when I sneezed!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Clerks because it started all of this not to mention the writers were more free with the humor because the film was never intended for mass audience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree<br />
Clerks was pure Genius Although Dogma had some high points!!</div></div><hr />

 &quot;I'll tell you what you need is a fatty-boom-batty blunt! Then I gaurantee you'll see a sailboat, an ocean, and maybe even some of them big-ti!!ied mermaids doing some of that lesbi@n shi^!  Look at me look at me you fat sloppy bish!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Kevin Smith is a frickin' genius no matter which movie you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Clerks all the way baby</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roehm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While I voted for Clerks, I almost voted for Mallrats.<br />
<br />
Clerks is the quintessential Smith.<br />
<br />
Mallrats, is Kevin Smith with an exclaimation point. That movie is so freaking funny.<br />
<br />
Chasing Amy, is Smith with emotions.<br />
<br />
Dogma is Smith with a soul.<br />
<br />
J&amp;SBSB is Smith giving us fan service, i.e. &quot;Mallrats2: Mallrats Go Nationwide&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember working at Blockbuster when Clerks was released.  After seeing it, Randall was our hero for life.  When he laid into that bitchy lady and told her she couldn't rent there anymore, it was a culmination of everything I ever wanted to do to some of the jackass customers we had to deal with.  Of course, she probably ended up down at &quot;Big Choice Video&quot; :D   Good stuff!<br />
<br />
Gnomers had the order about right, but I'd probably put Dogma in front of JaSBSB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Clerks overall was the best. But Mallrats and Strike Back had some of the best quoteable lines. A couple of my favs.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you do anal? is it true chicks fart when you blast em in the ass&quot;<br />
&quot;Make it fast.. and sexy... and when its over say My what a lovely tea party&quot; ( &lt;3 Deidrich Bader)</div></div><hr />
