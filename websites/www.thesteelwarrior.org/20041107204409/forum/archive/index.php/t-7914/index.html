<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before I deployed I had convinced a few friends to go with me up to PoM and hunt for a spell component..In our group was a good friend of mine from real life who was playing a lvl 53 enchanter. We were camped out on the castle wall hunting the mini zoro's and it was getting pretty boring so I turned to Dorenie (the chanter) and asked her to mez one of the rascals.. She was hesitant and was unsure if she could even mez the little bugger..The conversation went a little like this.<br />
Gustov: Hey, dorenie, try and mezz em.<br />
Dorenie: Um, I dont think I can.<br />
Gustov: Whats the worst that could happen?<br />
Mehinny: (the druid) She could get creamed.<br />
Gustov: Nah, they dont hit that hard, sheesh.<br />
Dorenie: Um, how hard do they hit?<br />
Elfton: (ranger) Not that damn hard, just mez em!<br />
Dorenie: Fine! But if I die Im gonna be really pissed!<br />
At this time Dorenie goes running down the wall her robes flapping in the wind.<br />
Elfton: Private message to Gustov: Dude, theres no way she can mez em, she's gonna get spanked.<br />
Gustov: PM back to Eflton..:Yeah, this is gonna be soo funny!<br />
About this time Dorenie casts her mez and low and behold the little bugger does a quick about face and comes tearing off after Dorenie, who is now high tailing it back toward us..<br />
Dorenie: (while running like mad) You guys suck! I soooo owe you!<br />
Gustov: (laughing so hard, typing was difficult. : Run dorenie, Run!<br />
Mehinny: Guess she should have invested in Run three.<br />
Dorenie: You fuckers better pay for my rez!<br />
Elfton PM to me: Dude, I think she is pissed.<br />
Gustov: Yah, I can tell..I better log my cleric, she only lives a mile from me..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did something like that one day.<br />
<br />
Was running a fear raid for a RL buddies guild. And we were up to the gholems.<br />
<br />
We needed someone to take the DT as you pull. We had a druid the whole raid asking just stupid noob questions over and over and was anoying us.<br />
<br />
Kizef tells raidchat &quot; Hey Druid_001 come here a min I need your help pulling&quot;<br />
Druid_001 tells Kizef &quot;sure what do I do?&quot;<br />
Kizef tells Druid_001 &quot;easy see that gholem up there? Nuke him with your biggest nuke&quot;<br />
Druid_001 tells Kizef &quot;But he will kill me why dont I snare it?&quot;<br />
Kizef tells Druid_001 &quot;NOOOO. We need to get it back to camp as fast as we can. We only have 18secs or pull it&quot;<br />
Druid_001 tells Kizef &quot;ok.. but I really think I should snare it&quot;<br />
<br />
Dread Shouts &quot;Druid_001&quot;<br />
<br />
I pull it back to camp and we kill it without another DT.<br />
<br />
Druid_001 tells Kizef &quot;What happened I died before it even got to me?&quot;<br />
Kizef tells Druid_001 &quot;hmm not sure. Must be a bug. Lets try it again on the next gholem it should go better.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Its been 2 years and we are still laughing about that druid. Im not sure he ever figured out what a Death touch was.</div></div><hr />
