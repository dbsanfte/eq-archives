<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DJP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I dusted off my alt, a war, and managed to lvl him up to 63 by now. But i need an advice about an agro combo.<br />
<br />
My alt has :<br />
BoC<br />
CHoS<br />
Fabled Short Sword of the Ykesha (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27282) <br />
And Cold Steel Brand (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26460) With Guard2 aug<br />
<br />
And i'm working on my anger2 and 3 augs atm.<br />
<br />
Btw, can anyone explain me about one more thing ?<br />
I noticed sometimes, depends on who is in adv group, that with Incite disc and <br />
Fabled Mithril Two-Handed Sword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27240), i can get a better agro than with CHoS + CSB<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both of the procs on the cold steel brand are very low aggro.  Guard2 in particular is essentially zero aggro.  As well, the offhand generates almost no aggro from just its melee damage.<br />
<br />
So it essentially comes down to the aggro of CHOS vs. the aggro of FM2HS.  I am not surprised that the 2 hander comes out ahead.  Two handers have measurable aggro just from swinging, where 1 handers have very little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">also depending on the amount of offensive aa's dealing with your 2Hers; the 2hers will win out .. usually pre-60 your 2Her won't carry ya through; but post 60 ( like you being at 63 ) ... i'd say go with the fabled mith...hell, augment that thing and go to town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you actually have a BoC, why aren't you using it? BoC + CHoS seems like your handsdown best aggro combo except before you proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 handed weapons generate more aggro initially, if the DW setup doesn't proc early. Seeing as early on in a fight is where aggro tends to be most sketchy, a solid 2hs can often do well on short fights due to the reliability. On longer fights, procs WILL happen, and WILL generate more aggro over time. <br />
<br />
  I'd go BoC mainhand and FSSOY offhand. FFSOY should have around the same aggro as a CHoS, and it's hands down cooler. BoC is by far your highest aggro weapon of that list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agree with fitemore. Use BoC+FSSoY just cuz CHoS looks like ass and every mnk/bst has one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Damn, I remember when so many people would complain about the Yak look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DJP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have heard somewhere than selfbuffs in fight gives a bit agro but anyway, i put guard2 only for soloing. I don't want to move it to BoC coz i would to put anger2 on then aug3 later.<br />
Thx for advices all, i will keep BoC + FSSotY in group then FM2HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, some buffs give aggro and some don't. Guard has been very poorly rated by most people, but rune 3 gives 200ish aggro per proc. Not all debuffs are high aggro either. For example, frostbite, an ac debuff, gives decent aggro as well as obsidian shatter, another ac debuff. However, fiery curse gives absolutely no aggro at all as a fire debuff, more like malo than tash.</div></div><hr />
