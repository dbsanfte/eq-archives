<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, I am trying to better the website I myself have built for my guild and well, I know NOTHING about website building.  I simply took frontpage did some HTML there and uploaded it to AOL Space (yes I know I'm a looser).<br />
<br />
I see other guilds websites and they don't only look way better but they also seem at least to be easy to update.  I know nothing of what CGI means or PHP or ASP or anything and obviously I don't have a hosting anything that supports SQL stuff or Pearl or god knows what other terms I have no clue what they mean (yes I am that dumb)  But I am willing to change all that and have the $$ to buy software and hosting space etc.. <br />
<br />
I have talked to other people and heard that alot of the new high end web building stuff has a &quot;frontpage&quot; like program for stuff like that such as:  Dreamweaver, DHE editor and god knows what other names I've heard.. anyone have any suggestions for my non-webdesigner, web designer wanna be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just make a nice, functional HTML site until you decide you want to learn to other languages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a few websites out there that teach ya HTML and such...Webmonkey, W3 schools, etc. Dreamweaver is a cool HTML program, shows you what you're making as you code it.<br />
<br />
Start with the basics and build from there. Keep it clean, easy to navigate, and easy on bandwidth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems vBulletin itself has a &quot;frontpage news&quot; option?  As in you can simply update the front page of a website via post?  That wouldn't be bad and would take care of easy updating and forums in one shot.. but I looked into that and I guess there is server side stuff for vBulletin like CGI or PHP or something like that.</div></div><hr />

Try another free board system, see if it's the type of thing you like. PhPbb and Invision board are two great systems, won't cost you a dime in liscencing.</div></div><hr />
