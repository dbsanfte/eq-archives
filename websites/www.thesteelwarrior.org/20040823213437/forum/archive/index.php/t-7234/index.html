<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently put up a teamspeak server for some local uses here.. but I figured I would extend this invitation to everyone.. if you have any use for this server whether it be for your EQ Guild or for another game, let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shorty incase anyone hasnt said it today you are the man:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice :) I use teamspeak for Soldier of Fortune 2: Double Helix....<br />
<br />
I can definately log on an chat with people tho when I play EQ or jus chillin.<br />
<br />
Was wondering honestly why TS wasn't more popular within the EQ crowd; I know it'd be too hellishly chaotic in raids, but in exp groups it seems like it could be handy.<br />
<br />
Can I get IP and password (if applicable?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually have a guild which uses TS for raids - you can moderate channels and everything just like IRC so it can be made manageable.<br />
<br />
I'll just post it here and anyone who wishes can use it - if you want any extra privs or anything let me know.<br />
<br />
teamspeak.xwarzone.com default port</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ventrilo &gt; TS<br />
<br />
<br />
We've been usin it on raids for the past few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild uses teamspeak on raids.  Works pretty well, although I rarely join it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am in a TS server with other guildies but its basically for just chatting etc.<br />
Not enough people go for it to use on raids although for the life of me I have no idea why.<br />
<br />
Ive been using it for months now and cant imagine not chatting via voice while playing EQ.Definitely enriches the experience(Also makes groups a heck of a lot easier, no need to type to communicate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild has been using one for several months.  It went down just before a raid a little while ago, and it was a big adjustment to have to type everything in !<br />
<br />
We don't use it to discuss whats happening raid instruction wise, but we do use it for pullers, and raid leaders in their own channel.  Makes efficient use of making a raid faster if you don't have to wait for someone to type a reply.<br />
<br />
Grouping, with all 6 in the channel, we barely type :)  Near instant response makes for a much funner game experience, as mistakes and frustrations come across a lot less , IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Vamcoy's a brown-noser :P<br />
<br />
Light Warriors started using a TS server regularly and are having a great time with it.<br />
<br />
We use it on raids to coordinate moves, pulls etc, but not enough people on it yet, for full scale operation.</div></div><hr />
