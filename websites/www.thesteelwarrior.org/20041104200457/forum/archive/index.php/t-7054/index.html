<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just made the elementals and I was wondering which items to stick the 40hp augs considering I may be seeing some upgrades soonish.<br />
<br />
Personally I was thinking either chest and legs or head and legs (I can currently afford 2 augs with my LDoN points) but just wanted a bit of advice from you guys.<br />
<br />
Also which of my items should I be looking to upgrade first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off, grats on the EPs!  Keep in mind that until you start doing EP Gods, you most likely won't be finding any new BP/Legs until that time.  Tossing 40hps on the BP and legs might not be a bad idea, considering your probably going to want to start collecting molds (every slot minus the BP drops in the EP, legs only coming from Gods), which means the Helmet of RZ might be replaced by an EP helm soon enough.<br />
<br />
But if your guild is anything like mine, plate was always the most expensive, so molds come far and few between for the plate classes.<br />
<br />
I can't give you much solid advice on best items to upgrade first, but I can at least try and give you insight into what to expect in the ways of upgrades.  GL with those molds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Out of those options, definitely the BP.<br />
<br />
 For some bizarre reason, people continue to neglect 10ac augments however. Use your remaining points to get 10ac augments for your neck, belt and mask. All three of those spots you will probably not replace until Time. That 30ac you get there will serve you MUCH better than any 2 40hp augs, for less cost.<br />
<br />
After you get ac augments for those slots, adding 40hp to your leggings would be your next best bet for your current gear. Augment any Raex gear you get though, it'll be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Augment any Raex gear you get though, it'll be worth it.<br />
I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I completely agree with Fitemore. Augment the BP with the 40hps aug then do AC on your neck, waist, and face with the 10AC augs.<br />
<br />
Then if you have more points later on, augment the legs with 40hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conanette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cheers for the advice guys.  Will check out the AC augs asap  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fitemore is right on.  Also, don't forget the Ferubi augs (2 x 15 ac, 2 x 25 hp/mana/end).  You can use those to put in places where the LDON AC augs won't go, like rings, gloves or bracers.  Then you can use the 25's to make those high AC/decent HP VT items last a little longer.  The best part is that even if you upgrade, it only takes a group to go replace them.</div></div><hr />
