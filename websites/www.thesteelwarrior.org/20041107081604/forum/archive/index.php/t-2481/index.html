<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">An average cleric saves someone's life probably 200 times in a raid. 1CH = 1 life saved. 1 quick heal on a chanter after a mez resist = 1 life saved. It goes on and on. I think nothing of it, fuck it that's their job. Shut your fucking hole and heal!<br />
<br />
 Maybe 1-3 times per raid, when I don't MT, I save someone's life with /shield. Or don't even save it, but just absorb 5-6 hits. Invariably every single time I do this I feel like some kind of superhero. Like *I* just saved the day, single-handidly. Never mind the healers that kept both me and the shieldee alive while I protected them. I was the one that threw myself on that grenade and God damn it, I am a hero! My chest puffs out. I intently watch the chat box to see if anyone noticed my selfless act. I watch the tank channel to see the anguished cries of the other warriors who tried to steal my glory and were met with a sad line of &quot;You cannot shield someone who is already BEING SAVED BY GRIMMLOKK! For he is the true hero here, you sorry excuse for a sidekick.&quot;<br />
<br />
 So I was wondering, does anyone else feel inappropriately heroic when they save someone with shield? And if so, do you think clerics feel the same way if they tank something??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am glad I saw this comrade.  I was in droga today, the fourth add popped (farming seer and king), and I was at my wits end keeping hate on the things enough for the slows, and cheals.  The fourth one just was too much and starting mercilessly beating on my shaman.  Cleric heals the tank and I pop shield on the shaman.  Life goes from 30 percent, 27, 24, 18, 10, 3 percent and BAM heal for 3k lands (or some such rediculous cleric number).  After this I look around, no dead casters, and I think to myself &quot;Damn that /shield thing is useful&quot;  Then my shaman friend says &quot;Damn that /shield thing is useful&quot;.  Yes Grimmlokk in my little tank world, in the sea of 6 adventurers, the Right Hand of Thule, the Legion's Finest, Trooper extaordinaire, is a hero.<br />
<br />
I was extremely pleased with myself.  Way more then I am tanking BoT mini's, or Vindi, or some quad for 900k freek of nature.  I absorbed maybe 500hp max, but I saved my caster.  To me as a Warrior, there is no greater reward or duty I have.<br />

Slow resist, mob on slower.. /shield saves his life most likely.<br />
Especially on Stromm, where mobs still hit for 40% buffed HP on casters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I must say that of all the times ive used shield, perhaps only less than 5 percent has resulted ina life being saved, as opposed to absorbing damage which could have been healed.  Most of this is due to the &quot;screaming caster&quot; syndrome, but on the times it has meant the difference between life and death, it felt real good to make a difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That would be one of the minority cases i mentioned wouldn't it Trondir?  :) Hmm, having said that though i'm probably biased since I only ever got to use /shield on tremendously hard hitting POP mobs not at level 30....<br />
<br />
/agree Gulug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a cleric and...well, mostly a main slower at this point, I'm surprised more warriors don't use /shield.  You don't have to be the MT to use it even.  People say it's usefulness is limited...guess what?<br />
<br />
Like Valeris said, the reason you get thanked for it because /shield is something everyone can actually SEE.  It's hard to miss the &quot;Soandso uses Warrior as a living shield!&quot; message (okay, I miss it because my hits are the same color).  It's not like Taunt where they have to accept the fact that you're probably trying to use it.  They get that great message and suddenly, unless they suffer from &quot;caster panic&quot;, they go from:<br />
<br />
OMG!  GET IT OFF ME! GET IT OFF ME!  YOUR CLERIC/ENCHANTER IS BEING KILLED!  HELP! HELP!  TAUNT, YOU GODDAM BASTARD! TAUNT!<br />
<br />
...to...<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, you can get it off me now.  Healer sending heals already?  Lets get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
...and sometimes...<br />
<br />
&quot;Woo!  You the man!&quot;:D<br />
<br />
They can see you're actively trying to do something, not just praying to the taunt gods. (I think we need to petition for deities to be changed.  Suddenly worshipping the God of Hate doesn't sound like a bad idea...if it actually did something.)  Whether it actually does something or not, the perception is you're actively working.  And like many warriors have said on this board, when people are choosing between warriors and knights...perception is everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've never really had use for /shield.. Used it twice or so in testing. Really hasn't caused any problems either, gay skill. Should be automatic if anything. /autoshield a target or two, /shield if they get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Setting a player to /autoshield would make the skill incredibly enticing.  Especially when you know you have a potentially sloppy situation coming up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, possible 3 named nasty bitches on inc.  AE teams ready?  Warrior shield targets ready?  Bring em in!&quot;<br />
<br />
When you absolutely, positively have to keep &lt;insert biznatch&gt; alive, use /autoshield.<br />
<br />
Damn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Auto-shield would be kinda boring imo. <br />
<br />
If they would just double the range on /shield it would be alot more usable though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree Gulug  <br />
of course, when you use shield whenever its up and someone overagros, you get a 5% rate.  I never shield a caster vs a slowed mob, so I rarely  really use shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is not often that I get to attribute a saved life to /shield, but last night it did.  <br />
<br />
We were in PoV on NE wall when some fool pulled a spider along the top of the wall. All of a sudden, the cleric was getting beat on hard.  Shaman got aggro long enough so cleric could heal himself, but the mob was not slowed and was beating the shaman done hard.<br />
<br />
I stepped in trying to taunt it off the shaman but low health aggro was not my friend. Fired off /shield along with ever trick in the book to grab aggro.<br />
<br />
Well CH landed as shaman was just about to drop (around 1% or less health). I got aggro at same time and we proceeded to clean up the mess.<br />
<br />
The cleric got all the praise but I know that if it were not for /shield the shaman would have been paste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As Valeris and Kaesorn mentioned, /shield is something that everybody sees.  It's amazing how often people see me shield them and say things like &quot;omg you're the first warrior I've ever seen that uses shield!&quot;.  Sure most of the time the person would have lived without /shield, but people see that, and appreciate it.  Use /shield and use it often.  Use it anytime someone besides you is getting hit and you're in range.  Don't worry about saving it for a dire situation, it comes back in 3 minutes or something.  <br />
<br />
Little things like that are the difference between a good warrior and a mediocre one.  People say warriors are easy to play but hard to play well.  The reason for that is they've grouped with warriors that don't use taunt effectively, that don't use /shield, that stand there for 10 seconds when someone pulls aggro off of them, because they're watching TV or cybering instead of paying attention.  That then yell at everyone in their group for not knowing how to play.  That spam the group with links of all their uber gear and then still can't hold aggro worth a crap.  That don't turn mobs so pets can hit them in the back.  That don't want to pull, and get trains every time they do.  That won't adapt to different slowers and healers.  The list goes on forever.<br />
<br />
If you want to get pickup groups, know how to hold aggro, with proximity, taunt, procs, bash, and watch for things like slow messages to know when to taunt.  Don't be afraid to pull and know what you're doing when you pull so you don't train your group.  When you are pulling, do it fast, be off like a shot the second the mob in camp dies or starts to run, but stop if you hear your cleric start a heal on you.  Do everything *fast*.  Shoot arrows at mobs on inc if you're not pulling, hit them with bash and taunt the second they get to camp, stand close to the slower, watch for slow messages and be super-quick on the taunt button.  Be ready to /shield if the taunt doesn't work.  Be cheerful and pleasant in group chat, don't yell at people even if they suck, just give them helpful hints and if they don't listen, put them on your &quot;do not group&quot; list.  Know about gear and always be looking to upgrade, through quests or the bazaar or whatever.  Put in the effort to maximize your character, even if your guild doesn't give you access to uber stuff.  Don't try to get more than your share of the loot, and make a point of splitting everything equally.  <br />
<br />
All this stuff will get you a reputation as a kick-ass tank.  People don't remember exactly what you did, but they remember that grouping with you was a lot more pleasant than that noob warrior they grouped with that couldn't hold aggro and yelled at everybody.  I've had guildmates ask me &quot;how can you hold aggro better than XX warrior who has better weapons?&quot;  It's all these little things that add up to you being a great exp group tank.  People DO remember things like that, and it WILL get you groups.  And the best groups are with that really smart cleric or shaman that remembers you and sends you a tell for another group when they see you looking for one.  Good players remember other good players, and try to group with them again.  It goes both ways.<br />
<br />
If you think playing a warrior means hitting auto-attack and mashing taunt then you are not playing your warrior very well, and shouldn't be suprised you have trouble getting groups.<br />
<br />
So there you go....Brutul's Guide to Getting Groups Even Though You're Not a Paladin.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Oh, and to avoid ninja'ing Grimmlok's thread...Yes, /shield DOES make you a hero, every single time you use it.  After all, you are sacrificing yourself for the good of someone else right?  All warriors deserve to have their ass kissed profusely each and every time they heroically hit their /shield key.  Spread the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think /shield is a good idea but still clumsy to use.  Why is it have such a long reset time?  If it was just a little more flexible Warriors would naturally use it more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Brutul is my hero.<br />
<br />
I don't know about feeling heroic, but I know the warrior I group with always feels bad when shield doesn't save a life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It does kinda make me feel special when I do it, and I especially love when people comment about it, making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
And again, /shield rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Here is a nice easy way to be able to shield someone at the drop of a pin. This is how I do it, it takes a few keystrokes and you need to watch your target bar but you can do it without loosing a swing on the mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, in the keyboard settings of the options menu... there is a cool shortcut that will let you toggle the last 2 targets. I personally bound this key to the &quot;Q&quot; button. It is right up near my assist hotkey (number 1) so I can switch targets really frickin fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second of all, unless you excel at typing I recommend a /shield hotkey. It doesn't need a name in there, just /shield. Name it &quot;The ass saver&quot; if you please.  I personally don't use it, because I just type out shield, but if you have problems typing somewhat fast, then I reccomend it.<br />
<br />
Ok so the basic procedure is this; The monk pulls a_badass_mob_001. Yay, it's in camp now, you have an unslowed mob beating on your ass. Chanter tashes, but luckily doesn't get agro.  But! Problems arise. Mr. Joe_Blow_Chanter slows and grabs agro. What is a warrior to do?! Well, you hit your taunt key (if it is up). Oh no that failed! The chanter is taking a beating, and his rune is gone, so what do you do? Assist the mob, hit your shield hotkey, and then hit the &quot;Q&quot;Button to get back on the mob. (if you assist the chanter, you may agro something he mezzed, or he may have a group member targeted or whatnot)<br />
<br />
That, imo, is the way to use shield. It's quick and easy and efficient. I find it a habbit now, that I'll assist the mob when I see the slow message, only to find myself targeted and bash my &quot;Q&quot; button to get back on the mob.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps some warriors in their quest to /shield (we all know it's /hero, though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Didn't read all of the post really, but my point in this post was basically this quote from brutul: (sucks at boards quote junk lol)<br />
<br />
&quot;It's amazing how often people see me shield them and say things like &quot;omg you're the first warrior I've ever seen that uses shield!&quot;. Sure most of the time the person would have lived without /shield, but people see that, and appreciate it. Use /shield and use it often. &quot;<br />
<br />
I cannot count how many enchanters I have /shielded since lvl 55 that were shocked to know that we can actually do this.  I get tells from 4 enchanters regularly for groups because I got added to their friend list because I actually /shielded then, and I am still the only warrior that ever does.  Make me wonder when a lvl 60-65 enchanter is like &quot;wow, what is this shield thing you just done on me rag&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hrm...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip, Binnamar. I'll have to toy around with my hotkeys to comfortably fit that in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, been using that to good effect since before i quit raiding. In my case  key 9 /assist, key 10 /shield , the minus key switch back to previous target. i actually saved a fellow warrior once - was using assist to determine if an add was covered and noticed his hp's dropping alarmingly without a heal coming in, found out later his healer had been dropped a second before....:p<br />
<br />
Gets easy with practise but if you're fumble fingered  occasionally like me and just grouping for exp might be worth setting up specific '/shield Slowername' keys - you do loose some flexibility like that though unless you're good at keybank switching heh....</div></div><hr />

Even if Warriors have perfect aggro, no one will thank you for being able to hold aggro or able to taunt a mob off 100% of the time because it's your job.

I'll have to check the exact verbage I used (I ninja'ed the idea from somewhere/one else actually) but I use/like the following for a /shield hotbutton:<br />
-attack off<br />
-assist mob<br />
-shield<br />
-switch back to mob<br />
-attack on<br />
<br />
Note: need some pauses in there to make sure it works right, can post exact text if folks are interested.<br />

You take 50% damage since you're being shielded, but you take 75% of the total hit because you're shielding...that mean you take 125%?<br />

I was in a group in the PoN maze just having a good time with some lower friends. Well we clear the maze and people need to run and such. So, without an evacer there is no way to get us all out other then to duel. so all the melee duel me and I kill them, the other casters gate but the cleric stays. I /duel the cleric and she starts to use her 400point stuns and whatnot. I took off all the buffs and crap and just kept taking punishment. I then /shielded her and started to attack her... I killed myself. Nothing like seeing Binnamar has been slain by Binnamar ! Sad thing is, I lost exp :(</div></div><hr />

The attack on/off thing is in there just cause I hate  missed/oor/can't hit yourself target spam and in case I have the wrong target selected; really isn't necessary but doesn't hurt anything too much either (maybe lose 1 attack round per use, tops).  <br />
<br />
If the mob is indeed mad at me when the button is clicked, shield does &quot;fail&quot; but doesn't get used, so no harm done.<br />

But afterwards all i heard in raid chat was how awesome that /shield was, and what an awesome warrior I am, and how much I rock, and how perfectly timed it was. I have always had a hotkey for that since I was level 35 and got the skill. I use it daily, because it helps on unslowed PoP mobs aggroing casters, and it makes people know that I do pay attention, and I do want them to all live. I love using it, it makes me feel I have gave something back to that cleric who has been healing me all day. And people notice it. It is one of the more beneficial things we as a warrior can do to help people in dire needs. I have to many stories to list about /shield. <br />

I get the feeling some of you guys cant see the forest because of all the trees.  Turning attack off, assisting mob, doing that doing this when all you need is a hotbutton with the following:  <br />
/Shield &lt;insert name&gt;<br />
<br />
This is instant and does not require target swiches etc.<br />
I usually got two of those hotbuttons, one for the main healer and another for crowd control/shammy.(or just judgement call depending on classes/task at hand)<br />
<br />
If anyone else is getting aggro you can try to type it out to save their behind but they deserve to die in most cases imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">2 things suck about shield.  1) It's range is too damn short.  You have to be up the persons ass in order to /shield them.  2) You cannot /shield a person who is currently using a /disc, OR if you are currently using a /disc.<br />

I'm a little skeptical of the guy saying he /shielded the MT on Vindi or whatever.  Either the MT's /defensive wore out (which is possible under lowered dps situation) or the MT wasn't /defensive at all in which case he should have /duel'd him and taken his job :)</div></div><hr />
