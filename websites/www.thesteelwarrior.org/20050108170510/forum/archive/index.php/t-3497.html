<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, ive been in a family guild for about 2 years now, and we are just now getting to the point where we can consistently feild 2-3 groups, we want to start &quot;going up the ladders&quot; and we know that starts with keal, the problem is we dont know much of the progressive ladder beyond that.<br />
<br />
what id like is if some of the more seasoned raid warriors here can give me advice on gear-up zone pregression.<br />
<br />
we have<br />
3 or 4 good clerics<br />
2 awsome shaman<br />
2 or 3 good necro's<br />
3 good 65ish tanks<br />
2 65 chanters<br />
2 65 monks(think 1 might have quit eq havent seen him in months)<br />
<br />
and some more classes (wont go much into detail as they arnt on consistantly and/or and required in a raid)<br />
<br />
so um... so after about 20 more keal runs where next folks?<br />
<br />
also have completed 2 monk epics and have done phinny in kedge, also have a medium sized ally guild that we joint raided fear with, hehe got all of the golems and i got my ball of everliving golem btw :)<br />
<br />
we have also done hate 3 times (got my hand of the mistro :D) with just 4 deaths all togeather</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as starting in Kael goes I'd take a look at Thurg quest armour and see if it really is an upgrade to anyone cos my guess is that it isnt.  There is plenty of bazaar buying stuff these days that is better.<br />
<br />
With those numbers I'd start in either Halls of Testing if you see that the gear is worth it for you, or alternatively WToV cos you will also get a shot at Gozzrem and Telkendor who drop some quite nice loot.<br />
<br />
From there I'd look to hitting Bastion of Thunder towers for the 2-3 groupable named up there for ornate BPs and other goodies.<br />
<br />
Then some of the smaller Luclin named - Rhag 1, Rhag 2, Va'Dyn, Rumblecrush, Doomshade, Evolved burrower etc..<br />
<br />
I the traditional progression of Kael arena - Halls of Testing - Velious named - NToV - Luclin Named etc is pretty redundant now with the amount of bazaar buyable gear and one groupable gear that is much better than what is available in Kael / HoT.  Splitting your guild into 3 XP groups in BoT would probably get you better loot, more XP and be much better value to your guild than a night in Kael arena.  Ofcourse your guild probably wants to raid so look at the normal guild progression path, discount anything that wont give your guild upgrades and start there, I'd recommend WToV if you arent concerned with maintaining dragon faction as you'll get both velious armours and a shot at the WToV named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of us have shit for gear thats why we are still doing kael, and most of the bazaar stuff lacks resists, ill try to get my manglo working today so i can give you an example(problem is most of us are dirt poor)<br />
<br />
NToV? north temple of v? id probibly need a raiding guide for anything past keal hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can talk you through it too :) Thats what we are here for :) :)<br />
<br />
But yah, I would work on getting those 12-18 people killing Vindicator first and make sure your clerics can do a Cheal Chain for 5 minutes without screwing up.<br />
<br />
If you can kill him once, you can kill Statue just about any time...<br />
<br />
When you can walk all over his butt...hint: DC chanters with hasted pets = win!<br />
<br />
Then you can work on taking out Eashen of the Sky and his Buddy Ikatiar the Venom(ous)...<br />
<br />
Make sure two of your tanks are getting to the 8k(ish) hit point range and then you should try and Find King Tormax. This fight will require some more DPS than you are used to so make sure you can Kill Vindicator in under 3 minutes by the time you try him.<br />
<br />
Eashen and Ikatiar are only slightly harder than Vindicator.<br />
<br />
You can try and Kill Dain Frostreaver around this time as well. He is a very tough pull, so allow lots of times for your monks to practice up.<br />
<br />
If your clerics have lots of exp time in between raids, try and get them to dig up some LDON Flowing Thought augs. Also make sure people get their Coldain Shawls and Cabbage Earrings.<br />
<br />
A Bard for Resists (especially with Psalm of Veeshan) will help your guild a TON.<br />
<br />
Try and kill the Va'dyn in Akheva Ruins and have your warriors wear the 100 hp neck slot items (shaderock).<br />
<br />
Velketor will have some good items for your casters as well, and if you can kill Vindi, you can kill him, just make sure you know about when to pop disc, etc...<br />
<br />
After that, your next big fight will be Aaryonar. He has a ton of hps and you need to be able to shield your casters effectively from his AE, as well as be able to handle the respawns (which you can)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok dont know who eashen, ikatiar, and va'dyn are, and our tanks are about 6500 with raid buffs.<br />
<br />
thanks for the reply's so far hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would take your band of merry men and farm the living crap out of BoT. This will server a dual purpose - first of all, you need to get people levels and AAs. The higher your average level and the more AAs you have, the higher the chance of success. You should also be able to pick up a lot of ornate armor for your clan. From the looks of your magelo, most every piece will be a nice upgrade. Once you have a couple of 7-7.5khp tanks doing mobs like Vindi or the lesser NToV mobs are considerably easier on your clerics.</div></div><hr />
