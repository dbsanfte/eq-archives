<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiia Bella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am a first time poster but long time reader of these boards and would like to thank you all for the great information, tips, etc that I have gotten from the posts here. You all have made my life as a warrior much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Just a little background. I did a search and did not find any topics that related directly to my question but it has been something that has been on my mind as of late.<br />
<br />
I took a long break from EQ a while back shortly after Velious was introduced and have just recently come back right before LoY. <br />
<br />
I decided that I would like to transfer a couple of my characters onto the same server, as I had a warrior (was lvl 34 is currently 55) on CT and a druid (was lvl 56 now 62) on Vaz, so later I could possibly get a second account, etc. I moved both chars to Maelin Starpyre and have been enjoying playing on that server. <br />
<br />
Lately I have been frustrated with finding groups. I am guilded (in a small guild) and have a small network of friends, but I do enjoy meeting new people and even though pick up groups can be frustrating, I have met some great people. It seems that most of the time, and I play at a variety of times, most of the major zones are void of players and the LFG options are also virtually empty.<br />
<br />
My question is what are your opinions or experiences of the  general states of your servers, preferably higher population ones. i.e. do the same problems I am experiencing exist in mass on even high population servers as a result of EQ having been played for so long or other factors? <br />
<br />
I enjoy my characters, my guild and the new friends I have made on Maelin but was considering starting a character on a higher population server. However, I do not want to restart if the end result will be the same regardless of what server you play on.<br />
<br />
As a point of reference, I do realize this is not a simple, do this, or don't do that question. I realize that EQ has evolved over the years and is quite a different game than it was when it first came out. <br />
<br />
I am not looking to turn back the clock, to revive the newness that the game had when I first logged into Norrath. I am just looking for opinions or experiences that may give me some insight on how to proceed. <br />
<br />
Nor is this a sob story of how I cannot find a group. Most of the time I can find a group in a reasonable amount of time. I group with guildmates, friends, or strangers. I am simply looking for  more people to group with period in sheer numbers. <br />
<br />
This game still remains enjoyable to me and I will continue to enjoy it and the friends I have made through it regardless of whether I remain active on Maelin or move to another server. <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your input.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Venril Sathir server isn't high population except 50 plus, mostly moveloggers heading to a server that suits their timezone (European). Not much help sorry :)<br />
<br />
Erollisi marr (that I came from) is a pretty old server, as such however the bazaar makes it extremely easy to twink a character, this lead (when I was playing an alt in the 30's) to difficulties finding a group - often a large percentage of the people in zone were being powerlevelled or were simply soloing due to 'overpowered' equipment and had no interest in grouping - (alt was a cleric, heh) I think this would be a fairly common malase on older servers....this was before the overhaul of the group exp mechanics and the KEI nerf however so perhaps things have changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A good way to figure out is this:<br />
<br />
All the main gods (i.e. Veeshan, Cazic-Thule) are most likely the older servers.<br />
<br />
Demigods came next from problems ie Solusek Ro split to Ayonae and Druzzil.<br />
<br />
Then they had others like Zeb and Torvon<br />
<br />
And then you have them run out of ideas for names i.e. Maelin Starpyre and Stromm.<br />
<br />
My take on it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">very wise, ninja ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiia Bella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info on the names, I sort of knew the order that the servers went live in, but that makes it easier.<br />
<br />
But, It was probably lost in the enormity of my initial post so I will try to restate it in a more concise manner.<br />
<br />
Are all servers regardless of age or population size now mostly dead in zones pre-50, slim to none in zones 51-60, and only elite guilds/players populate the upper levels of the game? <br />
<br />
Secondly would any of you see worth in moving to a more populated server than Maelin and starting over?<br />
<br />
Or are the older/more populated servers pretty much set in their guild/player hierarchy in so much that a player starting out now would have a next to impossible time advancing or joining any guilds there unless he or she knew someone on the more populated/older server?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />

No.<br />

Not really worth the cash imho. Maelin has lots of ubers really.</div></div><hr />

I play on Saryrn, and lemme tell ya, being a true noobie on that server would be hell.  There are maybe 1 or 2 true noobies on that server per week, and they are so far behind the curve that its not funny.  There are a lot of people running around on 1500HP level 1 Wizzies, and 2500HP level 1 pallies that its not even funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2500 hp pally? i hope thats with buffs. lol<br />
<br />
I cant speak for other servers but I know emarr is hard for those levelling up. I just started up an alt sham whos level 24 now and finding a group is hard. All the old spots which used to be packed out when i was levelling up are empty. I guess there are 2 reasons for this. One is theres just fewer true newbs coming through and the majority of the population are over 60.<br />
<br />
The other is theres just too many zones to choose from that this spreads the numbers out even more.<br />
<br />
Just out of interest last night i was doing &quot;who all (level) (class)&quot; and surprise surprise, most levels there wasnt even a single player on e.g for clerics, then you started to get several into the 50s and 60s and for 65, there were too many to list.<br />
<br />
So know levelling up alts feels like a rush to get to the higher levels because its just sooo boring duoing or getting a friend to PL u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">same on tunare, starting a new character is extremely difficult. Unless you have a ton of money to twink, or make a solo class and are prepared for tons of downtime, don't restart and stay where you are on starpyre.<br />
<br />
even on the old server (tunare was one of the original servers i believe, and is almost always near the top of the list at peak hours when sorted by pop.) You can go to loio, ot, dl, kc at offpeak hours you'll have the odd traveller/soloer, or BYoG group, no more than 6 people in the zone. Peak hours? you might have 10. now, for the newer zones it's a little easier, but equally unsatisfying...paludal -- marus seru (usually empty between there and NL) -- dsp -- i don't know what people do now after 40. Dungeons are horrible for population, but then again, aside from guk, kc and seb, they always were.<br />
<br />
I myself am a dungeon person, i love crawling, pulling 4 and 5 mobs at a time, making the clerics and chanters work, the other melees and dps assist, use their brains :D ... if you're the same way find some others that love dungeons and see if they're willing to start a new char, each of you start over as a different class and have a pre-detirmined group for when you get on, all kinds of fun. That way if you see something you want, or read about something you want to kill, you don't have to go scrounging for people. The best part is each of you have something to do when the others aren't on, you have your old chars, they have theirs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiia Bella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you all for your responses.<br />
<br />
I suspected that the current gaming population would be similar across most servers. I guess with a game as popular and as old as EQ, in fact most likely all MMORPG's, that have been on the market with any shred of success would have much lower newbie populations.<br />
<br />
It makes sense, I was just looking for some clarification.<br />
<br />
I am continuing with my Warrior on Maelin, almost 57 now.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think that the &quot;decline&quot; in lower levels is just a symptom of the age of the game. I mean my warrior is over 4 years old now, and there are a lot of others out there of similar age, and the ability to Ebay/Playerauction contributes to this a little more.<br />
<br />
On Veeshan (which did have the split into Saryn a couple years ago), there are some guilds under the 60+ crowd but I don't know a lot about them. As far as the lower zones, I havent been to many of them in a while. All the 50-60 zones I haunted are shadows of what they were: Sebilis is a ghost of what it was, Velks Lab is usually pretty empty as well, as is Akheva, Maiden's or Umbral. Haven't been to Howling stones in ages. Going through level 30 zones and under are usually lessons in PLing.<br />
<br />
Raid content is usually kept trimmed pretty close to the ground too: nothing between NToV and the Elemental Planes survives long. I can't comment on the Elementals but with 5 or 6 North American Elemental Guilds + the Japanese population, I doubt its a whole lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Try a PvP server.  There still seem to be a few people in most of the lower level zones on Tallon Zek.  Overall they are lower population servers, but since there are other things to do besides level (pvp) the level ranges seem to be spread out more.</div></div><hr />
