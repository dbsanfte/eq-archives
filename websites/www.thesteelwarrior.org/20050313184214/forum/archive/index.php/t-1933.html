<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has recently started farming the planes, and I'm just curious to know a couple of things. We don't have any elemental armor yet, but actually farming PoFire is hard as hell these days because those minis are being cleared almost instantly. My questions are really the following:<br />
<br />
1) Besides Fire for armor, which plane is the most worth-while for farming?<br />
<br />
2) Listed from easiest to hardest (in terms of difficulty of bosses and #'s required for them), which planes are difficult and which easy?<br />
<br />
3) What is the re-spawn time on most minis? Are they 3-day or 7?<br />
<br />
4) Our member base, I would say isn't that large, considering we don't have that many people that play 24/7. our max attendance nightly reaches about low 50s usually available for raiding nightly (not always the same people on each raid), but we usually get those numbers fairly late in the day (5pst or later, giving about maybe 4 good hours for a raid). Considering we have about 3-4 guilds in elementals on our server competing for the same things, and considering the difficulty of mobs, is our raid force large enough to raid elementals efficiently?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. air &gt; fire &gt; water &gt; earth (?). not done any earth ring yet, but numbers needed for them is probably greater than some of the water minis. not counting tanthisala in PoE, who is easy. someone else could correct me on this.<br />
<br />
3. 3 days for fire/water/air, not paid much attention to earth. someone else could correct me on this. twin birds in fire are 2 days.<br />
<br />
4. low 50's in the beginning of farming is too low IMO. unless you have bots (clerics/dps) it's going to be tough. but with enough clerics with that number you can do the 3 air stooges (mist/wind/smoke), twin birds in fire (as you probably know), and possibly some other easier minis, like pyronis, babnoxis, quavonis. Hydrotha in water too, probably.<br />
And Tanthisala croc in PoE, but doesn't drop molds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50 isnt too bad as long as you have a solid rot and decent dps.  fire and water are a bit tougher than they used to be because of their upgraded dps and hps.  Air is a huge time sink but the avatars are pretty easy, just expect 2 loots every 3 hours.  Hydrotha is probably the only mob youll be able to do in water, although giliothin,who doesnt drop elemental, is doable with an ae sotw rot.  Fire isnt bad, you could de thethe first 3 birds, pyronis, and maybe magmaton or babs if your lucky and have decent tanks and druids.  Imo earth is by far the easiest zone of elementals at this time, even tho only vine ring drops elemental, and only bracers at that.  Every ring is the same basic principle and they are a joke once you get used to them.  The most elemental is in fire but it will take you awhile to get used to the mobs and aes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgor</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can farm some easy loot by doing the rings in PoE . all can be done by 40ppl . only ring 3 will drop elemental armor but loots from other rings are really decent <br />
<br />
stone ring is a joke and I m pretty sure it can be done by 20ppl (we did with 33 and it was easy kill ) <br />
mud ring is really fast and the named is quite fun ( AE root :p ) and not too difficult <br />
vine ring is cool and the named will drop 2 bracers each time but you need DPS in order to down him fast .<br />
soil ring is abit harder because of the 100000 adds that will spawn when you fight the named but still doable by 40 experienced ppl .<br />
<br />
you can also try PoW . hydrotha is just all about MT heal . Grohin the wise is all about AE heals and Krziilk the mighty is some sort of underwater Mithaniel Marr . Stay away from Ofossaa or he will most probably rape you  <br />
<br />
you can give a shot at PoA avatars (exept maybe dust....damn spiders :D )  but you will spend alot of time to spawn them for only 2 loots .</div></div><hr />

Oh, and someone mentioned to me that there is no way of confirming whether the PoEarth rings are up altogether, is that true? if not, how do you confirm it?</div></div><hr />

All that for a gay bard lute, or some fucking leather pants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Air is quite cool, my guild did a lot of it, and really you can get 15 loots a night with 45 50 people without any elem stuff.<br />
<br />
Fire is good, but for a guild new to elem, avoid Reparm, Blazzax, and AM.<br />
<br />
Earth is somewhat like Air, ie easy but long, especialy Mudwalker and Peregrine, the 2 other rings are a bit harder, but np with 55+.<br />
<br />
Water is probably the most difficult place, I would rank Griohin the Wise as hard as Blazzax or very close but still worth it imo, beside for a guild new to elem, if you don't have anything worthwhile up outside E planes, go for it, it's really a good training, considering you have to deal with shitty aggro in PoW, Rampage , massive AE dmg.<br />
And I disagree about the loot, if you are the 4 5th guild making it to elem in your server, you are not likely to see leather leg drop any time soon, so even legs are good, ring is really really cool, drum is so rare than anyway, even if you don't like it, it's not a concern. Anyway can't be worse than Blazzax that drop elem mold and is 10 time harder than AoWind or Pyronis, for example.<br />
<br />
Air is really cool for guild new to elem imo, other guild will rush PoE , PoF , PoW on patch day , so you might be able to get a full air spawn on patch day, getting a ton of good gear including 0-6 elem mold + a dozen of various good items on mini, it's just ... long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">problem with poa is that 1 avatar still seems broken so you can only get him on server reset, the 4th one is entirely too much of a pain in the ass to kill for loots (i'd rather go to the dentist than clear all those spiders + sigmund again) so you are looking at max 4 molds available most of the time.  poa is probably the easiest place to get armor though - the 1st 3 avatars are really pretty easy - 35 people is prolly enough to do them once you know what they do.<br />
<br />
I dont think blazzax is all that hard - after our 2nd or 3rd kill we were able to kill him with 45-50 people without too much trouble &amp; thats in a guild that had only cleared vt like 3-4 times at that point, not a ton of ssra/emp gear either, so we werent exactly geared like superchamps.  I think babnoxis is tougher than blazzax personally.<br />
<br />
I think they should change the loot tables a little - maybe put 3 drops on poa/pow mobs to help compensate for the fact that there just arent nearly as many droppers there as in pof.  POA is especially annoying cause it takes the same amount of time to kill 1st 3 avatars as it does to clear like 6-7 mobs in pof, so if you happen to be in the wrong time zone, you really miss out on a lotta drops.</div></div><hr />

Avatar of Wind ? because on mine it's Avatar of Smoke that does not repop, only up after patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
