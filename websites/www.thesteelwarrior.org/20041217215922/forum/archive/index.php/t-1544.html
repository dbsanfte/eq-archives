We've came into a bit of a situation here lately where we've got our first high level warrior ever. He's having trouble keeping aggro in exp groups though, unless I'm puller. He always loses aggro if I'm not pulling, and he always has an aggro slip on slows. He's getting frustrated, and I've told him to make the attack off/taunt/beg/disarm/attack on hotkey and worked with him a good deal on that. Unfotunately, he doesn't have my flamelick=aggro tool at his disposal, so I'm at a bit of a loss otherwise.<br />
<br />
Here's his Magelo:<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=614145<br />
<br />
We're not a extremely high end guild - as in not keyed for anything but Seb. Highest are a 58 cleric and a 58 ranger, followed by a 57 ranger, 54 chanter, 53 shaman and then the rest are 50-52. Aum should be 53 tonight. We're working on smithing him a full set of Tunare cultural plate. Any suggestions for upgrades we can obtain for him? We do have the added advantage of everything being droppable on our server, so bear that in mind.</div></div><hr />

Have him pick up a wavecrasher and frostbringer, those are both good aggro weapons. Basically you're looking for weapons with a proc, preferably weapons with debuff procs such as slow or snare, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's level 51...he's not gonna hold aggro off rangers who are 6-7 levels higher than him.  I'm willing to bet your AC is about equal to his, so just have the highest ranger tank for the time being until he gets some more levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a frostbringer and a BCA or a WC or a something with aggro proc! BBoT would even work. But as haass said, at 51, he cant hold aggro against higher level people like that, and his taunting skill is weak against the mobs because his level is so close to theirs. <br />

One note is that there is no difference (for a warrior) between the imbued BLESSED Full Mithril Armor and the non-imbued Full Mithril Armor. The stats are the same except Blessed has some +WIS on the pieces.<br />
<br />
He really needs to round out his gear.<br />
<br />
Some stuff (face, finger, bracer, gaunts, BP, belt) are very nice.<br />
<br />
Other stuff (ears, neck, arms, head, shoulders, back, legs, boots) are very lacking.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
EARS - (2) Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings<br />
NECK - Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
ARMS - Champion's Vambraces (drops in kael manor, also good for clerics and other plate classes)<br />
HEAD - Champion's Helm (drops in kael manor, also good for clerics and other plate classes)<br />
SHLDR - Draconic Pauldrons (this a quest, easy for you guys to do, could outfit alot of members with this)<br />
BACK - Cloak of Greater Pernicity<br />
LEGS - Full Mithril Greaves<br />
FEET - Full Mithril Boots</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oddly enough ... if your cash situation is good enough ... I'd recommend getting him a Primal weapon.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh or the red blade from the epic.<br />
<br />
But assuming that the rangers are epiced (with 40% haste) and their wonderful taunting procs, he is in one of the true hells of the 50's warrior. There is about 0 he can do to even compete with a ranger that much higher wiht better haste and DPS. Not to mention the fact, unless they have changed things while I was away, that until he is 60th, taunt does nothing to red or yellow mobs. <br />
<br />
Frosty, Bloodpoint, levels. Levels are really the key. At 55-56 I had problems keeping agro off rangers the same level as me. If you can snag better haste, that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do realize that none of that shit matters one bit if he can't keep aggro right Baadan?<br />
<br />
He'll just have 1100 ac while the mob is hitting the ranger, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things have changed, taunt button does work on reds and yellows below 60.  It's just rarely succeeds, and with who he's with, he'll lose it again immediately after anyway.  What he needs are levels above all.  Though a willsapper and frosty would work well once he has the lvls, if you can afford them.  Also, for those who don't know, epics are still no drop on FV I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd get the druids, shammy's, and clerics together to PL this guy.  higher lvls will bring him up to speed, then you can work on weapons.  Def's are Frostbringer, maybe a Barnicle Covered Axe.  That or you rangers can tank for now till he catches up.<br />
<br />
Big goal is 55 so he gets defensive.  Then get him some form of procing weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your warrior is only gonna be able to keep aggro if the exp group lets him.  This is true whether he has proc weapons or not.<br />
<br />
Such is the life of a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More levels and a Frosty will make a big difference.  <br />
<br />
Once he does get levels, it is all about timing.  You see the Mob_01 glances nervously about/looks uncomfortable message, you punch taunt.  Follow it with a Kick/Slam/Disarm just as a little reminder.  When you see the Mob_01 slows down/yawns message a few seconds later, you punch taunt.  Follow it with a Kick/Slam/Disarm just as a reminder.<br />
<br />
Once I get used to how a certain caster times their spells, I can usually keep aggro off them with taunts (provided taunt actually works).  tell your friend to keep the faith.  The 50s stink for everyone, actually, so do the low 60s, but eventually it does get better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burol</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need to get him some levels and teach the rest of the guild how to NOT steal agro. It is true that he is going to have a very hard time holding agro while you are all higher than he is. But, it is equally true that agro is the responsibilty of the entire group.<br />
<br />
Also, as others have said, try to get him some agro weapons. Depending on your budget or guild capabilities some realistic options are Wavecrasher, Frostbringer, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, and Barnacle Covered Axe to name a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd just like to re-iterate ... that since they people play on FV ... your standard responses on what to look for in bazaar don't really apply.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest we all take a moment to make a level 1 there and go to bazaar to marvel at what life without no drop tags is really like.<br />
<br />
And I maintain that if the warrior is going to save up for a weapon, a Primal Warsword would REALLY help for XP grouping, much moreso than a Barnacle Covered Axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kolanifv</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the ideas, we're starting to work on the Draconic Pauldrons this weekend. I issued him a Snowchipper from the guild bank alt last night, and drug him along in the Mephit Caves in PoN to offtank adds.<br />
<br />
I'm lierally a Jade Reaver from my epic - damn things never drop while I'm there, and I'm not paying 55k for something I'm turning in - but as soon as I get it, I'm giving him my Windspeeder, would put him at the same haste as the rangers. He's got a Silken Whip, as well. Other ranger is a 2 hand specialist, we can keep aggro on him, it's the shadowknights we have trouble with stealing it. We use our Jolt combat innate when we're around him, we don't like the aggro when we have a proper tank.<br />
<br />
Does the Bioluminescent Orb (right click Flash of Light) add to aggro? If so, I have one sitting around on the bank alt. I use the other one for bow kiting  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, just thought I'd add something about the hotkey you were talking about before.  Beg should be removed from it.  It only adds aggro on critical failures (fairly uncommon).  Also, the amount of aggro it generates is low.  Add in the fact that as he uses it, his skill goes up, thus there will be less critical failures, so it's really not worth it since you have to turn attack off to do it.<br />
<br />
As for disarm, Varaho (a warrior on these boards) recently tested disarm for aggro.  From his test, disarm only gave aggro the very first time it was used, and all other times it was ignored.  I myself then tested it also, and got the same results.  The amount of aggro for the first disarm is fairly low also, not worth bothering about imo.<br />
<br />
Taunt.  Make sure he isn't hitting it each time it pops up.  The way taunt works is if someone else has aggro, and you successfully taunt, you will be put at the top of the hate list plus one.  If you have aggro, then taunt does nothing at all.  So it's best to save it for when you lose aggro.<br />
<br />
Weapons will help him with aggro some, but the biggest thing you can do is work with the rest of your guild to have them keep aggro on him.  Jolt, fd, evade, and even just turning attack off and backing up a bit are your best options for him to keep aggro.  Hopefully he'll get the levels soon so he can do more himself.<br />
<br />
I still say a willsapper would be a great weapon for him if you can afford it.  Frosty offhand, or maybe one of the new troll smithed yaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To shed light on the pulling/aggro correlation you've made; if the puller does a fair amount to aggro the mob on inc (such as flame licking, continuing to plink arrows, etc) when the warrior taunts successfully, he will have a very substantial aggro lead on everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khiloor</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree with teaching the other members how to NOT steal aggro.  <br />
<br />
Just an example.  I tank BoT stuff with chanter throwing tash and slow, and the chanter just gets a look at when it hits, then aggro comes back to me.  Grouped with a 65 ranger eq/am3 pulling, and a 65 rogue with insane aa's (i think she dinged 180aa's during the group, primals, the works).  I had no problems whatsoever.  None.<br />
<br />
Next day, I help a lower level guildy in need of a tank at hedge in PoN.  I couldn't hold aggro worth shit against a 58 rogue with just epic / lsoee.  Group is wondering what's wrong, and i'm thinking to myself. &quot;yep, rogue is gonna bite it cuz he gets too much aggro&quot;. <br />
<br />
Aggro is a 2 way street, warriors have to learn how to taunt correctly (using the above instructions), as well as having the correct weapons with procs and dps, along with teaching the gung-ho rogue/monk/ranger/wizard/shaman/whatever it's not an aggro contest.  <br />
<br />
Just tell the cleric only to heal the tank because he's the only one who should get aggro.  Then when the rogue is sitting in PoK nekid for 30 minutes a few times, he'll start to figure it out too.</div></div><hr />
