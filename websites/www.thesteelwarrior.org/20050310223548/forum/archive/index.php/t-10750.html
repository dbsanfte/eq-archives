The way the notice reads, it will be impossible to avoid deleting characters (not to mention lots and lots of inventory items in some cases) if you have more than 8. Could be especially ugly for someone whose main on one server is AArdvark and whose main on another is Zebra.</div></div><hr />

Solusek Ro was heavily euro pre euro servers, but now all that is really left is Dima's guild Magna Charta and whatever is left of Wolfsclan.  The other euro's had to make a joint force effort to kill Solusek Ro and that was a recent event.<br />

From what I understand this will put ~7 american guilds in qvic by force instead of through balance of competition.  Not exactly rounding out or toping off in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Qvic/Txevu represents the last of the significant non-instanced content, and the merger is going to result in too many guilds chomping at that content.  If you're just below this level (Time/Uqua/Ikkinz,) then no problem.  If you're past this content (Tacvi/OoW) then again no problem.  Those stuck in the middle are screwed.</div></div><hr />

Then the top 3 American guilds on Sol Ro are screwed.  Darkblood (my guild), Empyreal, and Age of Tyranny (Veyah and Krassus).  Darkblood has been in Qvic for about a month now while Empyreal just beat Barxxt a week ago.  Age of Tyranny is just now starting to work their way towards an Uqua win (they have beaten the twins).  I have heard BB already has two or three American guilds that are Qvic+.  <br />
<br />
Basically, by March 23 at least 2 and possibly 3 American guilds on Solusek Ro will be competing for Qvic, and when the servers merge it's just going to exacerbate that problem.  Something needs to be done, but I guess the best solution SoE has is &quot;free server moves&quot;.  Anyway, Qvic is going to be a mess.<br />
<br />
To top it off, we have to deal with the 8 character limit, name changes, guild hijinks, and overall pain in the ass that is a server transfer.  This makes EQ un-fun for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't Qvic 8 hour respawn or something?  With all the instanced content, I can't imagine that big guilds butting heads will be even 1/10 the problem it used to be pre-PoP.  Overcrowded exp zones seems like a bigger reason to keep populations down than raid mob availiability the way raiding in EQ is these days.</div></div><hr />

Qvic is a 6 hour respawn on three monsters that each can drop up to 2 molds: Ptav M'Sha, Mnat M'Sha, and Dvoin M'Sha.  These monsters as basically one groupable with a good tank, a cleric, and a bard + any random DPS (but they have a lot of hit points).<br />
<br />
The problem, as I see it, is that Qvic is meant to gear up your guild for what follows in GoD (Inktu'ta, Txevu, Tacvi..).  If 3+ guilds are all competing for those 6 hour spawns, it's going to be difficult to gear up in Qvic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have 4 (and previously 5) guilds in Qvic on Xegony, but we operate a rotation that works well.  We've been in Qvic for 2 months, and we already have 80% of all the M'Sha armour we could want, to the extent that some pieces go to trials (and the mana augs rot :p).   Most of us find them pretty boring now, but we keep going in on our rotation days to fill in slots here and there on people.  The big boost in power has already happened, when in the first few weeks all our regular members picked up multiple pieces of huge upgrades.<br />
Txevu might be a bit more of an issue but it's never been a 'farm for loot' zone to the same extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back on track. I feel sorry for the Sol Ro/BB People because they are having to go through(Wow, can't seem to spell it right) change. People like Dima that have been around for a long time on Sol Ro are basicly getting the shaft, taking away solusek.dima in tsw is  :( . They should have atleast given a warning prior to a month before. Not really a lot of time when you think about it(For people that have been there since day 1, or close to it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saryrn could possibly use a population boost.  Only 2 true active raiding guilds left post-uqua, and one active raiding guild pre-potime.  rest are just &quot;show up for potime&quot; type guilds that farm qvic mini's when they can and that's it.  It's bad when /w all 70 shaman is 3 during primtetime hours, american.</div></div><hr />

In trickles rather than droves. It seems Stromm's raiding population is growing again from folks coming back. Some of the growth unfortunately is coming at the expense of lower content guilds ( more than normal) and other servers. There is a slow ,but, fairly steady influx of people I know coming back all the time. More so than are leaving for other games at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So SOE seem to be merging low server population with busier servers without checking the stauts of the guilds on the servers, has anyone actually grabbed the attention of any SOE personel and told them? <br />
<br />
how many guilds in the game are in high end? <br />
<br />
what servers are they on ?<br />
<br />
how many people play those servers ?<br />
<br />
what timezones are most frequented ?<br />
<br />
Simple questions that they should ask <br />
<br />
How can we make the most money out of declining server populations when we've now reached PAST the optimal amount of paid for server xfers per server? and no one on the chosen servers are now paying to leave ?<br />
<br />
that's more like the question <br />
<br />
SOE is a business, SOE has a server with no major population , and they are paying to operate it , but players aren't using it for various reasons, perhaps because they're finding no reason to play , so they'll merge it with a semi successful server to save costs, but what they won't do is merge it sensibly . why not? because that would mean less income from server transfers , and the possiblity of having to upgrade a server slightyl to handle the influx , altho i may be being a little paranoid about that <br />
<br />
fact reamins , some servers are dead in the water, adn it doesnt make sense to merge them with other dead servers, far better to grab the players attention by sticking ppl from a server thats never seen the endgame , onto a server which is still vibrant with LOTS of competition , if you want to see a dieing server, make a toon on Cazic Thule during euro hours, a server that had Euro guilds performing all sorts of server firsts a few years ago , but now , a desolate wasteland 8(</div></div><hr />

CT ain't a dead server bro, just the euro's done migrated and/or disolved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 years ago, we have 4 HK Guilds, 3 Euro Guilds, and 4 American high end guilds.<br />
<br />
Now we are done to 4 American guilds high end, only 2 past Ikkins4. Some servers, people just seem to flock away from, while some people seem to flock to.<br />
<br />
Also, merging Sol Ro/BB Was probably a good idea, while it did have its faults. People don't want to become Bristlebane.Sondosax, while some don't want people to move to their server. They mixed a High Euro population server, with a High American Population server, to give competition to both Euro and American guilds on either side. I don't really know too much about Bristlebane, but I know Sol Ro is like 70% Euro, so /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you really know too much about SolRo either.  The oversweeping generalization of calling SolRo a euro server is absurd.  The comment would have been valid a few years ago perhaps but the euro specific servers took much of the that population a long long while ago.  The vast majority of the server plays on PST-EST primetime.  There is even a larger amount of american raiding guilds to european raiding guilds.  I don't see this move as mixing high euro/american populations.  I see this move as some names got drawn out of a hat.  My disappointment is the top 3 american guilds on solro are near the same progression already; now add 2-3 more guilds who have 0 interaction with us in the same zones.  Solro couldn't handle 160+ people in yxtta last week, I wonder how bristle ro is going to handle a few hundred in Qvic.</div></div><hr />
