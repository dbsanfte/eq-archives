<br />
This strikes me as so bizzare.  Someone playing a game talking about earning a drop.  It's not a job, it's a game.  You don't earn it, it's a reward.  In fact it's much closer to gambling than it is to working.  With working you're pretty much guaranteed that if you work X number of hours you gain Y reward.  With gambling if you play X number of hours you have a chance for Y reward, but certainly no guarantee of it.  And EQ is much more like gambling than working.  So some people invest a lot of time gambling and reap some big rewards, that's not EARNING it.  That's winning it.  Hell it's even more like the ring toss at a carnival.  Sometimes you win a stuffed bear, sometimes you throw away a roll of quarters, but it's never earning it like a job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is only a game and impacts our enjoyment for a finite amount of time.It's not a job as it won't improve our quality of lifestyle outside of EQ nor cope help cope with rl responabilities.However,luck factors IRL and EQ and so does work.Irl and EQ you make choices about how you want to get where you are going and then apply time and effort to it.That time and effort and willingness to work with others to get stuff done does factor IRL/EQ.<br />
<br />
Gambling for the average person pays off or doesn't with relatively little effort and time.That is one of it's attractions.Unlike EQ &amp; RL where many small things go into creating a package most gamblers win or lose in the moment.Over time harder work and more time will pay off IRL &amp; EQ.The fact that EQ  often resembles a job(work/time&amp;effort/putting up with stuff etc) for many people is one of it's greatest drawbacks.Imo it is also part of what keeps people fascinated with EQ for so long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't ironic, because you *were* being an idiot. It wasn't really an insult, I was merely stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why getting po'd at uber players is ever going to accomplish anything, including changing the game.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as an edit... perhaps some people have time to read for 20 minutes and screw around during a raid... I can see how this would easily be possible. However, people that do that in my guild are generally docked points/booted. I myself try to focus as much as possible on the raids...</div></div><hr />

earn  (ûrn)<br />
tr.v. earned, earn·ing, earns<br />
   1. To gain especially for the performance of service, labor, or work<br />
   2. To acquire or deserve as a result of effort or action<br />

I think earn fits quite well. Not everything you 'earn' as a result of a profession. <br />
<br />
How exactly is ring toss luck, btw? It's called a 'game of skill' for a reason. If Iput the same amount of time into tossing rings as I used to playing EQ, would you call it unfair that I was an uber ring-tosser raking in the giant bears[loot], and you were a casual ring-tosser?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back on topic, I challenge any and all of the naysayers to avoid ad hominem bullshit and challenge any of the statements I made. What I said was facts. All except what Isk edited into my post, although I am fond of chicken.I did not say the raiders have everything handed to them on a silver platter--just 66-70.<br />
If you were out playing the game instead of being a whiny little bitch, you might realize just how wrong you are. As I said:<br />
Several OoW zones have xp that is on par with or better than Earth/Fire, superior loot, easier than early GoD zones like Vxed/Tipt, openly available to everyone.<br />
The main difference between C2 Fire and, for example Proving Grounds, is this:  the flagged people spending all their time in C2 fire are familiar and comfortable with the spawns and the pulls. They're just as candy ass as your whole &quot;F the ubers for getting everything handed to them&quot; thread.  Go get familiar and comfortable with spawns and pulls in OoW zones. Two days ago I got 2.5aa in one hour with a non-uber pickup group in Proving Grounds, 4 whole corners from the zone-in. Random non-uber pickup group puller got familiar with his surroundings and how to chain pull them, and did it. I tailored (read: toned down) my damage output for random non-uber warrior, and random non-uber cleric kept him alive. I was the only notable DPS in the group. It's really that simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cardinal, <br />
<br />
May I suggest that you actaully more reading. With proper exerecise you should get used to the consentration needed for reading, have the headaches lessen and it may even improve your reading comprehention. <br />
<br />
May I aslo suggest, as a newcomer here that you may want to find out who the people around here are. <br />
<br />
May I point you to the 12 pages of posts after my first one as a step in your remedial reading course? I have yet to find the mythic causal who just wants to have everything now--and not get the sence of accomplisment that comes with achiving something.<br />
<br />
We did not assume you were an idiot, don't come here and assume that we are. We can very much fathom that there are differances and why they are there and even why they are good. <br />
<br />
You argue that /played time should show the differance in power--and I agree. At 513 days played you either have a real problem with EQ--and should seek conseling-- or a bazaar bot, or both. That is more tha 40 hours a week since release.<br />
<br />
However most of the power differance between you and say Haass--rests not on time invested, desire or ability--but that fact that you can raid and there by get flogged through the planes.<br />
<br />
However, Haass needs no help from me in stuffing you. Heck Haass probably doesn't need to stuff you, you will take care of it yourself. <br />
<br />
Cardianl may I suggest, STRONGLY, that you take a gander at Haass's GOD experiment thread (at least) in the Tavern. You are prooving yourself to be a popmus jack ass to anyone with any sort of posting history here. Frankly, I would suggest if you are going to take on a firery old timer like Haass you read more of his posts than just that. <br />
<br />
Aramelus<br />
<br />
Something you (and I think that most casuals) are over looking is that if the access is blown open that does not mean the differance between raider/non-raider will disappear. Just because the non-raiders are in the Elementals the raid targets are still going to be raid targets and probably beyond the reach of any family guild for a long time to come. <br />
<br />
The prestige of beating the elementals doesn't go away--but is properly transfered from being there to beating the boss mobs. <br />
<br />
The 4 guild that are floggin the elementals can work on something that is far more interesting than making sure Jobober has his MB flag--getting down the real work of beating the elemtal bosses and working Time. <br />
<br />
Opening the elements--or any other zone--does not take the &quot;shiney&quot; off it. Beating the boss mobs is where it is at.<br />
<br />
I suggest, after reading the first to sentences of your post, that you do the same take some courses yourself, in spelling and grammar.<br />
<br />
Why does post history mean jack? OMG this guy has 5000 posts and has put dps parses on the forum! You just finished suggesting someone was mentally unstable because of the time they put into EQ, yet you have your lips firmly pressed to Haas' backside because of his history on this forum. Make up your mind please. A newcomer with 2 posts might know more than any other person on this forum, so lets just stay off the post history BS, kay?<br />
<br />
And family guilds should have no problem beating the EP's... the kind of gear you can get from LDON and OOW are trivializing PoP. I'm sure you can handle the flagging process- hell, I even found it fun. Do you want gear and exp handed to you, or do you mind working for it? Just because you are &quot;casual&quot; doesn't mean you can't blow a couple hours for a raid.. I have always been a casual gamer at core and I have no problem raiding with my guild.</div></div><hr />

but no! you wont do it and i know why. because you know that you will get one week behind in leveling. you will lose ground. some of you CANT do it because your guilds will disband you. some of you cant do it because you will miss some important flagging. some of you cant do it because if you are not level 70 you wont be able to get a group in oow OR ldon.<br />

Post history does tell you something.  It tells you that person has been around for a while.  And as a result people have had an opportunity to form an opinion about them, their posting style, the quality of their posts, and whether or not they have a reasonable perspective or talk out of their asses a lot.  Don't expect to be given the same respect as a long time and well established poster on the board if you're a Johnny come lately.  It just isn't going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Actually, most people are pretty happy in game at the moment as far as I can see.  This partcular debate has been going on in one form or another for a long time, and always tends to generate alot of posts, and alot of debate, and alot of anger(tho personally, I am not angry with anyone here, I think that both sides have some pretty legitimate points).  But people are loving OoW...no flags, interesting zones and mobs, fun fights without being stupid hard, that can be done by 'casuals' and 'ubers' alike'.  Most people I know, both 'casual' and 'uber' all agree that the game is pretty fun right now.</div></div><hr />

Ok. Apply everything you just said to EQ. The guy has played over 500 days. People who started in fuckin PoP are bitching the game is too hard. The situation is the same...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Iroxorsju</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All i can say is that i have been a raider and a non raid player.  And raiders have it made.  <br />
<br />
I can tell you I work alot harder for upgrades as a non raider then i did when i was in a raid guild.  Basically like i read from a previous post, when i was in the raid guild i was not an officer i didn't have a special responsobility just like the majority of people don't in guild.  All I had to do is show up for 4 hours a day raid to get my dkp then log out and be done.  Now that i am a non raider with no high end guild that raids at the time i am able to play.  I can spend 5 or 6 hours a day playing for 2 weeks straight just to get a upgrade that was less of a upgrade then i got when i  raided for 2 weeks playing 4 hours a day.  <br />
<br />
I have to side with non raiders on this completely on this issue.  They really need to fix the game on how gear is distributed in comparison to time put in to it.  Raid players don't have leet skills in this game to be able to kill named.  Any numbnutt has the skills to killed named in this game (well i can't really say that i have met some real winners).  Its just some players don't have accesss to a raid guilds.  Wether its people like me that switch schedules every 2 weeks, or a person that doesn't have access to the play times that the raid guild plays.  There needs to be a way that non raiders are able to get almost as good of upgrades as a raider.  It would fix the problem with all the bitching.<br />
<br />
Sorry if i have grammer mistakes/or i sound a little jacked up.  Been up for 18 hours now need some sleep.  Only 4 more hours at work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well if the differance in reward is too small people won't go through all the hassle involved in raiding.That their are special mobs that take a lot of friends to kill that drop special loot adds extra depth and adventure to the game.<br />
<br />
I agree the balance has shifted far from the original idea that raids were a special occasion to now they are practically a matter of a normal days play for a lot of people.Really i'm not sure how to fix that.The players see the targets/quests and do what they have to to get them dead/done.It may be too late for EQ1 with all the time and effort people have invested in their guilds .To pull the rug out now would cost eq and sony a lot imo.After all they made it this way.The players did what they had to to progress.To undermine past work and effort made under game imposed conditions would be unfair now.<br />
<br />
Imo a game without something to replace the depth added by the raid game will not have the same lasting interest.People don't all have to raid at the same level of time/effort.For some folks an occaisional mini raid for an epic or flag will do it fine.Casual raiders like me can still kill the big mobs awhile after the ubers manage it.Competitive types will do what they have to to win and stay near the top.If you are highly competitive and caught up with what the fellow next door can achieve then you have to devote your time and energy to raiding in EQ.Theres lots of fun to be had without competing against the local uber folks tho.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, EQ2 or Vanguard etc will tune this better.I'd like to see raids on special mobs to be...well more special and less a fulltime playstyle.Still thats EQ.If you want to compete with the top people you better be willing to do what they do or find another game.The fun in EQ is playing with friends against the environment tho not each other imo.That's why I don't care if uber tank #2 has 2k more hp and 500 more ac.He doesn't play with me and our raid mobs still challenge us and feel great to beat.They also pay out rewards that we couldn't get grouping that help us over come our next obstacle.Gives us good reason to come together. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmmm.<br />
the thing about Cardinal suggesting that Haass learn how to work for his gear is that it is unusually--even spectacularly--misplaced advice. Haass's lack of anger augments appears to mean one thing to someone who doesn't know how Haass has been spending his game time; to folks who have been reading the board, it seems fairly obvious that Haass is unusually committed to challenging fights and upgrading himself and his groupmates and has been doing so for years (the same would be true of his groupmates, it would appear). Telling Haass he has no right to post on warrior issues is just weird. Calling Kailyn Haass's tool when so frequently they disagree on these boards is also odd.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it looks to me that serious raiders have certain points, many of which casuals probably agree with. First, many serious raiders work their asses off. It would surprise me very much if folks like Brutal and Wandor coasted through their raids, heh. Everybody who thinks Wandor doesn't deserve his gear please raise their hands.<br />
<br />
I thought so.<br />
<br />
Lazy, immature players are lazy and immature players, whether they are in a casual guild or in some raiding guild. Eventually, a good raiding guild will at least attempt to cull the retards from its ranks. But so will a good casual guild. Mostly for the same reason: it's a drag to play with retards. In fact, both guilds will make some attempts to avoid letting the retard in in the first place. Anyway, attempting to draw conclusions about the ways in which game design might or might not differently affect players with different play times/styles will be difficult if we keep getting hung up on pointing out that some casuals are lazy whiners and some raiders are lazy egomaniacs. Of course some are, some aren't.<br />
<br />
Casual players keep formulating one of their beefs like this: &quot;High percentages of raiders just stand around, hit autoattack at the call for assist, and collect their upgrades. The only reason more of them aren't afk is that they're too lazy to get out of their chairs in rl and go to the fridge for a beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not only is this an offensive formulation for a raider to read, but it's not really the issue for casual players.<br />
To formulate the problem in a way that isn't so offensive to raiders: Let's say that there's a raiding guild with good players in it. They're in a position to recruit another good tank. They're not interested in having idiots around, so they have a vetting process. Some of them know an ungilded warrior who is a good player. Perhaps he's been in a small guild before or a less advanced guild at any rate, but at this point he's free to move to a more advanced guild. He's interested in applying to this guild, because it would afford him access to the next level of the game--tougher mobs, cooler fights. This warrior applies to the guild, is tested, and is accepted. <br />
And you know what happens next: the first month the good warrior is in the guild he sees some significant upgrades and he gets them significantly faster than he was getting lesser upgrades before joining the guild.<br />
<br />
The issue for casuals isn't that the guy shouldn't get upgrades. It's not that he isn't a good player or that he isn't working hard or that the guild isn't working hard.<br />
<br />
The issue for casuals is that this warrior didn't suddenly become more skilled by clicking the &quot;accept guild invite&quot; button. Over time, sure, he'll get more skilled because good players, whether they are casual or raiders, tend to get better when they face new mobs. But that first month what changed was not his effort, but who he was standing next to. The effort/reward ratio changed dramatically for this warrior. Not because he's working less or afk or any of that, but because his rewards are better-- perhaps dramatically so.<br />
<br />
I really don't think thoughtful casuals begrudge this warrior his upgrades. Certain issues, particularly with PoP flagging, do cause casuals grief, though, and have almost since the release of PoP. I personally think that OoW might in fact render PoP flagging a moot issue, particularly in combination with LDoN. Bronze armor used to be Uber, and what happened to it will someday happen to Ornate. And SOE really does appear to be moving away from a &quot;flagging&quot; system and more toward a &quot;kill it if you can, die if you can't&quot; philosophy. Casuals are happy about this.<br />
<br />
Nonraiders who have been around a long time might be having another problem. Clear up until PoP a good casual player could hang with pretty advanced raiders. Yeah, his gear wouldn't be quite as good, but at least he could be in the same zone as other people at his level. Beginning with PoP, that changed. The gulf is wide, and getting wider. <br />
Of course raiders are not responsible for the disenfranchisement of old school nonraiders in this game. But it's disingenuous for raiders to be shocked that some of these old school warriors get pissed off once in a while. If you're a raider and watching that, you don't have to feel sympathy for these nonraiders. It doesn't have to matter to you that some of these players figured out how AC works, or melee hate, or taunt, and took the time to test that stuff; it doesn't have to matter to you that for years these players felt like they could be in the top levels of the game, and now they simply can't if being in a large raid guild is not an option for them. But you also don't have insult them by suggesting that they'd have better gear if they'd just work at it. You don't have to suggest that they're unskilled if their AC is 600 less than yours. Maybe once that would have been true, but it's becoming less and less safe to assume the wider the raider/nonraider gap gets.<br />
<br />
Another issue that irritates me personally is this business of &quot;casuals just want to skip content.&quot; True, casuals want to avoid high risk, low reward fighting. But no more so, I think, than raiders. And nobody really likes low risk, no reward fighting. Everybody in this game skips content, nobody's fought everywhere, so to me that sort of lecture looks hypocritical. Specific suggestions, or descriptions of the power requirements of a single group to take a given mob are certainly not annoying, of course--in fact, there are several of these uber/casual threads that a number of examples of generous and thoughtful advice. But blanket statements about content skipping are annoying. (Consider this statement: any warrior who has AET and cannot cast divine aura on himself to give his casters time to escape whenever the shit hits the fan is a content-skipping slacker. See? It's irritating and pointless.)<br />
<br />
Well. I see Gunnar has posted since I started writing this. I agree with much of what he has to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Why is the gap so big?<br />
<br />
1. The only way they can maintain &quot;challenge&quot; in the game for massively multiplayer encounters is to increase mob difficulty.  The only way players can cope wih increased mob difficulty if they are at threshhold is to have appropriate gear drop in graduated levels.  Thus gear gets much better rather quickly for the raider.<br />
2.  Something that takes 50 man-hours to defeat (50 people for 1 hour) will drop much better loot than something that takes 6 man-hours (small group raiding).  You can exclude xp groups from this as concentrating on loot and xp rarely go hand in hand (exception being in LDoN and GoD).<br />
3.  To keep peoples interest sony must always have a carrot to dangle ... gear must continue to get increasingly better or else inerest is lost.<br />
<br />
Raiders are on a path which non-raiders have either chosen or are forced (by RL) to not participate in.  They are effecively left out of the loot cycle.  Expansions 1-2 years old are easy enough but they will never have cutting edge gear.  In the last year &quot;cutting edge&quot; gear has increased so dramatically that we therefore have a large gap.<br />
<br />
This cap can be shortened by the non-raiders if they are willing to put the time into it.  Greater han 8k hps and 1600ac are doable by a level 70 in all non-raiding gear.  It isnt easy, and it requires a massive time sink, but it is very doable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Casual players keep formulating one of their beefs like this: &quot;High percentages of raiders just stand around, hit autoattack at the call for assist, and collect their upgrades.

<br />
Not only is this an offensive formulation for a raider to read, but it's not really the issue for casual players.<br />
<br />
You're correct Brabble, but that formulation is typically used as a counter response to raiders who come in with giant egos and who go on and on about how hard they &quot;worked&quot;,  how &quot;difficult&quot; it all was, and what &quot;lazy&quot; no good pieces of crap non-raiders are.</div></div><hr />

You can exclude xp groups from this as concentrating on loot and xp rarely go hand in hand.<br />
<br />
This is so wrong, historically for EQ. In the original game there were good loots in almost all the XP camps (SolB/LG). You could XP and come up with the chance of loot--at least loot you could sell to fix your own gear problems.<br />
<br />
Kunark was exactally the same--Seb had named and loots every camp worth having--zone out being the one exception I can remember. And introduced the idea of random loots off regular mobs (a great idea IMHO). <br />
<br />
Once the population leveled up for SoV you had all access to XP loot and one group quests and--in what was a good design dicision--2 spots that could be more or less easily farmed by hard core non raiders or casual raider (Arena and HoT). I know I on grouped most of my Champions armror--while getting XP. <br />
<br />
Really its only until you hit PoP that you get no good loot without raiding. When released you could not even get ornate without it. From what I am hearing about GoD--is once you are geared for it--you can and do XP + loot. Just that it was very difficult for the non-raider to get good enough to crack GoD for XP + loot camps. (If you can get KT flagged it sounds like you are in good shape for XP + loot--I haven't been there yet but that is the impression in get from these boards.)<br />
<br />
PS I am actually happy with EQ atm (and would be happier if I could get a grind group going outside of WoS) but am actually enjoying the discussion too.<br />
<br />
PPS My point about Haass--if you are at all familiar with the people around here and need to argue with them the way to do with it Haass is definately NOT an illogical, weak but flamy rant. Haass writes good rants and can use logic. And may of the posters here find him enteraining. I mean how many other folk around here get a lawn chairs and beer responce for their anticipated rants?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well if the differance in reward is too small people won't go through all the hassle involved in raiding.<br />
<br />
and why wouldnt they? because raiding is less fun than soloing?<br />
<br />
if it is then the real solution is to address the problem of why raiding is not fun rather than bribing people to do it through a faster progression path. <br />
<br />
if sony decides to reward certain styles of play it should be for reasons of discouraging strategies that ruin the fun of the game. and i can give a couple examples:<br />
<br />
long ago sony realized that soloers (some classes) can get experience faster than groupers. they said to themselves &quot;most people consider grouping to be more fun than soloing but many of the same people also know that they get experience faster by soloing. so they sacrifice fun for the sake of progression. this needs to be addressed&quot;. the problem here was that soloing could be practiced and the methods could be fine tuned to become very efficient. whereas it was difficult to fine tune the methods of grouping because of the large overhead time of putting together a group and the learning curve of working together with people whom you have not grouped with before. so they gave a huge experience bonus to 6-man groups. in my opinion they overdid it but it was reasonable to suggest that something had to be done to make up for the huge timesink of looking for groups. since most people considered grouping to be more fun they shouldnt be relegated to leveling more slowly than soloers.<br />
<br />
raiding had a problem of its own. back in the days when raiding meant &quot;plane of fear&quot; before kunark the raiders looked forward to 2 hours putting a group together and 2 hours of corpse recovery for 1 hour of experience. the reward for this grim experience path was a modest upgrade in gear. many thought it was not worth the effort even if they actually enjoyed raiding. so they didnt raid even though raiding would have been more fun for them.<br />
<br />
does anybody here remember tumpy tonic cups? this was a quest whereby the player made deliveries and got an experience bonus and then went back to make more deliveries. when i discovered it at level 18 it was THE fastest progression path i knew about at the time by far and i used it up to level 24 or so. i did it for one reason. the experience was fast. a friend of mine used it all the way to 35. he was bored to death doing it but it was the fastest progression path so he did it. he hated the game. but it was the fastest progression path. sony rightly nerfed it. when the fastest progression path is this boring it plain and simple ruins the game.<br />
<br />
they replaced tumpy tonic cups with flagging. another phenominally boring grind that like the cups is also the fastest progression path. what could they have been thinking?<br />
<br />
what some of us would like is a world in which style of play is neither rewarded nor punished so that each type of player would be able to compete in his own manner and be rewarded equally for his time. if raiders soloers groupers questers indoorsers outdoorsers ldoners tradeskillers could all get comparable results for their same amount of time invested then everyone could have fun in his own way.<br />
casuals werent the only ones left behind in PoP. tradeskillers got the shaft. questing was for the most part obliterated. all previous efforts for improving faction were made without effect. i think of people who put hundreds of hours into tradeskilling and then retired their merchandising when they came to find that there was nothing in the new expansions to spend their money on. i think of people who spent hundreds of hours working on faction because they were &quot;an evil race&quot; and they needed to be able to move about certain important areas enough to make this time effort worthwhile. then we got pok and their hundreds of hours are for squat. some people loved doing new quests or even discovering new quests and for the most part they have nothing to do now. where the game used to be filled with variety and many different avenues of fun for many different personalities it turned into a treadmill where today is just like yesterday which was just like the day before and there is no  other path to go down. a person can hunt in the same zone these days for TWO YEARS. how can a game have 200 odd zones in it and have that happen??<br />
<br />
.. and then comes oow. though im not playing anymore i hear from these boards that it has taken important steps to bring back the institution of the pickup group. if this is true then i applaud it. now they need to start bringing back the half dozen other institutions they nerfed to oblivion long ago. soloing, quests, tradeskills, faction and so on.<br />
<br />
i wont be there. they obsoleted my machine so that they could add chainlink fences and stary skies. enjoy your stary skies. im not upgrading.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">and why wouldnt they? because raiding is less fun than soloing?<br />
<br />
Nope,because raiding is more work than soloing and harder to organize and keep going.People will take the path of least resistance.If all you have to do is log in and kill everything yourself for the best loot then most will likely do it....er Diablo.Getting together with other folks takes some amount of effort.People who wanted to progress quickly would focus on doing that on their own rather then wasting time socializing.So grouping pays off with better potential loot quality than soloing because you can kill harder mobs.It encourages people to group.Unfortunately imo, they added group xp mods as well,but, that's another discussion.Raiding is much harder to organize and keep running smootly.The payoff is being able to kill &quot;special&quot; mobs with higher quality rewards.<br />
<br />
In kunark people had epics,In velious there was a lot to raid that you couldn't possibly group at the time and so on.Suggesting the balance has swung too far to one side is reasonable.Suggesting that the payoff for a single group should normally equal that from similiar efforts of a raid force of equal players is silly.That was never EQ.They put the mobs/challenges in front of you and people did what they had to to beat them.That is EQ.Tuning it to suit the majority is of course complex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Two things.<br />
<br />
 1) Most people in a guild are not involved in the planning or organization of raids. The 'difficulty' part you describe is attached to a handful per guild, not the majority. By that logic, then, only those who are involved in said planning and organization should be the ones reaping the rewards of that work. That's obviously not the case.<br />
<br />
 2) The most common refrain I hear from 'casuals' is 'equal reward for equal work'. With instanced zones, it SHOULD be easy to obtain if the player is skilled. If a raider wants to raid 20 times a month at 4 hours/raid and recieve 2 upgrades, then the casual player should be able to, within the space of 80 hours of play over a longer period of time in a select instanced zone, be able to recieve 2 upgrades. Of course, this will never happen, not least because hardcore raiders will pop blood vessels at the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">1)Well there's not much planning involved in making a group and beating down a few mobs.Everyone who raids does have to put up with extra work/hassle/whatever .Most people don't find their raids landing smack in their favored playtime.They work their real life and gaming plans around their guild.No one gets along perfectly well with 60 other people.Few people in guilds get to perform the job they want how they wish on raids.A lot of frustration occurs trying to get 50 plus people to get stuff done raid after raid.That frustration is felt by everyone not just the leaders,although,I am certainly far more stressed as guildleader/raidleader than I was MT.I suggest that if you spend a year raiding daily with a raid guild as a core member you might look at this differantly.It's not as easy and carefree as it's often made out to be  here.And raids have changed a lot since velious.<br />
<br />
2) The refrain you mention is Diablo esq not EQ.In EQ not all mobs are created equal and not all players of a given level have equal strength.Again this type of refrain suggests that a soloer who finds it just as difficult to kill an easier mob in a n instance as a group does in a harder one should get the same quality drops.That the difficulty to the player concerned should determine the loot dropped not the strength of the mob.It leads to questions like..why not just solo?All the rewards would be yours anyways and finding a group can be a pain.Why would you ever go through the extra effort of forming a raid if you get the same quality drops from killing stuff yourself or with a couple friends?Like with the origional epics the idea was that some things were too hard for a group to achieve on their own.So they enlisted the aid of more friends to form a &quot;special&quot; battle against a &quot;special&quot; mob.The mob itself determined the number of players required.Just because a group of level 60's in bazaar gear would find a particualr mob more difficult than a group of level 70 raiders doesn't mean their mob drops better loot.It's like saying a level 50 necromancer has a really hard time soloing his particular instance so he should get drops = to an instance of the same difficulty for your group.The difficulty for the particular individuals involved is not a factor in determining loot quality because the whole game is about making your character stronger over time to over come more difficult suff.The whole point is that given your aa /level/gear you will find it easier to tank a particular encounter than a fresh 65 with 0aa and less upgraded gear.The differance in what you can kill determines the quality of loot you get not the difficulty in killing it.<br />
<br />
Everyone needs an upgrade path.OOW is a very easy place to get good xp and upgrades relative to older EQ.I agree that raiding has to a degree lost it's &quot;special&quot; nature and has become the standard for higher end players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Since this thread has degenerated into raider/nonraider opportunities for upgrades....<br />
<br />
Are you a non-raider?  (as in dont like to do 12+ man raids)<br />
Are you willing to put in some time with friends to get some nice loot on decent return?<br />
Do you have friends willing to play for a few hours straight here and there?<br />
<br />
Get a group of friends together and kill Seru.  Do some research ... earn the key (takes about 2 hours if all mobs spawned) ... do more research ... then carefully execute your raid.  It may take a wipe or 2, but it's very doable with &quot;nonraider&quot; level gear.  All you really need is a cleric with some decent FT and a shaman slower.  A patch healer on the side helps.  Expect it to take anywhere from 30-90mins depending on how many casters you bring for dps.<br />
<br />
*After you earn the key (if you are the keyholder) then you can even ask random lfg folks if they wanna come along for some fun.  Seru is pretty easy if you know the encounter, so having a closeknit group of friends isnt even always a must.<br />
<br />
This weekend i added 35 raw ac, 15 attack, 3 hp per tick regen, 200ish total to resists and about 60 raw hps + some stats.  Not to mention another instaclick.  I had to do a bit of questing on the side for the earring ... but it wasnt very hard.  Total we racked up 10 loots btw the 5 of us (I botted one) including some ancient songs/spells.<br />
<br />
Sigil earring of Veracity:  25ac 100hp/mana + stats and 10 to all saves<br />
Heavy Yttrium Chestplate:  75ac 125hp/mana + stats and 15 to saves (30 FR/PR)<br />
Seru's Torque: 25ac 100hp/mana + stats and 20 to all saves (wrist/arm/neck)<br />
<br />
Our group:<br />
Bard <br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Shaman<br />
Druid (duel boxed by me)<br />
Mage<br />
<br />
Total drops were:<br />
2 breastplates<br />
2 heads (earring quest)<br />
1 torque<br />
1 arms<br />
1 boots<br />
1 bow<br />
1 FT5 ring<br />
1 ancient bardsong (mez ... which simply kicks ass pvp)<br />
<br />
Total time investment:<br />
First kill: 67 minutes from port in to arx<br />
Second kill: 74 minutes from port in to arx (had some rough spots on healing so druid had to assist vs dps)<br />
Total time investment: 2 hours 21 minutes.<br />
<br />
We were all in 90-95% single groupable/buyable gear.  Now the cleric and i have 75ac/125hp bps and various items with amazing stats/saves.<br />
<br />
After our Second kill of Seru today, we took our same lil 6-man group and did Vallon Zek in tactics where we picked up his necklace and FT3 belt (gratz cleric and mage).<br />
<br />
I see a lot of complaints out there that there are not enough casual type raid encounters providing decent gear ... lots of complaints that small groups cannot get gear on par with raiders.  Yes you will have to deal with competition for mobs, but btw the 5-6 decent expansions out there in which to find &quot;something&quot; with a worthwhile upgrade on it ... it's not all that terribly hard.  Especially with most guilds of any substantial power farming PoP, GoD, and OoW.<br />
<br />
Granted we did get lucky with the server reset .... but what did you do this weekend?  There are viable small group technically non-raid targets (at least non-raid by todays standards) out there for dedicated non-raiders to hit, and the gear they drop can slingshot you into the higher-end game where fast xp etc is all neato and stuff.  You gotta put in the footwork before you can harvest the rewards though.  You don't have to be in a raiding guild to play with the big dogs.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify:  None of us have any EP gear.  None of us are key'd for Vex Thall.  None of us have more than 10,000 LDoN points.  We're just a bunch of dedicated shmucks in single groupable gear that push the envelope and have fun.</div></div><hr />

At one time, your #1 may have been true.  Any more, that's completely not the case, particularly in gates/upper end OOW.    In these areas, if EVERY SINGLE person isn't at full attention at all times... the raid is over.   Any more, the &quot;Only leaders need to be skilled&quot; argument is nothing but an old cliche'.   <br />

As for your number 2... it's already there and available, and I see no popping veins, just excuses as to why they're not reaching out and seizing the opportunities available to them.

Its a shame that so many interesting raids are effectively locked because of PoP. MB, the Bert flagging fight and Grummus seem to be more of the same but TT, Syran and Agnar (which is about the limit of my PoP raiding) are more interesting and involved fights with the need for more than 1 tank and that people not go afk after turning on auto attack. <br />
<br />
Hopefully EQ2 will use the better EQ raids as a base as opposed to the more of the same fights that we saw in the first 3 years of EQ.<br />
<br />
I admit that my view of raiding is old and dated--but I can't do the newer stuff--at least yet. OoW offers hope for that too, I think. <br />
<br />
I think the best thing EQ can do (and apprently has done) is provide a path to elemental level gear for casual players--and nurture the 'casual raider.'<br />
<br />
I woud love to get an XP group anywhere in PG (though that maybe a bit above me) RDS, or anywhere but WoS. Too many people and it seems there are better loots out there. <br />

Dude, Omens has some GREAT raids for the more casual types of guilds, they're aimed all over the map.  Check Harbingers Spire up top, Noble's Causeway...

Killing the 4 dudes for the Gate key to the arx takes about 5-10 mins each with 4 toons and the right strat.  Add in about 30-40 minutes of running from place to place and clearing trash and its possible to get the key to the arx in about 2 hours assuming they are all up.<br />
<br />
Yes you still need bane weapons to damage seru.  You do not, however, need bane weapons to get and hold aggro.  We use bard/mage dmg shield + personal clicks for 200+ dmg shield.  Bard is for resists on MT for seru's stun proc, cure on the MT, bardsong, and focus for casters' dots and nukes.  The neato thing is that you can bring 1 tank 1 bard and all casters and have the same effect.  We use dmg shield + nukes and dots to kill him.  Our group can usually maintain around 1000dps between damage shield, druid dot/nukes, mage nukes, and shaman dots.  Often times, if cleric mana is hanging strong we let slow drop for a few minutes now and then (especially while i'm defensive) to capitalize on the strong dmg shield dps.<br />
<br />
He's the biggest sissy in luclin if you do your homework.  Adding in a 2nd group of all caster dps cuts the kill time more than in half.<br />
<br />
As for the reports for the earing quest ... that took me around 8 hours worth of farming to get all 4.  This, however, is only needed for the earring quest and is not required for arx key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In kunark people had epics,In velious there was a lot to raid that you couldn't possibly group at the time and so on.Suggesting the balance has swung too far to one side is reasonable.Suggesting that the payoff for a single group should normally equal that from similiar efforts of a raid force of equal players is silly.That was never EQ.They put the mobs/challenges in front of you and people did what they had to to beat them.That is EQ.Tuning it to suit the majority is of course complex.<br />
<br />
where do i start?<br />
<br />
1) &lt;&lt;Nope,because raiding is more work than soloing&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
raiding is less work than soloing except for the guild officers. the rest only have to show up.<br />
<br />
2) &lt;&lt;People will take the path of least resistance.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
many soloers like myself loved getting ourselves into very challenging situations. it was common for me to quad kite 20 at once or to hold 20 or more agros while charming. i often did summoning mobs solo. i took out named mobs in groups of two that ive frequently seen wipe out groups of six. the path of least resistance for me has always been raids because i can kick back and let the officers do everything important. whether playing warrior or druid raids were always extremely boring for their lack of personal strategy. they were too easy for me. i hated them.<br />
<br />
3) &lt;&lt;If all you have to do is log in and kill everything yourself for the best loot ...&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
back in the days when the fastest progression was solo (as recently as velious) it never had the best loot. and we never &quot;killed everything ourselves&quot; simply by logging in. we worked hard for it. harder than i ever had to work raiding.<br />
<br />
4) &lt;&lt;Getting together with other folks takes some amount of effort.People who wanted to progress quickly would focus on doing that on their own rather then wasting time socializing&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
are you serious? socialinzing is a waste of time? most people dont take such a cynical view.<br />
<br />
5)  &lt;&lt;Unfortunately imo, they added group xp mods as well,but, that's another discussion&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
ok we agree on this one thing. the hundred percent group bonus would not have been so bad however if soe hadnt had added to it a large number of soloing nerfs<br />
(unsnarable, uncharmable, summoning, fast moving mobs that act as landmines to soloing efforts) as well as a dramatic cut in the exp given for deep blues and huge bonuses given to exp in the elementals.<br />
<br />
6) &lt;&lt;Raiding is much harder to organize...&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
yes it is. but notice that word &quot;organize&quot;. the average guildy is not involved in organining guild activities.  he just shows up.<br />
<br />
7) &lt;&lt;Suggesting that the payoff for a single group should normally equal that from similiar efforts of a raid force of equal players is silly.That was never EQ.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
equal effort deserves equal rewards. was that &quot;ever EQ&quot; though? it depends how you measure &quot;payoff&quot;. loot payoff has never been comparable for soloers. but experience used to be much greater. well .. not for warriors :( but it was for a number of other classes. that was a great injustice in itself. but now the loot is worse, the experience is worse, and the flags are nonexistent.<br />
<br />
its not just soloers. its groupers now too. a full group of six friends who play together 60 hours a week will never get experience at more than half the rate a raiding guild can. their loot will never be much better than current bazaar loot. and why? because they are shut in behind a locked door with a sign on it saying &quot;non raiders need not apply.&quot; they look in vain for another door to enter like a bad dream and find another door with another sign that says &quot;get with the program buddy and get a guild.&quot;<br />
<br />
tuning to the majority may be complex but sony was so far from balance it made a large number of people very angry. angry enough to quit. do not forget our troubled times as warriors when warriors were so poorly balanced against knights that many warriors simply gave up. some retired their characters and some quit the game. some soldiered through it. so when you find yourself on the other side of the equation, that is you are on the side that gets 500aa per year for 40 hours per week of work while others get 150 for the same effort and 500 fewer AC and 2500 fewer hitpoints, maybe you find the whole thing balanced only because you are on the &quot;right side of the scale&quot; and its a happy place to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">1)Well there's not much planning involved in making a group and beating down a few mobs.Everyone who raids does have to put up with extra work/hassle/whatever .Most people don't find their raids landing smack in their favored playtime.They work their real life and gaming plans around their guild.No one gets along perfectly well with 60 other people.Few people in guilds get to perform the job they want how they wish on raids.A lot of frustration occurs trying to get 50 plus people to get stuff done raid after raid.That frustration is felt by everyone not just the leaders.<br />

exactly! they are rewarded more because everyone hates it. but something doesnt compute here. EQ is supposed to be a game. at least in theory its supposed to be fun. back in the days when raids were done once or twice a week and only needed 30-40 people to succeed the stress on everyone was much lower. why oh why did sony institute a system that bribes people to do something they hate? what does that have to do with a game?<br />
<br />
suppose the server had the capacity to give the player an electric jolt on his chair. and suppose only raid mobs commonly did this. suppose it were very painful and happened many times on each raid. what would you suggest that sony do to improve the fun of the game? get rid of the jolts? it would seem obvious. what if instead they tried to make up for it with &quot;far better loot&quot;, and what if youve been torturing yourself for 2 years for the sake of that loot? and what if some who never raided because of the jolts suggested they get rid of the jolts? and what if half the people on the boards said &quot;no! that wouldnt be fair! we suffered for two long years torturing ourselves. you deserve the same thing if you want the same loot!&quot; this is basically what ive been hearing from the community for the last year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well,It's obvious you have a totally differant perception of what EQ is about than I and probably the Dev's do.EQ is intended as a team sport imo that allows some latitude for differing styles of play.Origionally, it appears that EQ was designed primarily around groups with good play results for less than 6 people and the occassional raid that netted extra special gear.The emphasis on raiding grew through expansions to where it is now partly due to player influence.I'm sure some will disagree with that last point.<br />
<br />
You take a lot out of context ,but,my post above is plain to read.I disagree about raiding in higher pop and newer expansions.They demand more from a player than most xp groups do.My guildmates would agree on this I know.Raiding places much more stress on them generally than grouping does for many reasons and you seem to agree with this.However,stress/work/hassle does not equate with hate.I didn't suggest raiders hate raiding.Sometimes added work and stress payout with an added sense of achievement.Combine that with the positive aspects of teamwork and belonging to a group sharing mutual interests and victories in the game and you have a good recipe for enjoyment.Like many things of this nature it is balanced with the potential for frustration and a sometimes uncomfortable reliance on others.EQ encourages team play by design.Team play is not always easy to accomplish by random people tossed together over the internet though.<br />
<br />
To recap...<br />
I agree that the game has swung too far to the raiding side.However, I think any steps taken to balance this must respect the fact that players have spent a lot of time and effort operating under established rules.Any long term persistant game must respect this or undermine it's integrity imo.<br />
<br />
I agree that all players need upgrade paths.I think OOW &amp; GOD do a lot for this.Whether they do enough is very subjective and early to comment on I think.Certainly,as far as the complaints about good xp zones go GOD and OOW have rendered this mute imo.I haven't been back to fire since KT &amp; the Proving Grounds in OOW.Most people I know far prefer those new spots for xp.The drops in those places are very good for non raiders too.<br />
<br />
A bigger, tougher mob should drop higher quality loot.That has generally always been roughly true in EQ.Players do what they can to solve the problem of these special mobs.They often require special large forces to defeat.That it doesn't always seem so &quot;special&quot; anymore lacks luster.The new raid game is a very involved team video sport though with its own rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">LDON embodied the biggest failure to this ideal, imo. Originally, it was a great idea with how they designed the raids. Though they were implemented at kind of the last minute, and the raids were bugged to hell, the idea of taking only 36 people to raid something that would be the end game of that particular content, was a great idea. The uber guilds resisted this, because PoP had just forced them to increase their average raid sizes to 50+, which meant that at least half of their force would be sitting inactive if they chose to do these raids. But the LDON raids were actually pretty unique, though buggy, in the tasks which they asked the raiders to accomplish with such minimal forces.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to try those new LDON raids they implemented, but I think if they were implemented better that would have been a good medium between the hardcore raiding and non-raiding styles.</div></div><hr />

HOW IN THE f#$#ING H&amp;#$ CAN ANYONE SAY RAIDING IS HARD!  Come on, except for the raid leaders, and a few key people, any damn chipmunk can go on raid if they just follow directions.  I have a lot of respect for people who can run a good raid.<br />
<br />
There is not much to it.  Hell, even when I MA on a open raid, it is often less work and effort than grinding xp and often  takes less knowledge of the game.  <br />
<br />
I am not saying people who are in raiding guilds are bad players.  I am not saying they do not deserve uber loot.  I am only saying that raiding is not hard for the vast majority on a raid.  If there is a warrior who has 15000hp 2400ac, and every flag there is, he is probably a good player, but it is not guranted.  He could still be a trained monkey.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">To be fair, this is more true with some classes than others. Warriors always need to be keeping a look out, especially on raids that you have an offtanking team instead of a mezzing team (due to whatever reasons) or it becomes blatantly clear they aren't paying attention. That can definitely get you kicked off of a raid, even before the 54 and less slots per raid idea. You can tell who the real players are, because they are the ones that use every one of their class skills they can, in order to further the raid.<br />
<br />
But if you're talking Wizards, Rogues, and some other classes, it becomes much easier to slide along on somebody else's ticket.<br />
<br />
People can come here and argue all they like one way or the other. Yea, it might not take some people much skill to raid. It might take others a great deal. What you put into the game is what you get back in my experience. When it comes down to it, as a casual player, are you (not specifically anybody, but YOU) as proud of the gear you wear, as the player that just leeches rot loot for doing nothing?<br />

I suspect that itemization in OoW is partially designed to help overcome this and allow more people to experience GoD without having to farm Time for months first.<br />
<br />
With that said, most of the Warrior-type items I have seen from OoW have crazy good HP but hella-bad AC.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if there was elemental+ level armor out there in OoW somewhere.  My guess is that there probably is but we haven't found it yet.<br />
<br />
The other alternative is that the tanks still have to go through elementals / Time to be able to do their job in GoD, while the other classes can still get massive upgrades in OoW.<br />

Either way, I'm convinced SoE hates melee characters and generally has no idea how to balance their game around melee combat.  If they did, Warriors would be able to solo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I've come to the conclusion that raiders consist mostly of retards.  That's why they think it's so hard and so much work. Tying their shoes is an all day ordeal, standing next to 70 other people all with sparkly weapons and shiny armor distracts them.<br />
<br />
This is why every so often, someone who was actually in one of these guilds comes here and says &quot;Man, raiding is a complete snoozefest, I show up, I sit around, I turn on auto attack for a little while, and I get phat loots&quot; which is immediately followed by &quot;NUH UH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before you take offense to it...just look at the general population of EQ.  The vast majority of people are fucking idiots.  There is absolutely no way that the raider demographic is excluding these people.  The problem is that when you give a fool better gear than everyone else, he develops a superiority complex.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if there was elemental+ level armor out there in OoW somewhere. My guess is that there probably is but we haven't found it yet. <br />
<br />
If you look at GoD armor, my guess is that there's not.  I would suspect that this trend is going to continue because Raex is probably deemed overpowered down at SoE headquarters.  To further the problem, raiders fucking agree with their assessment, which is why they oppose opening the EP's.  We can't be having people get the same overpowered gear I'm wearing.<br />
<br />
7500 or 8khp unbuffed doesn't mean jack shit today.  HP &gt; all days are long over, and even tho the HP gap is starting to close, there is still a MASSIVE AC gap, and there's no end to that in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I'd agree that the main/biggest problem I've noticed in gear from OoW and GoD is the low AC on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Yup ,Haass is still mad.The trend should continue if what you mean is that raiders by raiding get better loot than people in groups.If they are all of equal strength more people working together can kill tougher mobs.Tougher mobs should equal better loot in EQ usually.That concept has been around awhile though.<br />
<br />
The people in my guild are for the most part not hardcore players.I know lots of hardcore players in higher end guilds who play crazy amonts of time and on average have way more individual skill than most people I meet.I'm not one of those players.I'm old and slow and when I'm playing I often don't take stuff as seriously as more hardcore players.I have never measured player skill by a tag though.Really I don't care either.I like folks with good attitudes that are fun to play with that can get the job done.That's always been more than enough for me.<br />
<br />
People who lack recent long term raid experience really have little idea I think.There is extra stress and work beyond what casual grouping normally requires.I group all the time and so do my friends.I guarentee the majority find raiding more challenging and many are very smart folks.I am in a position to draw a contrast.Imo grouping is far easier for me 90+ pct of the time even when i was only MT.My friends who tank beside me daily would say much of the same about our raids since the ep gods imo.We've only just beaten time and the stress is often evident.This has nothing to do with a direct measure of player skill or justifiable loot rewards though.<br />
<br />
Player skill depends on the player not the tag.Loot is put on mobs roughly measured by the overall difficulty required to kill them.It's left up to the players to get it ...that's the game.I think Haass often has valid points about improving the game for non raiders.I also think his view of the raiding part of EQ is out of wack due to his competitive nature.It just makes him feel good to put down raiders and the raiding game to justify his frustration at lack of progress  by comparison.There is a game for non raiders.There is definately room for improvement though.</div></div><hr />

Oh no, that has nothing to do with it.  I'm really fairly happy in EQ.  I just don't like listening to the bullshit the ubers spew on this board about how lazy we are and how they're more deserving of loot that they really didn't do anything to earn other than show up.<br />

 Perhaps because when you group as a high ender, you sit in one spot, a spot with a predictable spawnrate, and kill the same things over and over again. In raids, you actually have to move, and if the content is new, you are more aware of your surroundings. That being said, there are plenty of hardcore raiders who are good at /assist and TV watching and not much else, if you'd admit it.</div></div><hr />

Granted i dont really know what zone you are talking about but i do see most of our Luclin high end guilds in places like WoS, PG and on occassion Ldon. I should certainly hope they find it easy. <br />

Try these areas at 5k unbuffed, with 30 or so AA, in a pickup group and you may be in a position to &quot;draw a contrast&quot; as you say.<br />

Yup, I fell outa the tree with the gear I have.I grouped without droga weapons and ldon augs in cruddy gear.With this character on Stromm I quested all of my stuff without any bazaar available loot(at the time) and grouped everywhere I could.We die a lot one grouping trying anything we can get our hands on especially in new zones accidently pulling raid mobs hehe.I was 5k unbuffed and worse at one time.Regardless in one group my job is almost always clear and relatively easier even if we wipe due to lack of gear,heals,cc or just being silly.I'm hardly uber and I have done my share of grouping in craptastic gear for zones.Have you done your share of raiding the higher pop game and god or are you just assuming you know whats it's like and understand the challenges that face raiding guilds.I can draw that contrast quite well.</div></div><hr />

Er no.I don't consider myself a high ender.However,the majority of our raids now require the majority of our raid force to be operating at a higher capacity then they usually do in groups.We are usually undermanned relatively and too much slacking wipes us.Things change quite fast on our raids.No one usually stays on the same target ceaselessy attacking in time for example.There  are always new adds to offtank,kite and kill.There are various ae's rampage and aggro problems that keep melee awake and subject to a lot more than /assist and watching TV.You are making ridiculous assumptions about stuff you know little about obviously.I am guildleader/raidleader and I guarentee you that that sort of inattentiveness and slacking is not the staus quo in my guild and I feel safe in saying the same about the other 2 guilds of people I know ahead of us in content.We certainly have a few slackers and folks will be inattentive at times.The reward for that is often death and maybe a tl out btw.Of course pure dps classes could slack a bit more.The vast majority do not and act quickly in response to stuff thrown at them by the encounter or me.<br />

Like anyone we group what we can.Our gear allows us to pull faster and multi pull when we sit and grind so we do and sometimes we die.Still less work and challenge then raiding for us.Like everyone else we sometimes group the hardest stuff we can and adventure...crawling through new places.Better gear means you can do more and do it faster.It doesn't mean that people in my guild don't challenge themselves in grouping as much as you do.Btw they did not drop out of character select with their gear.I never try to form a perfect group.I take what I can get and go do stuff.I'm absolutely certain that strong groups in our server top guild can do more than we can and kill it faster.I still see them dying and tackling too much at times.Doesn't bug me though.Those guys play crazy hours and they play hard...dying endlessly until they solve stuff.Really I don't think you have a clue about long term raiding challenges in POP+.I doubt you know much more than lots of raiders about grouping though.</div></div><hr />

I think there should be a game that's enjoyable for non raiders.However,I think non raiders often make judgements about stuff they haven't experienced in these threads.Raiding is more challenging generally than grouping for us.It is intended to be so by soe imo.Not everyone wants to spend weeks or months learning stuff with 50 + other people by dying over and over doing cr's and blowing spawns without any loot or xp to show for it.They shouldn't have to.I see raid guilds collapse regularily after people have invested huge amounts of time and energy to various stresses.It's not always easy.<br />

My wife and I have invested huge amounts of time into this game like many people.We are all for improving the EQ for everyone.There is no beginning for raiders and non raiders, though ,without a certain respect for each other's game.Not that soe or anyone here will necessarily care...most prefer to gripe.</div></div><hr />
