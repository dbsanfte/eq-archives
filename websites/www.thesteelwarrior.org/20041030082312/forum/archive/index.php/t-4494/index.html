<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Endjinne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For a while i was dual wielding a CHoS and a SotB.  Both proc stuns.<br />
<br />
However I *think* the stuns are different.  It seems that the CHoS does not work very often on PoP mobs.  I would get the message that the proc went off and the 179 HP DD kicked in but that the mob was *immune* to the stun portion of the proc.  However, it seemed the Planar Strike proc on the SotB *did* stun as well as DD.<br />
<br />
Was I imagining things?  If no it seems that the SotB is in fact far better than the CHoS for generating aggro on PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Oh also, the Greatstaff of Thunder *does* proc stuns against most PoP mobs up to level 65.  That is why I suspect the SotB and GSoT share the same stun proc, where the CHoS has a different stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Indeed, they are different as you can tell that they have different names /bonk<br />
<br />
I think all Pre-PoP Stuns (spell and proc) have a level-limit that is lower than lvl60, the exact level-limit depends on which spells/Proc you use.<br />
<br />
Only PoP stuns (both spell and proc) can stun the lvl60+ mobs.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the general consenus is that even your target is immune to the stun effect, it still creates aggro. But whether or not the amount of aggro will be the same if the stun would have stuck, it depends who you talk to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CHoS procs Force Shock, which has two effects: A DD and &quot;Stun(0.00 sec)&quot;. That stun is level capped, ie wont work on mobs above a certain level (I fail to recall what level that is though).<br />
<br />
SotB procs Planar Strike, which has 2 effects: A DD and &quot;Stun(0.00 sec/65)&quot;. That stun is level capped at level 65 (I assume).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lvl Limit on &quot;basic&quot; stuns is Lvl 55.<br />
<br />
Stuns that appeared with PoP , like planar stun or planar strike , have a limit restriction at Lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All weapon proc stuns are equal, however some are more equal then others....<br />

How doesnt that mean? /puzzle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Endjinne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah!  So that begs another question.<br />
<br />
Does a Stun/55 generate aggro (or as much aggro) on a level 56 to 65 mob as a stun/65?<br />
<br />
If the consensus is yes, it does.  Then what information is there to back this up?</div></div><hr />

Compo, it is a reference to a book called Animal Farm by George Orwell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Endjinne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, that was my intention when i created the post.<br />
<br />
OMG I loved that book.  It still is the foundation for many of my personal philosphies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stuns still generate aggro, even when resisted or if the mob is immune (Easily tested by having a paladin cast a low level (cease/desist) stun on a mob and having the mob turn to him when the spell is resisted (or the mob is immune).<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;does it generate the same amount of hate?&quot;  That is impossible to test.<br />
<br />
There are several weapons out there with level 55 limited stuns that are generally accepted as good taunting weapons, even though their stuns don't affect +55 mobs.  (I personally own blackout and norge 'tal and they will both draw aggro when they proc on immune mobs in elemental planes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Endjinne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okies, cool.  So a mob that is immune to stun still gets aggro from it.  <br />
<br />
However, on PoP mobs that cast, it seems like a good idea to keep a SotB in your pocket to keep the nasty buggers from gating/helaing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used to use an Exiled blade in my mainhand for a very long time, and the low level enchanter stun that it proc'd made the weapon much better than a BoC due to the increased procrate. I don't think it matters how long the stun is or if it's level capped at 55 or not. What does matter is the amount of the DD portion of the stun. Apparently larger stuns like anarchy on the SoD have a tad bit more agro associated with them over other lower damage stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use CHoS + SotB. I keep the hammer in main because the dd is higher, 179 vs 75. But if I am fighting level 56-65 caster mob, like some of the mini-named in LDoN, I switch so the stun/65 sword is in primary hoping for an interupt. <br />
<br />
Maybe someday I'll get one.</div></div><hr />
