<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Werekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any new gear dropping yet that is obtainable by a non-uber raiding party?  havent heard jack yet, plz post if ya got the gear :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alla's has some of the new stuff that dropped in ChardokB, and it's some pretty cool stuff.  There's a 31% haste mask, a dagger with a stun proc and some other odds &amp; ends that will probably stop dropping in a few days, knowing SoE's MO.<br />
<br />
I spent about 3 hours in Nurga last night, and there was no loot to speak of.  The named mobs we ran across only dropped what appeared to be quest items.  At 55 a good majority of the mobs were dark blue.  There are a TON of caster mobs &amp; SK's that HT, which can be a pain.<br />
<br />
My 47 cleric bot got half a level of exp, and my 55 warrior got about 17% in the same amount of time.  I was there with a 63 mage &amp; 57 Shaman, so if you had people who were in the same level range I would imagine the exp would be better.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think it would be a good alternative to Tier 1 PoP zones that are complete train fests.  It was good to be in a dungeon exp'ing again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got a 13/20 hammer in droga that procs force shock.  A very nice up and coming warrior weapon.  Think recommended level was 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daktaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was just in Chardok B tonight, pretty cool zone.  Had a decent ring and earring drop.  Also got the 31% haste mask, its 10ac 5agi, 15hp and mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was able to solo droga named relatively easily, decent cash farm if I feel like running around invis looking for named, nothing sees invis that I have yet to find.</div></div><hr />
