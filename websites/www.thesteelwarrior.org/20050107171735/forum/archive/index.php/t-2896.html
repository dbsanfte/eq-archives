I dont have that much cash probably about 1600pp  and ideas are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grobb hide masks are pretty cheap now.  They have decent HPs on them.  Also a sarnak bracer of victory is under 1600pp on CT for sure.  They have 10 stam and 30 HPs.  AC on it blows (6AC), but your current ones are only 9AC.  Twisted ring loop and jagged bone hoop would both be ear upgrades that are pretty cheap now.  I got my jagged bone hoop for under 500pp. (6AC 40HP)<br />
If you can save up a little bit more cash get a clattering bone necklace (2.5-3k) and a putrid belt of rotten hide (3k)<br />
<br />
Hope this help. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ears:  easiest/cheapest to more costly<br />
Black sapphire electrum earring (2ac/35hp)<br />
Jagged Bone Hoop (6ac, 40hp)<br />
Solstice earring (5ac, 5sta, 55hp)<br />
Mosquito leg earring (7ac, 8sta, 65hp)<br />
Bloodmetal earring of engagement (7ac, 8sta, 70hp)<br />
<br />
Face:<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes (8ac, 35hp)<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians (12ac 35hp)<br />
Gantru War Mask (11ac, 5sta, 25hp)<br />
<br />
Fingers:<br />
6ac/65hp ring <br />
another valorium ring<br />
<br />
From the looks of your armor, you CoV faction is likely trashed.  If you feel up to it, spend time in kael fixing it and possibly farm thurg armor there.  Picking up a thurgadin helm would not be a bad idea.  Once it is fixed, bracers of benevolence and draconic pauldrons quest are options.<br />
<br />
Factionless suggestions<br />
If you can strike up a deal with a high elven smith, try farming materials for Full mithril armor and go for arms/legs/boots/bracers.<br />
Head: Helm of Raldukan, this you can hunt with a group in UP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmysterio</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions, plan on looking for a jagged bone hoop and death mask or gantru war mask.  And yeah Im sure my CoV faction is probably kaput,  some folks in my guild and I were planning on going on Giant faction, but now the guild is pretty much disbanded, which makes hunting in Kael to fix it kinda hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmysterio</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a jagged bone hoop for sale in bazaar, person wanted 3k for it tho so had to pass, was unable to find a death mask of elysians. Everything that seems like a nice upgrade is so damned expensive its mindboggling. And for a mediocre upgrade it would wipe out my bank account.  Dont really know how Tarew Marrs economy compares to other servers though.</div></div><hr />
