<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have seen alot of different threads saying this is broke that is broke blah blah is not balanced etc. I wanted to start a thread on some real topics that I think SOE was just smoking something when they came up with it.<br />
<br />
Some personal examples I have seen<br />
<br />
1. The Beastlord Epic mob in Fungus Grove that is immune to melee damage. This is an epic mob for a mainly melee char. Does this make any sense ?<br />
<br />
2. Wizard Epic Golem in Fear. Completly resistant to all magic (maybe some lures hit slightly). This is flat stupid.<br />
<br />
3. Phinny in Kedge Keep. Drops several diff epic pieces. My wife is a 65 wizard we had to kill Phinny 21 times before the wiz piece dropped. This mob is on a 12 hour timer as well. This is just another one when I ask myself what were they thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure some you have alot better ones than this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh because epics are supposed to require a raid force with help from other classes? The wizard epic mob thats immune to magic means you need meele dps to help out on the kill. That all just IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Beastlord epic mob in Fungus Grove is immune to all melee damage except for the H2H weapons that beastlord gets as part of the quest.  They are also part of the final turn in.  <br />
<br />
Rest I have no fucking clue what they were smoking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">like the fact they tried to put different mob types in epic fights.<br />
<br />
Drop rate on phiny does suck ... if mage solo'd. wizard item would have droped sooner :-)<br />
<br />
I ate TONS of DT's in the name of the warrior epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SK epic drop from PoHate.  I myself have spent over 100 hours grouped and solo trying for the drop since epics went live.  Got a tell from a good friend on saturday morning that she had one to chain for me.  Even w/ the &quot;increase&quot; in drop rate that SoE says they put in it is still the most annoying camp I have even done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3. Phinny in Kedge Keep.

<br />
Whats the point?  The RNG is well known for this.  I have seen wiz epic part drop 5 times (or was it more?) in a row.  I got every kill for 3 days looking for another part.  Lots of rotting rog and wiz parts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I spent around 2 months straight killing Phinny, trying to get a robe. But that's the breaks. As was mentioned, 12 hour respawn. That gives you the opportunity to kill again without much of a wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me, #1 &quot;wtf were they thinking&quot; is Ikkinz.  The most unimaginative zone layout in history, used and reused for a total of 7 steps of GoD progression. And they're constantly messing around with the raids there still, making them lamer and lamer. Last night we got halfway through Ikkinz 4 (after beating it several times a couple/few months back), and a turn-in was changed. So we had no choice but to TL out, with a 2.5 day lockout, unable to do a damned thing. The change made absolutely no sense. It didn't make the raid more difficult. It didn't do anything except &quot;trick&quot; us into losing turn-in pieces, which were handed in in the same manner as the last several times through. Every time I go to this zone, that's exactly what comes to my mind - from the lame assed itemization to the lame assed layout to the lame assed mobs that need to be killed by a bard on a Tuesday while it's raining under a full moon (which didn't offer clue emotes for weeks on end) and on and on - WTF were they thinking?</div></div><hr />

Tell me tho when you saw SuperChicken up with a sword in it's hand and you were getting the drop that you didn't sh*t yer greaves :D.<br />
Those were the best DT's I ever recieved; even better than Innoruuk's or the golems or CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">irmingnomers is right, the beastlord epic final fight makes sense if you know the story.  He has a protection that makes him immune to normal melee, but part of the beastlord epic is making claws that can break through that enchantment to kill him (just ask any beastlord what they were doing gathering epic pieces in The Deep, The Grey, and Maiden's Eye).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the ones that I scratch my head over is the reasoning behind having corpses from a failed Ikkinz trial pop at the trial entrance, other than the zone. Nothing like sitting around for a day waiting for a KT flagged necro or SK to be available. Waste of time.<br />
<br />
The whole berserker class seems a bit of a waste as well. <br />
<br />
peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to me the Beastlord class itself seems to be an odd thing done by SoE. Think of it, a class that shares ALL monk's uberest items hence deals equal if not more damage, can buff you hp and atk like a shaman, can slow like a enchanter, can haste, have prenerf monk mitigation table and better hp so it tanks like a knight while wearing leather, and lets not forget they have the best pet of any class.... oh and mana regen buff which parent class did they get that from? w t f  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh they can't debuff(tash or malo) for their slows and they can't double attack without aa's.  I haven't looked at any parses with aa's so I'm not sure on how effective they are and such but yeah beastlords are pretty nice heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aren't they? Btw I'm not looking for a nerf or any such thing so plz dont flame me, the game's too old for all that now anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlords are overpowered.Thats why they make incredibly fun alts. Slap some good twinkage gear on them and they steamroll red cons.Easiest alt I ever had to lvl 1-30 solo.Course back when I did my wizard I had KEI available 1-46 so once he could quad at 29, 29+ was a breeze.<br />
btw Mass Kiting &gt; Quad kiting for that tingly balls feeling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Phinny drop for the wizard epic sucks, sure his respawn is pretty quick, but how often is he really up?<br />
<br />
Shards for the cleric epic are so rare it is ridiculous.  We spent three straight nights for about 3-4 hour stints in Skyfire, nada shards.<br />
<br />
The golem in fear is a pain in the ass more because it's so risky to check if he's up even unless you have insta nexus gate as a wizard.  Breaking fear even nowadays isn't especially fun.  I guess you could say the same thing for guards though and enchanter mob in PoF.<br />
<br />
I remember clearing hate like four or five times to get the final epic piece for our enchanter, it was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The bottlenecks in epics are just annoying and frustrating and a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
Getting kicked out or disconnected and waiting 10 minutes or more to get back in because you have an active character, having to reboot your PC competely just so you can get back in.<br />
<br />
I'm still having issues with the DX9 changes, I bet they never get fixed.  Occasionally mobs will be swimming in the ceiling or bouncing up and down from under the ground.  Sometimes I either cannot hit them or can only hit them like half the time.  Sometimes I just cannot see other players or cannot see mobs either.  They are just not there on my screen even though they are right in front of me.  Mind you...  I have a GeForce FX5600 with the latest drives on a decent P4 2.4Ghz with 512MB of RAM, not some old video card on an old system.<br />
<br />
Factioning is annoying.  It is ridiculous how much work it takes to raise certain factions.  Factioning is messed up.<br />
<br />
The nerf bat.  Recently I've noticed several mid level casual player type zones named pop rates have been dramatically nerfed.  Trust me, I spend hours farming these zones, they have been hardcore nerfed.  The constant patches.  It used to be that patches were rare, now they are all the freaking time.  The new expansions that they keep pumping out, bugged or finished or not.  The lore behind the new expansions, where is it?  The lore and storylines of these expansions is just stale.  Where's the creativity?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 words....Item Effects.<br />
<br />
Flowing Thought=mana regeneration<br />
Aura of Battle=attack &amp; regen<br />
<br />
For me the lack of creativity, zerg style encounters, and general dumbing down of the game has been the hardest.  SoE gives the hardcore's just enough challenge to keep them in game, and provides just enough free passes to allow complete fucktards to reach 65 and beyond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Why doesn't haste last anywhere near as long as KEI?<br />
2. Why recommended level of 56, required level 55?<br />
3. The 1018 errors after each patch for 5 years.<br />
4. Free back pack for new players.<br />
5. Don't they start with money now, too?</div></div><hr />

Hell no.</div></div><hr />
