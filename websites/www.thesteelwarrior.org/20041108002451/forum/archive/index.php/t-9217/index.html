<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xyzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I searched before deciding to post this and didn't find anything relevant. I noticed some people are very aggrivated by the new corpse decay particle effect while farming for cash / exp and stumbled across this while playing. You can /hidecorpse looted and that should be able to make the corpse disappear instantly. I hope this helps someone out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn now thats the best news I have heard in a while. It really made shakerpaging FG a pain as the eyes and brains on those mobs can pay for half the cost of the kegs or more, but looting 100 plus corpses with that delay was no fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks you soooo much!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It doesn't seem to work tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Works perfectly for me <br />
<br />
/hidecorpse looted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Huh, tried it again today and it worked for some reason.<br />
<br />
It didn't when I tried it when this was posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">New fingers, eh Haass?  I hate it when new fingers foul up my tpying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So just type /hidecorpse looted one time and they disappear instantly on looting like the old days? Or do you have to do this every time ytou log in or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I tried it once when I saw this thread first, and it didn't work then, even tho I got the same /hidecorpse message I did the 2nd time, so I dunno what the deal is.<br />
<br />
I had to turn it off anyway because it hides the corpse even with loot on it.  Most of the time, I check loot and then end up deciding where it goes later, so not so cool from my veiw anyway.  <br />
<br />
It's a bandaid fix.  It's a really great bandaid fix, but still a bandaid fix.</div></div><hr />

Didn't work for me the other night in Sol Ro.  Come to think of it, should be still in effect and didn't work again last night in Sol Ro either.  Zone maybe?  that would be bizarre..   I'll take another go at this.  Lots of tradeskillers PB hunting drops would find this useful.</div></div><hr />
