Just did one of these for the first time last night at level 16 (rerolled... again, damn the lack of /face lol).<br />
<br />
fun stuff, any trinkets i should be trying for in here?</div></div><hr />

By the way, I HIGHLY recommend doing shadowfang keep when you get around 25 if you can.  It's gonna be a helluva haul into Horde territory, but SFK was really the first time I realized that I'm not in EQ anymore.  It's such an excellent dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what i meant was any interesting drops clickies whatnot that would be useful. already looking at the taskmaster axe (  http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=5194  ) and picked up a couple minor stat upgrades last night.<br />
<br />
i keep forgetting there is a trinket slot in WoW Lol.</div></div><hr />

SFK will emphasize the difference in grouping.</div></div><hr />

If you can finish Deadmines, as in kill Van Cleef, I would do runs in there till you got as much upgrade as you needed.  VanCleef himself drops a nice sword and the meat tenderizor was something I used as well.  There's also a blue shield that drops in there, forgot the name of it.  On my first character, I ran DM's about 4-5 times and just moved on.  By then I had everything I needed.<br />
<br />
Its also real fun if you are guilded and have high lvls there.  I did a quick run through there with my 2nd character with a lvl 50+ paladin.  I was only there for loots and to finish the quests in there.  Basically he just ran all through the mine, pulled about 20 mobs all on him, sat there and spam'ed his aoe and killed them all at once.  High lvl characters in low lvl dungeons/instances just destroy the place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">06-17-2005, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that grouping with higher level people has a huge impact on EXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">06-17-2005, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah it does but when you're slaughtering 50 mobs in the time it takes to kill 10 alone its not so bad. especially when the loots start piling up, its nice walking out of a lowbie dungeon with a nice upgrade and some blue items to share with friends or sell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">06-17-2005, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True that.</div></div><hr />
