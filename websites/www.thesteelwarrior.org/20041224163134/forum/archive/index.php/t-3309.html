I'll note that much of the remainder of the thread was very good.  I completely disagree with Lendardo's take on that dev forum, though.  He seems very optimistic that SoE will look at melee balance.  I think they simply said what they needed to say in order to halt a riot.</div></div><hr />

This was shot down by the other monks, but yeah it's just stupid.  Next he'll be telling us that Monks are supposed to be a tank, they've always supposed to have been a tank, and the only difference in tanking a Monk and a Warrior should have is the fact that Warriors have a taunt button. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

SoE shouldn't have been lazy from the beginning and just made armor sets tailored specifically to each class.  Better yet, save your points and buy the armor mold, take it to EC, and have it crafted (no fail, of course) ala Ornate and Elemental armor style.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's more work.  But hey, you know what?  How many times have you heard your mother or father say, Don't do it if you're not going to do it right?  Same concept here.  If SoE had done things properly from the beginning, we wouldn't be in this mess.<br />

<br />
Mob dropping class only armor is not going to work with the current game structure due to not enough of any class to make the said items not rot.  Of course a system like elemental armor could work, not sure why they're not doing it for the high end loot.  Or they can have a vendor you turn in all plate items from say Time to warrior only version with corresponding stats, i.e. Armguards of the Brute can become Raex's Armguards of the Brute.</div></div><hr />

Rangers are getting pretty darn close to beating a rogue for situational DPS (granted lots of AA to do so).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad most of you dont realise this is a feasable solution.<br />
However it will require a total loot redesign from the start.<br />
<br />
This is a wonderfull solution however for EQ2 or another MMPG <br />
<br />
I get 1.5AC points per AC on my armor slot. So 1.5 Multiplicator.<br />
<br />
Play around with that multiplicator and boost it to 3.5 or 4 on warriors.<br />
Keep it (i guess 1.5 for monks), boost it to 2.5 for rogues<br />
<br />
Ex : Raex Bracer = Ac46 hp145 -)  AC59 hp145 when worn<br />
<br />
With change Ton Po = Ac20 hp135 -)  Ac70 hp135 or Ac80 hp135 when worn by a war<br />
<br />
NO change Ton Po = Ac20 hp135 -)  Ac30 hp135  when worn by a monk<br />
<br />
With change Ton Po = Ac20 hp135 -)  Ac50 hp135  when worn by a rogue<br />
<br />
Not only it works, but its very easy both to balance &amp; itemise.<br />
<br />
However this is imposible for EQ1 since it means a TOTAL loot CHANGE.<br />
Of every single item in the game. Thus impossible.<br />
<br />
The idea however despite what the author says is brilliant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that is probably one of the best fixes for the mitigation gap I have seen, if a little extreme.  You could avoid returning the entire database of armor by making the multiplier smaller... alter the class multipliers.  Leave knights at 1.5 and boost Warrior to 1.7 or so and all would be well.  Boosting it to 4.0 would be a little ludicrous and indeed require a massive returning to all gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a little history of the monk class for you ...<br />
<br />
Monks have the highest AC multiplier in the game. Always have.  (This was to offset the fact that monks were a MELEE class, and thus had to step up and melee mobs, but could only wear leather and cloth, very low AC armors, back when EQ came out).<br />
<br />
So to give the other classes a higher AC multiplier will yet again NERF the class, who's defense is already in the crapper.<br />
<br />
Considering monk armor already has the lowest AC of class armor, that's a pretty stupid idea don't you think?<br />
<br />
What's even worse is, it goes against the whole IDEA of the monk class. They TRAIN AND HONE THEIR BODIES to be able to take a blow. You know the whole martial arts thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for nerfing monks... what nerf?  -30% mitigation and +20% avoidance sounds like a proper rebalance, not a nerf.<br />
<br />
A body, no matter how well honed, will not weather an arrow as well as a body well-trained with rigorous martial routines and covered in platemail.<br />
<br />
If you insist on referring to the &quot;nerf,&quot; then please keep in mind that it was the glory days of 60 AC monk-only leggings when warriors did not get such AC on leg items until four expansions later that created the situation requiring said nerf in the first place.<br />
<br />
But this is all off-topic.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This crap again, and again, and again ...<br />
<br />
&quot;As for nerfing monks... what nerf? -30% mitigation and +20% avoidance sounds like a proper rebalance, not a nerf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: What is the ONLY class in EQ that has a defensive PENALTY right now?<br />
<br />
Answer: Monks.<br />
<br />
-30% Mitigation, NO CHANGE TO MONK AVOIDANCE. They never touched monk avoidance. It stayed the SAME.<br />
<br />
And right now BEASTLORDS mitigate better than monks.<br />
<br />
That is a nerf. So when I refer to the MONK NERF, I refer to the fact that monks are the ONLY class in the game that receives a DEFENSIVE penalty ... I refer to monk armor having LESS AC than any other melee class armor, but still they receive a defensive penalty ... I refer to the HYBRID offshoot of the monk class MITIGATING better than its parent class even though they're BOTH &quot;leather&quot; based classes.<br />
<br />
It was a nerf. It wasn't a fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If you insist on referring to the &quot;nerf,&quot; then please keep in mind that it was the glory days of 60 AC monk-only leggings&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The nerf went live a WEEK before Planes of Power was released. The GLORY days of AC 60 legs were over by then, as Vex Thal's AC 35 and AC 25 legs were already perceived UPGRADES to AoW pants by then.<br />
<br />
So if you insist on bringing up AC 60 legs at least get your TIMELINE CORRECT.<br />
<br />
And another thing ... those legs are quite dated right now.<br />
<br />
And TANK AC vs. Monk AC is far more in line. Monk AC on elemental gear is well behind the AC on other melee classes.<br />
<br />
So ... the NERF, WHICH STILL EXISTS, is no longer needed.<br />
<br />
Itemization FIXED the problem.<br />
<br />
BUT ... I ask you ... what is the only class that STILL has a defensive PENALTY?<br />
<br />
Monk avoidance is the same as avoidance for any other class.<br />
<br />
But their mitigation is still horrible.<br />
<br />
&quot;when warriors did not get such AC on leg items until four expansions later&quot;<br />
<br />
Velious ... Luclin ... Planes of Power. That's TWO expansions later.</div></div><hr />

I miscounted the expansions by one.  LoY is an expansion.<br />
<br />
BL mitigation being too high might be bad.  Monk mitigation is fine where it is, imo.  Give a druid the defensive skill caps of a monk and let him try to tank.  Monk dps could use a little help, I think.  Warrior initial aggro could use a little help.  Other than that, I dont see serious problems with either class.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic at hand, I think a 1.7 ac mod would be good for warriors.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Please post for me the gear upgrades you got from LoY.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to see what your Ykesha raids turned up that had everyone looking to replace their PoP gear with. Let alone their Luclin gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to the topic at hand, I think a 1.7 ac mod would be good for warriors. &quot;<br />
<br />
There's no reason for warriors, who receive the MOST AC in the game for wearing plate mail armor, to get any increased AC modifier.<br />
<br />
They already get a 1.5 modifier AND they get to equip gear with AC that blows the doors off of anything the OTHER melees classes see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I might be missing something here but isn't this one of the problems everyone has been talking about and that I myself have seen in game?  That other classes DO SEE these armors with Same AC as warriors.  I am not saying all but unless you're specifically talking about Raex... a lot of high end stuff including the new LDON stuff has other classes in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wubao ..... Your not seeing it right, i'll explain myself.<br />
<br />
ATM : <br />
Raex Bracer = Ac46 hp145 =  Ac59 hp145 when worn by a war<br />
Ton Po Bracer = Ac20 hp135 = Ac33 hp135 when worn by a monk<br />
Bilidil Bracer = Ac31 hp134 = Ac45 hp135 when worn by a rogue<br />
<br />
So where is the difference between us 3 ? the AC<br />
<br />
So instead of fucked up loot (bst + monk)  (rogue+rng) (war+pal/sk).<br />
Where we get heavily shafted by the mana counterpart there is an easy solution.<br />
<br />
Melee Bracer = Ac30 hp135<br />
Hybrid Bracer = Ac20 hp135 mana100<br />
Priest/Caster = Ac20 hp115 mana145 (not important for our test)<br />
<br />
So far so good.  Now instead of 1.5 ac factor for melees &amp; 1.65 for monks.<br />
<br />
Change it to : <br />
<br />
2.5  Pal/SK = Ac50 hp135 mana100<br />
2.4 Warriors =  Ac68 hp135<br />
1.8  Ranger = Ac38 hp135 mana100<br />
1.5 Rogues = Ac45 hp135<br />
1.4 Monks =Ac42 hp135<br />
<br />
While numbers arent really ideal, i find them decently balanced.<br />
And instead of having to make 12-14 ? item types (one per class)<br />
<br />
You will only have to make 3 : Melee / Hybrid / Caster<br />
<br />
Whats the difference between a cleric and a wizard ? the ac<br />
Whats the difference between a war and a monk ? the ac (ac=hp too)<br />
Whats the difference between a ranger and a paladin ? the ac<br />
<br />
So basically pure class issues are only centered around AC.<br />
<br />
Where does a Monk get shafted VS a BST ?<br />
Where does a Rogue get shafted VS a Ranger ?<br />
<br />
The Tankability &amp; Survival issue (ac &amp; hp).<br />
<br />
The extra ac (if any) or hp (if any) arent enought to balance the Mana gains.<br />
<br />
This solution is a fix, while it cannot be applied to EQ.<br />
It will do wonders for another game balace &amp; tuning.<br />
(Just tune that Coefficient and u can change class tankability at will).<br />
<br />
Add an HP coefficient too if u wish to balance things out.<br />
But the future of Balance can only be attained by the use of coefficients.<br />
And a Melee/Hybrid/Caster loot Distribution.</div></div><hr />

While the monk NERF still exists (and it does) that 33 worn AC means jack ... and shit to a monk.<br />
<br />
It's more like an AC 15 bracer for all the good it does.<br />
<br />
And having monks LAST on your calculation table? Right.<br />
<br />
Run that one past your guild's monks. You know the ones that pull mobs. Ask them if they think they need a 1.2 modifier on their armor (which is a REDUCTION) while you need a 2.whatever.<br />
<br />
Ask them while they're in the middle of pulling those wonderful mobs that ass-rape monks about if they should have a LOWER AC modifier than they currently have and if warriors should have over DOUBLE them.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll get back to you when they finish loading at their bind point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To a certain extent, I wouldn't argue this.  But most of it comes about as a result of having to counter the hyberbola of Hybrid plate classes coming here who claim that if Warriors receive even the slightest improvements it's &quot;back to Kunark!&quot; for them.  They overblow the importance of our AC advantage, which isn't all that large and doesn't have that much impact.  They overblow the importance of our HP advantage, while completely disregarding and discounting those abilities they have which help them regain HP in combat.  They point at our DPS and scream about how everyone wants us for DPS and how they'll never take a Knight if they don't retain a heavily stilted aggro advantage.  Which is sad as hell given that the only class we really out DPS is Paladins and they have so many things to counter balance it that it's not even funny.<br />
<br />
And finally they point to defensive and go completely ape shit about how they don't have it and never get to tank the boss mobs and therefore we deserve to be sodomized in the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
Do we over blow the issue to an extent?  Absolutely.  But it's the only way to get a fair hearing given the constant counter propaganda spewed forth by those people who have a vested interest in seeing to it that Warriors receive nothing, and lots of it.</div></div><hr />

Not suggesting any kind of nerf, he/she(sorry=P) is saying IF loot was done by arch-type(melee/hybrid/etc) then they could do those modifiers to get class AC where it should be relatively. They even give very clear numbers that would be higher than current monk AC(base and worn). So please, back to Monksville with the mitigation bitching.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run that one past your guild's monks. You know the ones that pull mobs. Ask them if they think they need a 1.2 modifier on their armor (which is a REDUCTION) while you need a 2.whatever. <br />
<br />
You need to get past the mechanics involved and look at the end result Wubao.  Who cares what the multiple is if the end result makes sense?  If the end result is a monk BP with 50AC and 200 hps do you care whether the item has 500 raw AC and monks get 0.1x multiplier or whether it has 1 raw AC and monks get a 50x multiplier?  I certainly don't.<br />
<br />
I've suggested a similar way of balancing equipment several times before.  A system like this would allow SoE to tailor items for pure melees in general and then use multipliers to custom fit them to each class.  It would also allow them to do the same thing to casters and hybrids.  Let's take it a step further and look at what they could do with multiple modifiers.<br />
<br />
My system included the method already outlined in addition to categorizing the effects on equipment and instead of putting a specific effect on it, you assign a generic type to it which is defined by your class.  Here's an example of what I mean.<br />
<br />
Say the devs make a BP with 75 AC 150 hps 150 mana 10 to all stats and resists vengeance 8 and mana preservation 4.  This obviously is a good BP for any class but is by far the most beneficial to a hybrid.  Let's say you want that BP to automatically customize itself to any class that puts it on.  First we assign some base values to it.<br />
<br />
Say 50 AC 100 hps 100 mana 10 to all stats and resists and a type 4 effect<br />
<br />
Now we give multiples to each class and define what type 4 means for each class.<br />
<br />
Warriors 2xAC, 1.75xhps, 0xmana, 1.5xmelee stats, 0.5xcaster stats, 1.2xMR, 0.9xother resists, type 4 for warriors = Vengeance 8 + 4 worn DS<br />
<br />
Paladins 1.8xAC, 1.5xhps, 1.3xmana, 1.4xmelee stats, 1.2xcaster stats, 1xall resists, type 4 for paladins = vengeance 8 + mana preservation 4<br />
<br />
Monks 1.5xAC, 1.4xhps, 0xmana, 1.5xmelee stats, 0.5xcaster stats, 1xall resists, type 4 for monks = Vengeance 10 + 10% extra flying kick damage<br />
<br />
Wizards 0.6xAC, 1.0xhps, 2xmana 0.5x melee stats, 1.5x caster stats, 1.2xFR/CR, 0.9xother resists, type 4 for wizards = FT 4 + 20% reduction in aggro from spells<br />
<br />
That would allow that 1 BP to have the following effect for just the classes I listed:<br />
<br />
Warriors: 100 AC, 175 hps, 0 mana, 15 melee stats, 5 caster stats, 12MR, 9FR/CR/DR/PR, Vengeance 8 + 4 worn DS<br />
<br />
Paladins: 90 AC, 150 hps, 130 mana, 14 melee stats, 12 caster stats, 10 resist all, Vengeance 8 + mana preservation 4<br />
<br />
Monks: 60 AC, 140 hps, 0 mana, 15 melee stats, 5 caster stats, 10 resist all, Vengeance 10 + 10% extra flying kick damage<br />
<br />
Wizards: 30 AC, 100 hps, 200 mana, 5 melee stats, 15 caster stats, 12 FR/CR, 9 MR/DR/PR, FT 4 + 20% reduction in aggro from spells<br />
<br />
To some extent they're already doing this with augmentations.  It doesn't adjust automatically to each class but you won't have a warrior sticking a mana augment on anything and you probably won't see a wizard sticking a vengeance aug on anything...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
As a paladin, I do agree that KEI is the real enemy.  It allows casters and Hybrids to cast spells without any real thought to mana conservation.  Before KEI, groups did not mind having a warrior because warrior's did not slow the group down.  This really caused two problems - Clerics do not have to manage their mana to ensure they have enough &quot;healing&quot; to keep the tank alive.  Secondly, waiting for aggro to be established was no big problem before KEI since a &quot;nuker&quot; would not have enough mana to go all out on a single mob - they needed to wait partly to recover mana from the previous fight.  <br />

Down with KEI - not that it would ever fly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yuffie's idea may be rather weird and while i may not like it.<br />
Its very interesting. If you think about it, its a brilliant solution.<br />
<br />
With LDoN came out fully customisable armor.<br />
The imbalance is still there but it is lessened to some extent.<br />
(On AHR bp we had 125hp AND 125mana, On LDoN its 210hp OR 210mana)<br />
<br />
We went from  AND to OR , which is an improvement if u ask me.<br />
<br />
Making all melees wear the same gear still is a great idea.<br />
(Ill skip the coefficient part consider they remain the same,<br />
and lets try to ignore wubao's useless comments on monk nerf)<br />
<br />
HERE IS A SOLUTION FOR TODAY'S EQ<br />
<br />
You kill some Boss01 in LDoN<br />
<br />
He drops :  Aerin's Necklace of Fury    War/Mnk/Rog   All<br />
Ac20 HP150  +10saves +10stats  1 Slot TYPE11  <br />

<br />
Hail, Maurauder Areinias<br />
&quot;You have just revienced a   Ac15 hp30 Veng3  TYPE11   Rogue/All augment&quot;<br />
<br />
Problem solved. 3 fully balanced loots in 1 item.<br />
No rots/decay, no crazy all/all shit.<br />
<br />
Melee class balance preserved (post augment).<br />
All Pure melees are happy (tailored items galore)<br />
<br />
I wont go on with the Hybrid or the Mana version of this.<br />
<br />
Give me 2 days, and i can make Hybrid &amp; Mana version of this necklace.<br />
While preserving class balance &amp; keeping everyone happy.<br />
<br />
So you see :) Sharing loot with monk/rogue can be a blessing<br />
if implemented correctly (doable with LDoN) and easy to balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, that just isn't true at all. If you can add modifiers to melee, you can do the same to caster classes. Hence, maybe priests get more from their AC than the robe wearers, etc.<br />
<br />
And while we are at it, since warriors are supposed to be fine with having a useless 100MANA on an item, I should think priests could be equally set with an extra 10INT on an item (I don't hear casters complaining about VT).<br />
<br />
I don't really agree with lumping classes together at all.  It looks like an easy fix for what was lazy programming an itemization to begin with but it'll probably bring far more problems than it fixes.  However, to the extent you really wanna work with the idea, its not that bad.  Basically, Emilia is discussing CLASS-inherent itemization/modification versus ITEM-inherent itemization/modifiation.  Hey, so long as we are all treated differently according to our unique skill set in what we bring to the raid and group, I&quot;m happy.</div></div><hr />

They TRAIN AND HONE THEIR BODIES to be able to take a blow. You know the whole martial arts thing. <br />
<br />
Sorry but Leather isn't gonna help much against what in EQ would be the same or similar as getting hit by a Garbage truck speeding down the highway.  And I think it would be much more appropriate to say they train to not get hit, not to take a hit.  Its the basic of just about any martial art.<br />
<br />
In any case, the disparity between Melee, Hybrids, and Casters has gotten way out of hand.  <br />
Warriors, Rogues, and Monks all need their niche that isn't stepped on by Hybrids, as well as the availability of items/abilities that don't require them to be so  dependant on Casters as they are now.  Warriors have /disc Defencive, Rogues have Shroud of Stealth, Monks have... well I don't know or really care with how poorly some of the monks have portrayed themselves in this thread, grow up some and maybe I'll care to look into it.<br />
<br />
Few funny things I have noticed;<br />
 <br />
Warriors as they supposed best tank, has the worst taunt of the tanking classes... defeats the purpose dosen't it?  If Warriors keep their current agro, then they should have a much higher hp/ac than Paladins/Shadowknights.  Otherwise if they wont upgrade a warriors hp/ac, then they need a much bigger taunting ability.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Monks are the only 2 damage (ie, not a tank, healer, slower, etc.) oriented classes that are solely dependant on being in melee range to do their damage.  All other damage classes do their damage from a range, or have the option too.  Would think in turn they would have the defencive or offencive advantage over say Rangers.<br />
<br />
Being able to cast a spell doesn't carry the penalty that it used to when EQ first came out.  Even the once crappy spells that Hybrids got were upgraded to majorly turn the tides of balance.</div></div><hr />

It looks like a deliberate action from SOE to break the depency on warriors, clerics and monk for specific tasks of pulling, tanking, healing. All this seems to be done on purpose and I would assume that it will take a lot of factual evidence that it was a bad idea to convince a dev in his ivory tower. Same holds true for monks btw.<br />

Same with the reliance on rogues for dps, as far as I can tell.<br />

Three things ...<br />
<br />
1- Monks are originally a CLOTH wearing class. Not just a leather armor wearing class. They wear wraps on their wrists. And robes.<br />
<br />
2- It's all MAGIC armor.  Before you start with the leather vs. plate BS ... consider this ... MAGIC armor is MAGIC armor. It doesn't matter to anyone that magical chain protects better than a lot of magical plate. Why should it matter that magical leather or magical cloth protects really well?<br />
<br />

Not to zero, but it shouldnt be snap agro.  The taunt button should be the best way to get agro.  All the tanking classes have taunt.  SoE will not do this because it will be viewed as a nerf, and not a fix.  With WoW coming out, SoE will not want to do anything that can be viewed as a nerf.  What will most likely happen is small work arounds like augs, with them throwing a big bone to those whining the loudest just before WoW launches.  Maybe warriors will get a better taunt to level it out.  <br />
<br />
As it is, the game is closer to Easy Quest then it is to Ever Quest.  When we all get snap agro, then you can go full out on every single mob that you chain pull and plant them all lined up like little daisy's to be choped down 1 by 1 without any skill or strategy.  The game would be better if they took snap agro away from the knights and forced players of all classes to have to think about the things they do.<br />
<br />
We all agree the all/all gear it was lazy programming.  I dont see it as a game buster though.  Just somthing they need to be careful of in EQ2.<br />
<br />
Not to encourage monk whinning, but would you rather have a monk or a bard in your group?  Would you rather have a monk or a rogue? monk or a ranger?  Monk or a Beastlord? To be honest, I never really even consider monks for my group unless there is nothing else available, there are much better pullers, much better melee DPS.    &quot;If&quot; there is a broken class, I would say it is a monk.  (I have never played a monk, and dont have any friends who play them)  If it wernt for the fact that they sound so retarded on the MBs I would feel really bad for them.</div></div><hr />

Revising the gigantic content of EQ takes a lot of damn time, something the devs don't have a huge abundance of. If they did they would have already addressed the monk mitigation, warrior taunt, rogue whatever class balance problems already. Instead they've been spending their 40 to 50 hour work weeks (more?) on producing expansions which demand resources to develop and push out the door. Whether that was the right or wrong strategy is moot at this point. It's done. The point is that those expansions pushed class balance off the table because the dev team has finite resources and manhours to work with.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief the devs aren't lazy, selfish, evil bastards who have a crosshair drawn on us, the Players. They want to be proud of their work and go home happy that they did a good job for us, just as we would in their position. <br />
<br />
Any workable balance solution we come up with has got to be simple, because simple doesn't take a lot of time to alter or code.  Emillia's idea of one adjusting coefficient is fantastic. Applied consistently it would allow them, and us, to focus on key game variables that make a difference without taking two months to implement them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say that now.<br />
<br />
BUT if something like this were implemented, it would ...<br />
<br />
1- Not be simple<br />
<br />
2- Not work properly.<br />
<br />
3- Ruin the itemization that's already in game.<br />
<br />
4- Create more work for the devs who already do not even want to TOUCH itemization from older expansions and do everything they can to avoid extra work of that nature.<br />
<br />
Look, I'm sure someone's gonna post here after this post saying &quot;Well Wubao, you stupid, illiterate fool, READ Emilia's post and you'll see that it deals with some OTHER game besides EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is fine. But the above quote talks about implementing this idea in current EQ.<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea that much in regards to CURRENT EQ.<br />
<br />
And it's not as simple as you think it is.<br />
<br />
And if something like this were tried with current EQ, it'd wreck the itemization from all the previous expansions, and the dev team would have to go in and tweak that stuff, you know, spending more time dealing with items they already screwed up on.<br />
<br />
Remember those AC 60 monk legs you all hate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here I thought they were motived by their paycheck and their idiot supervisors who don't have a clue about EQ, but know a few things about $$.  As much as I would like to believe it, Its far from the truth, they do as they are told, and the people telling them what to do are the same people who provide the wonderful CS, plan out the excellent scripts (read timesinks), and learn that above all else, people are addicted to the game and they can take him their nice fat paycheck by making the game as much of an addictive timesink with minimal content that they can.<br />
<br />
1- Monks are originally a CLOTH wearing class. Not just a leather armor wearing class. They wear wraps on their wrists. And robes. <br />
<br />
Your point?  Were talking Now, not 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
2- It's all MAGIC armor. Before you start with the leather vs. plate BS ... consider this ... MAGIC armor is MAGIC armor. It doesn't matter to anyone that magical chain protects better than a lot of magical plate. Why should it matter that magical leather or magical cloth protects really well? <br />
<br />
So because its magical, it instantly turns into The Amazing Invincible Armor of the Ubermonk?  I'll remember that the next time I see a monk splattered on a pull... and try not to split my side laughing.<br />
<br />
3- Next time someone wants to complain about AC 60 monk legs ... think about ROBE OF SECRETS. AC 65 CASTER ROBE. That's 4 less AC than your LDoN PLATE MAIL BP. A ROBE. <br />
<br />
Guess what, people did complain, but I guess you weren't there.<br />
<br />
<br />
My origional point was that monks depend heavily on avoidance, yet you seem to want them to be superior in terms of mitigation as well (correct me if I'm wrong).  I agree that Itemization sucks, but SoE wont invest the $$ into proper class/item balance when they can spend their money on making more money (like future expansions).  Then again you could just be trolling, looking for bait to get off on, in which case please gouge your eyes out and ignore my post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously. It's just not.<br />
<br />
I didn't like the idea. At all.<br />
<br />
You want to see what OTHER classes besides warriros think of it?<br />
<br />
Post it on other message boards. Like perhaps Monkly Business, where this whole thread started from.<br />
<br />
See if monks take a liking to your idea of improving warrior AC values to twice that of their already gimp state of AC.<br />
<br />
See if rogues really like the idea of allowing them to be even more useless in melee combat.<br />
<br />
OF COURSE warriors are going to like this idea. But see what everyone else thinks.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, continue to flame me for actually having an opinion. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, come on people. You cannot flame people for their opinions, that is the exclusive right of &quot;Superchum&quot;<br />
<br />
Not everyone that disagrees with your opinions is flaming you man, get over it.<br />
<br />
Your posts go just as far as most toward telling others their opinions suck.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't like the idea.<br />
<br />
I felt the idea did a disservice to one of the two classes I play.<br />
<br />
I expressed that opinion.<br />
<br />
And people continue to attack it, like their opinion has any MORE weight in the whole matter than mine does?<br />
<br />
Uh-huh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone that disagrees with your opinions is flaming you man, get over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are correct though. Most people who disagree with me are not flaming me.<br />
<br />
It's the ones who ARE flaming me that my comments were directed at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beekkool</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, I AM a rogue main, 65 levels and 132 AAs worth of Halfling Rogue (insert halfling rip here), and I would love to see warriors get a taunt upgrade.  I hate holding back my damage for any reason, and the MT not being able to taunt is a big one.<br />
<br />
As far as Monks and Rogues go, We need a DPS upgrade imo, to compensate for the lack of utility (so we can drag corpses, la dee freakin da, drag your own damn corpse you lazy bastards).   This is especially true for the non high end guild rogues and monks (ie pre Fen Ro, etc.)  There are other options but then we start stepping on the toes of other classes, but its based on Reliable Repeatable Utility assets (like giving rogues a triggered slow AA of 60%+, or monks a triggered mem blur AA for pulling).<br />
<br />
I prefer taking what we have and making it better, not taking what is the specialty of other classes.  Tho at this rate I expect SoE to give Rangers Shroud of Stealth, Pallies and SKs Defencive, and Bards a single targetable NPC summon from anywhere in the zone to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think alot of the balance issues could be fixed with implementing a few new AAs into the game<br />
<br />
The far biggest issue in my opinion when comming to warrior vs paladin/sk is ability to get fast agro. <br />
This could easy be fixed with a new warrior only AA. Range taunt. <br />
<br />
then they could put in a warrior only durability for further upgrading AC / Hp abit. <br />
<br />
For monks and rogues i think their problems is much more dps related than ac and hp to be honest. Since warriors is darn low on dps tables as well they might as well make a pure melee dps upgrade AA and put melee clases up where they belong in dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AA 'fixes' suck almost as much as itemisation fixes :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cuedyen2</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What they should do is reduce the hate given by hybrid spells. Not to zero, but it shouldnt be snap agro. The taunt button should be the best way to get agro. <br />
<br />
While this would fix warrior's as far as aggro goes, do you have any idea what can of worms you would be creating by letting hybrids cast without aggro worries?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When they're casting stuff like Cease and the piddly 20 mana SK snare, you don't really think they actually believe it will stick, do you? Why do you think most Paladins use Cease instead of Akilae?</div></div><hr />
