He warns virtual thieves: &quot;You can't run, you can't hide and they will find you.&quot;<br />

Okay i understand the concept but come on people it is just a game. I have had full accounts full of characters taken away from me but did i cry about it?! No i moved on with my life :p<br />
<br />
Jail time for this type of in game shyte is ludicrous. Get a GM get the player banned or the account banned completely, but to send someone to jail for ganking your l33t lewts is fricken st00pid!</div></div><hr />

Like a cleric said, you own NOTHING in EverQuest truthfully. You CAN sell your account, but it's not YOURS to sell.</div></div><hr />
