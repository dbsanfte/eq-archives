<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those that don't know Unyielding Stance is an Invulnerability tanker power that increases resitances to Smashing, Lethal, Knockback, Hold, Sleep, etc. but it also immobilizes you.  I've read a few posts on the official CoH message boards saying that US is the power to have.  I'm lvl 24 and I haven't taken it yet, I'm still very reluctant because of the immobilization portion.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with it and what they thought of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've had it for a few levels, and I find it quite handy.  There are particular mobs, such as the Tsoo ink men and ancestors that stun you frequently.  In unyielding stance this pretty much disappears.  The only time I've ever had a hold, stun, or knock back actually land was once a consigliere in Independence Port managed to land a hold on me, but he was extremely purple and it may have just been an extreme level difference that allowed him to do it.  And as I'm sure you know, that when you're stunned or held, your defenses drop meaning you take a lot more damage until you snap out of it.  Unyielding stance can have a huge impact on surviving encounters against these kind of mobs.<br />
<br />
If you have taunt and/or provoke, while in unyielding stance you can still quite handily do your group job of focusing the attention of the mobs on you.  The only problem you end up having is that sometimes your knock back attacks will knock a mob out of range and you end up having to wait for it to come back in range.  Or very occassionally a mob will hover just outside of your melee range, waiting on you to drop unyielding stance, but this is by far the exception.  And sometimes when a mob decides to beat feet and run from you, you'll have to risk dropping unyielding stance to chase them down, but normally that isn't too much of a problem.  And if you simply click off unyielding stance, or even just click temporary invulnerabilty on which will auto disengage unyielding stance, you can move immediately, although unyielding stance does have a bit of a refresh timer, so you should be sure that's really want you want to do first.<br />
<br />
Using unyielding stance I very easily will tackle a group of yellow tsoo ink men along with a light red ancestor and come out on top.  Without it, I very probably would be stunned so often that my defenses would be off more than they would be on and I'd probably have to run if I didn't get defeated altogether.  I really recommend that you get it at your earliest opportunity.  It can really make a major difference in certain encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Glatius, nice write up. :)<br />
<br />
I'll make sure I get it once I ding 26, grr seems so far away hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The tanker I pair up with regularly just got US at 24th (I think). He was very hesitant to get it for the reasons you say, but now that he has it, loves it. <br />
<br />
As a blaster I have, once or twice, gotten agro from somethign while he was imobile, but, thanks to years of EQ, I just dragged the mob to him and the next tuant he did (of what ever flavor) stuck it on him. It gets my vote of uberness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some tanks team it up with teleport, as currently you can port around the battle area, with the stance still on, and not lose too much mobility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got it early, love it - when you solo a lot (as I do) it really helps - as people have pointed out if you are stun/mezzed/held you loose the toggle defenses and start getting pasted.<br />
<br />
I don't have teleport - so soloing you gotta wait on the mobs coming back in range - or time dropping US so that you can hit them and hopefully they don't stun/mez you etc... again. Also note - before you drop US make sure you don't have a stun/mez/hold icon up - US doesn't actually stop the mez/hold etc... from landing - it just lets you stay able to attack etc... while the hold is on you - drop US with the effects still up and they immediately take effect which could be bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">US doesn't actually stop the mez/hold etc... from landing - it just lets you stay able to attack etc... while the hold is on you - drop US with the effects still up and they immediately take effect which could be bad <br />
<br />
Excellent point, I'd forgotten to mention that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks again for all the information everyone.<br />
<br />
US doesn't actually stop the mez/hold etc... from landing - it just lets you stay able to attack etc... while the hold is on you - drop US with the effects still up and they immediately take effect which could be bad <br />
<br />
That seems kind of weird to me.  US is supposed to increase your resistance to mez, hold, etc., correct?  If it increases your resistance it would make more sense for it to not even take hold on you, you should just resist it outright.  Could this possibly be a bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It could be a bug, but what actually seems to be happening is not that you have your resistance increased, but rather you're immune to the effects while US is up.  The effect still lands, the icon is still there, but it has no impact unless you drop US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kalorn stop talking about how good Unyeilding stance is and get back online and help me level up!<br />
<br />
 :eek: <br />
<br />
One of our tactics to use is if the tank has to AFK tell him/her to turn Unyeilding Stance on.. it has a small taunt value built in. Then we teleport him into the middle of a group of enemies. It's hilarious to see him appear in midair and fall in the middle of a gang of Crey soldiers and just stand there and take a beating while everyone else blasts away. Tank does his job and never presses a button lol</div></div><hr />
