<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hahn Highnote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that Anguish is supposed to be a fun reward for getting to the end zone of OoW, but does anyone else find the wide range of extremely awesome augments that are TRADEABLE to be a bit... ridiculous? For instance:<br />
<br />
Stone of Horrid Transformation (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47340) <br />
Rune of Grim Portents (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47337) <br />
Kyv Eye of Marksmanship (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47347) <br />
Rune of Futile Resolutions (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47341) <br />
Rune of Astral Celerity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47343) <br />
Gem of Unnatural Regrowth (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47339) <br />
Abhorrent Brimstone of Charring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47344) <br />
Stone of Planar Projection (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47342) <br />
Rune of Living Lightning (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47338) <br />
Orb of Forbidden Laughter (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47345) <br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, but this seems like a huge &quot;freebie&quot; to anyone who can enter the zone? I always envisioned original new items, not generic &quot;here's your effect, grats 90 hp/mana&quot;. <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just wrong though, and everyone in Anguish is loving it. And maybe it's because I'm a bard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">maybe it's a mistake!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably an oversight that they forget the no-drop flag.<br />
<br />
They also forgot to make them removable with distillers, so you cant remove them once you have inserted them into something.<br />
<br />
And since you have to be 18 people or more to start an Anguish instance, I doubt they will be acquired outside of guildraids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uh they are to good :( It's like, here, there's something everyone can use, we don't want to make new items. Original thoughts please? Really retarded  that ithey're so equal. People hardly have to think about what they loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh neat! Where are you, Timmok? Where in KBH, that is. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kbh NV, but at work atm :p<br />
<br />
As for the augs, I like them, managed to snag the 15 avoidance one last night. We got 5 total in 5 hours of raiding(full raid), but too early to say wether thats the normal drop rate or not. <br />
<br />
Moving between bosses is a bit like VT clearing, except the augs adds a bit of spice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Skovlunde, suburb ;)<br />
<br />
Hopefully the augs are as rare as you say. If they make them no drop, and reusable, it would be a lot better.<br />
<br />
Still they lack imagination sadly~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anguish is the end zone of OoW?<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does that seem incorrect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rigeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anguish is the end zone of OoW?<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does that seem incorrect?<br />
<br />
Why does that seem incorrect?  Its the only keyed zone.  Unless theres more zones off of Anguish (which doesnt seem right; it seems more like VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anguish is the end zone of Oow, according to lore and developers ;)<br />
<br />
I can only assume that the augments are supposed to be no drop.  It wouldn't suprise me if it was intended for them to be permanent, as opposed to removable with distillers.  But I guess we'll see.  It's not like these are going to hit the bazaar any time soon, but I'm still suprised there wasn't an emergency patch on CoA to make them no drop :p<br />
<br />
We got 11 augments in about 7 hours raiding, 2 were from mini named, 9 off trash.  I managed to snag one with regen/FT and stuck it on my belt, simply because they may never be reusable, so I put it in one of my better items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I understood OoW to be a relitively small expansion that mixed alot of previous expansions together. Has GoD's size, 2 tiers of quest armor like PoP, Luclin's Progression ideas, Faction quests like in Velius, New epics and level raise of Kunark, Instanced zones from GoD / LDoN, Loy wasnt really an expansion. <br />
<br />
And about mid GoD opening it was rumored that GoD wasn't beatable until OoW came out with new level raises ect. don't know if its true but would explain they small size of OoW. Luckily it has a pretty good amount of high level content. <br />
<br />
The CoA augs look greatly like a mistake, but you never know with sony. I like the idea of one time usable for the augs as it makes a person think before they throw it into something. But i agree it should be no drop. End zone loot should stay end zone loot not bazaar fodder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I gotta say I am surprised to hear Anguish is the end of OoW... kind of a small expansion geographically. The itemization is huge, but really not a lot of zones. They are good zones, I will admit, but still, I can't help feeling a little dissapointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kunark = 26 zones<br />
Velious = 17 zones<br />
Luclin = 28 zones<br />
Planes of Power = 22 zones<br />
Gates of Discord = 10 static zones/10 instanced<br />
Omens of War = 9 static zones, 3 instanced<br />
<br />
So yeah, OoW isn't a high zone count expansion.  Part of this is due to the fact that there are no cities and no low level zones.  What makes it seem even smaller though, is how fast people made it to the end zone.  Compared to PoP or GoD the time required to get to the expansion end game was very short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It appears that Monday evening they nerfed the drop rates so that the augments effectively no longer drop off trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It appears that Monday evening they nerfed the drop rates so that the augments effectively no longer drop off trash.<br />
<br />
Seems the same here :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Kunark = 26 zones<br />
Velious = 17 zones<br />

<br />
Interesting ... Velius sure felt bigger.<br />
Anyone know how many zones where in Legacy of Ykesha ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Only one, it had drogmors and dye ingredients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">pfft, that was barely an extension of that stonebrunt zone in odus :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Had 5 zones total. Gulf of Gunthak, Dulak's harbor, hates fury, torgsomething mines, Nadox. Any others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The issues with those augments (the no-drop tag) and solvent issue will be fixed next patch.<br />
<br />
They still drop off base pop NPCs, but not at a 100% frequency; that was a bug. As others have posted, you still get a good amount of augments per clearing, so it should help some in making the clear a little more worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">soe always represents expansion zone counts with all themem variations, hollows for instance is 4 zones.  LDoN was never marketed as a 5 zone expansion even tho it basically is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>feressa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It appears that Monday evening they nerfed the drop rates so that the augments effectively no longer drop off trash.<br />
They still drop off trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kimo_Sabbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Quick question, previously you would kill about 30-40ish mobs in the zone and the 1 groupable named/ph mobs would spawn. I went in with a group after the patch and after killing 75ish mobs the groupable named/ph mobs didn't spawn.<br />
<br />
Last night in the raid they did. I am assumming that now they are triggered by two things 1. Number of people in the zone/expedition and 2. Number of mobs killed. Has anyone had them spawn for them recently with 1 group in anguish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It appears with the most recent Anguish patch that you need 18 people in zone to trigger the aug droppers and augments no longer drop off trash (again).<br />
<br />
-Belanar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>clotVS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We've been to CoA three times now post patch with a raid and a handfull of times with a goup - both raid/group....not one random aug off trash...think they over nerfed this a tad.<br />
