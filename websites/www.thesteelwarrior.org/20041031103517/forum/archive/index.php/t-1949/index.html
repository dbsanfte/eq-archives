<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does the proc with Wavecrasher add aggro even if a higher level slow is on the mob?<br />
<br />
Say for instance, a shaman is slowing, and I'm using Wavecrasher... when it procs I get the message: &quot;You spell did not take hold&quot;. Do I still get aggro for this proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Minowara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There has been much controversy surrounding the topic, but I use a wavecrasher. Comming from a first-hand source, it does. Example: Engage mob, 3 secs later, slow lands and shaman gets aggro, 2 secs later wavecrasher procs 2 times in rapid succession and mob us glued to me for the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Resisted/non-effective procs still generate aggro, madam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Minowara<br />
<br />
I also used a Wavecrasher, it is a great aggro weapon, and a loss of DPS of course.<br />
<br />
As for proc goes, as long as it procs, doesn't matter what happens, you get aggro, that simple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i have  a wavecrasher - resisted procs still get me aggro but the &quot;your spell does not take hold&quot; procs dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used a wavecrasher for over a year, and Gulug I can say with absolute certainty that you are wrong. &quot;does not take hold&quot; still generates aggro with absolute certainty.. however the amount of aggro of course is impossible to determain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never liked this weapon, and still dont. If you are not playing with a slower it does ok for agro, if you are playing with a slower I always preffered a frostbringer. I in fact have always preferred the Frosty over the wavecrasher whether I have a slower in group or not. Frosty is better ratio too, and is a heck of alot cheaper than the Wavecrasher to purchase ( Frosty is 5k on my server while Wavecrasher can be up to 20k ).<br />
I also never liked that the wavecrasher is PRIMARY only.<br />
My opinion is to sell the Wavcrasher for 20k, buy a Frostbringer for 5k and buy a Black Blade of Tormenting for 300pp ( also better agro than the Wavecrasher ever was ) and have lots of money left over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was actually about to post something about this.<br />
<br />
I purchased WC for 25k thinking it would be a great agro weapon.<br />
<br />
I constantly group with a sham and after he slows I can get agro back but it takes a while and a proc with result message (Does not take hold) does not ALWAYS get me agro. In fact most of the time is does not.<br />
<br />
I personally feel, IF a proc that does not hold still generate agro then it is very very small.<br />
<br />
One thing is for sure, you are not getting slow or dot agro when your WC procs on a mob that is slowed. And quite honestly once you into 30s most likely your mob will always be slowed while you are in a group.<br />
<br />
Overall - Wavecrasher is a very limited weapon that if you have to pay more than 2k for it you are paying too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have owned just about every weapon de'jour for the last 2 years and I can say with all honesty that the Wavecrasher disappointed me the most. While a &quot;did not take hold&quot; proc DOES generate some agro, it's nothing near the agro of a resisted proc or landing a slow. If you have a slower in the group the proc is basically negated - it's just short of worthless. Couple that with the 9/19 ratio and you are not even making any DPS to generate agro.<br />
<br />
The only reason I would ever recommend this weapon to anyone is if you don't have access to a ToD and you hunt without a slower frequently. This weapon amounts to a Lammy with a situationally useful proc at about 10x the price.<br />
<br />
If you need agro weapons and you are on a budget, sell this while it still fetches 20k+ and get one of any number of stun procing weapons, you will not be disappointed.</div></div><hr />
