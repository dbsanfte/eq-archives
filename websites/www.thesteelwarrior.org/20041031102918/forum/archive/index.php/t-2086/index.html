I been using mine fore MONTHS...and have yet to encounter another warrior with one.  They are cheap in the Bazaar, yet no one uses em.<br />

<br />
Then one night i stumble in drunk(and alone, lol) and im like, &quot;Oh, I wonder how my little trader in the bazaar is doing&quot;.  Of course no one bought anything.  Then I went to pass out and thought id check the prices on greatstaves again.  Ended up buying mine for 4500 with others priced at 5000, 6000, 8000 and 10000.  They are all back up to 15-25k again now though, and oddly enough the same vendors who were selling them for 6000 and 8000 shot theirs up to 25k  *scratches head*<br />
<br />
I dunno why, but baz is flooded with them for the last 3 days.  Ive yet to run into another warrior with one in all my travels.  The bazaar the 3 weeks before this never even had one for sale except now and then some guy tried selling his for 75,000.<br />
<br />
Who knows, they might become like weighty polearms soon and sell for 20pp :)  Okay, well not really...</div></div><hr />

Not sure wtf is going on, whether they adjusted drop rate or what, but something funny has happened in the last 10 days or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Probably has to do with the new stun proccing weapons out of Droga and Chardok B as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No flags = many many more people in BoT/HoH.  This has resulted in Nightly pickup raids of these zones and in turn the market as plumeted because supply out weighs demand.  I hope they re-adjust it to be more in line with the rate at wich these NPC's are getting taken down.  When they adjusted the drop rate it was before the flags where removed and there was not an influx of people with access to the zone forming pickup raids and dropping these NPC's every day.<br />
<br />
If they do not, ornate armor will be a mandatory upgrade for all people who break level 60 and have a small amount of platinum to spend.  Heh, for this reason I am gonna stick with Crusty/Cobalt untill level 60 on my new warrior. =)</div></div><hr />

Has to do with the random named dropping loot every single kill now, instead of once in 20 or whatever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I see the prices drop on the weekend like crazy.  Thinking its the folks that usually exp group getting these items that are selling em low.  They are usually out exp grinding and dont really want to stay too long in /trader mode.  So they set their prices sky low and hope someone buys it.<br />
<br />
Also a lot of warriors I come accross have never heard of the item.  A lot of them have never heard of steelwarrior either though :confused: .  Been trying to spread the word and such.<br />
<br />
Friend told me they nerfed it too, but I dont see much of a difference.  Was thinking it might have something to do with the stun effect pushing mobs back?  I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh yeah, Ive got a question to ask.  I hate to start a new thread for something so simple so I figure ill ask here.<br />
<br />
Does the GoT proc at 55 or 56?   Hehe, i just dinged 55 two days ago after a 14 hour stretch of exping and I dont think ill be logging in anytime soon to test it since I want a break.  If anyone knew offhand that would be great, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was interesting I saw immediately after Chardok B/Droga price go from 40k to 20/18k on Fennin Ro.  But over the weekend prices really collapsed some guy was selling for 3800pp last night.<br />
<br />
Very strange...I have not seen a nerf...used it extensively in exp groups over the weekend.  Perhaps they are dropping more frequently (although I hunted BoT all weekend and saw little change in loot drops) or perhaps people really don't know what it can do.  <br />
<br />
Irony was I told a warrior friend to buy one (he was complaining he did not own a decent agro weapon earlier in the night) and he wasn't interested in GSOT even at 3800pp.  /boggle<br />
<br />
Side note: if they don't tune ornate drops a bit in sol ro we gonna have some nice mudflation there...I'd see ornate prices dropping in half over next month on my server if trend continues....not that i think thats a bad thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ok i haven't been to baz in 4ever so i pray they at like 8k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I bought one and sold one for 25k after getting epic. Was actually thinking of saving up for another till I saw one for 5.5k. <br />
<br />
An incredible weapon for the price now; good dps and aggro all rolled into one. Unless I get an epic proc at start of fight, easier to get aggro too. <br />
<br />
Amazing as it is, there are still plenty of wariors running around with Fleshgrinders or non proccing duel wield weapons at 65 on the nameless.....Yet everyone I recommended the staff to has been very pleased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually it has everything to do with Solusek Ro being an older server and overcamped. Somebody is usually killing something if it's worthwhile (IE Plat). It's simple economics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They are still 28000 here, I bought one last night :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">On Solusek Ro, prices on the WMBS, GSoT, Windblade, etc are all dropping like mad over the past two weeks.  I saw several GSoT and WMBS for 10k or less over the weekend, and countless for 15k or less.  The windblades were all 33k minimum last week, and I saw several at 28k range over the weekend.  I almost picked up a WMBS for 10k and sold my windblade, but I am not sure that the WMBS is really better and selling windblades can be tedious.  Then again if they are comparable, I could net a good 20k on the switch. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, I bought mine 4 months ago when they were really really rare.  Worth every cent of the 40k I spent on it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">6k on xeg. BoT has been ruined for pretty much everyone cept the previously contained PoV retards who now inhabit the zone 24/7 and train the shit out of it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Did they up the droprate on em? I have never seen one :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's not just old servers that are having a severe price drop.<br />
It's simple supply and demand. Before they opened up BoT, they were fairly rare. Not that everyone and their cousin can get in, they are much more common. Couple that with the habit people have of undercutting the lowest price in the bazaar and you get a very fine weapon at a rock bottom price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">to anwer the guys ealrier question... yes it procs at lvl 55, but i am not sure if it is same proc rate.<br />
<br />
Was in a group in BoT with tank using GSot and procced all the time, i used it on my twink and his procced liek twice a fight =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've been checking for a GSoT EVERY time I've been in the bazaar for several months. I saw one for sale...once...for 60k, it sold before I logged and I haven't seen one since. Until last weekend. one popped on at 40k, then another for 35k, there were 4 up when I borrowed some pp from a friend and bought mine for 29k. By sunday they were down to 18k lowest, and there were 8 up.<br />
<br />
It was like everyone who was using a GSoT found an upgrade at the same time and decided to sell theirs, it was crazy. When I compare agro-generation being MA in PoV with my Tae Ew 2hander versus the GSoT, I can easily say it was worth paying 29k for...but damn I wish I would have held off for 2 days =/<br />
<br />
A weapon of this quality becoming affordable is very, VERY nice for those of us who don't have the time / forces to go get one ourselves.<br />

Found a greatstaff of thunder in the bazaar for the first time ever...35k.  Bought it instantly.  Next day, I got my Sceptre of Destruction.  Day after that I got my Copper Hammer of Striking off the King,  Day after that I got a Blade of Carnage.  Today I put the Greatstaff up for sale and there's already one in the bazaar for 15k.  I sure hope i'm not gonna eat 20k on a weapon I used for 1 day and owned for like 3.</div></div><hr />

I guess this is our taunt fix in action. I suppose it's SoE's idea of a joke to balance us by making stun-proccing weapons drop like mad, but whatever.</div></div><hr />

I figure that's why you don't see more warriors using them. Word of mouth will spread around what the best aggro weapons are...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're in the minority, and you're also using a BoC.  Of course your expectations for weapons are higher.<br />
<br />
It's not gonna out aggro a BoC, SoD or anything like that.  But what it does do is provide excellent aggro control for warriors for under 300k...something which up until the droga revamp was needed.</div></div><hr />

soooo, i'm guessing they shot the drop rate through the friggin roof. and will most likely fix it at a later time. i'd suggest getting got's on your alts at this time.  look at how much they ganked around the fungi drop rate.<br />

If nothing else its a decent way to make cash before the price drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">OMG saw one for 3.5k this weekend in bazaar.  There were like 8-10 of em being sold all at once.  That Copper Hammer weapon is dropping in price as well.  I think Im gonna grab a few buddies and run over to that area and get one myself.  People can prob farm these, but I think its a pain in the arse.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Caalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Picked up one on Tunare for 4.8k last night. I love it. Went to a pov group and while the mob would run initially to the chanter or shammy for slow and tash it didnt take me long to get it off of them. Procs seemed kinda sporadic at 265 dex tho, some fights it procced like mad, others were farther in between. guess I was just a little unlucky hehe but overall I love it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Largic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">2 weeks from now, GSoT-50pp.<br />
<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Woo! <br />
Found one for 5k this weekend and was able to pick it up.<br />
<br />
Went from 50 2HB to 170+2HB over the course of the weekend... Also was MA in Halls of Testing for a good part of sunday never losing Aggro.<br />
<br />
Probably the single best 5k I've spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Bought one for 3Kpp to put on a twink. The going price on The Nameless was around 6Kpp, but I got it from a guildmate.<br />
<br />
Just for reference, I bought the one my warrior is using for about 30Kpp about three months back.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they're this inexpensive, since they're a great taunting weapon, but I agree that the drop rate in BoT seems whack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">This was happening to the Windblade a while back.  Maybe they want all higher lvls to use the GSoT at least once.  Quick fix maybe?  Then again, that Droga fix might be worth looking into as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Just picked mine up for 3k! Wooties!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Thundarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Low of 3400, high of 17.5k on AB today....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Sorry to re-start this post, but GSoT hit 1800 on Veeshan.  Next lowest was 2k.  I snatched it up, because despite my better judgement, I get this eerie feeling something's up with it.  Besides, I can carry it around and let guildies borrow it for a short while to convert them. ^_^<br />
<br />
On another note, it almost seems like NONE of the warriors I've ever grouped with even know what this is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">All time low on the nameless of 1.1k for this weapon.<br />
<br />
Yes the pricing has gone to hell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Friend of mine got one on Tarew for 3900 last night.  I expect the CHoS/SotB to be similarly priced soon.  So much for the weapon market.  It's a good thing for warriors in general, but if you had an expensive droppable weapon to sell well, it's probably near wortless now if it's not a BoC.  I think even SoD prices will probably go through the floor now.  They are certainly better than the other 3 weapons, but most people are going to say hmm, 200k for an SoD or 8k for a CHoS.  Seems like an easy decision to me :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Kremib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I picked mine up for 7k on the Rathe this past weekend. Although my 2hb was way down (it is rising fast). I still like the results so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Bought mine for 2k a couple days ago :D:D:D:D /hug Mudflation<br />
all are around 5k-12k now on tmarr.. idk how i found someone selling one for 2k :D All i can say is.. wow.. awesome aggro, used to use Frostbringer/Yak Proccing or Frostreaver to this, and holding aggro through 2 resisted slows and 1 landed slow and a wizard chain nuking.. fun! Almost felt like a paladin :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Yroc Morf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Seen 3 for sale on TP last week .. 900 pp each</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I've seen em for 2k, though I bought mine last week for 4.5k :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Picked one up for 3500 on Povar a week ago. Could care less if I see it for 1k now...best plat I ever spent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>bigguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">makes me want to kick myself how fast the prices are dropping. I heard all these great things about it and about a month or so ago, i saw one for 20k, 5k cheaper than id ever seen it, so i bought it. Prices promptly dropped out after i blew my nest egg :P<br />
Little patience would have saved me 15k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Lol, seen one for 1500 pp on Terris this week, usually around 3k now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I paid 4k for mine a week ago. Saw one in bazaar for 800 Monday.  Don't get me wrong, it was worth the money I paid for it, but losing that much cash for nothing makes me sad.   Then, not losing aggro every 3 seconds in xp groups cheers me back up quickly enough. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I bought a GSoT for 900 plat on Innoruuk a few days ago. It's a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Sure Tug. Rub it in. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Friend of mine had to rub my nose in it when he won roll on one today. Oh did I mention he's a Cleric? /groan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Yah know i'm actually kinda upset that the prices dropped so quickly due to the amount being out there...that means EVERY warrior is gonna own one which kinda sucks because its nice having things be rare and somewhat unique...oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Peddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I paid 1200 for mine a weeks time ago, when I was still 53 :P Of course I'm glad they're cheap because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get mine, but it's still sad that PoP/Ykesha items drop in value THAT fast...makes it kinda pointless to farm items, doesn't it? (Not that I can...I earn 50pp a level too :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Bought a GSoT on The Seventh Hammer a couple days ago for 2k. There were 3 or 4 for sale &lt; 4k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">On Cazic, they are running about 4-5k, havent seen one under yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Tudaddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Bought one of these today on Tarew Marr for 500 :mad:</div></div><hr />
