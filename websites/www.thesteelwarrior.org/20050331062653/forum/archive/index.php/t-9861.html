<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, alot has changed since I stopped playing closed beta and I'm kinda hesitant about my talents.  Does anyone have or have a link to some good talent build information that is current?  I want to build a defensive/tank PvE warrior that still has decent soloability.  I'm 17 atm and those unused talent points are starting to bug me ;-P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's what I can tell you so far.<br />
<br />
Parry &gt; Block.  For 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1.  Parry requires melee weapon.  Block requires shield.  So if you go 2h, you still benefit from parry.<br />
<br />
2. Parry absorbs the entire hit, Block only absorbs as much as the block rating from your shield + some modifier for strength.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm going straight defensive until I see a reason to do otherwise.  Soloability appears to increase with weaponry.  Going from a 7.6 dps sword to an 8.6 dps axe is just fuckin huge on the soloability scale, at least from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />

Once you hit 60, assuming you get into a raid type guild, you'll want to respec to a more defensive route. I only suggest doing this if you'll be in a tanking position. Most of the time, you'll have 1-3 &quot;main tanks&quot;. the rest are just damage and slight backup tanking. the above setup is fine for that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the talent builds i see are just for when their level 60 doesn't say what order to get them in when they level up so Ninjaburger i appreciate your post. You or anyone else wouldn't have a similiar style model for a defensive warrior? One who plans on grouping/duoing 90% of the time and wants to be a tank in particular who wants to use sword and board?<br />
<br />
My setup so far is only (in order)<br />
<br />
Shield spec 5 (wishing i had done deflection first though) *where im atm<br />
Toughness 5<br />
Improved shield block 3 (im thinking i want to get lvl 1 of this not sure about lvl 3)<br />
Deflection 5<br />
Ancipiation 5<br />
<br />
That about where i have planned too... this whole talent thing is driving me bonkers though, i know you can respec but its expensive at my low lvl of 15 heh. From playing a SK in EQ this time i want to go best tank, often times i hated the fact that I could never equal a warrior so i want to lean really heavy on defense even throughout my leveling up period where so many other warriors (seems like 99% of ones on teh wow forums and such) are going offensive for pvp or soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does SORTA have an order, but as I stated, it wasn't mine originally....<br />
<br />
But just go for the second profile if you're going to be grouping a lot more than soloing.</div></div><hr />

What is the penalty/limitations on respecing?  I haven't tried it in retail yet and in beta it was free.</div></div><hr />

1 gold for the first respec, and it scales up to 50 gold....How? I'm not 100% sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Closed beta player here.  The build I'm going is totally PVE, with a focus on instance tanking.  I pretty much never solo so I focus on making sure I have the aggro while taking as little damage as possible.  Level 29 now so I guess not doing too bad after 6 days.<br />
<br />
Here's the template:<br />
http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=9010<br />
<br />
Basically I go protection first until concussive blow.  Stuns are huge so I want that skill first. <br />
<br />
Anticipation - 5<br />
Toughness - 5 <br />
Improved Revenge - 3 (HUGE)<br />
Defiance - 2<br />
Improved Taunt - 2<br />
Defiance - 5<br />
Concussive Blow - 1 (HUGE)<br />
<br />
At this point you've got some choices...go arms and get the ability to switch stances easier (along with slower rage decay), or continue on to the shield wall/shield discipline talents.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of this template, we fought van cleef two nights ago for a friend.  I was tanking VC while the rest of the group took on the guards.... well, opening strike was parried so I instantly revenged.  Blam, stunned.  Activate shield block just as stun wears off then hit him with revenge as soon as he swings.  Well, I got 4 stuns in a row ultimately so VC was totally taken out of the fight for at least the first 30 seconds.  Our priest ended the fight with about 85% mana (after nuking and dotting).<br />
<br />
Did the same thing last night on the hydra at the end of blackfathom depths.  Stunned the heck out of it.  Right now our fixed group has a good combo of rogue opening with cheap shot (stun) to give me time to build rage.  At the end of that stun I taunt + sunder, and then revenge as it pops up.  Aggro stays on me the entire fight with very little effort and the mob is stunned a good chunk of the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gazarion</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading from indalamar (a warrior veteran for WoW) view on warrior www.nurfed.com, rage is crucial to keep aggro and perform dps wise, and in order to build aggro you need to dish out damage and take damage. Thus, if you focus heavily on protection, you end up taking less damage and also deal less, wich lower you're rage build up by a lot. It's actually easier to keep aggro on several mob at once, than keeping aggro on only one, since when you're getting beaten on by multiple mob, you're rage build very fast and you can mash dps and taunt skills.<br />
<br />
Protection seem fine, but not really that better than arms build, in a way yes, you end up taking less damage, but you might lose aggro more easily causing dps class to take damage and making the healer spend more mana overall. Although, taunt seem to work relatively fine now, from most of the post i've read, a protection build is still not required to tank high level and certainly not better while leveling.<br />
<br />
According to indalamar, a arms build is still prefered for PVP or PVE, since it brings more versatility than a protection build that is only good for PVE tanking instances. If you solo at all, you wont be successful with a protection build either.<br />
<br />
Here's is my planned build, mostly based on indalamar and other high level warrior.<br />
<br />
arms<br />
Improved Rend - 3/3 (dps)<br />
Deflection - 2/5 (defence)<br />
Tactical Mastery - 5/5    (So far at my level, i hardly ever change stance, so i guess it could be better not to take it, and do a re-spec later on) (to keep rage)<br />
Anger Management - 1/1 (to keep rage)<br />
Deep Wound - 3/3 (dps)<br />
Impale - 2/2 (dps)<br />
Improved Overpower - 2/2 (dps)<br />
Two Hand Spec - 5/5 (dps)<br />
Sweeping Strikes - 1/1 (dps + AE taunt)<br />
Weapon Spec - 5/5 (in my case axe, although most war prefer to put harmstring and boost deflection, improved charge, etc, this way it doenst force you to a specific weapon type) (dps if weapon spec)<br />
Deflection - 3/5 (defence)<br />
Mortal Strikes - 1/1 (dps)<br />
<br />
Furry<br />
Cruelty - 5/5 (dps)<br />
Unbridle Wrath - 4/5 (to build rage)<br />
Improved Demo Shout - 5/5 (to AE taunt)<br />
Piercing Howl - 1/1 (to AE taunt)<br />
Enrage - 5/5 (dps)<br />
<br />
It should be a good versatile build until you're 60, at which point you can re-spec to be more defensive if you're the guild tank for PVE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think that build is overrated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heleron</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  So far I do not regret putting points into protection, it allows me to take less damage when I solo and I can easily swap out of battle/defense while fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of me wants to go protection.  Then the other part wants to go insane Berserker Warrior and just jack up points in Fury! Hehe.  But I'm going the middle road now, basically going to do about 30 arms then 20 or so in protection.  May change though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think that build is overrated.<br />
<br />
Why? I'm interested in hearing about how you do solo and in PVP with a Protection build.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm heading down the Arms/Fury spec on the way to Mortal Strike.<br />
<br />
I've found that I'm able to act as main tank in PvE instances (at least up to my current level of 26) when I need to and still manage to solo effeciently.<br />
<br />
Respec only will cost me 1g the first time so I'm not hesitant to change if I find myself falling back in utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite popular belief, the game does not revolve around PVP.  Who said anything about going pure Protection either?  I said that build is overrated, people put too much emphasis on a Fury/Arms build.  You don't have to be either pure damage or pure tanking, although you can be if you wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you don't? how will being mediocre at both help anybody?<br />
<br />
serious question, I'm curious what build(s) you think would be viable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always wanted to be a champion of mediocrity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not like people can tell you're generating 5% less aggro because you don't have the +aggro talent from defense.  Like in EQ where you can always lie about your HP if people actually ask you such things, nothing's stopping you from lying about what talents you have, as long as you're not lying about stuff that can actually be observed (i.e. you claim to have concussive blow but never use it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently I'm also a champion of mediocrity also, Haass.  Considering there's statements that you can do just fine without any protection talents, I fail to see how anyone can consider a warrior a mediocre tank with some protection talents rather than none.  I'm more middle-of-the-road style, although that might change as a hit higher levels and do different things, you never know.  PvP is not the end-all activity of the game, thank god.  I wouldn't even be considering this game if it was.  I never played Starcraft/Warcraft online against the BNet kiddies, and I won't be PvPing here either.  Seems too much like just another &quot;bigger dick&quot; contest.<br />
<br />
The basic build I'm going for includes (not a full list):<br />
<br />
Fury:<br />
Cruelty Rank 5 <br />
Improved Demoralizing Shout Rank 5 <br />
Piercing Howl Rank 1 <br />
<br />
Protection:<br />
Anticipation Rank 5 <br />
Iron Will Rank 5 (or Iron Will 3 and Toughness 2, etc)<br />
Improved Revenge Rank 3 <br />
Defiance Rank 4 <br />
Improved Sunder Armor Rank 3 <br />
Concussion Blow Rank 1 <br />
<br />
Arms:<br />
Deflection Rank 5 <br />
Improved Rend Rank 3 <br />
Tactical Mastery Rank 5 <br />
Deep Wounds Rank 3 <br />
<br />
<br />
Which still leaves me with 3 pts open to put into Impale, Shield Bash, Shield Wall, Unbridled Wrath, 2handed, Toughness, or whatever I feel like when I get up that high, depending on how I perform with it up until then.  I could also shift some things around to get different things instead as I level, such as Toughness instead of full Iron Will, Unbridled wrath instead of Sunder Armor, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
And like people have said...I can always respec if I change my mind later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I would hate PVP too coming from EQ where warriors were just a laughing stock vs. just about anything with a mana bar and knights/bards ruled the roost.<br />
<br />
In WoW however PVP is more of a balanced affair and group PVP is encouraged. When battlefields come out I look forward to being able to vegetate with guildmates in a &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; type game after a long raid.<br />
<br />
You don't have to be a griefer or a e-peen waving l337 d00d to enjoy some PVP.<br />
<br />
Something's gotta give though. If going down the arms/fury spec is going to make me a liability and not an asset to my guild's raids then I will respec into a weaker PVP/solo template. Right now I am enjoying myself solo, tank well for instances, and look forward to having some sort of chance in group PVP.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know. Shamans and Paladins make warriors cry. What can I do? I'm a warrior, I deal with what I have and hope that Blizzard corrects absurd overpowered classes/talent specs later and greets them with &quot;awesome changes (tm)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I set Ninjaburger's sig, tiled, as my windows wallpaper on a 21&quot; monitor.  Then my brain exploded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After perusing everything posted here I think Kalidor's PvE Instance Tank build comes the closest to fitting me.  The only part of the build I didn't like was going for Anger Management.  I'd be interested in hearing your reason for going after this.  In my experience the only time I have excess rage to hold on to is when I'm using dual wield to puree lower level mobs, and obviously in that situation I don't need the rage enough to spend talent points to hold it.  I almost never leave a fight with excess rage unless my final hit crits.  DURING a fight I never have more than 30 rage, and this is only when saving to renew Battle Shout, otherwise its 25, always 10 rage in reserve for shield bashing casters or hamstringing runners, and nothing I use except Battle Shout costs more than 15 rage, if I have 25+ rage in a battle I immediately throw it into a sunder, shield block, revenge, or heroic strike.<br />
<br />
So I took that build, reworked it ever so slightly by reducing Tactical Mastery to 2nd level(just enough to switch to Battle and Hamstring a runner) and redistributing those four points into Improved Sunder(a skill I use ALOT) and filling out Shield Specialization.  I named this build PvE Instance Tank - Stuns, Shields, Sunder (http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=9979) and gave Kalidor credit for the original design.<br />
<br />
Finally, while playing with the Talent Calculator a made another build of my own called PvE Instance Tank - Stuns, Interrupts, Sunder (http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=9986) with a lean more towards utility and effects.  Not seeing as much value in Shield Discipline, Shield Specialization, or One-Handed Weapon Specialization, I moved points over to Fury for Improve Demoralizing Shout and Piercing Howl.  I then made the final five points of the build a tossup for the user between One-Handed Weapon Specialization, Shield Specialization, Booming Voice, or Unbridled Wrath depending on taste.  One thing that would solidify my view on this build, which was kind of a whim, is the difference between daze and stun, I'm just not sure I really understand what &quot;dazing&quot; a mob accomplishes.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm planning on using the build thats only a slight modification of Kalidor's, with the second one being something I may play around with at the higher levels when the respecing cost isn't too painful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daze, from what I can tell and have read, reduces movement rate by 50%. Personelly, I would recommend Piercing Howl to everyone as it is useful for soloing, grouping and PvP.  <br />
<br />
Soloing it pretty much replaces hamstring for me.  It is also useful as a get away tool when you get to many mobs on you, from adds or other wise.  Piercing howl dazes all of them then run till they leash, bandage up and go at it again.  Since it is AoE, you don't have to individually target each mob or something like you would with Hamstring.<br />
<br />
Grouping, like soloing, I use Piercing Howl to keep runners from taking off a high rate of speed.  It is useable in all stances so you don't have to switch out of defensive stance like you would with Hamstring. On multi mob pulls Piercing Howl is AoE aggro and keeping all the mobs dazed gives you more time to react when 1 takes off for a robe wearing class.<br />
<br />
For PvP... 50% movement reduction &gt; 30%, 35% or 40%(Hamstring 1,2,3).</div></div><hr />

It just doesn't work like that tho.  I noticed this weekend when we were using shammy snare totem to get away from shit we didn't want to fight, that they'd follow us even further than normal.  I mean, no shit, I had an elder bear run fucking halfway across hillsbrad on my buddy's ass.  No snare totem...no problem.<br />
<br />
Same shit happens with Hamstring and Intimidating shout.  There's just no way I'd spend points on an ability who's primary use (for me anyway) would be to escape, when it doesn't provide that ability.</div></div><hr />

Use it just once to get the lead on the mob, then stop dropping totems.  Each time you drop a totem it aggros the mob, refreshing the timer on the aggro.  Drop one, run, keep running.</div></div><hr />

I haven't noticed that mobs will follow you farther if dazed or hamstrung or whatever.  I'll have to check that out tonight.  That said the primary reason I got it was for grouping in instances as another AoE aggro ability.  Thus far thru 3 instances(Deadmines, Stockages, Gnomergan) it has server me well.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me explain.  WoW is not EQ, between fights you heal very quickly and very easily.  Fights are also much faster than in EQ.  If you can tank sufficiently without taking any protection talents then why spend points on them?  In EQ you would still want to defend better so your healer could conserve mana more across fights, etc.  In WoW that is not an issue.  Really there is no reason whatsoever to put talents into protection.  Putting points into arms/fury will significantly and noticable increase your levelling solo and group over going defensive.<br />
<br />
Now, I will ammend my statement that at level cap in raiding there might be situations where you really kind of need protection talents so by all means respec at level cap...but I see no reason to gimp yourself for 59 levels to save the 1-50g of a respec.</div></div><hr />

Everything you said is opinion.  I love my protection warrior and I kill fast enough that I don't see the need to give up the extreme utility that I have with my current spec.  Maybe, if I didn't always group, I would consider going all out fury and arms talents, but thats not the way I like to play and to infer that such a build is &quot;gimp&quot; is pretty insulting, especially when you have no basis to make such comments.</div></div><hr />

I like Piercing Howl.  Seems really nice to be able to slow down mobs shortly after they get to the group so you have more of a chance to handle them.  Plus, people are saying it's a great agro tool.  You could get it at level 20 if you went straight for it.</div></div><hr />

Not possible, you can never kill fast enough. :)  <br />

No actually not everything I said was opinion.  If you compare the dps's of a good dps build vs a good protection build the dps build will significantly out perform the protection build.  If you compare the tanking ability of a healer + protection tank vs same healer + dps build tank...the dps build tank usually outperforms the protection tank in tanking as well.  The reason being is healing between fights doesn't matter...dps ends up mattering more than defense to some extent.<br />
<br />
Look at it from a theoretical standpoint.  If I spec 100% dps as a warrior and I am unable to tank effectively then I have gimped myself.  Blizzard cannot allow this, therefore no matter your spec you have to be able to tank effectively by design.  So what does improving your tanking ability get you?  In WoW, nothing...just eat a food after the fight and you're back to full...improving your dps will help however as you will finish fights faster, have more rage for more ability use, agro, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />

For those great fights that are pull 1 monster and kill it and then rest and then pull another one, and rinse and repeat then maybe, a dps build might out perform a protection build.   :)   I've watched warriors that are dps build using 2handers die to two or more mobs since they have low armor and nothing to prevent damage.    :)  Taking a protection build, I can easily keep 1 mob almost permanently knocked out of the fight with stuns while absorbing alot of the incoming damage with shield block.  :)  <br />
<br />
Looking at it from a duo standpoint, me being able to maintain aggro while doing damage and locking something down allows my wife (the priest) to open up dps earlier and not have to worry about healing unless we have a 4 or 5 pull. :)  <br />
<br />
Just because you don't see the value of protection talents, doesn't give you the right to call them gimp.   :)   I don't care if you were fucking the lead designers wife for 3 years, you are basing your &quot;facts&quot; off of assumptions on a build that you haven't played to its fullest extent.  :)</div></div><hr />

Oh, and bravo for waving the &quot;I was a closed beta player&quot; flag.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pardon me if there seems to be some confusion, but I don't think anyone actually specified when they would be using these talent trees, all I see is an argument about whether offensive or defensive is better. Anything before level 60 is irrelivent, I could care less what you do until then, so we might as well assume the warrior is level 60 when comparing talent trees.<br />
<br />
If you look at the big picture, a lot of people will be raiding, whether it's casual or hardcore your job as a warrior is to tank. Chances are you will be going defensive talents, or atleast a majority of them. If your whole theory is just to deliver so much DPS that the mob just keels over while it only delivers minimal damage to you, then there's about four other classes that I can garantee are better at doing so than a warrior. <br />
<br />
I don't care if you played closed beta for months, I played EQ for five plus years (many of them raiding high end content), and I don't recall our warrior ever using an offensive disc when tanking a mob you need fifty or so people to kill. You know why? Because it wasn't their job, their job was to just stay alive. If you want to go offensive talents until level 60, then by all means do so (that's what I'm doing), but don't forget the purpose of your class. Anything you have that can resist, mitagate, or lower the damage of the mob your tanking will be needed when the mobs are swinging for big numbers. <br />
<br />
Now remember, this is coming from a PvE point of view and it just seems silly that someone could just totally dog on a whole skill tree after how long the game has been out. If you're talking PvP, that's a totally different story, but as I recall they didn't actually release any high end raid content in Closed Beta, so why not just give it some time before forming opinions about a whole talent tree being totally worthless compared to another.</div></div><hr />

I'm torn between all 3 trees, as all of them offer something worth having in all the tiers of each tree.<br />
<br />
Are the abilities in the protection tree (such as revenge and concussion blow) only usable in defensive stance? I was browsing the wowvault for warrior talent builds, and this (http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=11191) build caught my eye. It looks good on paper, but i've only played a warrior up to level 16 in the first stress test. As for race, i'd probably end up playing as a tauren for the added war stomp.<br />
<br />
If you think a PvP warrior wouldn't really be worth striving for or wouldn't do that well alone or in groups, i'm also interested in playing as a hunter.</div></div><hr />

At the end of closed beta I could tank groups of elites just fine as well with no points in protection.  That's exactly my point, it is simply not needed.  Warriors biggest problems (post end of beta change) are rage generation, not tanking.  And your rage will suffer with a protection build.  If you are enjoying the protection build then by all means play it, but I will say the same thing here that I said in eq when I talked about the ac cap...when you realize I am right down the road, remember this conversation. :)<br />

a) I have the right to call anything I want gimp just as you have the right to disagree with me.<br />
b) Instead of making up what I base my opinions on I suggest you actually read my post.  Crunch some #s yourself if you don't believe me, its pretty simple math to see that I am correct.<br />

I was not waving any such flag, the other posted questioned the basis for my statements and I was answering her.<br />
<br />
Frankly the biggest problem I have with the changes is they simply do not do what blizzard wanted.  Post change I could still tank multiple mobs just damn fine and in fact single mobs were harder than pre-change...which is the opposite of their stated goal.<br />
<br />
Personally, it seems to me to be more of a detriment to have played in closed beta.<br />

Honest I am not trying to be antagonistic here, so let me appologize for that.<br />
<br />
I should also clarify because I don't think I was explicitly clear.  I firmly believe you should have one build for levelling and another build for end game.  For example at 40, IMO, you should respec and get MS no matter what you had before, yes the ability IS just that good and class defining...at the same time once you get MS I wouldn't ever put any points into imp heroic strike...but before then I do think its a viable talent.  I also believe that the end game is unfinished and we do not yet know what will be needed...so full protection MAY very well be needed at 60.  I can say that if, when levelling, you spec full protection you WILL level slower and less effectively than if you spec some/all in dps talents.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, a WoW warrior is nothing like an EQ Warrior.  We don't even know if they will have the same role in high end raiding.  Personally, I'm not trying to make my WoW warrior anything like my EQ Warrior.  Why pigeon hole ourselves into one role?  I'm trying to do different things, use all the tools (and there are a lot of them), Blizzard gives us in WoW, and not base everything on what I did in EQ.  Honestly anyone who does this and doesn't take advantage of all the skills and talents you have in WoW is going to be about 1/4 of the Warrior they can be in this game.  Its frankly night and day between the two games.  <br />
<br />
So if you're going Def because you like it and think its a cool/fun build, do it.  But DON'T do it because you think its the only way you can tank mobs in instances or in raids.  So far its not, and I doubt it will be like that at the high end either.</div></div><hr />

You can convince yourself that fun is what matters but in a system such as the talent trees in WoW 'having fun' invariably means 'I did not use my points as efficiently as possible'.  <br />
<br />
To put things in perspective it'd be like if you as a Warrior EQ can have 245 offense instead of 250 offense but have some skill in forage.  Yeah it might be pretty fun but you're still an inferior Warrior.  <br />
<br />
But since WoW has players being very powerful relative to mobs, gimping yourself shouldn't be as big a deal at least until raids.</div></div><hr />

Very true.  Game is still really at the early stages right now, who knows what it will even be like at the high end with raiding etc.  First respec is 1 gold, next one is like 5 gold (sounds like a lot but I'm betting at level 60 its not that much).  Not horrible, maybe WoW will give some way to repsec like DAOC did too.  (weren't there some things on raids you could loot to let you respect etc.?)  DAOC actually gave one free respec at level 20 or 30 I believe just due to all the patches, game balance issues, etc., that they did.  I wouldn't rule this out with WoW, especialy with PvP still in its infancy.</div></div><hr />

On Healing. As a smith I have a desperate need for iron. I get a fair amount of mine from the Yeti caves (the lower ones) and since 30th I have been doing that solo. <br />
<br />
I clock in at about 1500 HP--and while healing time is not significant, it is long enough that if I don't eat the dead repops can, and will start to catch me. I can only anticipate that  by 60th there will be appriciable down time on some pulls. So don't write off that at low levels just because we don't see it yet.<br />

I have no clue if in the end this build will work, but I like it so far (going onthe assumption that rage = agro and crowd control):<br />

I'd seriously concider ditching booming voice 5 and putting those points towards improved revenge and maybe improved sheild block.  i dueled a warrior a few levels below me who had the first rank of improved revenge and spent around 1/2 the fight stunned doing nothing at all.<br />
<br />
I initally went with booming voice 5 but ditched it for crits instead.  I do miss it somewhat because now I have to keep reapplying Battle Shout if I want it, but I like having the rage generation/dmg output of crits more than extending the duration of 1 buff and 1 debuff.</div></div><hr />

I agree it brings nothing to the table for dueling. It might help for mass PvP--especially if grouped. But no way am I ditching it before I hit 60. The fights where I have to save for battle shout run longer than ones where I run though rend, sunder, demoralizing shout and the slow. <br />
<br />
Yeah definatly don't want to dw against a defensive warrior. And shaking loose 5 points for improved crits with sword or ax would be nice too (as crits are no small part of the build).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see Booming voice bringing anything to the table other than a small amount of rage managment.  That being said, in PvE soloing its very nice to have.  I've got 4 in cruelty and 1 in booming voice atm.  If it improved power of the effect I'd be all on it but it only improves duration.  Its helpful, but not as helpful as more crits.<br />
<br />
The way I've found it to work is those long fights where booming voice (and demoralizing shout) duration comes into play I'm generating so much rage anyway that its not much to reapply booming voice or demoralizing shout.  So since I'm gonna reapply it at some point anyway (and I'll have the rage to do it) I'm going for crits instead.<br />
<br />
I've yet to see how booming voice helps any form PvP in any appreciable fashion... especially when compared to what the extra crits give ya (more dps and rage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I already have cruelty 5--so the argument ends up being booming voice now or weapon spec crits later. And can tell you that until I have the points to open weapon spec they are staying there.  TM is next on the hit list.<br />
<br />
As for the booming voice helping--that would most rely on the other melee members of your group. I can't imagin that a rogue would be unhappy to have 85 extra power for an extr a minute for his ambushes.</div></div><hr />

I'm a stance switching machine now!  You really do need to use your stances.  Grouped I'll start off in Def, taunt, sunder, dem shout, maybe rend, maybe disarm, revenge if I can, then once I have aggro locked (and as long as my rage bar isn't too full and I won't burn it down), I'll switch to battle and hamstring so they won't run and maybe overpower or even execute if I want to blow rage.  TONS of things we can do.  Not the stereotypical boring warrior by a long shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Concussion strike can be used in any stance. <br />
<br />
Revenge can only be used in defensive stance, but can be used with any weapon, this actually surprised me a little as I had envisioned revenge as sort of like a shield bash, but it works fine with a two hander equipped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In what way does it not look great on paper ?<br />
<br />
Just as an example, figure you are using a beefy two hander and normally hit for 300 every 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
In the first ten seconds, using no specials you would hit three times for 300, or about 90 dps.<br />
<br />
If you use heroic strike 8, the first ten seconds would be 300 ( you can't heroic strike on a charge ), 424, 424 - or about 115 dps. This nets you one attack's worth of rage and costs you 24 rage.<br />
<br />
If you use mortal strike, the first ten  seconds would be 300, 600, 300, 300 - or about 150 dps. This nets you three attack's worth of rage, and costs you 30 rage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Revenge is just a manual riposte really.<br />
<br />
Oh, and here's my problem with mortal strike.<br />
<br />
1) I rarely have 30 rage sitting around.<br />
<br />
2) Who the fuck has TIME to even think about that shit?  Even elite mobs at my level die so goddamned fast in a full group that I don't even get a HS off, let alone something that costs twice the rage.<br />

i'll just hold aggro, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose it would be nice for DPSing or if you like tanking with a two hander (which I do not). It just doesn't seem worth it to me to get several abilities that are almost useless (weapon specialization) to be able to get this one ability. If it wasn't at the bottom of the skill tree, or if the arms tree had better skills at the bottom to lead to it, I would probably get it. As it is, however, I just don't see it as being worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The chance to crit is based off the difference between your defense skill and the mob's weaponskill.  As such extra defense doesn't really help much unless you are fighting stuff over your level ( it adds .04 to dodge/parry/block per point ) but if you are fighting stuff over your level it sharply cuts down on the number of crits they land on you.<br />
<br />
I agree if you were only putting 5 points into defense, deflection is probably a better spot for them, but personaly I have gotten both anyway and don't particularly worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of you folks should check out the warrior forums on the blizz site.  They have heaps of info on talent builds and such.  Here are the top 4 ability sets that any warrior should think about getting.<br />
<br />
1) TM and Anger management = TM allows you to switch stances with ease and lets you use ALL of the warrior abilities.  Anger management is pretty good for 1 point.  It lets you keep your rage between fights (assuming you didnt execute) PLUS it generates 1 rage ever 3 secs.  <br />
<br />
2) Improved Revenge + Improved Shield block = This low cost talent combo will make you an awsome awsome tank.  Combined with improved sunder armor, you will be a walking tank machine!  With improved shield block (just rank one), that allows you to block 2 attacks with your shield.  When you block and attack, revenge lights up and costs very little rage.  When you spec improv revenge, it gives you a 40% chance to stun for 3 secs.  This combo allows you to block the attack, in instantly try to stun the mob.  It works so well that some folks have reported tanking a mob and having them land just a few hits (that were blocked) on them.<br />
<br />
3) Mortal Strike = Yeah everyone knows about it, but its a killer skill!  Later in lvls, you will be flowing in rage.  If you pvp, rage will be somewhat plentiful so being able to MS a few horde (or alliance) esp casters will mean a quick death.  MS is godly with duel wield, with the changes now.  Duel wielding, with the combo of MS and Overpower, my dps shoots off the roof.<br />
<br />
4) Fury + Enrage = DPS DPS DPS!  Using two hander or duel wield, this is the fury build.  Allows you to come somewhat near rogue dps, while we get to wear plate.  If you spec in the crit %'s, and wear the 3 ornate mithril pieces (easy to get), your crit % will be insane.  You will crit 5-7 times during a fight, each time making you faster and faster.<br />
<br />
There aren't enough points for all of these builds.  You have to pick and choose which kind of warrior you want to be.  You can do MS and the Imp revenge/block combo.  You can do fury/enrage + defensive skills.  The key is to sub in both offense and defense and to gear yourself towards you build.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried, but I couldn't sift through all the whining and complaining that is rampant on the Blizzard boards. (Note: All of them, not just the warrior ones)<br />
<br />
<br />
I almost feel like playing two separate warriors.  The Dual-wielding crit Fury build looks so so tempting, but I also like the Protection/general build I've set up.  I feel like to get both sets I should play two separate warriors with two different builds, as it would suck to have to spend so much money to switch between the two so often.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, there's so many items with +defense skill. Without making any sacrifices in ac/hps a high level warrior will have at least +30-40 defense skill, without wasting any talent pts. The warrior defense tree is severly lacking atm compared to fury/arms, hopefully it will get improved at some point.</div></div><hr />

My pve build would probably include Shield spec, toughness, imp shield block 1 and imp revenge, but nothing more than that. It still leaves you enough pts for mortal strike + cruelty. Never been a big fan of concussion blow, just like heroic strike it totaly kills your rage generation, even more so in defensive stance. And most boss type mobs are immune to it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah yes, but the 30 fuckin rage for mortal strike (that can miss by the way) is a good use of points.<br />
<br />
Uh huh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on a Mortal Strike miss you are only charged 5 rage.  Instead of stunning them (if they can be stunned that is) you stop their ability to heal pretty good plus you do some pretty sick dmg.  I'm seriously thinking about stopping at imp revenge 3 and grabbing mortal strike.  There's a lot to be said about the best defense being a good offense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets be serious here for a second.<br />
<br />
Mortal strike 30 rage, instant, weapon + 85, detrimental healing effect.<br />
<br />
Heroic strike, 15 rage, next melee, weapon +124 (rank 8).  <br />
<br />
MS is REALLY worth devoting your entire fucking build to?<br />
<br />
Uhh, okay, whatever.  See ya in 6 months and we'll see what you think then.  It looks like ass in a can to me.<br />
<br />
With Improved Revenge, the shield bash silence, and concussion blow, you stop them from healing pretty fuckin good too..as well as mitigating a fair chunk of damage on shit that doesn't heal, instead of just being a weak ass heroic strike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, thats only the first level.  Rank 4 of MS is +160 to weap dmg versus +124 to melee dmg.  The last level comes out slightly ahead of HS dmg wise from what I've heard from people who have used it, plus the fact that its an instant and not on your next swing so you get rage from your normal melee hits. Plus the heal debuff.  Plus the fact that you need sweeping strikes so the heal debuff can hit 4 guys (i dunno if concussion will work on a sweeping strikes hit but wouldnt that be the shit?).<br />
<br />
The imp sheild bash is 3 sec silence every 12 sec.  Very nice esp since you can silence melee.  Of course you can miss with it and it can be resisted.  And it requires a shield (which you would have in tank mode pretty much)<br />
<br />
Concussion blow, its a kick ass ability and I loved it but it has downsides.  If you miss, you are waiting 45 seconds.  If they dodge, parry, what ever you are still waiting another 45 seconds.  Boss mobs are stun immune.<br />
<br />
Its a trade off.  The ability to silence every 3 seconds plus a 5 seconds stun every 45 seconds versus the mortal strikes big damage,  ae heal debuff, and the boosted offensive output (read rage building) of the arms build.  I've done imp shiled bash 1 and concussion blow.  I've not done Mortal Strike so I'll decide if its ass in a can for myself once I've tried it.</div></div><hr />

Use your points how you want.  I guess if you like to see big numbers, then great.<br />
<br />
Me, i'd prefer an ability that DOESN'T hit the sheep standing next to whatever I'm hitting.  Maybe I'm silly that way.  Don't get me wrong, my next points are probably going into arms and fury, but that's only because I've gotten what I feel I NEED as a tank out of protection.  I just hope everyone who's fucking slobbering over MS or SS or Flurry or whatever the build of the week is realize that there's a lot more game than just PvP, and putting all your eggs in one basket is rarely a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well hopefully you'd move the mobs away from the 1 or 2 sheeped guys before you go hitting any dmg dealing AE's.  I usually dont have a mage in my group though so I get to do a large portion of the CC work.<br />
<br />
Of the talents in the prot tree, I picked the ones I felt made me a better tank over all.  For pvp reasons dodge talents will make you dead against a warrior.  I dont recall being overpowered by an NPC warrior mob but they do disarm.  afaik they have the same skill set players have.  I'm pretty sure I was hit by revenge stun more than once in SM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how the 50% healing effect of Mortal Strike is of any use at least for PvE.  The chance of landing a MS is same as any other skill, but a shield bash/pummel would stop the heal completely unless it's an instance boss (at least I haven't seen any non boss mobs that can't be interrupted) or it's an instant heal.  These aren't exactly the most common set of circumstances you'll face in this game.</div></div><hr />

We have a number of skills that are ment to hit more than one target and most of the time CCing something I could cleave frustrates the heck out of me. <br />
<br />
And respeces are cheap. Besides Haass 1) hunters to spec their pets for tanking  are scary good tanks. 2) Why the big push to for everyone to spec to prot?  Only need 1-2 per raid. I haven't feel the need to be a prot warrior in an instance yet (though you can be your ass I am in defensive and have the sword and shield going for the boss).  3) Respecs are cheap.  You should try fury/MS, we should try prot. I can't imagine that I wont.</div></div><hr />

Finally a game where dps_tank_03 throuh _09 can do something besides scratch themselves on a raid.  Of course not many folks are raiding in WoW just yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah CC is definately different in this game.   Usually I group with another higher level Warrior, a Hunter, and a Priest.  Higher level Warrior is the tank. (I back him up if need be or pull aggro off of the priest if need be)   So we have no CC to speak of besides tanking, and I'll tell you whats LOADS of fun.  Just going balls out dps insanity.  I bloodrage as much as possible, usually am in Fury (unless I want to use sweeping strikes), and whirlwind, cleave, and sometimes, sweeping and/or thunderclap, my butt off.  I also make sure I piercing when the mob is low if they're a  runner.  Occasionally I'll throw in a debuff, but the MT is usually doing that so its not necassary.  Using a nice two hander its tons of fun, and my dps is really good in this mode.  Pretty cool!  Tanking is fun don't get me wrong, and improved revenge/concussion are AWESOME, but I'm also having a lot of fun with what I'm doing right now.  (Have 22 poins in Arms and 13 or so in Fury)<br />
<br />
But it also depends on the situation.  Like last night.  We were doing Zul Farrak.  Had one pull that was 3 damned Shammys.  (pain in the ass mobs)  So to avoid all three constantly chaining totems/healing, our MT kept two busy, I pulled one off him and pulled it back and out of range of the others, and the rest of the group killed mine.  Rinse and repeat till all three were dead.  In that situation I went defensive with my shield and did the shield block, interrupt, revenge, rend, etc. thing.  Cleric was able to keep us both healed no problem.  Was fun, worked, and its really nice to be able to switch from DPS mode to tank mode and be very effective with both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mortal strike 30 rage, instant, weapon + 85, detrimental healing effect.<br />
<br />
Heroic strike, 15 rage, next melee, weapon +124 (rank 8).  <br />
<br />
MS is REALLY worth devoting your entire fucking build to?<br />
<br />
Uhh, okay, whatever.  See ya in 6 months and we'll see what you think then.  It looks like ass in a can to me.<br />
<br />
With Improved Revenge, the shield bash silence, and concussion blow, you stop them from healing pretty fuckin good too..as well as mitigating a fair chunk of damage on shit that doesn't heal, instead of just being a weak ass heroic strike.<br />
<br />
What you've missed here Haas is Heroic Strike replaces your next attack and hence you do not generate the rage you normally would.  Heroic Strikes real cost is more like 20-25 rage.  Mortal strike does not stop your next attack and you generate rage like normal.  <br />
<br />
Heroic strike is actually really ass.  With the latest nerf to MS its still very viable but there's now (IMO) 2 viable builds...Fury/arms and Arms/Fury (with MS) instead of just 1.  Before the latest nerf yes MS was just that overpowering such that every other build was significantly weaker than a MS build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug.  I just don't see it being that way.  30 rage is a fuckload of rage, especially when you're using a shield, which is what I use a ton since I group alot.  I'm lucky to generate 30 rage before something dies sometimes, quite honestly, let alone being able to make a big ass mortal strike land for full damage.<br />
<br />
I solo fine, can plow thru a couple +1 or +2 mobs before I get low enough to think about eating or slapping a bandaid on, so clearly it does not need major improvement, and when I group, I have the aforementioned problems, so I don't see it being an issue there.<br />
<br />
However, bet your ass that at 60, I will respec to MS for 1g, and respec back for 5 if I don't like it, just to see what all the fuss is about.  I highly doubt I will be impressed with it tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My build is 31 arms for MS, and rest into Prot for Imp Revenge and Imp Shield Block.  When I hit 53/54, I will be a tanking god and dps madman.   The true beauty of MS is in PvP, I totally decimate in pvp with MS.  Without it, it takes some time to kill off shamens and such.  I kill MUCH faster solo as well.<br />
<br />
MS is an instant and costs 30 rage.  In effect, you generate rage with your next swing.  So really what happens is that MS costs about 20-24 rage depending on what your weapon is.  Also if you spec crit %'s, MS usually crits pretty often.  With the new changes, dual wield warriors can use MS all the time now.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike just plain sucks.  I stopped buying the skill at lvl 15 or so, or once I got sunder armor.  They proved that sunder armor actually does equivilent + damage to the mob (because you are hitting it harder) vs using HS.  That and Sunder allows the rest of the group to hit it harder AND provide you with excellent aggro.  Try keeping aggro with HS, wont work.  Since it is stopping your next attack from generating rage, HS COSTS about 20-25 rage when you use it.<br />
<br />
Now with MS AND Imp Revenge, you can tank instances all day long.  I use a set of Ornate Mith Plate for +% crit's that boost my crit % up to +18%.  Dual wield thats a shit load of crits!  You will generate SOOO MUCH RAGE that you can't spam MS fast enough.  Try going in fury with dual wield against same lvl or -1/-2 of you.  Your rage bar is so full you can't spend it fast enough.  MS will releave that rage my friend!<br />
<br />
Now with just a few talents in protection, you have the awsome imp revenge + imp shield block.  If you are tanking 2-3 mobs, you will shield block 2 attacks and get to revenge 2 mobs with a 40% chance to stun em.  YES revenge transfers from mob to mob, so if you block 2 hits, you get to revenge any mob you want.  For 5 rage for a 40% chance of 3 sec stun, its awsome.  You will mitigate a lot of damage with your shield (assuming you have a good one), stun the mobs, sunder them, AND OMG keep aggro on all of them while your dps group takes em out.  Just remember to swap out to + AC and + Stam plate before you tank instances.<br />
<br />
GL and keep the warr strong.</div></div><hr />

Lots of rage.  Its not just eyecandy, its a good chunk of your overall dps (if that matters at all to ya) which translate into more rage.  Even fully prot spec'd the 5 talents in cruelty will pay you back in the form of more rage and of course mobs dieing faster.<br />
<br />
To me its kind of like tatical mastery...  yea it sucks we gotta put talents into it but the payback is worth it.  Having more rage than you know what to do with is a good thing imo.<br />
<br />
I used to think HS sucked ass too but I had some spare cash and went ahead and bought the higher ranks.  I'm glad I did.  I hit really hard when I want too.  Its nice to have that option.<br />

Sunder Armor has never saved my ass when I'm nearly dead, MS wouldn't have been able to do it either (lack of rage)...Heroic Strike has saved me more times than I can count.  I'll trust my own experience over your hypothetical numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for using Sunder or HS...never underestimate the power of &quot;burst&quot; damage when the mob is low on health.<br />

HS has steadily moved off my hotbar, it got to the 2nd bar (don't use cosmos).  Now that I have MS, there is zero reason to use it.<br />

Execute blows donkey balls.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
It burns all your rage, whether you hit or miss, and at the level I had (I don't think I bought the 40 execute, saving me pennies), it didn't hit as hard as my weapon did, and half the time didn't even do what it said it was going to.<br />
<br />
When the description of the skill states that it does 200 damage + X per rage point, I expect to hit for 200 damage.  The 149's I was getting for a long while pissed me off pretty good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Later on, exectue will be a skill you use a lot.  On instances, you can use it multiple times on the same mob.  Its an instant with no cooldown, you can execute as many times as you want.  Execute, rage potion (or crit hit), execute again.  Great fininsher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Execute's advantage is damage now.  Battle shout is a better dmg/rage ratio 100% of the time.  I encountered zero situations playing my warrior in beta where I actually would have chosen execute over battle shout (other than to see some big #s).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Execute is not bad at all (provided that you keep training it). It does occasionally miss and the damage is falsely advertised but it's one of the better damage abilities for the cost that you can do in Arms. If you happen to let your rage meter fill up, fire off a Battle Shout then finish with an Execute. It's rare but a 1400 crit is not a bad sight at all. Also Hamstring + Rend + Execute = wunderbar for runners. There are good alternatives, yes, but this works for me.<br />
<br />
So far (lvl 42) I am not impressed by Mortal Strike in PvE. It was nice in SM with all the pally/cleric NPCs but I could've easily used Sunder on most mobs and done just as well. If you dual wield in Berserker Stance, Execute may be king, but in Arms with sword/shield you can spend your more limited rage in other ways and be equal or better in most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">with a full rage bar i hit Execute's of 900 dmg pretty regular with rank 3 and thats without critting.  That only happens when i actually try to fill the rage bar up, but I can see dps tanks on raids burning the crap out of raid bosses when they drop below 20%.  Hehe that or becoming bite sized chunks of goo.<br />
<br />
It's also fairly handy in situations where you have a few mobs on you already and one runs.  Instead of chasing em, execute em.  Works like a charm except when it misses.  Building rage back up isnt hard with a good 2h and a few mobs spankin ya.<br />
<br />
Like just about all our abilities its situational.  And it does pretty damn good for the situation its designed for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm level 44, and lately I pretty much just run around with a 2h in berserker stance, works perfectly fine for me soloing mobs atleast +2, and I can do two at once at even level (granted it's a pretty close fight). Also the rage builder for berserk helps quite a bit since you generate rage off yourself getting hit, which gives you the extra swings you need to kill higher level mobs even if you still miss a lot.<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike might not be too amazing in itself, but with a 150+ damage 2h it's still an extra swing, combine that with Whirlwind as another extra attack, it does really well even if you're only fighting one mob. With axe (could use a polearm also) specialization and 5 points in Cruelty(?) I believe I have a 18-20% chance to crit, which easily builds enough rage for WW/MS, let alone being able to get good damage crits off those. <br />
<br />
Just some feedback, works rather nice for me. Worse come to worse you can switch to offensive, pop riposte/sweeping strikes and drasticly cut down on 2h delay in a tight spot while still using cleave/MS.</div></div><hr />
