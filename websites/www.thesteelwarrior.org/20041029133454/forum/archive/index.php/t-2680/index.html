<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple warning for you folks at the Vex Thal level.<br />
<br />
GM's are no longer allowed to de-spawn any warder for any reason.<br />
<br />
This means that if you kill a named and try to continue, and there's a warder that has not de-spawned, you're screwed. Gm's will not, indeed are not PERMITTED, to help you with this bug that they have often admitted is a known bug, any longer. They will not de-spawn the warder for you.<br />
<br />
What a load of crap. So now not only to they know about the bug, they refuse to fix it even on the as-it-occurs level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like you got an ass hole GM that didn't feel like helping you. I can't count how many times a GM has told someone &quot;we are not allowed to fix &lt;insert problem here&gt;&quot; when it has been posted all over that GMs are fixing &lt;insert problem here&gt; for people who petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This was posted over at the Safehouse, and several people have reported the same problem on that thread. So unfortunately, it wasn't just as ass of a GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ever try attacking Aten with a warder up?  It's pretty damn funny :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same ol' ass reaming to Sky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gm's were never allowed to despawn warders and VT has been buggy with mobs down and thier warders still up for a year or more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Until just this last week, I and many others have had GM's able to come in and de-spawn the proper warders for us.<br />
<br />
And yeah, i know, it's been bugged for a year or more. All this time, and they can't be bothered to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doors opening wrong way &gt; all, duh :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Up until recently GMs DID despawn warders if you cleared up to Aten and they didn't depop.  They won't anymore.  At least not on Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, don't forget...<br />
