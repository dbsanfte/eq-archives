<br />
My HP are a bit low (which still sounds odd to me at over the 5k mark) but there are a number of HP AAs I don't have yet (and they will come just as soon as I grind 11 more AAs for LR and ID 4 and 5).<br />
<br />
Gods I hate grinding defensvie AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A real quick look through your magelo and a check on Royal Attendant Gear, I'd probably go with the Greaves, they net you an instant 45 hp gain, while the BP was 10hp, I beleive. Through on a 30hp augment when you get a chance and you pick up a net gain of 75hp for the leg slot?<br />
<br />
Next I saw, again at a real quick glance, the bracers would net you something like 30 hp per slot? Yeah, you lose the vengeance 2 but can aug back with Aura of Battle or Vegeance 3, plus the open type 2 slots to slam on some extra HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
I looked mainly at HP because you mentioned it- Are you doing the 150hp GoD Tribute? If you have the cash, it's an easy way to net 150 hp that uses no slots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you having aggro problems? I have CHoS + yak and SoTB and don't have any issues, so personally I'd not waste a second anger aug on an SotB at least until you know you can remove it.<br />
<br />
Your profile looks a lot like mine, and I think I'm actually gonna cheap out and just buy the EF legs if I don't get lucky on an ornate legs drop in the next couple weeks. 700 AP's for what, 3 ac and 15 hp and no stamina to upgrade to RA seems stupid expensive to me. <br />
<br />
I'd also recommend buying an hp/ac aug for your RA head since you're unlikely to upgrade it anytime soon and you have a big investment in it. <br />
<br />
Fact is, the RA bp wouldn't be a bad option either, since you're not likely to see anything better anytime soon unless you're plotting to take out eindride icestorm like I am :)<br />
<br />
Tak or EF boots might be a good option too. However if you can handle hard ldons, don't buy those and just do lots of mm adventures for the bloodied boots of dark rites.<br />
There's a nice 85 hp shoulders in hard mm too, see my profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just don't see MM armor as an option when it is worse than ornate. Buffing out the hat probably is a great idea. :-p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How bout u just buy the Tribunal player made stuff. I can't remember the name of it but it has 80 hp on it. Unless you feel the need to do 80 Ldon's to get the Tak legs and aug them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So get ornate then. IMO the Tak stuff is overpriced, thats a dang ton of adventures per piece, and it's barely better than ornate without sticking lots of expensive augs in it. But to each their own. If you can wear cultural thats a great option too IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Helanic Tundra legs with a +6 Sta aug on them, bringing the stats to 40 AC +16 sta and +80 HP. Have 2k LDoN saved up, but I don't think the net gain from either Ornate or N Ro or Ef LDoN is worth the money or points. If I had an ornate greaves mold drop I'd plunk down the 500PP and make em, but definately would not run out and spend PP on one.<br />
<br />
For you moving up from SS greaves. like someone else said above, the only difference in important stats between Royal Attendent and Malevolent Greaves of Suffering is +4 AC and +15 raw HP on the RA, but that is countered by the +8 Stamina on the Malevelent Greaves<br />
<br />
Toss a 40 HP aug on your helm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Non LDoN thing I see:  replace your 8th coldain ring with another valorium.  Just swap in whenever you need to refresh the DS.<br />
<br />
Helm: slap a HP augment into it.<br />
Arms: Get EF vambraces, not much difference between them and the Nro to justify 700 more points, imo.<br />
Legs: See above.<br />
BP: looks ok for now.  If you feel like holding out and going for ornate bp, cool.  If you are not patient, like me, I'd get the Nro BP.<br />
And of course, hp aug all the ldon armor you can.<br />
<br />
Other than that, just keep grinding out the defensive/hp AA.  It's worth it.</div></div><hr />

If your agro is ok hold off on anger aug.  Not sure who/where you hunt with/at so not sure how your agro is atm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legs: Get EF, not much difference between them and the Nro to justify 700 more points, imo. <br />
<br />
Agreed thats what I did.<br />
<br />
I'd get the Royal attendant bracer/BP.  With GoD augs you add additional hps down the road in non slot 2 positions.  This means you will want a couple of pieces in inv when that day comes.  3 slot extensibility is core at least in a couple inv pieces.</div></div><hr />
