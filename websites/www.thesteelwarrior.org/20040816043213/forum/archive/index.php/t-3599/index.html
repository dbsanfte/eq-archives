<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While sitting here at work, righting a rather long and rambling post about class balance I came upon an idea. <br />
<br />
One so simple and elegant to fix itemization, that would only require a couple weeks or so to fix, That I think SoE should really look at.<br />
<br />
One problem I see in EQ is the LARGE amount of all/all gear and such. <br />
<br />
One older problem was with Class specific gear that would drop, and then rot because it was no drop.<br />
<br />
Both of these are problem, so what was the fix.<br />
<br />
Well they made velious quest gear and now ornate and elemental gear. These are better than before, and yes there  are still problems with them, but that is another discussion.<br />
<br />
How about this idea.<br />
<br />
You go out and you get an item of gear. <br />
Lets say you get The Strength of the Elements... <br />
nice shoulders<br />
all/all AC 15 Str 15 HP 100 FR 15 CR 15<br />
<br />
Now, lets say you take these shoulders and give them to your CLASS GUILDMASTER and get <br />
<br />
The Warriors Strength of Elements...<br />
War Only - AC 20 Str 15 HP 125 FR 15 CR 15<br />
or <br />
The Paladins Strength of Elements<br />
PAL Only - AC 15 Str 15 Hp 75 Mana 75 FR 15 CR 15<br />
or<br />
The Enchanters Strength of Elements<br />
ENC only AC 10 Str 15 Hp 50 Mana 100 FR 15 CR 15<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a feasible soloution to you? They still need to learn to balance hp/mana and caster/melee stats but thats another argument.</div></div><hr />
