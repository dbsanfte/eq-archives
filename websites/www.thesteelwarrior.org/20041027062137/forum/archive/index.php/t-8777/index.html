<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arrliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any ideas on where to get some decent exp for the warrior and okay AA exp for the shaman? I've tried GE, weak exp for the amount of time killing the mobs and no good AA exp for the shammie. Tried VL, velium is good and makes me money. Yet the exp/AA exp is very slow. I'm looking for the fastest way to 65 with the warrior. I have 6200 HP's buffed (Virtue, FoS and Boar). My AC is around 1300 (buffed). My shaman is fully capable of keeping my warrior alive (never really had a problem so far). Any suggestions would be most helpful and implemented very soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it depends upon you gear obviously but since you have no snarer I would say POI for good exp and mobs that don't run...if POI is too crowded or a bit much try Velks. I did both of these spots 2 boxing my war and shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">veksar beyond and including the shop is pretty decent exp, money you can make is insane too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arrliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was thinking Veksar, too. No idea what to expect in that zone though.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious as well.  PoI's a bit much for my 61war/61 cler combo, but I was able to do the PoJ basement without any problems.  It's often camped by BSTs and whatnot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoJ basement is good loot and xp, my war went from 61 to 65 there and I made 200k in sellables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I duo'd alot of veksar with my 65 war and my cleric who was 62 at the time.  I did this off and on til she hit 64.  Have the shaman mix up some ITU potions and you can pretty much go anywhere you want to in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shredder, the reason PoI was a bit much for your Warrior/Cleric combo was because you don't have slow. I too box a Warrior/Shaman, and for me PoI was no problem, fights just took a little longer than I would have liked. With that said, Velks is still a decent spot to 2 box a Warrior/Shaman, and it is almost always empty when I go there now. And you can just go straight to the FZ camp and get some decent drops that sell pretty good too.</div></div><hr />
