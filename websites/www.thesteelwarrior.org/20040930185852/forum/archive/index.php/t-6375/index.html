<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have killed both Nathyn Illuminous and Lcea Katta so i'm in a faction pit.<br />
<br />
I killed the Vampire Castle in Tenebrous Mtns about 15x.  I have gotten Valdanov Zevfeer to spawn, killed him and looted his Vampyre Volatilis Ashes.<br />
<br />
When i got to Phenic Dionicas i find i am KoS so starting the quest is a little more challenging.  How do i go about raising my faction with him?  Or should i just charm him with a chanter to kick the quest off?  Anyone got any experience with this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quetazl Coatl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As an Iksar I had the same trouble. Vampire's don't give you the correct faction I found out after camping there to get the ashes drop. Head to Sanctus Seru and kill any of the Heart of Seru guys. That seemed the quickest way for me. I was never able to get my faction high enough (actually didn't to take the time after all the vampire killing I did.) to do any of the other faction quests in Katta. Although the guards there love me now. <br />
<br />
I used a human form potion for the last fight, as it was in a building I didn't have sufficent faction with, and for the hand in. Over all, loved the quest, just spent alot of time killing the wrong mobs for the wrong faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply.  I have spent about 6 hours now camping in the 'of the Heart' tower and i'm up to dubious with Nathyn and apprehensive with Phenic.  These mobs with 'of the Heart' give +Nathyn and +Concillium Universus (Lcea Katta Phenic).<br />
Looks like this will work.<br />
Hurray!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">killing legionieres in katta give +nathyn and some 4 other +'s as well for katta npc's. Don't ask my why :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>icsdave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can kill the vamps and Legos till the cows come home, wont help that much, goto Seru.  Do the research on alla's about the different factions ( 4 or 5) and who to kill in seru to fix it, its all there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Starting from max KoS to both Lcea Katta and Nathyn Illuminous, I spent a total of about 15 hours clearing every thing on the 'of the heart' faction.  I ended up at near max ally to Phenic and Lcea and indifferent to Nathyn.  You might be able to do the quest with Nathyn at dubious.<br />
<br />
FYI when you give the quest piece to Nathyn he despawns and doesn't show his face again for 3 days.<br />
<br />
The part of the quest in TM where you give Lego Falion some orders took me longer than i expected.  I read a bunch of crud that says it takes 10 minutes but i found it took about 40 minutes for the regular TM guards to despawn and for Falion to spawn.  Then it took a further 40 minutes for Falion to despawn and for Kerzar to pop.  Plan ~2 hours for this part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A warning for anybody working on this quest:<br />
Turning in your figurine to Lathin Firetree spawns the quest version of Ajeea immediately. If you aren't ready to fight the 4 shades in the caster building right then, do NOT hand in the figurine. You will not be able to spawn the quest version of Ajeea with that figurine ever again.<br />
<br />
My experience:<br />
I knew it would take me forever to succeed at the pottery combine, since I have no int, wis, or pottery to speak of. So I went by myself to Katta and laboriously slaved away at the pottery until BINGO, the RNG had pity on me. I figured I would go ahead and do the turn-in to Lathin Firetree so that when I came back with a group to whack the shades, we could get straight to it. So, I did that. He gave me back the figurine and spewed a bunch of quest spam that I didn't read. It was late, so I logged out. <br />
<br />
Three weeks or so have elapsed. Last night I took a group to Katta to whack the shades. Ajeea was not up in the summoning circle where I half expected her to be. Uhoh. I went to see Lathin and gave him the figurine again. He told me he didn't need that and gave it back. Ajeea, of course, did not spawn in the summoning circle.  I searched the building and found her in one of the corner rooms. Great! I have her the figurine, hoping she would move to the summoning circle and do her thing (fond fruitless wishes!). No dice. Thus, the figurine at this point is worthless to me, and there seems to be no way to go backward in the quest.<br />
<br />
I have resorted to /petition to beg some rarely-appearing GM to trade me the first version of the figurine for the one I have now. I'm pretty sure that won't happen. Which means I get to start over from the beginning.<br />

Screwin' up quest turn ins for 58 glorious levels,<br />
