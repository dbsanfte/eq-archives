Well I like to have a place where we can talk about high end warrior issues without people asking me to link a Blade of War.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, mebbe our definitions of high end are different. All the AA questions, the questions about two boxing (since they usually wanna know how to two box their 65 shaman and 65 warrior), knight aggro concerns (in PoP), questions about weapons way out of my league... all looks high end to me, I guess I just don't know what high end is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to join with the forum order angst, but the Keep and the Tavern are still reversed :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for copying the paladin boards, here's the deal with that.<br />
<br />
The Overlords Sanctuary always existed. However, access was given to those who obviously played the higher end game, and knowledge of the forum travelled around. I would get PMs asking for access from guildmates of people with access, etc.<br />
<br />
However, the posts in it were lacking. There wasn't enough traffic. In trying to increase the traffic there,  It was suggested to make it public. I figured if we made it public, it would ruin the entire point of it..but Ainmer showed me the paladins board, and said that if we made it open - but heavily moderated it like they did, we could increase the posting and conversation in there without the downsides. It also gives lower players an area to read to get the information they will need eventually.<br />
<br />
So - that's what happened. We didn't &quot;copy&quot; the paladins board per se, we simply made a forum public that was private before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean come on, re-arrange the forum links...WTF, who would wast the time to complain about that.<br />

I also like having a high-end forum...makes sense IMO.<br />

<br />
The real question is &quot;Who would waste the time to move them around for no real reason?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for moving them back.  The people that have been around for awhile get used to the way things were.</div></div><hr />

AKA We are too lazy to adapt to change. LOL I don't mean to be a wise ass but I think change is inevitable. Things change and we need to be able to adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every morning for the past X years you :<br />
Get out of bed<br />
Take a shower<br />
Eat breakfast<br />
Listen to the news<br />
Get out<br />
<br />
Would you feel ok to just from 1 day have to :<br />
Wake up<br />
Listen to the news<br />
Eat breakfast<br />
Take a shower<br />
Get out ?<br />
<br />
We have our habits. We dont like to change them.<br />
Why change them when you can just as easily keep them ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with your logic Emilia is that there is a major difference between changing your daily routine, and moving your hand 3 inches south.  the analogy doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Seriously, who gives a rats ass if the links are rearranged on the page?  Pardon me for being a realist, but last I checked we play EQ because we are a: adept at reading, and b: have superior problem solving skills.<br />
<br />
A: Read each link to figure out where it goes.<br />
B: Click on the right one to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
I think the only quality that we all share, and is reflected in this thread, is our love of argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For 12+ months, i've done 2-20 checks per day on the old board.<br />
That a FUCKING big time span used to a SPECIFIC forum order.<br />
<br />
Thats 5 times per day, 400 days, thats 2000+ forum checks.<br />
YES i am used to a specific order, and I GOT USED TO IT.<br />
I dont like changing things. Have you ever heard of habits ?<br />
<br />
You know 1st drawer = socks , 2nd drawer = shorts ?<br />
Its called a HABIT. you like it this way, and would like to keep it as it is. <br />
<br />
May i also remind you that this is The Outhouse  <br />
A forum designed for our inside jokes and whines and various stuff.<br />
<br />
But i guess its too hard to go through your thick skull.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;Special Uber Forum&quot;  Well you edited you post.<br />
So cant really comment that anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They weren't changed for any particular reason.  Some people liked them the way they were before better.  Nobody cares if they get moved back, it's easy to do, so why not change em back?  So they're back.  Everybody is happy, it's a good thing.  Go to the tavern and have a beer.</div></div><hr />

I feel this quote is especially pertinent:<br />

We have a blade, but instead of using it, we dull it on the rocks of shallow complaint and pettiness</div></div><hr />
