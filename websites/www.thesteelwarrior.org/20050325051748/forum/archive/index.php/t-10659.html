The initiated around here--not that its anything formal, but have gotten to know the place--particularly from the EQ side, mitigation has a very specific meaning here, which works very well with the definition you provide. <br />
<br />
Mitigation is half the damage take calculation--after you have been hit, how much softer, less server and painful the damage is. The first half of the fomula is avoidance, in WoW, dodge and parry. (Block would definalty be mitigation--you can even see how much you mitigate.) <br />
<br />
The real reason I doubt it will change is that we have been kicking around the term for 2+ years. And as a point of jargon--its trying to sound offical. Its a short hand way to explane a very specific thing.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, I don't see why the word is not appropriate given the context of armor reducing damage taken.</div></div><hr />

Damage mitigation lessens the damage, making it &quot;less severe&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using mathematical ratios to define the percentages at which it does the above, the word is used perfectly in context here. Not to be harsh, but next time read the definitions you throw around or you're going to fail that college of yours!<br />

Isk: Ha, I remember this from the EQ forums too, wonder if we can hit 10 pages of debate again! ^^ (Note: no idea how many pages it really got to last time, it was just stupidly overdrawn)</div></div><hr />

Can we please use a new word? It seems like a lot of people try to use this word to sound &quot;official&quot; and self-important when bitching about the class, even if they don't use it correctl<br />
1 : to cause to become less harsh or hostile : MOLLIFY &lt;aggressiveness may be mitigated or... channeled -- Ashley Montagu&gt;<br />
2 a : to make less severe or painful : ALLEVIATE b : EXTENUATE<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what you *think* you are talking about, but when people use the term mitigation they are referring to the amount by which incoming damage is reduced by armor. <br />
<br />
In fact you could say it is the amount by which the damage becomes less harsh, or the amount that it becomes less severe, or the amount that it becomes less painful, in short the amount it is *mitigated*.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, in most cases, people are using it in reference to the &quot;damage dealt/absorbed&quot; ratio. In that instance, it's incorrect anyway.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen this usage, and suspect that if *you* have actually seen a *single instance* of it, you either read it on battle.net or simply made it up to make your point appear less stupid than it actually is.<br />
<br />
To suggest that &quot;most&quot; people use it to refer to that, particularly on this board,  is simply laughable stupidity.</div></div><hr />
