<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all...been hearing about the cultural (forged) weapons with Ykesha procs but haven't managed to find one in Bazaar.  Are these Rallos Zek / Ogre usable and what might the name of this bad boy be?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For some reason the Fearful has no stats, but there is no recommended level as far as I remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fearful is rec 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have two on my brothers Iksar warrior, level 28 I believe and there is no stat reduction, its still 12/21. I have heard from people here that it will proc at 35 as well. If its 45 he will be pissed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhhh....thanks for the info!  What are these runnin on your servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I paid 6k for Fearful on Terris. Vengeful has more stats but is a more common combo so it might be the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I play on Luclin and rarely see them for sale, but the 5-10k range is probably normal.  You may be more successful looking for a troll GM smith and asking him to make one, perhaps through a trade forum on your server's message board.  That's what I did and had a response within a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slyson Dycson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Play on Luclin also as an Iksar, and i must say the blades just rock for agro control.  Used the fearful one in main hand and frosty off hand.  They are a bit rare to find but as Rhagulim said, it may be better to find a smith to make you one.  On Luclin there are 3 trolls with high enough skill to even attempt them, 3 that I was told of anyway.  But hook up with the trolls, generally they will offer to do the combine for free if you have the components.  Or, just pay the whole sha-bang like me and shell out 2500pp, which is cheapest you will ever find.  The smith even told me that if I ever resold it, i could make a huge profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im useing a Honed Ykesha, its 12/22 with no stats but still owns a Frosty wich runs 2-3k more on Brell.  I have only seen one Zek Ykesha for sale on Brell wich is why I broke down and got the Honed.</div></div><hr />
