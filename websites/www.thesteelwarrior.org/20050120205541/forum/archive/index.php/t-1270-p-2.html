dropping aggro on slow = very bad idea if I need to explain ask but I assume you can figure out the concequences of dropping aggro on slow yourself. <br />
<br />
Well... let's think about it.<br />
<br />
Solo: Who cares what slow aggro is.<br />
<br />
Exp groups: aggro lock didn't matter until mobs HAD TO BE SLOWED RIGHT NOW OMG. If slow is lower aggro, then mobs can be slowed fast with a warrior or a knight. DPS classes can run faster with a knight, clerics love warriors mitigating better.  Real choice for either tank class (I think, would have to see it played out in practice).<br />
<br />
Raids: shaman expect to die on raids.  Why? Because they have to slow and they have to slow now.  Slow landing fast is (on slowable mobs) the difference between a money shot and a corpse run. Lowering slow aggro won't make shaman slow any faster - they are already slowing as fast as they can and eating deaths from slow aggro. Lowering aggro means they die less, but don't slow any faster.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are unintended consequences but on the face of it doesn't seem a horrific idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using a useless spell to get endless aggro is an exploit. <br />
<br />
It has always been there, the problem is now that paladins can take the beating they used to NOT be able to take, because they were upgraded to be 95% as effective as warriors.<br />
<br />
A cleric can chain stun mobs just like a palkadin, actually better because they have much more mana.. do you see a lot of them doing that?<br />
<br />
If for example I found out i could sell modrods for 100,000pp to a certain vendor. and i kept casting mod rod and selling them, would that not be an exploit? or is that working as intended?</div></div><hr />

*throws hands in the air* I give up if you can't see the need to retune all encounters if you drop slow aggro then there is no point in continuing to debate on this subject. You want the game dummbed down quite  a few of us don't but I assume some of those here and on the pally board do judging by the posts. I guess it goes back to a comment that I made while ago. SoE should just put a mob in you hail for EXP AA and items equiv ot your level cause if fast exp is so much fun they can keep all their players playing if they do that I mean damn that's such a great idea I can't believe SOE hasn’t done it before. no need for mobs or story line or anything :p<br />

<br />
Kiz until aggro lock was properly 'discovered' nobody had really considered the implications of it - being able to dictate exactly what a mob will do (i.e. hit the tank nigh exclusively through all sorts of debuff and burst damage) without a VERY significant difficulty to pull it off or cost to doing it is not a good thing as it has the potential to totally trivialise the game, in a way the gimpness of warriors aggro generation is a side issue to this fact. Of course I'm biased but i don't think i'm wrong about that - that's why i argue against extreme boosts to warrior aggro (towards current knightly levels) because despite the fact that'd make us able to compete better it'd still leave the game broken as hell (more broken than it is already). <br />
<br />
Kreugar(?) had a point about warriors entering the planes without access to pure hate generating weapons, when i was using a frosty and wavecrasher it was baad but thats not really the topic here, wether some sort of tweak for non-raid equipped tanks is needed that doesn't stack with later types (or becomes trivialised by getting better gear) is something for another thread.  <br />
<br />
It is possible to function in an exp group without early slows (though mana intensive), or more often with earlyish slows and some frantic attempts to keep the slower amongst the living :) knights would retain the ability to generate their own EB style hate generation with stuns or whatever but the intention is that it would not be an  immediate fait accompli as we have now. You actually still have a slight advantage in that you can generate this aggro on demand rather than hoping for a proc, with the trade off that it's a slightly more risky proposition (especially at the initial contact) to tank the mob unslowed with a knight <br />
<br />
TBhonest though most groups I've been in slow fairly quickly anyway and deal with the occasional pong. So long as no tank has a massive advantage (which is what we have now) groups will just deal with it. and maybe play a little smarter, heck if you have a warrior in group who's currently having trouble with his aggro generation, that's one more possible reason to group the SK than if we regain some balance by making aggro trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've designed PoP mobs to need to be slowed (unless you Joe Uber with gear up the wazoo that most players will only see in their dreams).  It seems they want slowing to have a certain amount of risk involved.  With a Warrior there is risk, a pretty significant risk, in fact I'd say that it's unusual for a slower not to die once every 4 hours or so with a Warrior tank.  I'm sure some of the more 'skillful' players will accuse me of being a lame player because of this, but this is my perception.<br />
<br />
With a Knight, much of this risk is negated.   I'd be very surprised if a slower died very often at all with a Knight tanking.  Certainly they don't die anywhere near as often as with a Warrior tanking, because if they did there'd be no reason to prefer the Knight over the Warrior to such an extreme degree.<br />
<br />
Reducing slow aggro would certainly mean that the Warriors would have a greater chance of keeping slowers alive.  It might even reduce the amount of deaths slowers take as a result.   I'm sure this would make Warriors happier and it would make slowers happier, but it would mean even less risk with a Knight tanking.   Would it put Knights and Warriors on equal footing or would it merely emphasize even more the advantage Knights currently have?  I'm not sure to be honest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Glatius2.  I absolutely don't mean Warriors are worthless.  There are monsters I can't fathom how they are tanked yet a Warrior jumps in there and stays alive.  That is most certainly worth something.<br />
<br />
As for the reason why I believe that making a game harder for fun is a bad idea it comes from experiences inside and outside of the game.<br />
<br />
I get more than enough random &quot;fun&quot; during raids. ^_^ The guild as a whole does risky things and rarely anything is a sure thing.  During my private times I am far more conservative.  I need to recover lost money and exp.  The last thing I look for is a tough wall to wall fighting camp.  And that is just me a tank which has higher survivability.  I can't imagine how well Enchanters like the idea that their down time is also spent dying as well for the sake of randomness to inspire fun.<br />
<br />
And it is purely human nature to seek out the path of least resistence.  Unless one is seeking a direct test or challenge they will pick the easier path.  As far as I know most casual exp groups are not tests of strength or endurance.  Why should anyone want to turn them into one?<br />
<br />
Okay okay, I'm getting off topic. ^_^<br />
<br />
A sensible suggestion I saw in the thread is to improve Warrior skill and reduce agro on Knights a little.  That is fine since I stand by my assertion that Knights have other control otuside of agro anyway, which is one of my key points.  What do Warriors have beyond any some level of agro control?  Can they control a monster without agro?  But Knights can.  Why is this fair?  In the end I believe Warriors will get far more utility out of gaining new skills than by reduction of agro on Knights.  That is my point.<br />
<br />
As a side note: on PON is an interesting thread.  If neither Knight class ever existed in EQ would Warriors still have a problem?  Maybe or maybe not I still would believe that Warriors need some sort of boost.  I would see other classes taking their own hands measures to cover the gaps in Warrior agro control.  I can't believe that this would be &quot;working as intented&quot;....<br />
<br />
At least the question is interesting enough that you can see both sides of the arguement. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe just maybe if fights are more unpredictable you might up your muscle quotient to better survive it?<br />
<br />
As far as efficiency groups go check out my poll in The Tavern, it makes for interesting reading. What my fellow warriors at this time and knights fearing a nerf may take as a sort of cold comfort is that it seems that groups demanding the most efficient set up (i.e. one tank only screw the others) are somewhat fewer and farther between than we might think. <br />
<br />
I expect the figures to be slightly biased due to the main readership being the people who don't have the 'power' to dictate to others what they want but we do still have a very significant majority of people saying that they don't worry to hard about efficiency they just group with friends/whoever needs a spot. I won't suggest many tanks 're gonna get a group over another type of class in zone though. I'll betcha knights and SK's edge Vanilla warriors in that respect though :p.  <br />
<br />
Myself i leveled all the way from 30 to 63 with a mix of two knights, a bard and myself typically forming the core of the group (possibly why it took so long :) ). <br />
<br />
I think we basically have to admit that with the numbers of the competition out there going LFG is gonna suck hard whatever the class balance is like (although having said that right at the moment the disparity really is huge enough that it does show). <br />
<br />
From my recollections back when knights were totally knackered I still found going lfg to be a pain in the arse....<br />
<br />
Cold comfort but some, next time you're lfg....</div></div><hr />

Apothes covered most of what I would say if I had been here during that time, so just going to hit on a couple quick comments directed at things said to me.<br />
<br />
Strange, it's my perception that more people die in this game as a direct result of a failed taunt than for any other single reason. Perhaps you'd like to correct that perception with the reality? <br />
<br />
Glatius said the above in reply to this comment from me:<br />
<br />
If a warrior has taunt fail, it simple does not work. No other consequence, other than those that arrive directly from taunt not working. <br />
<br />
I made that comment in reply to his suggesting that if spells fail there should be a chance of say, a nuke blowing up in the casters face, a port to the wrong place etc.  First, he took my quote out of that contest to attack it.  Note that with the extra information, it sounds just a bit different.  Second, even then, after I state &quot;other than those that arrive directly from taunt not working&quot; he says &quot;people die...as a direct result of a failed taunt&quot;.  We no kidding, that would be a direct consequence of taunt failing.  Duh!<br />
<br />
Now on to Gimmel.  He stated:<br />
<br />
You and Redhenna need to easy up on Aeka. I found from the first few pages: <br />
<br />
Followed by one call to remove stun agro, and one that could maybe be construed that way.  Ok, I retract my statement that no one is calling for the removal of stun agro.  The correct statement should be &quot;Almost no one is calling for the removal of stun agro, it is not being seriously debated here&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now that I have old business taken care of my one comment is about just how lazy and bored it seems players have gotten with the game.  With almost all penalty removed from dying in PoP(96 % rez removes almost all exp pain from a rez, GY's make CR's a breeze, etc.), people still get all upset that their is a small(I rarely any more loose a slower in an exp group..still happens, but maybe once every second or third group) chance of some one dying.  &quot;OMG, that is just not fun.&quot;  If we are going to remove all risk from exp, maybe we should just put a vender in PoK, who sells AA points, 100 PP each.  We could then go farm nice safe greenies for cash to buy our AA's.  Or maybe not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I've said this before, but I think it bears restating. Knights have always been able to lock aggro, but it never &quot;tirvialized&quot; the game until PoP. Why is that? The problem isn't that aggro lock trivializes the game, it's that it trivializes one aspect of the game, and SOE already trivialized all the other ones in PoP. The situation is never going to really be fixed until we have somewhere else that will give as good exp as PoP, but has the challenges that PoP lacks (crowd control and pulling, notably). Then they can nerf the hell out of PoP exp and it can become the DL of the 60+ game, easy, brainless exp, but not as good as a real dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suddenly now it's under the spotlight. Doesn't really matter why does it if it is broken? <br />
<br />
I agree with you that plenty of other parts of the environment are pretty dumbass in PoP but why let the very last thing that keeps it from being quite so mindless go too?</div></div><hr />

Oh my, I do so love the sound of that.  It does not sounds as in LDoN is going to be that fix, but I still hope.  Have been having a blast in Veksar lately tho, and looking forward to more of the zone revamps.  Hope there is something good coming from those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the only reason it is imbalanced is because of mob design. Which is why warriors make just fine tanks (if not preferable ones) just about anywhere but PoP. It’s unslowed mobs being able to chew up a tank in 15 seconds and slowers in 5 seconds that caused the problem. Before instant agro was an advantage, but it was not as huge advantage as it is now, and the warrior hp and dps advantages pretty much balanced it out. Now the mob design places a premium on snap agro. It not just that people just realized how powerful snap agro is in PoP, it’s that it wasn’t as powerful then as it is now, the environment made it more valuable. The best change may be to change the environment rather than the ability.</div></div><hr />

My ability to get a group or not has no bearing on that simple fact.<br />
<br />
I certainly agree that anything we can do to up the challenge of the environment (to increase the need for flexibility, reacting well to bad situations etc) is good, and may help knights compete for tanking rights with a 'rebalanced' warrior, or (my choice obviously) provide more chance for their skills to shine when grouped with a warrior :p</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but they are capable of tuning that risk. Maybe you don't remember the shamans splattering when disease counters were added to slow.  SKs sure do.<br />

<br />
Ok, lost me here. If warriors had a reasonably reliable way to hold taunt through slow (that's what you want, right?) from lowering slow aggro, the risk would be about the same as it is with a knight tanking during the initial debuff phases. The risk of an overburning yahoo would still be there for warriors after debuffs.<br />
<br />
Knights would continue to have the same risk as now. If knights have aggro on demand, lowering everyone else's aggro won't change that.  Therefore, the risk won't be changed.<br />
<br />
I see this as a change that can help address Warrior's issues while balancing the perceived benefits of the various tanking classes.<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Glatius2 <br />

<br />
Or would the lowered risk during slows reestablish warriors as the best tank.  I think it would bear some testing.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Apothes, I think I understand why you think lowering slow aggro would trivialize content, but think it through.  Has anyone ever not slowed anything because of aggro issues? Nope.  Ask the enchanters about being put on suicide tash duty. Content wouldn't be any easier if they HAD to tash and maybe could avoid dying. With high tash aggro they have to tash and die.  Without high tash aggro, they have to tash and maybe die.  The end result is the mob is tashed, dead enchanter or no dead enchanter. Same deal with slows.  Every raid I've seen where assist is called, it never applied to the slower.  They slowed right away, and stood next to the warrior so that if aggro was lost they'd just die without pingponging (heck, maybe taunt would work and they would live).<br />
<br />
Tell me again how forcing enchanters and shaman to die for essential spells to land makes the game harder? When it's all said and done, slow's gonna land - if it doesn't the raid will probably wipe.  So is malo, cripple, OOS and tash. If the debuffers have to die for the spells to land, the debuffers will die. But the debuffs will still land, because the encounter REQUIRES the debuffs to be doable. Upping the resist rate on slow makes keeping the MT up a bit tricker, and makes content a bit more difficult, but we're not talking about resist rates.  We're talking about aggro.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Naw, at least from what many ancient Paladins have known we've been doing this tactic forever.   This worked great in Lower Guk (one can cheese off undead froggies twice as much with a good old undead zap ^_^).  It wasn't such a wise thing to do in Kunark due realtive strength of some of the monsters (ie. I wouldn't be able to tank a mushroom in Kunark age with Kunark age gear).  In Velious it was more of the same.<br />
<br />
No one noticed it till now because it wasn't so life threateningly important.  On inc in Velketor's Kobald Pit I would watch for debuf caster to fire a spell and stun to hang on agro.  If things slip a Shaman can take a noname kobald for a bit.  In fact it felt like anyone could tank.  Usually didn't take more than a couple of taunts snag it back with just Taunt skill.   It was much faster to get it with a stun.  But for sure I wasn't doing chains or back to back like I have to do some days now.<br />
<br />
Luclin?  Who ever wants to talk about Luclin? ^_^<br />
<br />
Enter the POP era.  Not only are the monsters faster and have different HP pools but monsters deal damage differently.  I no longer wait for the debuffer to fire up their casting.  I have to start right away.  There is no room to casually stun things in the first few moments of a fight.<br />
<br />
What turns out to be a double edge sword is that the monsters have a much larget damage range.  A wide range of damage means that plate mitigation really means something now (yea!).  The downside anyone without plate mitigation is now feeling very frail (uh-oh).  They want the maximum protection offer which is why we are here.  A Shaman can't just take damage from a monster that has a range of 100-800 damage for very long if the RNG is mean.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing I saw mentioned in the thread: agro on slows.  If debufs like Slow did zero agro on resist then this would help out immensely.  Resists are the thing that punish groups the most and Warriors take the brunt of it.  In fact it could also balance out agro from spells Knights rely on because resist do happen for our stuff too.  If the first stun happened to get resisted which generated zero agro then that is your &quot;fun&quot; quota right? ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I didn't attack your post.  I'm merely emphasizing that there are indeed consequences when taunt fails, sometimes extremely severe consequences.  More so than any other ability in the game that fails with the possible exception of slow failing when you need it.  And that just doesn't happen as often as taunt failing.  Our skill is the weakest and most prone to failure of any in the game and it's the one we primarily rely on to function.  Given the current consequences of it failing, it's really no wonder people want something a little more dependable to rely on instead.  If Clerics fizzled as frequently as taunt does, people would be up in arms.<br />
<br />
Ok, lost me here. If warriors had a reasonably reliable way to hold taunt through slow (that's what you want, right?) from lowering slow aggro, the risk would be about the same as it is with a knight tanking during the initial debuff phases. The risk of an overburning yahoo would still be there for warriors after debuffs.<br />
<br />
This is what I mean.  Currently a Paladin probably fires off one or two stuns to be sure the Slower doesn't take a beat down when he slows.  Reduce the aggro of slow and suddenly a Paladin only has to use 1 stun and maybe not one of his more mana intensive stuns (although the mana costs on the higher end stuns are so obscenely low I'm not sure it even matters) to hold the same aggro.  Bingo, Paladin is doing less, using less mana, to make the situation the same.  The group is safer because the Paladin can actually do exactly what he was doing before and climb up higher on the hate list when compared with the Shaman or Enchanter.  Now they can do more like dot, debuff, and so forth.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure of the complete impact, but it needs to be considered.</div></div><hr />

I didn't directly respond because I wasn't going to disagree that part.  I wasn't tanking in Velious at the levels I am in POP.  I can't argue with that.  I could argue the other though.<br />
<br />
But of course it matters why.  Do you want them fix the problem or not?  Covering it up with something else means it is still there.  At the very least we should make sure SOE doesn't make the same mistakes again.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe this go back to the idea where there were no Knight classes in EQ.  Are Warriors still broken?  Warriors would still be class incapable of handling the heavy casting and agro requirements of POP monsters.  Everyone else would have to work around it.<br />
<br />
Whether the answer is boosting Warrior's abilities or getting rid of POP style monsters is debatable.  I like either but prefer boosting Warriors because I can see SOE trying to invent and implement even trickier more complex events in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the environment was covering it up, when they changed the environment it was uncovered so It's the way the characters interact with the environment that needs to be changed. I'd  hesitate to improve warriors (much as taunt makes me scream sometimes) until we see how knights fare with removal of 'aggro lock', although i'm inclined to agree that warriors could probably do with a mild but not unbalancing increase to make them a tad less random...</div></div><hr />

I am simply saying that bitching that nerfs are needed for paladins is stupid. Then both the paladins and warriors are sitting /LFG because if the stun aggro is removed I will not want to group with either a paladin or a warrior. I will happily take myself a SK or a bard and be done with it. They have spells which increase hate and they can lock aggro as well if not better than a pally.<br />
<br />
but if you really want to see how gimped both your class and your hybrid class can be go for it. Beg for the Nerf. The Kunark Reference is a reminder of how we all told paladins during Kunark times &quot;you are not a real tank, we want a warrior&quot;.

You mean it would take skill(*gasp*) to group with tanks without agro lock?  Oh no!  This could be why rangers get jolt, wizzies concussion, enchanters boggle, etc.  So they can work without agro lock.  There are also some tools for working around slow agro(root anyone?).<br />
<br />
I can state for a fact that without a knight, a group with a warrior tank can do very well.  It is a little more challenging, but can be done.  Every time you say that warriors cannot handle PoP mobs, you are proved wrong by every warrior who does tank in PoP.  Time for a new argument, as that one is just wrong !</div></div><hr />

However if you think it is normal that players have to work around deficiencies then we are just going to have agree to disagree.  You should be the only one responsible for doing your job.  Requiring others to do your job for you is not a good way to show your worth in groups.  As pointed out by others if Healing, CC, FD, and other skills had the failure rate as high straight Warrior agro they would all scream bloody murder.  If one believe this is &quot;working as intended&quot; then I don't know what to say.  If I haven't convinced you by now it will never happen.<br />

That is the problem Redhenna, why have all those tools for losing aggro (and decreasing DPS) in one case ie: warriors and not another ie: knights. Just choose a knight for the tank and watch the exp flow, or slow it to a snail pace with a warrior, hard choice for me!<br />

<br />
I'm not quite clear what you mean there Aeka.<br />
<br />
I agree we should be able to hold the mob on us 'reasonable well' without resorting to outside interference like root etc. However if you mean to continue that logic to other characters not needing to manage aggro (i.e. holding themselves back) then I can't agree. <br />
<br />
The proposition that nothing should stop you holding taunt and if you loose aggro somethings wrong doesn't fly. If the slower can't slow too early, if the nuker can't overnuke, if the rogue can Backstab away with no repercussions then what's the point? <br />
<br />
We're close to that already with current knight aggro and what we get is imho, riskless, dull, broken grouping. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it's all a matter of perception? I think the random factor's too low atm, you think the amount of control should be higher? Well so do I, I guess, just not nearly so high as it is atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In response to some posts waaayyy back: Landrain I'm not a troll or a warrior posting as a paladin.  I play a half elven pally on Torv. ...really <br />
 <br />
Glatius, when I said over a long enough time a warrior can make more hate than a knight I wasn't refering to normal exp. grouping, yes the time it would take would be much more than it takes to kill one exp. mob.  What I was trying to get at with that whole paragraph was if we had to use our higher end stuns in instead of having the option of using low level mana cheap stuns we'd have to curtail our spell casting to avoid med time and as a result may actually only generate as much hate in one fight as a warrior.  The difference is our hate spikes at the beginning of a fight and a warrior's starts at zero and goes up.  So a soultion to this would be an ability for warriors to do a burst of damage to spike their hate at the beginning of a fight.  I think this along with the double taunt sugestion would work great.  And just to list a disclamier: <br />
<br />
This is only a hypothosis based on game experience.  I understand that FT items, AA's and clarity spells make mana far easier to manage even for high level stun spells and that a 20 percent damage advantage may not be the equivalnet of a couple stuns plus knight melee damage (Also if Kazzuk's finding are correct, it's not even a 20 percent advantage). <br />
<br />
Raycheal, nice sig, pass the pretzels.<br />

Anyways just press SOE to get what needs to be changed, changed so everyone can have fun in EQ. <br />

I guess you have never taken a psychology course, or didn't learn anything in it. This IS human physcology, take the path of least resistance, the problem is stupid people who can't see that! I will not group with a warrior and watch him struggle with aggro when a knight is available to tank! I will not die because his char can't hold aggro. This is due to I believe a complete lack of unity in the warrior community to get Sony to do something.

I won't post on the topic any more (I've said what I've said and I'll just keep repeating it which is boring ^_^) but I will answer auxilary questions!<br />
<br />
There isn't any one particular exp monster in POP that makes me nervious to tank.  It is more situations.  The two I constantly see are:<br />
<br />
If I have to start a fight at half HP or some lower level I've noticed my chance of dying goes way way up.  In groups I've noticed Warriors weather this far more...it might be due to the fact I'm standing back tossing my heals in too.  I can't say for sure...no one has time to stop and scientifically study the situation. ^_^<br />
<br />
Any one particular monster is fairly tankable.  When two comes it becomes hard to withstand.  I know that just going straight tanking Warriors have a problem too but it isn't nearly as dramatic: when two things are pounding on you trying to fire spells is hard to say the least.  All of the tools I have to me to be able to cast.  If two (or more!) monsters are pounding on me I start to have problems helping myself let alone helping others.<br />
<br />
Then there are strange situations like silence and limited space.  If I'm silenced I have to fall back to just Taunt.  If the space is limited it limits the stuns available or I have to use more expensive means like healing to accumulate agro.  Any amount of time spent in fights like these situations is a big drain which makes me nervious.<br />
<br />
And this I believe this is one hint to Warriors if they want to look for ideas for upgrades.  A lot of skills SKs and Paladins have require them to be free to cast which ironically contrary to what needs to happen to tank.  But Warriors should always be able to fire skills especially standing toe to toe with something.  In fact they should shine at it.</div></div><hr />

your comment on that warrior balance issues should not be here strikes me as funny as I have seem many people say that but quite a few believe they should be I may have to look for the exact quotes form people to prove a point.<br />

in the future I would suggest locking all balance issues that are not about knights to stop the hard feelings people have stuff to say on the current issue if you continue to lock the threads it makes the board look bad because you are shutting down someone that has something to say, whether you agree with it or not or believe it has already been discussed.

stuns are not an exploit, they are the spell that every paladin has had in their spell bar the last 4 years, it is a part of the paladin life or whatever you call it, just like Complete Heal is a part of a Clerics.  Nothing has changed about paladins stuns agro.  If we want it we get it, get over it.  <br />
<br />
IF WE'RE NOT THE TANK WE DONT USE IT<br />
(read that last line again)<br />
<br />
IF we do its for the purposes of: <br />
<br />
- stop mob from running around<br />
- stop mob from beating caster<br />
- temporarily pause a mob in case anyone in group gets low HP and with late CH coming<br />
<br />
stuns dont need nerfed for your pleasure, people should learn how to play.  IMO simply tell your paladin to stop chain stunning or boot him (not that hard).  Hes screwing up your group by making healers heal more because of his inferior hit points/AC, when he should really only for the above purposes.  EXP Groups do well with constant pull of dps, not burst dps, in other words your nuking group will need to med/afk because they overnuked... which means downtime<br />
<br />
You,  Mognar are THE tank, TAUNT, thats all you need to do (having fast proccing weapons helps a lot).  I can drop 5k+ crits vs undead and get absolutely no agro even if i stun or group heal if needed, IF you do your job.  Your paladin friend is not gonna get in many groups if he doesnt learn how to play... and later on when you see him in CoD/HoH/PoNB/PoTactics pit... you might want to have in your group if you're killing undead :P *hint*<br />
<br />
As someone already said, &quot;Knights are king in EXP groups while Warriors overpowered in RAIDS&quot;.  At least Warriors can tell the group to back the @#$@ off in xp gruops until agro is obtained to fix the &quot;problem&quot; that YOU have (im sure a lot of the Overlords have a different opinion than yours).  Knights have no space at all (if so, then little) in raid mobs/gods/bosses so enjoy what you, the one and only class can do, and do well.  In the end game its not about xp groups, its about the phat lewts (raids), and you warriors are required in them, while Knights are not (look at some guild rosters, compare the ratio of warriors VS knights).  And in the end game we just became DT/AE/NUKE eaters, tank mezzers, while you are killing the gods face to face, so enjoy :P</div></div><hr />

Suggesting i should be made a fifth wheel in exp groups the way any raid warrior additional to the one or two who end up tanking in a raid is,  because you don't get to tank a god is bullshit, plain and simple. Every time you cast a spell in this game that's one more thing extra you got out of the game than we did, we accepted that and the frustrations and one dimensional nature of our task because we were SUPPOSED to be the best at it!  Suddenly thats no longer the case in exp groups which is where I spent the VAST majority of my 110 days played! You stack in an exp group with me tanking, I'm an irrelevance if you already have a knight to tank, how the fuck do you think that makes me feel?!?..even when I'm ALLOWED to tank I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the knight would place less risk on the group!...and /defensive on a raid is supposed to be my compensation?

 We are a temporaty tank at best.  We CANNOT keep agro on chain pulls, stuns require this thing called mana (we dont have much), and recast times, we also get resisted (a lot) and according to my parses we fizzle 15% of the time... ya i know you know all this even though you dont have a mana bar.  Over time we will be oom, and you with your dual wielding proccing weapons while taunting will still stand strong and me probably dead :(<br />
<br />
We have better things to offer than damn stuns, and with the days youve logged in, i hope you had enough to see an honorable Knight played <br />
<br />
What i found funny and still laugh at is the thought of a warrior being put to SA status just because a paladin came into the xp group lol.  As to my 150days played i was never put up to MA status just because i got in a his group; our experiences are at opposite ends.  A paladins job isnt to tank (tanking for emergency i understand) if a warrior is in group, we're downtime healers, emergency healers, add low dps, a little bit of crowd control with root/stuns.<br />
<br />
IMO, i feel more comfortable with at least 1 other tank in group, group seems more solid with 2+ tanks for some reason... I guess its just me, i gladly step down from MA status if a comparable warrior joined the xp group... it allows me do my job a lot better, which is keeping the rest of the group alive and keeping downtime to a minimum</div></div><hr />

Only ONE tank is needed in a group, that is a design flaw in itself. To fix that, the whole game has to be redone, ie: no crowd control, mobs shouting for help (no harmony style pulls), no FD pulling. Right now warriors are horribly broken with inadequate taunt, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If thats the case Lamini why are clerics, slowers and just about every other class getting large threads on their messageboards saying &quot;Hey,  these paladin/SK guys are the pwn&quot;? <br />
<br />
I've working in groups with SK's and paladins, I've watched them tank for hours with control of a mob so that it NEVER moved from them, setting aside the fact that looking at my control in comparison pisses me off to no end the idea of a tank never loosing control is wrong, part of that's the dumb flaming environment that allows single pull drone fests I agree but not having to regain control after a slow lands prior to the mob even reaching camp... that's broken.<br />
<br />
If Paladins want to push for more individualised spell lines that give them a clearer role in a group with or without a cleric, if knights in general want to call for a percentage of content which logically makes them the person to tank then i won't complain overhard. I'd actually support it because Verant/SoE's's Vision IS fundamentally flawed, but for knights to be Warrior AND spells in an EVERY exp group.. that i can't accept. <br />
<br />
Hell if you want to call for paladins to CH then go for it, it'll be fun to see the clerics screaming about how their exp group role is being eaten away because of their 'unique' role on a raid :p<br />

I wish most paladins took your view, I wish most Clerics and slowers took your view, they don't, and really why should they? unless something changes we don't save them enough and why the hell should any tank class expect as much control over the mob as you have? it's Broken ffs :P  I don't raid, plenty of people in this game don't raid, suggesting a balance between raid and exp is a fucking red herring and a handy little rationalisation for you knights! Suggesting i should be made a fifth wheel in exp groups the way any raid warrior additional to the one or two who end up tanking in a raid is,  because you don't get to tank a god is bullshit, plain and simple. Every time you cast a spell in this game that's one more thing extra you got out of the game than we did, we accepted that and the frustrations and one dimensional nature of our task because we were SUPPOSED to be the best at it!  Suddenly thats no longer the case in exp groups which is where I spent the VAST majority of my 110 days played! You stack in an exp group with me tanking, I'm an irrelevance if you already have a knight to tank, how the fuck do you think that makes me feel?!?..even when I'm ALLOWED to tank I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the knight would place less risk on the group!...and /defensive on a raid is supposed to be my compensation? Fuck it you can have it! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So, Would you give up all your spells for my 'prestige' position on a raid? <br />
<br />
Didn't think so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slightly irritated,<br />

Val  <br />
<br />
So, you knew you weren't casting spells when warrior was created?  So, now you want to rally your sad, sad, war mongering warriors to a futile cause to remove &quot;aggro-lock.&quot;<br />
<br />
The facts are warriors just need a bit more utility. Would more dps make you happy? What besides improving your aggro via taunt and nerfing pallies via stun nerfage would make the warriors stop bitching?  I see plenty of warriors finding groups- if their dps was higher they'd probably find even more groups. <br />
<br />
<br />
You want to take this from pallies and add that to warriors. <br />
Paladins already have lower caps on offense, defense, taunt, parry, and the rest.  Now, you want to cripple them further to improve your ego.<br />
<br />
My question is: What do you want to give paladins in return?  You want things to be equal? Give up something.  Don't just bitch and moan and want things to be one-sided.</div></div><hr />

No, I want(and I think Val would agree) to balance the three tank classes.  They should be equally desirable in exp situations, and their agro ability should be at a level that is reasonable.  You have lower skill caps in part to balance your spells.  To claim that it is crippling is just foolish.  With those lower skill caps, you are still the preferred tank in PoP.  What the idea behind this thread was in part is about discussing ideas to balance tanks against each other, and against the game, not about crippling knights.<br />
<br />

<br />
What do paladins want?  Good god, why should you get something in return for giving up the preferred tank spot?  If one class has more, and as a result is more desirable, and you want to balance out the two classes, you don't give things to the class that has more.  Things are one sided today.  Warriors don't get invited to groups unless their are no knights lfg who have the levels to get the job done.  We want to balance things, and mostly here we are discussing ways to do it without  returning things to the old days, when no one wanted knights to tank.  I fully believe that knights have to retain an edge in agro, just smaller than it currently is, to keep knights viable for exp groups, and keep them desiable.  Does that sound one sided?</div></div><hr />

See, paladins have those lower skill caps and that is also why they have nice aggro utility.   I have seen plenty of warriors getting groups- most people group with guild nowadays anyhow.  Any tank is acceptable in that situation.  I let my guild warriors tank in exp group if it makes them feel better.  <br />
<br />
I want warriors to have no complaints.  I don't think decreasing knight aggro is the answer.  As I said, give warriors more utility and things should be be better.  Warriors have a niche on raids, paladins have a les defined role (yes, we can do some things but warriors have THE job).  Why can't warrors see that they have a clear advantage on raids although paladins have one in groups.  That is a balance there in itself.  Maybe it is not a balance you like but it still exists.</div></div><hr />

Warriors do one thing, we tank.  It is what our class was designed as.  Knights where designed as utility tanks, hence those spells you get.  Now knights can tank, have utility, and have nearly unbeatable agro.  How about we get rid of your ability to tank and ask you to get by on utility?  After all, knights have utility as part of their class design.  Probably would be rough for you to find groups.  Yet you are quick to suggest that for us.<br />
<br />
Why can't warrors see that they have a clear advantage on raids although paladins have one in groups. That is a balance there in itself. Maybe it is not a balance you like but it still exists. <br />
<br />
Ok, let me make one thing clear here...2 or 3 warrios have a special raid role, they get a little glory.  So, because of that, you think it is balanced that we are not desirable for exp groups?  Any pally has a better raid role than a tank who is not actually tanking, and as most warriors are not actually tanking.  In fact, amny guilds are having knights tank trash mobs on way to the big /disc def mob.  Sorry, but your argument does not hold up.</div></div><hr />

we know that Paladins have better aggro as balance for having &quot;worse&quot; defense....<br />
<br />
It WOULD be a good way to balance... <br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
1) The defense difference HARDLY makes up for the aggro difference.<br />
<br />
2)You get tons of spells: roots, stuns, heals, buffs blablabla and LoH,<br />
we get NO spells and NO skills whatsover.<br />
<br />
3)You can solo certain mobs, we can't solo ANYTHING<br />
<br />
4)A Warrior that has worked HARD in the game, getting the best AA, the best Gear etc... Will STILL be outaggroed by ANY gimp paladin out there.<br />
<br />
A Paladin that has worked a bit in the game, getting the best AAs and best gear etc... Will OUTTANK most of the warriors out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
BOTTOMLINE:<br />
A Warrior with less hp then a paladin HAS NOTHING GOING FOR HIM! NADA, ZIT, POOP!!<br />
NOTHING!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Yet a paladin with less hp then a warrior will STILL BE FAVORITE IN A GROUP!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
and stfu about us being preferred on raids. That is NOT an argument,<br />
simply because only 2 or 3 warriors will be seriously tanking.<br />
<br />
All other Warriors are offtanking, which Knights do as well, And BETTER!<br />
<br />
On raids, Knights can offtank WITHOUT harming the mob, thus allowing enchanters to mez.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't people get a ç%/%&amp;(/&amp; REAL argument about class balance other then,<br />
but you get Defensive!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell me,<br />
if the cleric class ONLY had complete heal, NOTHING else, NADA....<br />
<br />
would you consider them balanced vs Druids?<br />
Which can very well heal in a group, as well as solo, dot, nuke, debuff, turn into a wolf, buff......<br />
<br />
no?<br />
BUT CLERICS GET COMPLETE HEAL!!!! MAKES THEM USEFULL ON RAIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
 As for issues with our aggro and nerfing stuns.  No nerfing our stuns won't fix all warriors problems but things are out of whack and correcting that makes sense.  Let me lay out an example for you:  What if a level 9 wizard spell created as much hate as their level 65, 6k nukes?  They'd get agro everytime they cast, tanks would have to scramble and hope taunt worked everytime that Wizard went to nuke anything.  Now imagine every nuke they got made the same amount of hate all the way up to 65, so only by the time they reached the upper levels would a wizard be able to function in a group.  That's the way our stuns work, they all create the same amount of hate, only it's a boon for us.  That's the fix that's needed, our low level stuns shouldn't make as much hate as our 60 plus stuns, it needs to be scaled.  This won't really affect how we function right now, a good paladin tries to use his better stuns to mitigate damage along with hold agro anyways but this brings mana management more into play.  <br />
<br />
Also you can't compare raid encounters to exp groups and balance strengths in one against the other, it's like apples and oranges.  We have utility that really shines in raids and warriors are built for one thing, tanking, that's what they do in raids, if your so envious of &quot;THE job&quot; make a warrior.  Also, how do you account for a casual player that wants to exp. and dungeon crawl if you make a class that balanced for raid use only?  <br />
<br />
Last thing, most warriors posting here aren't looking for more utility, they just want to be able to tank and many of them struggle to do it while knight classes have a far easier time.  They just want to be viable in the only spot they're suited for in groups. <br />

OMG, I am not envious of &quot;THE job.&quot; Warriors are the ones envious of the aggro.  <br />
<br />
This whole discussion, is in hindsight, moot. Stuns will not be changed.  It would game imbalancing.  Also, shadow knights and their hate line of spells which is built around them gaining aggro for exp or raid encounters would still be around. So, warriors would still be shit out of luck.  <br />
<br />
Warriors better stop looking at other classes and asking them to be nerfed and instead look towards gaining something a bit extra for themselves.  Adapt or die.  Make your groups adapt to your skills if they want some exp.  Are you warriors too timid to tell the tard overnuking or slowing a bit too early to wait like 5 seconds?  The majority of you, I assume, raid some.  It is common knowledge warriors need maybe 5 to 7 seconds to gain aggro.    If the AoW can be tanked for 7 seconds without slow then I am sure a golem in PoV or a giant in BoT can also. <br />
<br />
Also, I sure can compare raids to exp groups, SOE does when they add new spells and new AA abilities to classes.  To ignore that would be dumb.  You guys say its only three warriors. Three warriors (and more than that cuz' not every warriors makes it to every raid) in about 8 to 15 top to mid-level guilds per server.  Warriors are not the best choice for exp group, big whoopee-do.  Tanks do stack in many instances.  <br />
<br />
Let the pally or shd main tank and you do your thing with the add looking there dazed.  It works!!!  You guys are desirable for exp groups, you are just not the best choice to be the main tank for them.  Yes, you are designed to take damage and you can still do that.</div></div><hr />

It's interesting though that you mention this, because SK's often will group with warriors and enable the warriors to tank the mobs significantly better than without them.   I don't often play the games with aggro while grouped with an SK that I do with Paladins.     <br />

Did you know that in many guilds nowdays that Paladins outnumber warriors precisely because of their value on raids?   Of course not because you're still trying to slow the Avatar of War.    You have so many more raid roles than we do that it's not even funny, and to claim that because a couple of us are actually the *main tank* that this somehow balances weakness everywhere else is idiotic.    You have raid roles, LOTS of them, and often times that INCLUDES tanking raid level mobs, not to mention the fact that with the current unresistable or near unresistable AE's in many elemental encounters, having a Pally per group increases your success rate 10 fold.    Don't you DARE come in here and say that because a couple of us on a raid can hit /disc defensive and get healed.  <br />

So can rangers, what's your point?   As a matter of fact... I have to LOVE the current line of thought among Paladins.. it's EXACTLY the point warriors are saying.<br />

Here's the Jist of it:<br />
<br />
&quot;If we can't lock aggro, exp groups are just going to use rangers and beastlords to tank&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;Well according to you, you have more AC/HP, it's only fair that they have better aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You have so many more raid roles than we do that it's not even funny, and to claim that because a couple of us are actually the *main tank* that this somehow balances weakness everywhere else is idiotic.    You have raid roles, LOTS of them, and often times that INCLUDES tanking raid level mobs, not to mention the fact that with the current unresistable or near unresistable AE's in many elemental encounters, having a Pally per group increases your success rate 10 fold.    Don't you DARE come in here and say that because a couple of us on a raid can hit /disc defensive and get healed.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So can rangers, what's your point?   As a matter of fact... I have to LOVE the current line of thought among Paladins.. it's EXACTLY the point warriors are saying.<br />
<br />
Here's the Jist of it:<br />
<br />
&quot;If we can't lock aggro, exp groups are just going to use rangers and beastlords to tank&quot;<br />
<br />
My response is <br />
<br />
&quot;Well according to you, you have more AC/HP, it's only fair that they have better aggro&quot;.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So sorry, didn't mean to insinuate that the AoW can be slowed, I meant to say that if a warrior can take the initial beating before the CH chain is fully established then they can tank a PoP exp group mob easy.<br />
<br />
Hey, when you're grouped with a pally, know your role: offtank or dps, that is all.<br />
<br />
We won't agree on much because we are both looking at things from different viewpoints.  Give paladins all your boons and we'll grant you a nifty upgrade for aggro.  <br />
<br />
If you want to be Gods go play Diablo.  If you want to be a contributing member of the group then ask for upgrades (not nerfage of another class you fucking idiot!) that don't allow you to trample on the spots of others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got foot marks on my &quot;spots&quot; so bad you can't tell that there were ever spots on them.    The fact that you were slowly and consistently upgraded time and time and time and time again while we remained constant led us to the point where we're at now.<br />
<br />
Let me point out some Paladin and SK arguments of a couple years back:<br />
<br />
- &quot;We were told we're supposed to be 70% warrior, we just want that&quot;  (Now we all know that's a line of bullshit, because I'd be called &quot;a fucking idiot&quot; by you for 'asking for a nerf' if I asked for what you guys were asking for a couple years ago)<br />
<br />
- &quot;But warriors get Critical Hits&quot;  Wham, now warriors have the dubious distinction of.... getting the lowest critical hits in the game.<br />
<br />
- &quot;But warriors can dual wield&quot; Of course that's become irrelevant nowdays except that many of us still HAVE to dual wield against our desire.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Warriors get the highest AC/HP armor&quot; - Yeah, great... since late Velious/Early Luclin that's gone away too *except* for Raex armor, which on the melee side is *barely* better, and from the perspective of player upgrades is NOT as powerful as your armor.<br />
<br />
Yeah, don't presume to tell me about trampling on spots.  <br />
<br />
This one though is the best:<br />
<br />
Give paladins all your boons and we'll grant you a nifty upgrade for aggro. <br />
<br />
ROFL Boons... boons like what exactly?   What &quot;boons&quot; does a warrior bring to an experience group?    Name me ANYTHING that a warrior brings to an experience group that compensates for making the rest of the group tiptoe around aggro.   <br />
<br />
I want BALANCE, you want an unfair advantage, and you have the unmitigated gall to tell me that &quot;I want to be a god and shoudl play Diablo&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Well, my pally is 65 with pretty nice gear (6.7k hps buffed)- most pallies would be pretty satisfied with my equipment and I can't say how many times I hear: &quot;We need a warrior&quot; to take on the lower named in places like Tactics and maybe even BoT.  WTF, am I chopped liver?<br />
<br />
Nope, but warriors with their disc and their higher hps/tanking skills get the nod.  So, as I said, look for something to be added that makes you tank better but not paladins worse.  You advocate a nerf on pallies and it'll bite you on the ass.</div></div><hr />

either you need to be downgraded or we need upgraded, one of the two, but balance needs to come back. <br />
<br />
Back?  When was it balanced in the first place.<br />
<br />
Not to nitpick here, maybe you're speaking in general terms, but if you think things used to be balanced, they're just as balanced now. Just not in your favor any more.<br />
<br />
And it's equally not clear to me how a 20 percent advantage is being called insignificant. It's a significant (noticable) advantage that's overshadowed. Galtius' point that 4 complete heals, and a heal on the monk and 3 on the shaman is worse than 5 knight complete heals, but it's still 4 to 5. I really have a problem the usage of insignificant. It makes it sound like warriors have the same HP/AC as knights.  Checking top magelos reveals this to simply be not true.<br />
<br />
Not to continue to harp on this point... but it was never balanced -saying you want the balance back is like monks who still want it to be the way they used to be since they were balanced before the nerf.<br />
<br />
Or if I'm taking this out of context/intended meaning and when you say &quot;we want the balance back&quot; you mean &quot;we want to find a balance&quot; then that's ok. But from what I've seen of posts here, you really &quot;want the 'balance' back.&quot;</div></div><hr />

warrior disc aint worth shit but for 3 min or whatever the fuck it is! you my friend are a playy with a fucking god complex get off your god damn horse before you make my class look anymore stupid then you al;ready have.

Your high and mighty holyer then though shit don't flie with me your shit stinks just like mine! Pallys need nerfed period to bring back balance SK's prolly needed twinked a bit also not sure on that though I don't play one. Then once balance is re achived then SoEW can look at giving warriors a upgrade and then see if Knights need something after the war change. as it is we tank to fucking good for th eaggro we can generate palin and simple. SoWE messed up when they upped our taking ability as much as they did and diod not take into consideration or stun aggro ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you're telling me is that the &quot;boon&quot; is that we are considered &quot;better tanks&quot; on mobs with a 6-8 hour repop, even though you can tank them just fine, and this justifies the insane aggro deficiency?   I see, so park the ol 65 warrior at the named spot and camp to him every 6-8 hours... great idea.</div></div><hr />

No wonder they banned you from PoN. You've been brainwashed.  Who did it? Tell me, I must know who is brain washing the young paladins of Norrath to advocate nerfage to their own class.  You make yourself look stupid when you back up dumb campaigns.<br />
<br />
Warrior disc every 3 mins out of 9.  If it was 3 mins out of 72 mins like some paladins discs then I'd say you had a point but because you do not have a point cease and desist (STUNNED!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kiztent,<br />
<br />
Let's be realistic here just for a minute:<br />
<br />
The buffed hitpoint difference between equally geared knights and warriors is approximately 600-1000 hitpoints, correct?   I think we all agree with this.<br />
<br />
Now... let's look at avoidance differences:    It's been shown by both myself AND by Paladins (See PoN board, Lord protector's Citadel, Thread about skill mod items) that a 12% difference in skill caps equals a roughly 1.5% chance of being hit.<br />
<br />
So... the &quot;warrior advantage&quot; is this in a nutshell:<br />
<br />
1.5 to two extra hits per 100 are avoided by warriors<br />
<br />
He can absorb 1-2 extra hits per complete heal.<br />
<br />
Complete heal has a cast time of 10 seconds at a mana cost of 400.<br />
<br />
If you land a SINGLE stun which stops 2 hits from landing per complete heal, you've eliminated the &quot;advantage&quot;.   Gone, zippo, it's history the advantage is moot.<br />
<br />
A SK on the other hand... can cast Bite of Zefveer how often, actually returning a portion (1/4) of the mana to the cleric to &quot;reimburse&quot; for the &quot;cost&quot; also eliminating the &quot;5 to 4&quot; ratio.<br />
<br />
See, the thing is you guys like to play this game of Melee vs. Melee differences ignoring that which gives you your strength, which is your spell lineup.    You *never* use only melee, if you do, then you should roll up a warrior because you suck at your class, so comparing ONLY melee is inherently unfair.   <br />
<br />
Finally, healing on an unslowed mob is more expensive than healing a slowed mob, and we can ALL agree that currently warriors have to tank unslowed mobs more often than Knights do because of aggro limitations.    Between the above examples and this, the warrior &quot;advantage&quot; in tanking is not only gone, there's actually a tanking DISadvantage with a warrior.<br />
<br />
Having said all of that... let's look at the &quot;cost&quot; of losing aggro.<br />
<br />
1. Supernal Remedy and Supernal Elixir, the two most commonly used ancillary heals cost the *exact* same as Complete heal, the only difference being that they can be used with focus items.   Glatius' point is absolutely valid that healing with a heal that costs the SAME as complete heal makes the loss of aggro fairly enormous if it has to happen more than once.   I'm sure Gimmel will be happy to tell you about relative mana costs between having a warrior tank and a knight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brain washed huh? and that's a lovely reason to ban me from PoN cause I am brain washed yeah fuckin right. and yeah warrior reuse in disk should be short and untill they unhook it from the other discs it makes the rest worthless period and defensive aint worth shit in a exp group (so I am told anyway). let me spalin it real slow for all you pallies here.<br />
<br />
Pallys were not balanced to warriors in the &quot;dark ages of kunark&quot; although I never had issues back then. so SoE's answer was to make them tank as good as warriors (the skill cap difference is shit) there are parses around if you don't belive me. Well when SoE raied our tanking ability to that of warrios they neglected to think about our spells and the aggro they generate fo little mana cost. (heal spells still mana costly) so in essence SoE rebroke us but to the point it made all of you pallys have a god complex cause now generatring aggro was good cause you can tank liek a warrios it is no balanced I don't care how you slice it knights need to be brought back down to achive balance then SoE can look at upgradin shit but upgrades do no good untill balance is achived it just makes things worse. once you have something close to balance (no matter what SoE does it will piss off either class) then upgrade the warriors cause you know how much you will be changing balance.<br />
<br />
I hate to say it but I am very disapointed with my fellow class members atm they all seem bvlind to the issue and only want to keep the massive edge they have on the warrior class by getting the warriors upgraded closer to them and not nerfing themsleves. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's time I just go out and buy chutes and ladders cause if the pallys get thier way EQ will be so booring and repetitrious chutes and ladders would eb more fun.<br />
<br />
Without the need to think or have strats why even bother palying the game? oh I guwess it's fun to all of you to be able to just sit at the comp and stun a mob getting exp while cybering some wood elf chick or watching MTV while you play and not have to worry about dieing.<br />
<br />
Pallys = lame (IMHO and yeah I guess that makes me lame it's sad my class has degraded to what it has and it saddens me maybe it's time to hang up the armor and weapons. Because EQ as the pallys would have it just doesent sound fun to me)</div></div><hr />

It is at best marginally useful, probably about as useful as LoH, perhaps a bit more.  But not something you can use regularly and don't forget when a Warrior uses defensive his damage output drops by something like 40%, which means his aggro generation drops through the floor and people have to be even MORE careful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know how many times I can say how completly full of crap and how fricking arrogant this statement is! <br />
<br />
Let me translate your statement for you here:<br />
Hey Warrior, when you're grouped with a HYBRID of YOUR class, know your role: offtank or dps.... So what I am saying is that a class who is PART Warrior should be able to tank better than someone who is a FULL Warrior.<br />
<br />
The fact that you can even suggest that is complete and total BS BS BS BS!<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Ok now that I have stepped away from my computer lets get back to the thread in general...<br />
<br />
There has been a lot of suggestions through out this entire thread about aggro how it relates to each class. Here is my look at that:<br />
<br />
Changeing Stuns to lower aggro, uping taunt, removeing/lowering  aggro from spells like slow, they all boil down to the same thing. Balanceing out the taunt between knights or warriors. So which ever your advocating, its all the same thing so lets get to the real issue all the Pallies are having with the idea of us haveing equal aggro lock...<br />
<br />
Pallies are screaming that if Warriors can aggro lock just as good as hybrids then we will be back to the Kunark age and them being the red headed step children of EQ.<br />
<br />
BS! Complete and total BS! Now I am not saying that at one time you were not the red headed step child of eq but that has all long been changed.<br />
<br />
Your armor has been increased. Your hit points have been increased. You no longer steal exp from your groups by just being in them. Your migration has been increased to the exact same migration we have. &lt;-- Those were the reasons you were the RHSC of EQ in the Kunark age!<br />
<br />
You can self buff to almost match our HPs and AC. You can heal, stun, buff the group, many other things and you have already proven that you can be the main tank for exp mobs that hit for 500+.<br />
<br />
So sure giving us aggro lock may just make us wanted again as the primary tank. This however does not eliminate you or your role as a tank! What this does is allows us to come into EQ and say LFG and actually have a chance to get a group! <br />
<br />
I know while playing my shammy that should I need a tank and both classes could offer the exact same aggro lock and I was forming up a group I would see no difference in picking either a warrior or pally. <br />
<br />
I am not picky and just want to exp. I hate having to stress over a game and worry that someone is going to die and get pissed. I advocate for improved taunt for warriors and not lowering aggro lock.<br />
<br />
I do see that some people have a problem with the high end game and holding aggro lock would change these encounters. I dont necessarly agree this is all bad, but I do see it. If this is what the deciding factor was then in this case I would advocate for a Taunt2.<br />
<br />
Taunt2 - Works 95% of the time on mobs up to level 65. Perfect for EXP mobs but most raid level mobs you are still stuck with Taunt and the RNG on procs :)<br />
<br />
I must state that I would prefer not to have two Taunts and that taunt2 would be a last resort if it came down to no taunt or this taunt I would rather have something :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you land a SINGLE stun which stops 2 hits from landing per complete heal, you've eliminated the &quot;advantage&quot;.   Gone, zippo, it's history the advantage is moot.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Shrug.  I was going off Kazzuk's thread on debunking tanking myths.  It shows warriors with a ~200 AC advantage at the top end (he compared magelo's 15-20 for the relevant classes on eqrankings) which according to the AC parse on this board is a ~10 percent decrease in damage taken (the thread plots DPS versus AC).  Kazzuk's selected Magelos also showed warriors with a ~10 percent HP advantage.<br />
<br />
That nets out to a 20 percent advantage (it's a touch higher, but close enough) in pure melee. I don't know how stun mitigates that - and I'm willing to bet most people don't either.  People didn't take paladins as tanks before PoP, and they had the same stuns then as they do now.<br />

See, the thing is you guys like to play this game of Melee vs. Melee differences ignoring that which gives you your strength, which is your spell lineup.    You *never* use only melee, if you do, then you should roll up a warrior because you suck at your class, so comparing ONLY melee is inherently unfair.<br />
<br />
Well, since we're talking about desirablity for groups, I can say with total assurance that this utility - at least until PoP - that you like to point out doesn't mean a thing for groups.  Which is why knights like to compare melee strengths. I'm not sure how all those neat SK PoP spells impact group selection, but my suspicion that that it will have the same impact on group selection as all the other utility spells both classes have had.  None.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I'd never play a character as one dimensional as a warrior, I love the utility my spells grant - but we're talking about who gets the tank slot. Utility is a red herring.  Knights had aggro lock from the day the game came out, and until PoP and the &quot;must slow now mobs&quot; that aggro lock didn't matter a bit.  All the utility that knights have does next to nothing to get them groups.  You saying knights have utility is the same class of red herring as knights citing defensive for warriors being gimped in groups (the &quot;you guys own raid tanking, suck it up&quot; line of arguements).<br />
<br />
You reply - correctly - that defensive doesn't make a difference in grouping.  You may think so, but I've heard too many time &quot;must have defensive warrior&quot; to believe that the people that pick groups think that. Right or wrong it's still the perception. <br />
<br />
In the same way, you may think utility give knights group invites, but it doesn't.  It's all about the easiest exp. And the warrior (perceived) mitigation advantage has weathered quite a few expansions as the sole determinant of tank selection.<br />

Agreed.  Unfortunately, the better mitigation is still out there - today, at the top end.  Mitigation just isn't a factor for filling a group slot (within reason - otherwise rangers would be the top tank choice).  Once snap aggro is removed as a factor (that is, warriors get the &quot;fix&quot; they are asking for), guess what happens then. If you guessed knights never get groups, you guessed right.</div></div><hr />

And knights shouldn't be the #1 choice for tank, thats what you refuse to acknowledge, warriors gave up utility to be the BEST tanks and we aren't. If you can't hold the mob on you, and the slower has to wait to slow, our hp/AC advantage mean NOTHING! <br />
&gt;Hybrids have spells, all you morons discount how great of an ability that amounts to. Warriors DIE traveling some zones unless babysat through them because we can't root a mob and park it while we travel though. Or darkness it and outrun it. <br />
&gt;We can't solo worth a damn, worse with rogues at it at ALL levels. SKs can solo damn well to at least level 60, and Paladins can solo into at least the 50's (because of KEI, there is no buff for warriors like this one).<br />
&gt;Okay, then lets not fix taunt (since you don't feel its important). Then I DEMAND to be able to solo as well as a SK and travel as well as a hybrid! Got it now? WARRIORS SHOULD BE FIRST CHOICE FOR TANK!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

This is the kind of hyperbolae that drives me crazy.    <br />
<br />
Let me give you a for instance:<br />
<br />
You discount Zefveer's, but the reality is, a cleric looks at how many times he or she gets low on mana when considering a &quot;good tank&quot;.   If you're replenishing that which you take away at a similar rate, then it's going to be the same thing regardless, or if you're preventing damage from occurring then it's going to have the same net effect on a mana bar.   <br />
<br />
No one can sit here and seriously expect me to believe that a Knight will be considered &quot;untankable&quot; after having tanked for the last 8 months without incident and all of a sudden you're not going to get groups because an unfair advantage has been removed.   That's preposterous.  The fact is you won't get them nearly as easy as you do today, and it's RIGHT that you don't.   You have too much of an advantage.<br />

Incidentally, warriors were shat upon during Luclin as well, this isn't a PoP phenomina.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Frodlin, but I don't buy this. I'd counter by pointing out that warriors were the only choice for a tank for 3 years and promptly got thrown under the bus when slowing fast became essential (if that wasn't the case we wouldn't be having this discussion). I'd also point out that this &quot;unfair advantage&quot; didn't get knights groups for years, not reliably until PoP in fact (in Luclin a few SKs had used snap aggro to push their way into offtanking positions, but the joke about a SKs role on raids being to FD out of AoE range until SK only loot dropped wasn't inaccurate then). Once snap aggro becomes a non-issue, I see things going back to the way they were - I don't see how they couldn't.  Warriors still have real and perceived mitigation advantages - just like they did when they dominated the tanking landscape.  But the only way to find out is to prove one or the other of us wrong by changing snap aggro.</div></div><hr />

Things will NOT go back the way they were because people know pallys and sk's can tank well enough to warrent the tank position so even is knightrs lost &quot;snap aggro&quot; they would still get groups just liek warriors. the difference you are talking about in ttanking ability is so small most people will nto see it in a group enviroment period. so wheaterh you nerf knights or raise warriors the chises for groups will be between the 3 clases some have +'s others dfont and vise versa but all would beinterchangable on the general grind. there should be no fear of going back to kunark if there is then it's unfounded and it's people crying wolf when there is no wolf.</div></div><hr />

The context is significantly different now, we both know this.   Prior to this point, no one would give the Pal or SK the opportunity to show that they COULD tank, so the myth persisted even though there were a few of us who knew by the end of Velious that this was going to become a big issue.<br />
<br />
Having been given that chance to actually *show* that they were capable of doing the job, it's not really the same.  The Genie is out of the bottle now, it's absolutely clear that any of the 3 plate tank classes are capable of tanking mobs from a defensive melee perspective, two of those classes simply have currently an unfair advantage over the 3rd.<br />
<br />
The other thing that was different from then until now was mana regeneration.   During the &quot;old days&quot;, mana regen was very low, so the prospect of actually running low on or out of mana was a big deal, so the class that took less mana to get to that point had a clear advantage, tacked along with the hybrid experience penalty I'd say it was an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; just as there exists one today.   The rate of mana regeneration has dramatically increased though, so the perceived 'cost' between classes is much smaller than it has ever been up to this point without even considering aggro.  I'd go so far as calling it &quot;balanced&quot;.    The thing is, once you ad that extreme aggro difference, the balance turns into horse puckey.</div></div><hr />

OK, you have missed the boat. Period.<br />
<br />
The only reason why knights get tanking spots is because of their snap aggro.  Warriors make a better meat shield so if aggro is diminished then knights take a back seat because warrior hp/ac is better.<br />

Is this so hard to fathom? Any argument to the contrary is absurd.<br />

I call BS on the above. Players in EQ don't change opinios very fast if at all look how long i ttook them to relise knighgts can tank.. if they toned down our aggro or mande it cost more mana players would still have the same opinion on our tankablility and from the time they have spent watching us tank in PoP they know we can tank as well as any warrior on mobs that can't one round us. so in short pallys are crying wolf plain and simple there is no going back to kunark for us now that people have saeen us tank period.</div></div><hr />

Paladins aggro lock because a shaman (even worse, and enchanter) would have no chance in hell of surviving an unsloed mob duoing for 800 per round. This is why warriors need an improvment and Paladins do NOT need a nerf.<br />
<br />
If you entertain yourself with this romantic notion that chaos is somehow fun and dieing is fun, then yes it makes sence to leave aggro on warriors as is an nerf paladin aggro. But as you see dieing and downtime suck so its rediculous to ask for a nerf, warriors DO need an improvement that will make them more viable.</div></div><hr />

I grind on 63 and 64 mobs, and they hit for exactly that and yes it's too easy when I can 4 or 5 box and get 3 to 4% exp per kill (aa exp that is).<br />

for the hell of it I killed a few wihtout stuns and it was not difficult just let the mob hit me for 15 seoncds One or 2  CH's (my hp just over 4k so I use a bit more ch's then normal) before chanter slows simple as that.<br />

It is at best marginally useful, probably about as useful as LoH, perhaps a bit more.  But not something you can use regularly and don't forget when a Warrior uses defensive his damage output drops by something like 40%, which means his aggro generation drops through the floor and people have to be even MORE careful.  <br />
<br />
I agree....no one ever &quot;plans&quot; to use Lay Hands during an exp group so I would imagine no Warrior is counting to use &quot;/disc defensive&quot; as well.  These skills are just too costly to misuse or blow on whim.<br />
<br />
This brings up a small point of history: why was Defensive hampered by a 40% reduction in melee output originally?  I'm kind of fuzzy on the Kuarnk Age reasons but it seems to me that this restriction is too costly for what Defensive does in the POP Age.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. Cyphon and others are absolutely right.  One of the big points as to why Warriors are in bad shape is because of the environment change of POP.  If you aren't at least going to the POP environment where there are problems why are you so sure about your stance?</div></div><hr />

First of all I have to respond to this cuz it just $%#@$ pisses me off, and it is BS.<br />
<br />
I dont know how many times I can say how completly full of crap and how fricking arrogant this statement is! <br />
<br />
Let me translate your statement for you here:<br />
Hey Warrior, when you're grouped with a HYBRID of YOUR class, know your role: offtank or dps.... So what I am saying is that a class who is PART Warrior should be able to tank better than someone who is a FULL Warrior.<br />
<br />
The fact that you can even suggest that is complete and total BS BS BS BS!<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Ok now that I have stepped away from my computer lets get back to the thread in general...<br />
<br />
There has been a lot of suggestions through out this entire thread about aggro how it relates to each class. Here is my look at that:<br />
<br />
Changeing Stuns to lower aggro, uping taunt, removeing/lowering  aggro from spells like slow, they all boil down to the same thing. Balanceing out the taunt between knights or warriors. So which ever your advocating, its all the same thing so lets get to the real issue all the Pallies are having with the idea of us haveing equal aggro lock...<br />
<br />
Pallies are screaming that if Warriors can aggro lock just as good as hybrids then we will be back to the Kunark age and them being the red headed step children of EQ.<br />
<br />
BS! Complete and total BS! Now I am not saying that at one time you were not the red headed step child of eq but that has all long been changed.<br />
<br />
Your armor has been increased. Your hit points have been increased. You no longer steal exp from your groups by just being in them. Your migration has been increased to the exact same migration we have. &lt;-- Those were the reasons you were the RHSC of EQ in the Kunark age!<br />
<br />
You can self buff to almost match our HPs and AC. You can heal, stun, buff the group, many other things and you have already proven that you can be the main tank for exp mobs that hit for 500+.<br />
<br />
So sure giving us aggro lock may just make us wanted again as the primary tank. This however does not eliminate you or your role as a tank! What this does is allows us to come into EQ and say LFG and actually have a chance to get a group! <br />
<br />
I know while playing my shammy that should I need a tank and both classes could offer the exact same aggro lock and I was forming up a group I would see no difference in picking either a warrior or pally. <br />
<br />
I am not picky and just want to exp. I hate having to stress over a game and worry that someone is going to die and get pissed. I advocate for improved taunt for warriors and not lowering aggro lock.<br />
<br />
I do see that some people have a problem with the high end game and holding aggro lock would change these encounters. I dont necessarly agree this is all bad, but I do see it. If this is what the deciding factor was then in this case I would advocate for a Taunt2.<br />
<br />
Taunt2 - Works 95% of the time on mobs up to level 65. Perfect for EXP mobs but most raid level mobs you are still stuck with Taunt and the RNG on procs :)<br />
<br />
I must state that I would prefer not to have two Taunts and that taunt2 would be a last resort if it came down to no taunt or this taunt I would rather have something :)  <br />
<br />
Don't agree? I don't care, it is the truth.<br />
<br />
This right here goes out to every warrior who wants to nerf my class.<br />
<br />
Next time I lower myself to group with a warrior this is I want your gimp asses to do: When I get below 50% your bitch ass better /shield me.  If I want to take a break for snacks, you will MT your best (which is 30% of what I can do) until I want the job back.<br />
<br />
Got any other issues? Too fucking bad, there ain't shit you can do about it. Go find another group, where you WILL be a liability, and 7/10 cause them to die cuz you are so gimped.<br />

This is nonsense. Knights get groups because they can tank groups -- they have the AC, hps and abilities to do that. They EXCEL in exp groups because of their snap aggro.</div></div><hr />

Well, since we're talking about desirablity for groups, I can say with total assurance that this utility - at least until PoP - that you like to point out doesn't mean a thing for groups.  Which is why knights like to compare melee strengths. I'm not sure how all those neat SK PoP spells impact group selection, but my suspicion that that it will have the same impact on group selection as all the other utility spells both classes have had.  None.  <br />
<br />
I love how the knights arguing this point tend to slip and slide around the whole &quot;utility&quot; thing, as if that spellbook and the 3500 points of fast-regenning mana they have to use it with don't mean anything.<br />
<br />
That &quot;utility&quot; is part and parcel of what knights *are*. They don't get groups for their ability to root, but that doesn't mean having root is worthless and shouldn't be counted. They may not get groups for their ability to resurrect, and yet there are many times and many group configurations where that's really useful. They may not get groups for group heals, flash heals, buffs, etc, but all that adds up and is part and parcel of their class. You can't just evoke some bizarre argument of contiguity and say that since those things aren't directly involved in tanking, that they are useless for balance considerations. Obviously they are, and any knight who says they aren't is blowing smoke.</div></div><hr />

You're talking out of your ass.  Enchanters, shamans, rangers, druids, clerics, wizards, beastlords, mages, and necros can all generate snap aggro as well as a Paladin or even better.  Yet you don't see them typically tanking for a group.  Why is that?  Well, if you'd stop talking out of your ass, you'd know it's because Knights have the AC/HP/avoidance skills/assorted spells that assist with tanking, to make them a more efficient tank than those other classes.<br />
<br />
You might try and argue that if Warriors had snap aggro they'd be a more efficient tank than the Knights so they would get the majority of groups.  I disagree.  I think people would just get whichever tank happened to come along first, because the Knights still bring other things to the table that Warriors don't.<br />
<br />
You're living in paranoid land, terrified that Warriors might actually become an acceptable tank for the majority of players again and your little monopoly will be gone.

Pallies tank 90% as well as warriors. This difference is not especially noticeable in XP groups. And the paladin brings something to the table that the warrior simply cannot - aggro generation on demand.<br />
<br />
As for your claim that everything that paladins have, other classes do better, you're full of it. I can think of two things right off the top of my head that pallies are the best in the game at, and that's HP buffs that stack with cle/sham buffs in BSS, which is better than BOTH the Beastlord and Ranger versions, AND you also happen to have the fastest heals in the game.<br />

I say that because for getting groups - the thing under discussion here - they don't.  This isn't a discussion about why I prefer to play a knight (though I didn't pick the utility, I happen to like it), it's a discussion about who gets groups and why.  And the fact is that all this utility amounted to close to zero in terms of getting groups until snap aggro was deemed essential for groups. That's a pretty recent development.<br />

<br />
Nonsense.  Consider the following 2 phrases before PoP:<br />
&quot;We can't do that without a warrior.&quot;<br />
&quot;We can't do that without a shadowknight.&quot; (or paladin)<br />
<br />
Ever hear the first one? I bet you did.  I know I did all the time - well maybe you heard something like &quot;ok, warrior's here, we can do that now.&quot;.  Ever hear the second one before people cracked third tier PoP? Don't make me laugh.<br />
<br />
QED.  <br />
<br />
Knights ignore utility because quite simply, it never mattered for getting a group - and I'm of the opinion that if warriors get snap aggro we'll (knights) be in the same boat as before PoP. It's not like we want to knock our class - heck I'd bet that most warriors don't know half of what a knight can bring to a group, knights have utility shooting out the ass, always have, never mattered until now. <br />
<br />
I didn't see warriors clamoring for snap aggro until recently.  Nope, nope, we got defensive, we own raid tanking, we're essential for groups, life is good. Knight utility? Don't need it, they need it to solo 'cause I got a group. Bitter? Hell yeah we are. Paranoid? You bet. We remember all too well what life was like when warriors sat in the driver's seat. I don't have any desire to go back to those days, and I know exactly how much my utility you keep talking up while glossing over your mitigation advantage means.</div></div><hr />

It's my position that while there *may* be a minor difference, it's so little that on a day to day basis, many people can't even see any kind of significant difference in damage mitigation between hybrids and warriors, while they *can* see concrete benefits in the form of buffs, fast heals, group heals, and aggro lockdown.</div></div><hr />

Well, when a *shadowknight* says his utility abilities don't get him groups, you *know* he's talking out of his ass. FD pulling anyone?  <br />
<br />
Monks anyone?  Now, admittedly, the monk nerf happened around PoP time so it's hard to separate the two - but before then, monks FD faster (no cast time and faster recycle - though death peace at 60 mitigates this some), had disciplines to mitigate a failed FD (stonestance, SKs got harmshield just before PoP which has the same net effect - save your ass when you fall to the ground), better mitigation, same hitpoints, oh, and 50 more damage output (at least).<br />
<br />
Maybe that has changed, but just like the warrior had to be the tank, the monk had to be the puller.<br />
<br />
Maybe the perception has changed, and FD pulling is useful utility.  Wasn't before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see to remember us discussing problems with taunt and holding aggro against other classes for ages...<br />
<br />
Taunt problems  are not new, people DEALT with them. Slowers waited a few seconds, nukes didnt go off on incomming, debuffs werent used to pull, dps didnt go full bore before the mob entered camp... <br />
<br />
Going OOM used to be a reality, it no longer is...<br />
Fights used to last longer, now they are absurdly short.<br />
Warriors had a signifigant advantage in Tanking ability, so people dealt with it, they no longer do...<br />
Knights could tank, it was just a little more in-efficient, it no longer is...<br />
New Spells, Gear , AA's have incresed the abilities of all... except warriors, all we got was hps...<br />
<br />
If you ask me, and I have thought about it a lot. The problem is that it is a totally different game now than when warriors were created, and at no time have we ever been updated, sure we get new gear, so does everyone. New Spells, New Focus effects, AA's do a lot more to increase other classes than any do to increase a warrior's abilities.  The game has been reduced in risk and dumbed down so much, no longer do the warrior tactics needed.<br />
<br />
No longer is aggro management a skill used by players, it is something to be looked at with disdain...<br />
<br />
PoP, with its utterly INSANE exp modifier, has made it so that by far the most important thing is for people to pull as fast as possible, kill as fast as possible, and only with a knight tanking does that happen. <br />
<br />
Our GL/RL was out of town for about a week, so raids slowed down, people went to exp and do other things, we took a little break. When we started up raids, OMG, it was like people took everything they knew about aggro and threw it out the damn window. Not any of our warriors could effectively hold aggro. Why? Because people were so used to aggro-lock for a week, where  they didnt have to worry about aggro.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think AGGRO-LOCK is very bad for the game. If I had my choice we would all need to manage aggro, everyone has tools to do it  with, except warriors. Not like this would HURT anyone, they all have the ability, just no one needs to use it. Removing AGGRO-LOCK would appear to KNIGHTS as a NERF, but was it ever supposed to be there in the first place? Why have such an elaborate aggro management system designed, when one class with a simple fast cheap spell, can circumvent and prevent any consequences for everyone else? Originally, when KNIGHTS were not 90% warriors, it was BAD for them to lock aggro, they could use snap=-aggro to save the ENC, or the CLERIC.. imagine that! Knights being defenders and protecting others... It was BAD if they locked aggro as they couldnt take the punishment... my goodness that was almost balanced, they were too weak, and needed some upgrades, but what really hurt was the exp penalty, percieved or real people did not want to lose exp, it was too hard to come by. That no longer is the case ...<br />
<br />
<br />
What do i think is more likely? We need to push for warriors getting an equivalent ability to lock aggro. Some say this will trivialize encounters. To that I call BULLSHIT... I want someone to show me this... this anecdotal 'it will trivialize' is pure BS.<br />
<br />
Our problem is twofold... <br />
<br />
One.. is Paladins are screaming and crying... KUNARK! KUNARK!.... We want defensive... waaa waa waa...  they dont want nerfed, they are trying to protect the turf they have been given. IMO, we can just ignore them, that is little problem. All classes have inter-class rivalry and jealousy.<br />
<br />
Two.. is a bigger problem. It is the Warriors here, who are either so UBER they dont know how 99% of the game is played or they are too proud and stubborn to admit there is a problem... <br />
<br />
Why do other classes get fixxed? Because they stick together, they come up with whats wrong and they unify, they say this is whats wrong please fix it... <br />
<br />
sure they may ask for the moon... ie Druids and Rez's.. <br />
<br />
but druids did get  a 75% heal, and a lot of upgrades to what was always one of the most powerful classes... They can solo, be MH is exp groups, be in CH rotations on Raids, and PL people like crazy.. why? BECAUSE they demanded as ONE a FIXX! <br />
<br />
We need to stop this petty bickering.<br />
We need to stop, standing around, whipping it out and saying, MINE is bigger, I have no problem...<br />
<br />
Until we do that, we have no reason to believe anything will change...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll repost from http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1365&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=2<br />
<br />
The AC and HP numbers are taken from eqrankings, mitigation by AC taken from Steelwarriors (thread referenced in repost).<br />
<br />
Warriors mitigation (both in more damage can be taken between complete heals and damage taken slower due to better AC) is as much better than knights and knights is better than rangers (using the same metrics).<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that rangers mitigate as well as warriors, I'd love to see you try it with a straight face.  <br />
<br />
IF <br />
1 - warriors are better than knights but not by an important amount, <br />
2 - knights mitigate better than rangers by that same (unimportant) amount<br />
<br />
THEN<br />
rangers mitigate as well as warriors<br />
<br />
OR <br />
the assumption that warriors mitigation advantage is negligible is incorrect.  <br />
<br />
Pick one.  Or if you don't like the numbers Kazzuk picked to illustrate his point, show me some better numbers to use.<br />
<br />
It's my position that the still superior warrior mitigation is overshadowed by the ability to slow faster with a knight tanking. Removing that advantage will bring warrior's unquestioned advantage to the forefront again, making it the sole determinant for grouping.<br />
<br />
--- repost follows ---<br />
I just think it's interesting that warriors advantages don't count here.<br />
<br />
Compared to shadowknights we're talking about a 15 percent AC advantage (1892 average versus 1722) and a 10 percent hit point advantage. In terms of overall mitigation, that's a 26 percent swing in favor of the warriors, yet it's not significant (warriors can take more damage between heals and take damage slower).<br />
<br />
According to this thread: http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/sh...s=&amp;threadid=145<br />
<br />
mitigation seems linear with AC from about 1700 to 1900 - the range our 'average' people fall into.<br />
<br />
Just for comparison:<br />
http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;...erver=&amp;order=HP<br />
<br />
The same listing for rangers weighs in at 4984 HP average and 1517 AC. That is, for those of you keeping score at home, a 13 percent AC advantage for knights and 15 percent HP swing. Total mitigation swing ranger to knight : 30 percent.<br />
<br />
So in terms of mitigation, warriors are to knights as knights are to rangers (actually rangers are slightly worse relative to knights than warriors to knight, but close enough, eh).<br />

1 - Shadowknights are NOT noble defenders<br />

2 - Shadowknights, as you may or may not know, had their aggro generating abilities unintentionally crippled when disease counters were added to slow.

Rangers are 240 defense.  All I have to judge mitigation on is AC -which is composed of avoidance (parry, dodge, riposte) and mitigation (defense).  If you look at the AC numbers, that ought to take into account the different skill caps.<br />
<br />
Admittedly it's a bit rough because of the different types of AC and how they impact mitigation (defense was worthless in luclin, etc.), so I'll drop the comparison.<br />
<br />
From another tack: <br />
You're telling me that a 25 percent advantage is insignificant. So, if I had the same AC as a warrior and the warrior had 5000 hp to my 4000, that wouldn't make a difference in group selection. That's an insignificant advantage?</div></div><hr />

Great posts.  The real reason why warriors neglect to mention this is because they feel that shadow knights stack with them better than paladins (and it is true to a point, their hate spells are buffs) and thus, the paladin is the root of all their problems. <br />
<br />
If paladins could help warriors gain aggro as well, this thread might not even exist.</div></div><hr />

Monks anyone?  Now, admittedly, the monk nerf happened around PoP time so it's hard to separate the two - but before then, monks FD faster (no cast time and faster recycle - though death peace at 60 mitigates this some), had disciplines to mitigate a failed FD (stonestance, SKs got harmshield just before PoP which has the same net effect - save your ass when you fall to the ground), better mitigation, same hitpoints, oh, and 50 more damage output (at least).<br />
<br />
Maybe that has changed, but just like the warrior had to be the tank, the monk had to be the puller.<br />
<br />
Maybe the perception has changed, and FD pulling is useful utility.  Wasn't before.  <br />
<br />
It just gets dumber and dumber. Now FD is worthless for SKs because monks used to be over-powered? Only monks could pull? Umm...let me tell my guild sks that all these years they've been FD pulling that it was worthless the whole time and didn't help them get groups -- or even help the guild. Except that I *know* this is crap. <br />
<br />
Hell, our guild raidleader is an SK, and FD splits spawns for us from PoS minis to Vindi and Statue. I grouped with an SK who FD split everything from Chardok to the Hole. The whole idea I'm sitting here arguing that FD for SKs is a useful ability with a *SK* is a sad joke.<br />
<br />
And Kiztent's idea that FD pulling might be useful now but wasn't before actually stands EQ history on its head. If anything with the rise of lull, pacify and harmony, and people fighting in gimp outdoor zones all the time, FD pulling has taken a hit recently. But in the past it was the bomb, and it's still extremely useful.<br />
<br />
Give it up, Kiztent. You're way off base here. Simply accept the sad fact that you do actually have a useful utility ability, and that this utility ability helps SKs get groups.</div></div><hr />

The fact that the second best tanks in the game can generate insane amounts of aggro is a hard one for people to see as balanced. It is even harder for people to see it as balanced when you consider the disparity of aggro generation between knights, warriors and even other melee classes. <br />
<br />
Take, for example, the Monk class. Monks  now have less defensive properties than the knight classes, yet somehow do not generate more aggro than them.  Knights say to warriors that because they have better damage absorption properties than a knight they should generate less aggro than them. I ask you this: Should knights generate less aggro than monks because monks have lesser defense skills?<br />
<br />
You will say knights have aggro as part of their class features: I will say knights have tanking as part of their class features.<br />
<br />
You will also talk of working with other tanks to gain aggro.<br />
I will say that there needs only be one tank in a group.<br />
<br />
I will also say that having a tanking class rely on another tanking class is a bad thing. If anything, classes with lesser defensive skills than a tanking class but higher than a healer ( I.E. monks~ ) should be the &quot;aggro&quot; classes. This would  keep casters somewhat safe while having the tanking classes maintain an exceptionally higher damage absorption power so as to make it be horribly inefficient to use one of said &quot;aggro classes&quot; to tank.<br />

Damn selfish to try to cripple another class just for your own well being.  I have said it time and time again, don't try to take away from someone else.  Instead, look for something to be added to you that is not game breaking.<br />

As my dear Kizz stated, Shadow Knights have been built over the past year or so as aggro builders to take that away would be counter-productive.</div></div><hr />

Think what you like.  I only know what I had to deal with.  And what I had to deal with is the perception that SKs could pull if you couldn't find a monk - with the exception of a few specialty pulls that SKs had a real advantage in.  Kinda like warriors can tank if you can't find a knight - except on raids, except it's not happening to you not me this time.<br />
<br />
Really take some sack to call someone dumb for complaining about the same type of thing you're so vocally complaining about right now.  That would make your aggro lock arguements... dumb.  Or you a complete hypocrite. Guess there's no need to look any further for a fix, warriors think being second string is ok, and asking for fixes is dumb. Thanks, drive through.<br />
<br />
I know that the monk nerf was one of the best thing that happened to the SK class.  We went from doing everything a monk did worse than a monk to having some real advantages over the class in some areas.  Sound familiar? Or did you have more stupid insults to throw out.</div></div><hr />

Remember these two numbers:<br />
<br />
SK:  355<br />
<br />
Warrior: 392<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now a little bit about EQrankings....<br />
<br />
It's a pretty established fact that people force their stats upwards in Magelo so that they can get ahead in the 'EQRankings race'.   It isn't very often that top end warriors in an experience group are going to be using their BF/AOE combo any more than knights in experience groups are going to be using their Axe/Shield combo.<br />
<br />
To decipher this penis wagging, what we need to do is consider the following:<br />
<br />
Does the gear which goes into each slot somehow give a better AC advantage to a warrior than to a knight?<br />
<br />
In all but the primary visible armor slots, the answer is a resounding no... all the best gear is equippable by multiple classes, including both tank types.    What then are we left with?   The two numbers I just gave you, which are the difference between warrior's elemental armor and knight's elemental armor.   37AC.   That's the big difference, the entirety of what you're talking about here, not 25%, not anything but 37AC.<br />
<br />
If you use Cloak of Luclin, then it drops to 19AC, and if you're really an AC nut, you could use torrent of pain to add an additional 12AC bringing the total to a whopping 7AC.<br />
<br />
If you're a Paladin, you pop on Aura of the Crusader for 30 of that 37AC and it's all over with just one spell.<br />
<br />
7AC... that's the &quot;warrior advantage&quot;.. that's what we give up EVERYTHING for.  A WHOPPING SEVEN ARMOR CLASS POINTS!    You can drag me through all sorts of pumped up magelos of the penis waggers on EQRankings who put in their AC wrong on Magelo to begin with (Note the cleric in crap gear being #2 in AC serverwide), the fact is, you take the gear that people can equip and compare it to one another.    <br />
<br />
Having said ALL of that.... and SHOWN it... you STILL &quot;reimburse&quot; your cleric for partial mana spent on complete heal AND Paladins STILL can totally *prevent* melee damage, and each class can STILL heal themselves and we're STILL supposed to be crippled in aggro?   Why the hell should this be?    Again... I repeat the question WHAT does a warrior bring to an experience group that compensates for this?</div></div><hr />

Snap aggro is not just about the initial pull and waiting on tash/slow! The only time it really matters is when someone gains aggro and is about to die! That is what matters and that is what saves lives! But its ok for your groups not to have to wait or even think about aggro, /boggle!<br />
<br />
But back to what you said. Screw that! Why in the heck should it be safer to tank with the HYBRID than the actuall Warrior. Your thinking just boggles me! Crap I am not even asking for much. I just want my snap aggro to be the same as the stupid HYBRID of my class so I can actually tank!<br />
<br />
I didnt ask to nerf knights in any shape or form. Giving me snap aggro is not going to change a thing. Knights have already proven that they can tank! You guys are so %$@# close to us in stats its not even funny! Then to top all that off you guys can heal and buff at the same time! Just because you want to be the &quot;GODS&quot; of eq tanking that you cant see that we are hurting and a snap aggro fix will not kill your class like you are implying is bs!<br />

<br />
If you're a Paladin, you pop on Aura of the Crusader for 30 of that 37AC and it's all over with just one spell.<br />
<br />
7AC... that's the &quot;warrior advantage&quot;.. <br />
<br />
Frodlin:<br />
<br />
1 - that 37 AC is raw AC isn't it (I checked, it is)? which would equate to, um, 53 worn AC - which is what the buffs increase.  So the 7 AC OMG THAT'S NO ADVANTAGE is really not quite that bad. And you can't assume SKs will maximize their AC for the sole sake of negating warrior advantages (casting torrent of pain, which gets resisted a suprising amount - though I prefer torrent of hate for group ATK buffs myself) since we're limited to 8 spell gems like anyone else.<br />
2 - If everyone has the same penis pump, you can still compare relative sizes.<br />
3 - A SK could have the same gear in non-visible slots as a warrior, but then they'd be a warrior, throwing away a lot of their much vaunted utility.  Don't believe me? Check the magelos.  Most of the top SKs have higher FT than their warrior counterparts (yeah magelo lists warrior FT, go figure), and most of them have capped int, again unlike their warrior counterparts.  Part of the warrior advantage (Raex has 10 percent more raw AC than Grimor in every slot FYI) is in (marginally) better itemization, but part of it is in specialization.  Warriors don't have a mana bar to attend to.  SKs (and paladins) do, and like it or not, if effects their gear choices. So the warrior as the specialist still retains the advantage there. <br />
<br />
Huge advantage? Depends on how you define it. It's smaller than the knight's aggro advantage, but large enough to bar knights from groups if it was the only factor.<br />
<br />

<br />
Misquoting numbers and forcing knights to itemize like warriors doesn't really prove anything Frodlin. I agree that the balance has swung too far, never have disagreed with that, but that fact remains that warriors want to retain all their advantages and take the knight's advantage. Playing down advantages while overstating disadvantages is a good debating technique, but I'm not gonna buy it.<br />
<br />
In trying to minimize the advantages, you're doing so by making some fundamentally flawed assumptions about how knights itemize.  And posting misleading numbers (comparing raw AC differences with buff that effect worn AC) makes your case look very shakey indeed. I find it difficult to have a candid discussion when I feel you are obfuscating. I agree there's problems, and I think they should be fixed. That's not the issue at hand. The issue at hand for me is the impact to the overall balance of the game and the impact to the viability of my class. Probably the same things you are worrying about, just for different classes.<br />
<br />
As I said, I think we're going the wrong way by trying to focus on the standard group. But as long as you are determined to re-establish the &quot;standard group&quot; with a warrior tank, I'll continue to disagree that it's a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Removing AGGRO-LOCK would appear to KNIGHTS as a NERF, but was it ever supposed to be there in the first place? Why have such an elaborate aggro management system designed, when one class with a simple fast cheap spell, can circumvent and prevent any consequences for everyone else? Originally, when KNIGHTS were not 90% warriors, it was BAD for them to lock aggro, they could use snap=-aggro to save the ENC, or the CLERIC.. imagine that! Knights being defenders and protecting others... It was BAD if they locked aggro as they couldnt take the punishment... my goodness that was almost balanced, they were too weak, and needed some upgrades, but what really hurt was the exp penalty, percieved or real people did not want to lose exp, it was too hard to come by. That no longer is the case ...<br />
<br />
<br />
What do i think is more likely? We need to push for warriors getting an equivalent ability to lock aggro. Some say this will trivialize encounters. To that I call BULLSHIT... I want someone to show me this... this anecdotal 'it will trivialize' is pure BS.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Give us aggro-Lock and snap aggro... problem solved...</div></div><hr />

That will not make the &quot;standard group&quot; require a warrior and saying that is the case is BS. It will ALLOW the &quot;standard group&quot; to have the Warrior as an actual option!<br />
<br />
Everyone that keeps saying that snap aggro is the only advantage a knight has is full of crap. Every single negitive aspect that Knights had in the Kunark era is GONE!!!<br />
<br />
But... even if that was the case screw you, I do one job and that is it. So leave me the heck alone and let me do my job! This requires that the mobs actually be mad enough at me to beat on me!</div></div><hr />

An SK wouldnt wear full Elemental armor?<br />
<br />
/boggle  <br />
<br />
Warriors have a *cough* ten percent AC advantage on their elemental armour.  I was talking about the invisible slots which Frodlin says knights would pick the same items as warriors because they can. I don't necessarily agree that's how knights itemize.  Given the different stats that knight magelos have, and the visible AC/HP advantage, I'm not the only one that thinks that way.  The top knights itemize differently from warriors because of this utility thing we have, which requires more than maxed STA and raw HP items. Mana pools require items that feed them. These are not always the best STA/HP items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huge advantage? Depends on how you define it. It's smaller than the knight's aggro advantage, but large enough to bar knights from groups if it was the only factor.<br />
<br />
I've never understood this. Knights CHOOSE to wear items to increase their casting effectivness over ac/hp items, and then act like that gives warriors an advantage. Hello? They choose to wear them because they think that the casting utility gained is GREATER than the hps/ac they are trading. They aren't making a &quot;sacrifice&quot;, they are making themselves more effective. If they didn't think the wis/int/mana/ft/focus effect was more valuable than the hp/ac they trade for it, they would be foolish to do it. If it is more valuable, then it is not a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - that 37 AC is raw AC isn't it (I checked, it is)? which would equate to, um, 53 worn AC - which is what the buffs increase. So the 7 AC OMG THAT'S NO ADVANTAGE is really not quite that bad.<br />
<br />
Yes, the 37AC is &quot;raw AC&quot;, so, let's take for the sake of argument the figure of 53raw AC, which when subtracting buffs is... 23AC advantage.  On a 2kAC warrior (which is what we're referring to here) that's a 1.15% difference.   <br />
<br />
<br />
 And you can't assume SKs will maximize their AC for the sole sake of negating warrior advantages (casting torrent of pain, which gets resisted a suprising amount - though I prefer torrent of hate for group ATK buffs myself) since we're limited to 8 spell gems like anyone else.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with this argument, indeed the spell is a level 53 spell and you certainly have more to spend your time on.<br />
<br />
2 - If everyone has the same penis pump, you can still compare relative sizes.<br />
<br />
Not if everyone's using a different ruler.   AC figures in Magelo are flawed because they rely on user input at the time of creation, and most people guess rather than stopping what they're doing, logging into EQ, stripping naked and getting the number.<br />
<br />
3 - A SK could have the same gear in non-visible slots as a warrior, but then they'd be a warrior, throwing away a lot of their much vaunted utility. Don't believe me? Check the magelos. Most of the top SKs have higher FT than their warrior counterparts (yeah magelo lists warrior FT, go figure), and most of them have capped int, again unlike their warrior counterparts. Part of the warrior advantage (Raex has 10 percent more raw AC than Grimor in every slot FYI) is in (marginally) better itemization, but part of it is in specialization. Warriors don't have a mana bar to attend to. SKs (and paladins) do, and like it or not, if effects their gear choices. So the warrior as the specialist still retains the advantage there. <br />
<br />
The most annoying aspect of class specific armors is that there's NOT an equal increase in power between classes.   The days of sacrificing melee stats for caster stats are over.. fini.. done.   Have a look for yourself, warriors and SK's and Paladins are generally all equipping the same stuff in their non-clss specific armor slots.   Some notable exceptions are the Shield of Ssraeheza and the Algae ring, and perhaps range slot gear (Noc's tiny book of logic is still popular).    In almost every case, the melee equivalent is just that... equivalent, it's not much better or worse, but equivalent.    As a matter of fact, the travesty I've seen is that in almost every case, if there's a warrior only item for a slot (Shoulders is a great example) they're not being equipped because they're inferior to the multi-class items for the same slot.  You don't sacrifice for your casting side any more, and it's really too bad that this went away, it would be a lot more fair.<br />
<br />
Huge advantage? Depends on how you define it. It's smaller than the knight's aggro advantage, but large enough to bar knights from groups if it was the only factor.<br />
<br />
The &quot;advantage&quot; is significantly smaller than the variation between two warriors of differing equipment levels.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Misquoting numbers and forcing knights to itemize like warriors doesn't really prove anything Frodlin. I agree that the balance has swung too far, never have disagreed with that, but that fact remains that warriors want to retain all their advantages and take the knight's advantage. Playing down advantages while overstating disadvantages is a good debating technique, but I'm not gonna buy it.<br />
<br />
I've never &quot;downplayed&quot; an advantage and I take great offense at your assuming that my using raw AC numbers was an intentional ploy to hide anything rather than simply adding up numbers and reporting them.    It's one thing to point out an error and have it accepted *which you did and which I did*, and entirely another to assign dishonesty to someone in doing so.   <br />
<br />
In trying to minimize the advantages, you're doing so by making some fundamentally flawed assumptions about how knights itemize. <br />
<br />
I'm not making assumptions, I'm clicking little magelo profiles.   I'm reporting how SK's say THEY itemize.   If you can show me the grand sacrifices made to upkeep SK's caster side, then please... I await it, but at every profile I've seen says otherwise.   There's nothing &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; about clicking on magelo profiles of real SK's and seeing what they wear, and doing something similar with warriors.   You'll find in the non visible armor slots, it's either the exact same thing or it's a wash.<br />
<br />
<br />
And posting misleading numbers (comparing raw AC differences with buff that effect worn AC) makes your case look very shakey indeed. I find it difficult to have a candid discussion when I feel you are obfuscating. I agree there's problems, and I think they should be fixed. That's not the issue at hand. The issue at hand for me is the impact to the overall balance of the game and the impact to the viability of my class. Probably the same things you are worrying about, just for different classes.<br />
<br />
You know, I'm not the one who started making fundamentally flawed comparisons.  If I'm not mistaken, you were the one who came here with a completely flawed logical argument about ranger to knight defensive differences in relation to warrior to knight ones when there's a significantly different class skill level makeup.   Then you say that because I say what i see when I click on little magelo profiles that I'm making fundamentally flawed assumptions about the way knights choose to itemisze, and posture yourself as &quot;taking the high road&quot;?    Let's get just a TAD more realistic.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said, I think we're going the wrong way by trying to focus on the standard group. But as long as you are determined to re-establish the &quot;standard group&quot; with a warrior tank, I'll continue to disagree that it's a good idea.<br />
<br />
You miss the poin entirely, I'm trying to re-establish that a warrior is as valid of a choice IN an experience group as their knight counterparts, that there should NEVER with ANY of the tank classes be an unfair advantage.     There is now, and if it were addressed properly, it could be eliminated.   You're not going to make any points with me by hiding stuff in your mana bar and pretending it doesn't exist though by making comparisons only on that which is displayed for all the world to see.   Fairness doesn't make handicaps for hidden value, it accounts for it.</div></div><hr />

Knights say, &quot;OMFG Warriors have all these advantages from their pure melee heritage&quot;!  Warriors reply, &quot;OMFG Knights have all these advantages from their hybrid heritage, including things with spells that Warriors can't duplicate regardless of gear&quot;!  Knights then counter with, &quot;But all that crap we get is completely meaningless if we don't completely rule over Warriors in at least one primary aspect of tanking, and and and you guys got DEFENSIVE, OMFG&quot;!  And on and on.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is this, the game is currently unbalanced.  The player base has made it perfectly clear that they prefer a Knight tank.  There is no compensation available to the Warrior who can't find a group because the group wanted a Knight.  So something needs to be done to make the Warrior either an attractive groupmate again or they need to be able to solo (like that is ever going to happen).  Until then, all the justifications the Knights spew in a knee jerk reaction to not wanting to be a second choice is just that, knee jerk reaction.<br />
<br />
The fact that some people refuse to see or accept the problem doesn't make the problem less real.  And all the BS spewing crap aside, aggro control is king in PoP and Warriors are the red headed bastard step children of that expansion because they don't have enough of it.</div></div><hr />

pfffft. Surely you jest. <br />
<br />
Not in the slightest, whatsamatter? too much effort to ask you to work for your mob control?<br />
<br />
If you all remember 'The Vision' was (we're told by the knights) that they got instant aggro balanced by a relative inability to take the damage efficiently. My but people screamed how that didn't work and many people (including their fellow tanks the warriors) felt that the balance wasn't there and knights needed a boost.<br />
<br />
'The vision' also suggested that if a tank was sufficiently able to tank without serious costs in mana or downtime the trade off was that he wouldn't have absolute control over the mob to leave encounters with some challenge value. Players were required to use some self restraint and the tools placed at their disposal to avoid out taunting the tank.<br />
<br />
Why then does increasing a knights ability to tank without touching his instant aggro sound balanced to you? <br />
<br />
*Snaps fingers* oh that's right, you are increasingly favoured OVER a warrior. That's balanced right? Sounds more like Kunark reversed to me. :p<br />
<br />
Waay back in this thread a paladin came here and whined about how the cleric in his group didn't appreciate his aggro abilities, he was tanking for the group but when a warrior came along the asked for the warrior to tank. With the reduced aggro control of the warrior (the paladin whined)  he was having to heal and stun and etc to keep the group going.....<br />
<br />
Now here's the thing, this cleric didn't consider aggro lock when looking for a tank (mistakenly in my opinion but still), he favoured the durability of a warrior BUT when it came to it he was perfectly willing to accept a knight as MT (sounds right so far), then when the warrior came along and was invited to group (BUT WAIT , that never happens! there's only ever one tank per group!) the warrior was asked to tank and the paladin swapped to an important secondary role that (to hear the paladin tell it) was neccessary to the groups continued operation. Colour me biased but that sounds like working as intended to me. :p Far moreso than this current situation anyway. <br />
<br />
Check the poll in The Tavern. Most people (80%) say they spend the vast majority of their time grouped with friends in less than the most efficient group makeups. Even dear Ocean Lord tacitly admits that he exp's with warriors and makes them offtank ! :p on the other side of the coin you can't tell me you knights had to solo all the way to 60 did ya? so even when people mistakenly still believed you couldn't tank and the shadow of Kunark lay heavily over you you still got groups right? what makes you think after the emancipation that was PoP you're gonna go straight back into shadow?<br />
<br />
LFG sucks, it always has sucked (even back when warriors had their great advantage because the warriors still had to compete amongst themselves), it always will.  Thing is at this time when a warrior is grouped with a knight he doesn't really offer anything in a secondary capacity whereas in such a situation a knight classes' scope shines through. Giving warriors utility to balance against knights spells would almost require a complete redesign of the class from the ground up (to make a suitable recompense for loss of and redefine our role) and could arguably destroy the central concept that attracted us to the class in the first place.....<br />

I group with warriors but I can be honest and say I don't like to.  Too much competition for the MT spot when they join (cuz they always want to MT instead of just dealing dmg even when they are a few levels below me) and I hate seeing my cleric, chanter, or shaman get hit.  <br />
<br />
It always happens at least once with a warrior and I get disgusted so I make it known that I am MT.  They try to steal aggro by taunting during the fight and I have to tell them to not do it (reminds me of a lower level pally that wanted to stun the mobs more than me).<br />

Since when ever was a Knight meant to MT over a Warrior? Mind you if classes were balanced right now your precious healer/buffer/mezzer wouldn't be getting fricken hit when you had a Warrior MT.<br />

See, this is the problem with warriors now!  You gotta be the best no matter what!  You know, balance means?  It means, I can do what you can do if I use all the skills at my disposal (inc my aggro generation).  I may not do it as well as you but I still get the job done!!<br />
<br />
So, knights don't tank as well as warriors (getting hit for those who want to nitpick) but we tank good enuff to be a viable replacement if there is no warrior around with our utility and all-around skills (including stuns, heals, etc).<br />
<br />
You warriors want to be the shit at everything.  Well, you're not and it is eating you up inside.  Well, if it bothers you that much that a knight can tank better in exp groups then let it fester I say.<br />
<br />
Get over yourselves.  You monopolize raids, which every Joe wants to do, and you want to monopolize exp groups.  Tough titty.  It would be a cold day in hell before I let an inept, one-dimensional warrior tank over me unless it is a friend that I am quite sure knows how to play his/her class and do it damn well.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors mitigation (both in more damage can be taken between complete heals and damage taken slower due to better AC) is as much better than knights and knights is better than rangers (using the same metrics).<br />
<br />
Mitigation has absolutely nothing to do with how much damage can be taken between complete heals. It has everything to do with lowering damage taken per hit. Go check on the definition of the word &quot;mitigation&quot;<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that rangers mitigate as well as warriors, I'd love to see you try it with a straight face.  <br />
<br />
IF <br />
1 - warriors are better than knights but not by an important amount, <br />
2 - knights mitigate better than rangers by that same (unimportant) amount<br />
<br />
THEN<br />
rangers mitigate as well as warriors<br />
<br />
OR <br />
the assumption that warriors mitigation advantage is negligible is incorrect.<br />
<br />
That's some pretty good crack there. Rangers are on a completely different mitigation table due to being a chain class. They are not relevant for the purposes of comparison in a discussion about mitigation. Not to mention, your if/then logic is in error.<br />
<br />
Compared to shadowknights we're talking about a 15 percent AC advantage (1892 average versus 1722) and a 10 percent hit point advantage. In terms of overall mitigation, that's a 26 percent swing in favor of the warriors, yet it's not significant (warriors can take more damage between heals and take damage slower).<br />
<br />
Ah, finally some numbers. I'm just going to play with your numbers for the sake of argument before I question their source and reliablity. Now, I'm going to assume that your position is that the warrior is on the same mitigation table, the only difference is AC. Fine.<br />
<br />
First of all, according to Solinar's AC thread, that TWO HUNDRED AC difference only icreases damage mitigation by TEN PERCENT. That's not as much as you think. Assuming the SK hasn't lifetapped at all, that's a cheal in maybe 8.5 seconds, instead of 10, after taking into account the less hitpoints of the hybrid.<br />
<br />
Secondly, your math is wrong, you're &quot;stacking&quot; the numbers to inflate the advantage. Those numbers just don't add together. <br />
When you talk about the 10% hitpoint advantage, that's one number. When you add that 10 percent mitigation difference into it, you can't add them to each other. You have to add them IN to each other. Here's an example:<br />
<br />
Skill caps: You way, you say parry, dodgeriposte are all 10% higher, therefore warrios have a 30% advantage.<br />
I say the 10% higher caps add a maximum of a 12% advantage.<br />
<br />
So your 25% advantage, which anyone can plainly see is stacked numbers, is actually more like... 11.5% or close.<br />
<br />
WE haven't even gotten into how 30% of any health pool on average  almost always remains untapped, which  cuts down on the effective difference between hybrids and knights, nor have we gone into buffs, or the utility spells of each knight which affect this.<br />
<br />
According to this thread: http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/sh...s=&amp;threadid=145<br />
<br />
Link's broke.<br />
mitigation seems linear with AC from about 1700 to 1900 - the range our 'average' people fall into.<br />
<br />
Just for comparison:<br />
http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;...erver=&amp;order=HP<br />
<br />
The same listing for rangers weighs in at 4984 HP average and 1517 AC. That is, for those of you keeping score at home, a 13 percent AC advantage for knights and 15 percent HP swing. Total mitigation swing ranger to knight : 30 percent.<br />
<br />
Rangers are irrelevant in this discussion, as I've said. Chain class. Different mitigation table. And you're stacking numbers that can't be stacked.<br />
<br />
My point still remains that the mitigation difference between hybrids and warriors is not immediately noticeable for most people. The difference is so slight, your average XP group player just plain doesn't notice it.<br />
When you add in stuns, life and manataps, and group buffs, that MINOR difference is competely wiped out.<br />
And we haven't even TALKED about the differences with aggro lock yet.</div></div><hr />

I've never understood this. Knights CHOOSE to wear items to increase their casting effectivness over ac/hp items, and then act like that gives warriors an advantage. Hello? They choose to wear them because they think that the casting utility gained is GREATER than the hps/ac they are trading. They aren't making a &quot;sacrifice&quot;, they are making themselves more effective. If they didn't think the wis/int/mana/ft/focus effect was more valuable than the hp/ac they trade for it, they would be foolish to do it. If it is more valuable, then it is not a disadvantage.  <br />
<br />
Right, thanks taking out of context. <br />
<br />
Warriors have a mitigation (tanking) advantage because knights focus on tanking and utility, not one to the exclusion of the other (just like clerics first work on mana, warriors first work on hitpoints, paladins have to balance mana and hitpoints). Assuming knights are playing knights for the utility, this is sensible.  Assuming that snap aggro is removed and mitigation is again the sole determinant in tanking, this is bad (for knights anyway). <br />
<br />
People don't want generalists when there are better specialists.  Exceptions exist, but they are few and far between.  The situation now is one of those exceptions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Time between heals? Well, 4k-1600 = 2400HP.  At 100 DPS, that's 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
Now, our hypothetical warrior has 4400 HP (10 percent advantage) and is taking 90 DPS (10 percent advantage).<br />
<br />
Time between heals? well 4400-1760 = 2640.  At 90 DPS, that's 29.3 seconds.<br />
<br />
29.3/24 = 1.2 or a 20 percent advantage.  Why, the 2 advantages DO stack. And the hypothetical warrior will have more HP (860 or 19 percent health) when the heal lands, so the cleric can delay casting even more, heightening the advantages.<br />
<br />
Yes, these are made up numbers.  Real numbers will yield the same results (assuming they keep the same relative level of advantage).  Try it sometime.</div></div><hr />

This used to be the case...<br />
<br />
Before all of the Knight usable items with 100+ hps and 100+ mana...<br />
<br />
See in the old days, as I reminise (excuse the spelling)... <br />
<br />
I played a paladin...<br />
I had a small mana pool...<br />
Casting a spell it would be noticable as my mana bar dropped...<br />
I had to choose between hp/ac and mana items...<br />
Because of our smaller mana pools, we used to do a thing called med break...<br />
Playing a paladin meant making a choice, do we want to be a tank that casts spells, or a caster that tanks...<br />
<br />
THAT is no longer the case...<br />
<br />
Itemization is INSANE... <br />
<br />
IMO, there should NEVER be an item with 100+ hps AND 100+ mana... where is the hard choice? where is the trade offf? <br />

<br />
<br />
Do you think that an enchanter should be a better group slower than a shaman should because shamans have better slows? And don't bother with any of the other powers that enchanters have aside from slowing eather. From that point on shaman are second rate slowers for groups and enchanters are preferred over all just for the job of being a slower in a group. <br />
<br />
Let me elaborate:<br />
<br />
Shamans, enchanters, beastlords and bards can all be the slower of an exp group, without having to rely on or even look at one of the other slowing classes.<br />
<br />
Shamans have the highest slow in the game followed by enchanters, then they hybrids. So naturally, shamans are the raid slowing class as their slow has the biggest impact. <br />
<br />
And shaman still have the best slows for exp groups.<br />
<br />
Now here is something interesting: both shaman and enchanters have ALL of the tools for slowing a mob: a slow spell, A de-buff to help it stick, and a form of mana regen so they can cast it. <br />
<br />
Something even more interesting: Shamans are the best slowers on raids and slowing does not stack. However surprisingly, this does not leave enchanters, beastlords, and bards shit out of luck when it comes to raids as. They have other powers besides slowing mobs that they use. <br />
<br />
And that, my knight friend, is just about as balanced as this game gets. <br />
<br />
<br />
Recap time: Enchanters and shamans are slowers. They both have the tools they need to do the job of slowing without having to use each other’s powers. Shamen are better slowers than enchanters. Both enchanters and shamans slow things for groups. Shamans slow things for raids. Enchanters do other things for raids because of highly useful utility. Enchanters and shamans are balanced for the job of slower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if only you could replace Shaman with warrior, enchanter with knights, and slower type things for tank type things we could have balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, these are made up numbers.  Real numbers will yield the same results (assuming they keep the same relative level of advantage).  Try it sometime.  <br />
<br />
See, that's where your math clears up. You're talking about the &quot;advantage&quot; as in numbers scaling up past 100%, using hybrids as the baseline.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about percentages of the warrior ability, using warriors as baseline.<br />
<br />
The way you use the numbers, adding them so that when you say, warriors have a 20% advantage, you'er talking about 120% of the ability of hybrids. THOSE numbers, you can stack.<br />
<br />
However, you're using the wrong baseline for comparison. Warriors, not hybrids, are the baseline here.<br />
<br />
In your example, the &quot;warrior advantage&quot; is as follows:<br />
<br />
hybrids have 90% of the hitpoints of warriors.<br />
hybrids have 90% of the mitigation of warriors.<br />
The numbers don't purely stack, you have to take the first one into account calculating the second one into the whole.<br />
<br />
In this case, 9/10 of 9/10 is 81/100. SO hybrids are 81% as effective as warriors in the pure melee aspect of the game, SO LONG AS they don't use any of their spells.<br />
<br />
Actually, I thought the difference would be larger, where it isn't. For that, I apologize.<br />
<br />
But, KEEP IN MIND all of these factors:<br />
<br />
We are ONLY discussing the pure melee aspect of this. Paladin stuns, shadowknight life and manataps, reduce or eliminate this melee difference by reducing damage taken, tapping life back, or giving mana back to the caster. In the case of paladins, the paladin has to stun for 4 entire seconds, OR to heal for 300 once, to elminate this difference. (the warrior cheal hits at 860, while the pally cheal hits at 600, there goes 260 points there)<br />
Warriors don't generally have a two hundred AC advantage over hybids, I find that number highly suspect.<br />
<br />
Christ, I've got a headache now... I HATE math.</div></div><hr />

I ask of you Oceanlord:<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you think that an enchanter should be a better group slower than a shaman should because shamans have better slows? And don't bother with any of the other powers that enchanters have aside from slowing eather. From that point on shaman are second rate slowers for groups and enchanters are preferred over all just for the job of being a slower in a group. <br />
<br />
Let me elaborate:<br />
<br />
Shamans, enchanters, beastlords and bards can all be the slower of an exp group, without having to rely on or even look at one of the other slowing classes.<br />
<br />
Shamans have the highest slow in the game followed by enchanters, then they hybrids. So naturally, shamans are the raid slowing class as their slow has the biggest impact. <br />
<br />
And shaman still have the best slows for exp groups.<br />
<br />
Now here is something interesting: both shaman and enchanters have ALL of the tools for slowing a mob: a slow spell, A de-buff to help it stick, and a form of mana regen so they can cast it. <br />
<br />
Something even more interesting: Shamans are the best slowers on raids and slowing does not stack. However surprisingly, this does not leave enchanters, beastlords, and bards shit out of luck when it comes to raids as. They have other powers besides slowing mobs that they use. <br />
<br />
And [i]that[i], my knight friend, is just about as balanced as this game gets. <br />
<br />
<br />
Recap time: Enchanters and shamans are slowers. They both have the tools they need to do the job of slowing without having to use each other’s powers. Shamen are better slowers than enchanters. Both enchanters and shamans slow things for groups. Shamans slow things for raids. Enchanters do other things for raids because of highly useful utility. Enchanters and shamans are balanced for the job of slower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if only you could replace Shaman with warrior, enchanter with knights, and slower type things for tank type things we could have balance.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And what do you suggest the role of the paladin is when the boss mob requires defensive, no AEs to counter, there are no adds to mez-tank with, and there already is a BSS bish?  <br />

I have said that you guys need a little something but nothing extreme as your brethren have been suggesting.<br />
<br />
Warriors are shooting for the stars when you can only reach the sky.  <br />

As long as one  tankable class has aggro lock and the others do not.... there will be no balance.<br />
<br />

<br />
As long as one tank class could tank and the others could not... there was no balance.<br />
<br />
(btw that was a reference tp pal/sk era kunark)<br />
<br />
if you made all three classes  equal in aggro lock...<br />
then that is not a deciding factor anymore..<br />
then - <br />
<br />
choose SK as FD puller/more DPS<br />
choose Pal as Back up healer/ghetto mezzer<br />
choose  War for better hp/mitigation<br />
<br />
except, the differences in sk/pal abilities FAR AND AWAY outweigh the very minor differences in war hp/mitigation.<br />
<br />
So my solution, give war aggro lock, and boost our hp/ac to a NOTICEABLE improvement...</div></div><hr />

You guys get aggro lock and I want no difference at all between pally hps/ac and a warrior's.  You'll still have defensive, dual wield, and the better war only gear.</div></div><hr />

Aggro-lock is the sum of the paladins' spellbook I contest.  Take it away and you gimp the pally.  If you want our spellbook, reroll bish!  <br />
<br />
Almost identical hps/ac is not the same AS identical hps/ac.<br />
<br />
26/20 1hb is not so uber fool.  If we could wield two weapons of the same caliber then I may agree with your assertation. Until then, silence dunce.<br />
<br />
Apothes, you are like a gnat. Just shut up and read, you may learn something.  Tank-mage was a throwback and I am sure some of the people here know what I mean.  Just because your dumb ass can't get the inside joke doesn't negate it.</div></div><hr />

Thunder of Karana anyone?  If paladins were given a line of spells similar to what you suggest, then the idea of sharing aggro-lock would seem more feasible than it is currently.</div></div><hr />

You miss the poin entirely, I'm trying to re-establish that a warrior is as valid of a choice IN an experience group as their knight counterparts, that there should NEVER with ANY of the tank classes be an unfair advantage.     There is now, and if it were addressed properly, it could be eliminated. <br />
<br />
Well, like I said, I just check the relevant top end magelos.  I'm not that keen on doing a slot by slot comparision.  I'll admit that the new itemization is a lot better and does help hybreds, but I still see those magelos (and I notice &quot;everyone&quot; has a flowing moss mantle in shoulders).<br />
<br />
As for the raw versus AC, my mistake.  I gave you enough credit for knowing the difference between the two, so I couldn't understand why you could do something like that except to make a dubious point.  You're point would be just as valid without the excited breathing about a 7 AC advantage.  Calling it a 1 percent advantage would work (except the raex stuff still has 10 percent more raw AC than Grimor).<br />
<br />
As for your point, I chose not to address it because while I believe it's what you intended, I don't believe and never will until I see otherwise, that it's what will happen if what warriors want happen.<br />

<br />
Group invites aren't fair. You know something about knight utility, I know something about it, but cleric/slower pair 1032 looking for a tank doesn't.  They know that a warrior mitigates/avoids damage better, requiring less healing. You call it hiding my mana bar, I call it considering factors that get group invites.<br />
<br />
You think it's a factor, I don't. I know it wasn't a factor until PoP - even in Luclin where a lot of top end items (cultural smithing, luclin boss loot) are all plate classes - which is the start of the itemization you are referring to, utility didn't matter.  I'm confident it won't matter again the edge is snap aggro is eliminated.  You disagree.</div></div><hr />

Check &quot;debunking common myths about the tanks of EQ&quot; in this forum.  The 200 AC advantage is for the top 20 knights versus warriors (which was the sample being considered).  It's really hard to quantify that difference at anything but the top end since access to gear (*cough* twinking *cough*) matters a lot more than a 20 percent natural edge.</div></div><hr />

Classes are defined by what job(s) they do now, not what subtype they are.<br />
<br />
That's why groups look for a &quot;DPS&quot; class or a &quot;Tanking&quot; class and not for a &quot;Pure Melee&quot; class or a &quot;Caster&quot; class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That invalidates all of your points. Only the very top end has that 200 point difference, not the very average 4khp hybrid. In fact, that hybrid probably has a 10% worse AC than a warrior, same ratio as the top end, and that mitigation difference between the warrior and hybrid's going to also drop quite a bit.<br />
<br />
You make invalid comparisons. WHat you're going to have to do is find the average HP between the warriors and paladins at that level, and recompute.<br />
<br />
Computing for the AC difference of the high end and the hitpoint difference of the average guy isn't going to give a valid comparison, it's going to give skewed numbers.</div></div><hr />

So when the hell is SoE going to let Warriors back on the field?  That's my question.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, to judge by what happened to monks, never - in the way you want.<br />
<br />
I think there are changes that could be made to even the balance (I still like dropping slow aggro since it's an indirect means to get what you want), but trying to get it back to the way it was isn't, I think, going to happen.<br />
<br />
But I've said that as long as warriors remain fixated on re-establishing the standard group they're barking up the wrong tree.<br />
<br />
30 however many pages later and we're still there.<br />
<br />
Aside from our paladin troll, no one has disagreed that warriors need help (if they have, I missed it), but I have yet to see a suggestion about how to change things that isn't an attempt to remove the knight's edge.</div></div><hr />

Now if we're gonna start talking about fixated...you been reading these threads right Kiz? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway, was thinking of expanding my T-shirt line would there be a market for a &quot;Ocean lord is my Bitch&quot; one D'ya think? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok lets start here…<br />
<br />
Knights are a Hybrid – this means that they are a mixture of two classes. Most of the bitching is coming from pallies here so lets deal with them for examples sake. <br />
<br />
Pallies are part warrior and part cleric. Is everyone with me so far? I will go to the extreme here for the sake of the whole “God Tank!” Let’s say that Pallies are 95% Warrior and a measly 5% cleric. Sound good? (Just an example here, bear with me)<br />
<br />
So we gave up pulling, buffing, healing, porting, solo’ing and every other thing you could even suggest so that we could tank! You hear that??? Did that sink in??? We can do one @#$%!@# thing, PERIOD!<br />
<br />
So here comes the Pallies who I earlier suggested that they were 95% tank while being very generous! You want me to believe that somehow in your mind you have convinced yourself that a character who by definition is 5% less tank that me (being generous) should tank better than I should be able to while being 100% tank??? You want to tell me that I have given up EVERYTHING for nothing??? That my one-dimensional class should not excel at our one and only job. SCREW YOU!<br />
<br />
<br />

Group invites aren't fair. You know something about knight utility, I know something about it, but cleric/slower pair 1032 looking for a tank doesn't. Hmm… so what you are saying is that although you have been tanking in exp groups for the last 8+ months and no one is going to remember that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ocean Lord<br />
<br />
See, this is the problem with warriors now! You gotta be the best no matter what! You know, balance means? It means, I can do what you can do if I use all the skills at my disposal (inc my aggro generation). I may not do it as well as you but I still get the job done!! No KIDDING – I gave up everything to be a TANK. I DESERVE TO BE THE BEST TANK! If you bothered to read and actually take a step back and explain to me how you can even suggest that your arguments hold water I would be more than happy to discuss it!<br />
<br />
So, knights don't tank as well as warriors (getting hit for those who want to nitpick) but we tank good enuff to be a viable replacement if there is no warrior around with our utility and all-around skills (including stuns, heals, etc). I think the last several months you have more than proven that knights can seriously rock for an exp group, which is what we are discussing!<br />
<br />
You warriors want to be the shit at everything. Well, you're not and it is eating you up inside. Well, if it bothers you that much that a knight can tank better in exp groups then let it fester I say. Compete and total BS here, I want to be the best tank in the game and could care less about anything else other than that! That being said, if you are so ass backwards that you think that if just because a warrior becomes a better tank than you do that your role is going to be eliminated. You my friend should pull your head out and breath some fresh air every now and then.<br />
<br />
I cannot tell you the number of times that I have had to make due in groups with “key” classes missing! From slowers to crowd control, I don’t give a crap - if your in my guild and LFG the first person who sends me a tell fills the open spot!<br />
<br />
Get over yourselves. You monopolize raids, which every Joe wants to do, and you want to monopolize exp groups. Umm… You must mean that ONE warrior monopolizes raids! I sure as hell know that warrior two and three might have a job but warrior 4 and up come to a raid wait for assist and turn on auto attack and if they are lucky maybe they get the opportunity to /shield someone… As far as every joe blow wanting to “monopolize” a raid well I can tell you for a fact that my wife who plays EQ could give a hoot about it!<br />
<br />
EQ is not broken. Not being God is not being crippled. It's being balanced. ROFL… I don’t even know what to say to that other than thanks for the good laugh!<br />
<br />
And what do you suggest the role of the paladin is when the boss mob requires defensive, no AEs to counter, there are no adds to mez-tank with, and there already is a BSS bish? <br />
<br />
Spam heals? Lay hands? Added DPS? Boring. Hmmm… I kind of thought we were talking about how this relates to Exp, but I will respond to this one too. Let us see here... If there are AE’s to counter, there are adds to mez-tank and people need BSS you get to help out. Then after all this extra stuff is done you get to help kill the mob. Warriors… well… we are either the Main tank or DPS, PERIOD!<br />
<br />
You guys get aggro lock and I want no difference at all between pally hps/ac and a warrior's. You'll still have defensive, dual wield, and the better war only gear. There already is barely a difference and it grows even smaller if you count in your self buffs. Talk about wanting the whole world, gee! <br />
<br />
If given a choice and I didn’t have to worry about weapon procs to hold aggro I would use a 2h weapon every time.<br />
<br />
The top two BP’s that are in the game are Warrior then Pally, neither of which have actually been found yet to my knowledge and are listed from when you could randomly type in code to get links. After that is a bard only, no clue at all on this one… Then comes Chestguard of Enchanted Marble – hmm… both War and Pally can wear this one. Then comes Great Shadow Platemail – hmm… once again both war and Pally can wear this. The first BP that a Warrior can wear and a Pally cannot is Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle and #16 on the list.<br />
<br />
So you must be talking about weapons… lets look at 2hs which I myself would prefer to use. #1 Ornate Greatblade – WTF both War and Pally again. #2 Stone Etched War Sword – well I’ll be damned, once again War and Pally are listed. So lets look at #3 surely it is War only, Crap it’s the Blade of War – and holy mother of all that is good and evil, slap me silly and call me susan it is also useable by both War AND Pally!!!!<br />
<br />
Debate what you want to I just went to Alla’s and sorted by AC for the BP’s and Damage Ratio for the weapons!<br />
<br />
So every 3 minutes out of every 10 I can lower my DPS by at least 50% and use defensive, you got me there :(<br />
<br />
Oh well, sorry it took so long to post my reply I got busy at work. Personally I think that Ocean Lord can go the heck away, but hey that’s just this mans opinion!</div></div><hr />
