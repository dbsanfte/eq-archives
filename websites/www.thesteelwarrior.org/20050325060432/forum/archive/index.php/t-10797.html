<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daseal</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I recently picked up WoW and promised myself not to fall into the same pitfall I did from EQ.  From what friends tell me, and from what I've noticed thus far leveling seems fairly easy - even for the casual player.<br />
<br />
I am quickly approaching twenty and have some questions.  First of all at the end I want to go nearly all Protection, because not only is that my job that's where the fun is.  For now I'm curious if it makes more sense to go dual weild or 2h as far as damage is concerned.<br />
<br />
If the answer is dual weild, does WoW incorporate any sort of mainhand bonus?  Have there been any parses done?  Do you go quick weapon main hand ratio offhand?  Or from the looks of it maybe a somewhat big damage main hand speed off hand.  Or maybe just speed all around!  I just wonder what the experts have to say about this.<br />
<br />
That said - in an offensive build does anyone have any ideas?  I was going to go for frenzy/flurry in the fury column but haven't thought it out beyond that point.  I feel an offensive warrior is my best bet for quick leveling.  I'm a fan of soloing most of the time, but not opposed to groups.  I know warriors may not be powerful to get me all the way through!<br />
<br />
Also curious how you guys setup your hotkeys.  Still trying to play around with them, but since I don't have all the skills and don't fully understand them it it's touch.  I have 4 bars setup on my UI to try to incorporate plenty of clicky space.  Plus the quick bar change works too.  I'm guessing I want to keep attack, taunt, and maybe execute/heroic/bow/charge/rend/hamstring/mocking etc on the bar part.  Any advise would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">useofweps</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the same sort of situation as yourself, so thought I'd post what I've picked up and have tried talent wise. I spent my first 5pts in cruelty under Fury, and am spending the rest in the Arms tree. I play on a PVP server (can't imagine playing any other way in WoW, it's just so much fun - whereas I hated PVP in EQ) and am going for as much up-front damage as I can get. As you say, I plan on respeccing once I get to the highest instances if it's necessary, but currently at lvl 30 I am starting to get to the cool sounding talents in the Arms tree - got first point in Impale this level, will finish that off then pump 2h damage until axe critical % opens up, working towards improved hamstring, sweeping strikes and MS.<br />
<br />
I have read so many talent builds at 60 that my eyes start glossing over when I look at them. Speaking personally, it would have been much more interesting to see in which order folk took talents while they were levelling, rather than a finished build, so incase anyone else feels the same, here's mine. :)<br />
<br />
At level 30 currently, so 21 points spent:<br />
<br />
Cruelty - 5pts<br />
Improved Rend - 3pts<br />
Deflection - 2pts<br />
Improved Charge - 1pt (needed to gain &gt; 10 rage on a charge, opens hamstring. Of course when you gain Charge lvl 2 this is redundant)<br />
Tactical Mastery - 3pts<br />
Deflection - +1pt  (3 total)<br />
Deep Wounds - 3pts<br />
Tactical Mastery - +2pts (5 total)<br />
Impale - 1pt<br />
<br />
Any feedback very welcomed. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will say that after having concussion blow for a week I am not sure if I want to give it up for anything.<br />
<br />
re: dual wield<br />
<br />
you get a sort of mainhand bonus or an offhand penalty, whichever way you want to look at it. your offhand damage will be the DPS of your weapon plus not much more. your miss rate will also increase, but generally your rage generation will increase as well. I prefer 2h for pure damage but everything is situational. for some people DW makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
as for hotkeys I keep stance-specific skills in the first bar of each stance. skills like shout, rend, hamstring, and so on are in my second bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duel wielding in this game for warrior is pretty painful unless you're fighting stuff thats lower than you.  It tears them up real bad, but against high mobs I find I usually just end up fanning a lot, cooling my opponents off.  I would suggest lugging around 3 or so sets of weapons, a 2h, 1h/board and an offhand.<br />
<br />
Tankability is pretty important in wow in general, but I believe the ability to frontload at least &quot;some&quot; damage is more important throughout most of the game.    The majority of the instance encounters are brief but bloody.  You either get destroyed, or savage your opponents and move on.  If you're serious about getting hit, you should probably have 11 points in protection (I will argue that more than 1 in imp shield block is a waste) and put the rest wherever.  In my case it comes out to 32/5/14.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I honestly think a protection build is better for soloing. The fights may take longer, but you can solo multiple mobs or +2 mobs consistantly and still end combat with a good 75% health. Only way I would go arms is if I were just plowing a bunch of lower level mobs. <br />
<br />
Improved shield block is pretty amazing, nothing like blocking 2/3 of the incoming damage and with revenge/con blow, the mobs is stunned a good portion of the time anyway.<br />
<br />
Soloing with an arms build at 60 is still weak sauce, even with a 56dps 2h and the 25% crit chance I have currently, you're also pretty much worthless in groups. Arms builds are sub-par for tanking and you're lucky if you can get a consistant 200dps. Only reason I'm keeping my Arms spec is because we want atleast one warrior with MS on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true.  You do take more damage with arms than fighting in pure defensive stance.   I still find in most cases if I'm fighting humanoids I can blast through 3-4 of them, bandage, and still have surplus runecloth left over.<br />
<br />
Shield block from what i've seen is either something you use religously, or rarely at all.  Anyone who uses it consistantly seems to swear by it, I like it mostly for bosses or endurance matches.<br />
<br />
I really hate having to rely on crits to frontload damage, but it seems to be really the only way to pull it off with a war.  I wouldn't necessairly call them sub par either, you can sidestep most of the fury tree, and pick up the vast amount of power of protection in the first 15 points or so.  True, the hate you produce may not be as &quot;good&quot; as a full prot spec, but being able to hold more mobs than my healers can keep me up for is suffecient hate for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, well I think it's all situational. <br />
<br />
It's not necessarily that you can't hold agro in a arms build, but you lose a lot of the mitigation you would get from being protection spec'd. I just don't think there's a reason to half-ass it, if you're going to DPS, then go all out, if you're going to tank, then go all out, but being a DPS tank just doesn't make sense to me. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying there's only one way to play a warrior, just giving my feedback from experiences is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being an acceptable dps tank requires having better then average gear to make up for the mitigation difference. I went Protection and yes the mitigation was wondeful, but instances took longer, killing trash mobs took longer, I preferred being able to tank two elite Giants in Marauden  kill one solo while the others dropped the second that I held aggro on. The stun abilities sucked on named and giants/higher lvl elites. I can make up for the loss in mitigation with Crusader procs and Crystal Restores, and put no extra burden on the healer. If I get in a fight thats more difficult then usual I'll equip a shield boost my AC over 6100 and be fine. 11 points into protection gets me to Last Stand which can boost me to a little over 4000 health without buffs enough to tank Anything I've come across up to lvl 55 elite Shade of Eranikus quality bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a hybrid build, you lose out on roughly 1% mitigation, some protection hate abilities, and stuns (Which are nonfactor for me.)  It's not really half assing it as much as you think, and here is why:<br />
<br />
The major tanking difference between the hybrid and full arms/fury build comes from heavy armor plate.  The very good heavy armor plate (Which every warrior should strive to get for heavy tanking), is typically including good amounts of + defense on it.   Sadly, +defense gear is conterproductive to one of furies best skills, enrage.  So in order to enjoy the trees full benefit, you have to pass up on an easy 600+ armor, in addition to what the toughness provides.<br />
<br />
The hybrid build can retain a good portion of it's offense, while gaining the majority of the benefits of the protection tree armorwise without being counter productive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience (note: MY experience),  I found DW to very frustrating fighting typical xp / instance mobs.  The bad streaks I encountered where BAD.  I would get behind in rage, miss 15 in 20 hits, and the hits i did land only netted me a few meager points of rage.  The good streaks I encountered where barely noticeable.  If sword spec. triggered, it was lost in the combat spam.  When I did crit, there was a large difference in damage whether it was with my offhand or primary.<br />
<br />
In the Arms build many players use, Its much more beneficial to use 2-handers because; a) Overpower, MS, Sweeping Strikes do much more dmg, b) Deep wounds will out dmg Rend, even with talents, using a 2-hander, c) Whirlwind does much more dmg and generates more hate across 4 targets.<br />
<br />
When I tested, I used my Whirlwind Sword  vs.  Sword of Serenity + Vanquisher's Sword.  My crit % in Battle Stance was listed at 12.45%.  Three hours worth of fighting was mostly done in Berserker Stance, only switching to Battle for Charge and Overpower.  All weapon skills were max +5 due to racial talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Im new warrior playing on EU-pvp-server (am at the moment lvl 44 orc warrior) I would need some opinion about mine warrior build. At the moment I have:<br />
<br />
Fury Mastery: <br />
Cruelty Rank 4 (will be maxed with lvl 45)<br />
Fury Total: 4 <br />
<br />
Arms Mastery: <br />
Deflection Rank 5 <br />
Improved Rend Rank 3 <br />
Tactical Mastery Rank 5 <br />
Improved Overpower Rank 2 <br />
Anger Management Rank 1 <br />
Deep Wounds Rank 3 <br />
Two-Handed Weapon Specialization Rank 1 <br />
Impale Rank 2 <br />
Axe Specialization Rank 5 <br />
Sweeping Strikes Rank 1 <br />
Improved Hamstring Rank 2 <br />
Mortal Strike Rank 1 <br />
Arms Total: 31 <br />
Total <br />
Total Points Spent: 35 <br />
<br />
I planned the spend last 15 points into the protection, but still dont know what is better anticipation or toughness? Anyway I will try out last stand too, so mine build will looks like:<br />
<br />
Shield Specialization Rank 5 <br />
Improved Bloodrage Rank 2 <br />
Toughness Rank 5 (or Anticipation Rank 5?)<br />
Last Stand Rank 1 <br />
Improved Shield Block Rank 2 <br />
Protection Total: 15 <br />
<br />
The character should be useable for pvp (not for 1 vs 1 duels/pvp)  and for higher-lvl content (instaces).  <br />
Ideas how well/bad the build is? <br />
How bad is it to be specialized on 1 weapon (like axe)?<br />
<br />
thank you for answers<br />
<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your build is almost the same as the one I use and I havent had any serious problems doing what I feel I should be able to do as a warrior.<br />
You want to be good in PvP and do good dmg focusing on Crits. Thats what I get from your build. It may be more beneficial to remove deep wounds and impale from your build if you intend to PvP alot since it essentially nerfs Intimidating Shout, one of the most useful PvP abilities I've found. As far was what protection talents to go with. Even tho you want to focus on dmg/crits occasionally its more beneficial to your group if you equip a shield to tank bosses large groups of trash. So heres what I would choose for your spacific build. Gives you 10% more Armor 5% more block with a shield makes bloodrage more efficient when you need that extra rage at the start of a fight and Last Stand makes your survivability in tough fights better. <br />
<br />
Shield Specialization Rank 5 <br />
Anticipation Rank 2 <br />
Improved Bloodrage Rank 2 <br />
Toughness Rank 5 <br />
Last Stand Rank 1 <br />
Protection Total: 15</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I´ll try out the protection part; the part about removing impale &amp; deep wounds makes me a little scepticall, as im loosing 20% more dmg on crits and gaining 1x bandaging each 3 minutes, well I`ll have to check both options then, which one work better for mine playstyle.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as i know impale only adds 20% to the effect of crits ie. 20% to deep wounds dmg. Can anyone else comment on that?  I prefer a 8 second fear/immobilize for the combat healing option personally. In PvP Intimidating Shout is a life saver, but with deep wounds and a high Crit% it wasn't an option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Impale from what I've seen only adds 20% damage to your ability crits.  This does not affect your bleed damage.<br />
<br />
Your deep wound damage seems to be based off your average weapon damage (Including any attack bonus).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kbok</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Impale <br />
Rank 2/2 <br />
Increases the critical strike damage bonus of your abilities in Battle, Defensive, and Berserker stance by 20%.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As I understand with impale your ie. HS/MS/Execute will make 20% more crit damage as without, so for me with a high crit rate (at least I will try a &quot;high crit rate&quot;) is this skill more worth as be able to bandge in fight. (beside that im 99% the time with a priest grouped).</div></div><hr />
