<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, here's my magelo:  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=401514  and basically I'm at the point where I'm trying to swap out sta/low raw hp stuff for items with high raw hp.  I basically am posting to ask for any ideas on an upgrade for my ranged item.  Looking at the droppables all I can really find in the bazaar is 100k+ elemental bows that would be an upgrade which I can't afford.  My guild is basically doing ntov/bot tower named level stuff.  Doing a search I basically found a sandwich of foul smelling herbs which adds 20raw hp but I lose 5 raw AC then I also stumbled upon the new PoH ranged quests.  The second and third melee ranged rewards from that quest seemed real nice, but I was basically wondering what force I would need to get the second or third part of those PoH quests done or also just any other suggestions for a new ranged item.  Lord Kreizen drops a ranged item that seemed tempting but the PoH quests really caught my eye so if anyone has any info on it.<br />
<br />
Also I was thinking about trying to get kizraks wrist/helm for my next upgrade and was wondering if ornate helm drops in BoT at all or only Sol Ro/tactics?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Work on the Plane of Hate Marsinger Gem quest if you don't feel like dishing out the cash for a Stonewood Compound Bow (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19096).  I'm nearing the completion of the second melee gem and already have the book for the 3rd.<br />
<br />
Mind you, though I'm not 100% sure, the PoH quests can no longer be MQ'd.  Some say they can't, some say they can, but if I were you I would not take the chances.<br />
<br />
Pieces for the first gem all drop of mobs near the zonein.  Bring a couple of guildies and AE the stuff.  It's pathetically easy.<br />
<br />
The main piece for the second gem, called the Etched Soldier's Crest, drops off the dark elves located near Innoruuk and west of Maestro's cathedral.  More specifically, you must fight the Rogue/Warrior dark elves (Agents, Assassins, Warlords, etc).  These guys are levels 62 to 64, have ~20/25k hp, and triple anywhere from 540's to 620's depending on their level.  You will be able to tell their level by how much they hit (62 - 540's, 63 - 580's, 64 - 620's).  The good thing is - They do not run, they do not gate, they do not summon, and give damn good exp.<br />
<br />
You will need the Dissertation of Dark War in combination with the 2nd gem to complete the 3rd gem quest.  Some of the minis drop the Dissertation of Dark War, but I'm not sure exactly which ones.  By look, I would imagine Overlord R`Gahbsa (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12194) and Grandmaster R`Tal (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6627) do.  I'm positiveMaestro of Rancor (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=1596) drops the Dissertation of Dark War because I just looted it off him last night.  <br />
<br />
The rest of the pieces drop off various minis located throughout PoH in order to finish the 4th gem though.</div></div><hr />
