<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to say i picked up two these two last night and i have been very impressed. Prior to that i was using a GSoT.<br />
<br />
IMO, the procs on both of these two were getting me more aggro than a GSoT proc. I based this on the fact that sometimes, if im not MA, i can use a GSoT and when it procs, i dont automatically get aggro, unless it has a streak of 2 or 3 procs in a row.<br />
<br />
With the copper hammer and bloodsword, both were getting me instant aggro when they procced. I tested them out in BoT and although the mobs were immune to the stun portion of the copper hammer proc, the aggro was still noticeable.<br />
<br />
My other benchmark for aggro is whether an early proc from a weapon will keep aggro on you when slow is casted, without taunting. Frmo what i saw, both were able to do this.<br />
<br />
taking into account the decent dps and nice stats (120 raw hps woot) plus resists and others, id def say these two would be hard to beat for the price - i picked both up for total of 30k.<br />
<br />
I will probably use the GSoT still for exp grinds for the added dps, but im happy that i now have a decent set of DW aggro proccers until i get my epic and another EB wep.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol<br />
<br />
wasnt fishing for compliments. just that theres so many posts these days about what are good aggro weapons that i thought id give feedback on the new kids on the block.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wish the hammer and bloodsword were that cheap on my server.  On Torv copper hammer is 65k, bloodsword is 100k.  GSoT just dropped to 10k though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im surprised they are that high. from what i heard they drop fairly commonly and the guy that drops em isnt very hard. <br />
<br />
it has had a drastic effect on GSoT prices though as you said. from never ever seeing GSoTs for sale in the bazaar i saw 6 for sale last night from 10-20k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've now spent 8 hours in King room, and haven't seen him pop yet. I dunno how common this guy really is, or maybe they finally nerfed the drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">King popped 3 times in 7 hours for some guild friends then when I showed up he didn't pop for the 5 hours I was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">King popped twice last night in 6 hrs.  Dropped Hammer twice.  The Elder sword guy on top of King fort did not pop :/<br />
<br />
The camp is too easy to buy these weapons.  King PH is the one to the right of the furnace.  Since I have not seen Elder sword dropp guy... I have heard he pops on the ledge (or second from ledge) above King room.  Anyone confirm were Elder sword guy pops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We got 2 hammers in an hour and a half the other night, but that was probably just luck.</div></div><hr />
