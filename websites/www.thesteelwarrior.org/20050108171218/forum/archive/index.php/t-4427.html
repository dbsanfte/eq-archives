Like (and this is not directed at the pally who posted this specifically) but<br />
<br />
What is gonna suck is when hybrids get completely left out of this. We get shafted completely on disciplines and it appears we are going to get shafted on this very nice change. <br />
<br />
Tell me again how pallies need fixing...?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much like we don't want the &quot;nerf those knights back to kunark&quot; posts by frustrated warriors on this board to represent the whole boards viewpoint, the small number of knights whinging that they need to be upgraded too or whatever in that thread is balanced by a majority of posters who seem to be much more reasonable, and in this case Im not only talking about the TSW posters who have chipped in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not entirely true. If you spend enough time on other class' boards, you'll see exactly the same trends popping up. There's the majority collective voice of reason, the lunatic fringe and the bitter ex-players that still hang out on the boards.</div></div><hr />

They are paladins about everything, including comportment there. We are far more rough and tumble here, and the SK's are just out of control.<br />
<br />
I think its funny that the class message boards, at least between the 3 of us track to character fairly well. <br />
<br />
PoN, on the whole has one of the best functioning commuties in EQ, though they are  a bit stiff and perhaps a bit narrower in scope (or maybe that is just my perception because I don't cruse all their forums all the time).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jynn Tlespirit</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad that many of you noticed the majority of paladins are pleased that positive steps are being made for all pure melee.  Most of us view warriors as fellow comrades in arms and not the enemy.  Please keep in mind quite a few paladins also play warriors so they aren't completely ignorant about the issues.<br />
<br />
There wasn't enough information given for me to really make a final decision about it although I am very very optimistic.  The thing that I do like is that it is a solution that shouldn't adverserly affect smaller guilds and lower level players.  I just hope the aggro issue is addressed sufficiently.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of DAoC.  I always enjoyed fighting there because there were more options and you had to think.  If you got an opportunity here you could follow up with an appropriate action.  <br />
<br />
I'm happy you will be getting something different than more hp.  This should make the classes much more fun to play and a lot more valuable.<br />
<br />
Look forward to the chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">deliciouspk, from the announcement (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510):There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You actually picked a pretty good thread to post on.<br />
<br />
If you actually look at what is being written there are some sound posts.  There are reactions on what it will address and importantly what it will not address.  How this system is still subject to the whims of the RNG.  How this system on its own won't address some important problems.  How this system might alter current content.  Reaction is mixed in any substantial sized group because not everyone thinks the same.<br />
<br />
My favorite interesting nugget, there are even ideas how to stack this with Paladins and SKs.  A stun or debuf might make monster prone longer either creating more opportunities or keeping the current ones open longer.  That would work out great for Warrior stacking!<br />
<br />
But hey where are the posts on  &quot;NOOOO!  Warriors must not have this!!!1!!&quot;  I didn't see them but then again its grown so fast that I may have missed it.<br />
<br />
Everyone fears change.  There is no denying how this will be the biggest change to melee since Kunark (everything else has been fiddling with pre-existing material).  Heck some of the posts in TSW main thread have a worried tone as well.<br />
<br />
Every group has their fringe element.  Make fun of them if you want...I might even help out. ^_^ Just don't mistake the voice of a few for the opinion of most.  Anyone could fish out a few choice posts in this board and make it look like all Warriors at best are pesimistic and at worst ingreatful whiners about all of this but that isn't true.  Is it?<br />
<br />
Go back and reread the thread you posted.  Most are level and honest.  If you want someone's opinion you want just that.  Some are afraid but some are curious.  Just like you guys are.<br />
<br />
I welcome anyone who comes by and doesn't flame.  Post your thoughts.  Just like other class boards, you have to be proactive to constantly dispell myths and keep your class (and their class) grounded.</div></div><hr />

It's really too bad that even after all of this crying and concern on all sides, that the so called &quot;fixes&quot; being implemented seem to totally ignore the issue of warrior &quot;snap aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
Unless the monster &quot;leaves itself open&quot; as it's running toward the group, I fail to see how these changes will stop the mob from running straight at the shammy as soon as its slowed, and then on to the wizard who nuked a little too early, etc. etc.  <br />
<br />
I don't know how the new changes will be implemented or how effective they will be.  However, if the new changes allow warriors to gain agro relatively early (say the first 10 seconds of a fight) and then hold agro pretty consistantly for the rest of a fight (barring complete overnuking, which a knight can't hold agro against either), plus the changes give warriors extra dps, defensive abilities, and utility, that seems like a pretty solid improvement on the class.<br />
<br />
Knights have always had more &quot;snap agro&quot; than warriors, since day one.  It wasn't until well after Velious, when other knight abilities started to improve, that people started looking for knights rather than warriors.  I don't think snap agro is the end all be all of tank viability.<br />
<br />
By the way, I play a SK, not a paladin, but I still see things largely from a hybrid perspective.  I think it's great that they're giving pure melee a unique skill and I have no problem at all with the fact that hybrids aren't getting these abilities.  There might be a few extreme knights posting that these changes are going to make them underpowered but I think most knights agree this change is more than fair.  It's possible that SOE will screw it up and it won't help warriors enough but I doubt this is going to make knights &quot;underpowered&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deliciouspk</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to play an SK.  65, ep flagged, yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly how you play and I'm not questioning it, but just to let you know, I had insane aggro.<br />
<br />
I could pull an xp mob, and have necros and wizards chain casting and alternately sitting down right next to the mob without it ever once looking at them.<br />
<br />
Any raid mob I tanked never, EVER looked at anybody else unless he knocked me out of 3 or 4 casting attempts in a row.  Even then, if he ran off, I could make him run RIGHT back to me without moving a step.<br />
<br />
That is the power that warriors lack atm, that's what makes SK's and Pallys more desireable, and that's why knights are tanking in Time atm.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the changes, nothing that has been mentioned so far to me seems to address the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, we have open minds.... just not so open that the wind blows through them<br />
<br />
For some reason, I found that quite hilarious.<br />
<br />
Aeka, yup, it's good.  There were a few at the start saying &quot;We should be a part of this!!1!&quot; and (for some strange reason, probably reading to many R&amp;F forums =p) I thought &quot;Here we go again.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for not addressing the problem:<br />
<br />
It was my understanding that the issue was warriors being passed over for knights for exp groups.  The causes highlighted were primarily knights vastly superior agro and negligble hp/ac etc gap.<br />
<br />
Now, if these changes mean that warriors become stackable then that may very well mean that they will no longer be passed up for groups.  i.e. groups won't care if they have both a knight and warrior or multiple warriors.  If that happens, the agro issue becomes a moot point.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you consider the issue to be warriors should be tanking in exp groups that sorta changes things a bit.<br />
<br />
Frankly, as I've said before, if I never get another reply saying &quot;We want a tank, but we're really wanting a pally or sk&quot; and instead get a group ... I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
*shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka, thank you for one of the best posts I have seen yet on the coming melee changes.  Knights are somewhat worried over the coming changes, fearing that the pendulum will swing too far in our direction, and they will end up in a similar boat to what we are now(history suggests this is very possible).  For the most part tho the PoN crew is glad SoE is doing something for pure melee.<br />
<br />
I also find that some of the comments, from both message boards, along the lines of 'Knights are saying'  or 'wariors are saying' some what amusing.  Classes don't say things, people say things.  We here at TSW cannot generally agree on anything for sure, so how can we all be saying anything?  PoN is no different.<br />
<br />
So thanks again Aeka for adding in a little voice of reason to these discussions with your post again.</div></div><hr />

I'm Sorry... For this quote.. I have to throw the Bullshit flag and asses a 15 yard penalty...<br />
<br />
This was NEVER the reason to play a hybrid, Until PoP Completely screwed the group dynamics up... When that happened, 95% of the current fan-boy crop of paladins started their twinks and leveled up so that they could play the new overpowered-intelligence-free class...  they called people Dr))Ds for a reason..maybe we should call the paludian's because most are like that zone.. dumb free cheap and easy experince..</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, we realize that we are in good shape overall.  Still, in our heart-of-hearts, I think most Paladins would like our disciplines to be more useful.  Pretty much the only one that ever gets used is Holyforge.  But, that is another issue for another day.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the melee changes.  Even though helping Warriors will hurt my chances when I go LFG I realize that the three plate classes should be perceived as equal for most experience grouping situations.<br />

<br />
is currently.. <br />
<br />
Warrior Disciplines Also Suck.. because we cant use anything besides Defensive/Evasive Without screwing ourselves for a half hour or more...<br />
<br />
Unlinking disciplines is good for everyone..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boleslav, unless the changes are waaaay better as a finished product than the initial descriptions indicate, this isnt going to hurt your chances when LFG at all.  At least at this stage it looks like the possibility of getting a special move in is still pretty random.  Aggro spells are guaranteed to work on demand.  I'm not saying I think the changes are a bad thing, just that from what little has been hinted at they're not going to address the ultimate problem.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins should get this, they are a melee class and it should be a core change to how melee works.  However, Knights should not be part of the initial change.  They need to work to get things into a semblance of balance first, and then they can decide exactly which moves are viable to give to knights without breaking the balance.  This also hopefully could make 1h and shield viable if they can link useful moves to shield bash(not 2h bash).<br />
<br />
Also this very well may include a fix to aggro, its way too vague to know at this time.  They stated that some moves will be usable without a significant open, which could mean a new taunt move for getting initial aggro.  Its just too soon to tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cuedyen2</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boleslav was not saying the new changes will hurt his chance at finding a group - he was saying that fixing warriors would do that.  Balance would occur when a group is looking for a tank and takes the first Warrior/Paladin/SK that is available.<br />
<br />
If the skills will actually fix warriors is still debatable.</div></div><hr />
