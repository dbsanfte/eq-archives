I've seen these two acronyms tossed about quite a bit, but have no clue what them stand for, or what they indicate.  Looked in the library first, but couldn't find an answer.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example a mob that has a DB 1000 and DI 100 his min hit would be 1100 and max hit would be 3000. Each hit is calculated DB+DI(1-20) so if the mob rolled a 7 his hit that round would be 1700 (db of 1000 + DI*7)<br />
<br />
The only exclusion to this is warriors roll a 1-19 instead of 1-20 giving us our innate 5% dmg mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Assume a die 20...it can random from 1-20.<br />
<br />
- the DI is the damage per hit die. So in paen's example from Die roll of 1 (100) to Die roll of 20 (2000)<br />
<br />
- the DB is the added damage per die (a constant).  So in Paen's example D1 (100+1000= 1100) and D20 (2000+1000)<br />
<br />
Good stuff and kinda intuitive when you think like you are rolling dice...sorry for the rehash but I figured if this helped me understand this it might help others.</div></div><hr />

Of course I always think of DB as Damage Base, but the effect is the same. When DB is high, you don't want to be hit, so evade, when DI is high (and you are not stupidly over ACed for the mob) you want defensive/stonewall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DI in some discussions also refers to divine intervention. Cleric spell, buff that may (or may not) fire when you get low on hitpoints. If it fires, you get healed. Chances that it will fire go up based on your CHA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And for a cleric DB= Divine Barrier, basically a spell that drops them from the agro list and makes them invulnerable for a few seconds (like 12 or something) while rendering them unable to cast.</div></div><hr />

I searched first, I promise!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on DB and DI... now I understand how this 5% damage mitigation bonus that everyone talks about, is derrived.  But in reality, wouldn't the true mitigation percentage fluctuate depending on the DB as well as DI?<br />
<br />
To take the example above...<br />
DB=1000 and DI=100<br />
<br />
Minimum hit is 1100, max hit is 3000 for most classes.<br />
However for Warriors, max hit is 2900...<br />
<br />
2900/3000 is 96.6% or 3.4% lower max hit.  Of course this number would fluctuate as the DB and DI values change.  <br />
<br />
/ouch... haven't had to do math in decades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye &quot;DI&quot; won't search as it's too short.<br />
The main thing is pay attention to the evasive/defensive recomendations rather than simply mindlessly hitting defensive on everything no matter where you are.<br />
And, assuming the library thread is accurate, it gives ya a pretty good sense of the relative damage-producing power of listed mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, its not really 5% it fluctuates every mob depending on the DI.<br />
<br />
Shielding is the same way just reverse, it strips the percentage off the DB only, never touching the DI, on the same example mob above 10% shielding would take 100pts of dmg off every hit regardless of whether the hit was for 1700 or 3000 initially.</div></div><hr />
