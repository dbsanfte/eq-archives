I was considering just getting 3 for run3 jsut to help pulls such as in PoJ. any advice would be appreciated on when to really start crankin em out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember that AA exp doesn't scale like regular exp.  So it goes faster at higher levels.<br />
<br />
That said, RS3 is just great.  PoJ isn't where it's really needed, though, because you can cast SoW in PoJ.  RS3 makes a huge difference in dungeons, where SoW won't work.  <br />
<br />
All else equal, if you got levels first, the total time to get levels and AA would be less.  But that dungeon pulling thing .. if you are often a puller, I'd go for RS3 somewhere around 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got Run 1 with my monk at level 51, Run 2 at  52 and Run 3 around level 55. <br />
<br />
I still don't have that many AAs with my monk ... First Aid 3, CF 1 and ND1.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
With my warrior I have 4 AAs at level 52, and am not all that motivated to level or AA grind much right now.<br />
<br />
The general consensus is to get Run 3 as fast as possible if you really want to AA for something ... and then hold off till 60 to start getting them.<br />
<br />
But with the ZEM for PoP making XPing in the 50s so fast and smooth, it probably isn't that big of a deal if you want to bang out some AAs in your mid-50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run 3 is worth getting over any levels or any other AA.<br />
<br />
Other than that, levels are more important, but it shouldn't be everything.  But you can't even use most of the interesting AAs without being level 59 anyway, so why not level first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried at level 51 and thought AA was horribly slow. I was getting like 1pct or less AA per kill, and yes, to me that was horribly slow since I was levelling just as fast.<br />
<br />
I waited level 55 to get Run Speed 3, and now am putting off any further AA till level 60.<br />
<br />
At level 55 the AA you get from Plane of Nightmare or Plane of Disease isn't bad at all.. it's still slow, but if you don't look at your exp bar all the time, you;'ll find after a few days of grouping your 3 AA pts will be done. So for less than week evening's worth of grouping, no more sow potions ever.. it's well worth it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuli</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, just wondering what your take is on Regen?  I got my first AA last week and I've just been wandering around not spending for fear of buyers remorse.  I know I know everyone says to do Run first but I'm never without a 10 dose of SoW and I'm rarely the puller(play with a monk nearly every night) so it doesn't seem quite so urgent to me to be able to run a little faster.  Then again if everyone does it there must be a reason, right?  Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get Run 3.  You're gonna feel extremely stupid when you're 60 and everyone else is running at sow speed indoors on your first Kael or ToV raid and you're falling behind.<br />
<br />
Run 3 = free inventory slot that doesn't need to be used by Jboots, and end of sow potion buying.  You aren't going to regret run 3, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could do 3 more AA's now for Regen if I wanted, but at least as a melee I dont see the point. Hell I  never get the time to work on BW because crazy clerics heal me so regen is not going to help me much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't regret run3, however I miss my regen from time to time. ( I had it refunded back in the day :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go Run3 and then Regen3. Just beacuase Run3 is godly in some occasions and regen 3 just makes those little number's that keep us alive come back faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I waited till 60 to get my run 3, I don't regret it. It would have helped some sure, but nothing that I couldn't deal with.<br />
<br />
It's up to you, I felt like aa was going way too slow at those levels so I just kept pushing along in levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I waited till 60 to get Run3, and I'm now almost 62 without getting anymore. I think I'll buffer into 62 then get some AA's under my belt before making the final push to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">before you can start on your class AAs your gonna need to spend 6 points in general and Run 3 is the way to go. Then most warriors would put the other 3 into Regen.<br />
<br />
As to when to get it, it would at least get Run 1 or 2 then you can hold off till your in your later 50s and the exp comes a bit faster. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt advocate spending a lot of time getting AAs when your in your low 50s because levels at that stage means a lot, especially when even tier 1 pop mobs are all mid 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started trying to get my first AA point at 51, it was so painfully slow I went full regular xp until 55.  At 55 I've been grouping with some low 50's friends alot that can't really handle planes well yet, and so I started doing full AA  just to see my xp bar move. :)  I'm probably going to do full AA 'till I get run3 (too many raids take place indoors), then level a bit more, then do regen3.  Level 55 is better than a few AA imho, defensive makes you a much better assset to a raid than run3 regen3 will. :)<br />
