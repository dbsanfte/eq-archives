Primary<br />
SoD - Anger 3 Aug<br />
Secondary<br />
BoC - No Augment<br />
<br />
Once I anger 3 the BoC, does anyone have any reasoning which weapon would be better in primary / secondary?<br />
<br />
I know that for secondary weapon agro, it helps to have a weapon with damage 15 or above (to get the minimum hit of 2), but I dont know how that offsets the extra Agro from BoC in primary.<br />
<br />
Secondary question, pre elementals, besides bloodfrenzy and hategiver, are there any weapons which would widely upgrade this combo?  (GBoS with anger 3 would replace SoD, but im not going to spend a lot of raid points on this)</div></div><hr />

Don't spend raid points on a GBoS, get a couple groups together and kill Auliffe on your own, GBoS is pretty common.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's been a while, I was thinking GSot4W. Eindride is still pretty easy, I wouldn't waste DKP on any BoT tower drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never heard this before. As far as I am aware any weapon in your secondary will always have a minimum hit of 1 because there is no off-hand dmg bonus. <br />
<br />
I used a 15-21 weapon in my offhand for a while, I will check my logs to confirm this.<br />
<br />
Back to the original questions, GboS is an upgrade to both those weapons if you can put Anger 3 on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. agro seems to be based on max hit without a crit so minimum damage would not change agro.<br />
<br />
2. agro from dps in off-hand is something like a fifth of the agro compared to main hand.  Hardly a consideration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shows the offhand information.<br />
<br />
I guess my concern is that the BoC is going to be said to be put in primary hand just because thats what the assumption is, with no regard to offhand agro.  (which the sod really doesnt do well in).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">K-Dog</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to put boc main hand because it had a better ratio than sod.  Having sod offhand isnt so bad because your damage bonus doesnt affect proc damage at all.</div></div><hr />

Anger3 the BoC and look to replace the SoD (although losing that Anger3 is a real blow still you will get a ton of $$$ for the SoD).<br />
<br />
BBB or BF or the fine item I use OSoW is better mainhanded..... or anyweapon with a 450 plus inate agro proc and a &quot;more procs then normal&quot; type rate and better then 20/15 would be a better mainhand. <br />
<br />
OSoW is 2-3 groupable and not really sought after (i.e. other warriors not knowing its 25percent extra proc rate will not even be interested in the item).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, min hit on 15+ damage offhand is 2.  Something to do with rounding I think.<br />
<br />
At higher levels I really dont see SoD to be worth its price (at lower levels is super naturally <br />
<br />
SoD doesn't proc until 46.  It's not good for twinks either.</div></div><hr />
