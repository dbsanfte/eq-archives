<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste ASAP!  Like, head to the bazaar nowish and buy the best haste item you can afford. And lose the 'magelo' sword and get something that will be even decent at aggro: Copper Hammer, Sword of the Bloodsworn or a Frostbringer even.  <br />
For armor look at Ornate if you're rich or Fine Heraldic if you're not so rich.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree though, priorities should be agro weapons and haste as suggested above.  If your guild is raiding BoT you might be able to drag them out and have them hit Xanamech for ya to pick up some 41% haste and a CHSD, or just drag down a group to Droga a few times and pick up the CHoS, SotB, and the 31% haste belt.  Once your weapon/haste situation is remedied, you can look at armor upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is true. DPS, War, Cleric, Slower and JB = dead.<br />
<br />
Xanamech = around 3 or 4 clerics, 10 DPS and a good war and slower.<br />
<br />
You could do with less, but would be a longish fight.<br />
<br />
All numbers 65 of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to say get a GSoT and/or WMBS.<br />
<br />
Armor, any chance of raidign ToV in a meaningful way?<br />
<br />
If you don't have haste that would be a priority (after GSoT which is probably stupid cheap).</div></div><hr />

Bracer of Benevolence quest is a good idea if you are on dragon faction too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste. Soulscream belt, for example.<br />
LDON yourself some armor from Miragul's. I think you'll like the bracers.<br />
CHoS + SotB will carry you to 65 and beyond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ToV was raided for years with max level of 60. A crew that big with up to date gear could destroy HoT, and would probably have an easy time everywhere else in ToV as well. (assuming proper class distribution, enough clerics etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with karlorr on NToV<br />
<br />
Your guild can do it.  It will take a lot of participation and descipline.  Expect lots of deaths, and camp a cleric at first sign of a wipe.  We're spoiled now with flawless Vindi, Statue, Dain, Tormax, and Aary kills.  It wasn't designed to be that way.<br />
I'd suggest bringing a clericBot whose only job it is to move with the raid, and camp before battles begin.<br />
<br />
Also, for good armor, EToV (HoT) is the place to be.   The armor drops there are the easiest Really Good armor to get.  You'll need good CoV faction for turn-ins.  Your guild can snooze in HoT with three groups.</div></div><hr />

I'm checking on allakhazam and there are alot of mobs.. so if sombody could post the best mobs to take down that would be great.. thanks =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlorr</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No keys.. IMO Velious was the golden age of EQ.. no shards, no flags.. just straight faction work that you didn't even need to do unless you wanted to turn in quest stuff.<br />
<br />
As far as mobs go, you can't really cherry pick too easily. Best bet is to just jump in there and &quot;do the cycle&quot; as we used to say in my old guild. Start off in Halls of Testing, then go North or West depending on what the majority of folks want to do faction wise.</div></div><hr />

port to CS, swim to SG, succor across or swim (safer to succor) to EW, in EW run to ToV. Might want to invis up for run through EW. And kill all the dragons around ToV entrance if on Kael faction for decent neck resist items.<br />

I was talking to my guild about that and there might be willing to try it.. was looking at some of the mobs that had pretty good drops and they didnt seen me be very hard.. can I get some feedback on this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SsRA is harder than NToV.  Gear up in Halls of Testing in ToV for a few weeks, then do NToV for a few weeks, then you will be prepared for SSRA.  Once you have mastered SSRA (might need to recruit a few more people to do hard mobs like Emperor) you can move on to farm Vex Thal.  Once you farm Vex Thal to the point of utter boredom, your guild will be able to easily get through the flag process to go to elemental planes.  If you skip SSRA and VT, you can stiill do flags but might need a few more people and a while longer to do it.  You can form an alliance with a similar geared guild too, instead of recruiting more people.</div></div><hr />

Don't sell yourself short if you think you've got at least that many people.  A good tank, cleric, shaman, and chanter and you're pretty darn good to go in there as long as you make sure you have enough healing power to keep people alive through AEs.  Check around the site, you'll find a couple other good posts on how to do HoT.</div></div><hr />

That will make a huge difference against the raptor mobs and a noticable difference against the wyverns, drakes and wurms. Also, at that level, paladins are about the best group healers, that should be his role. The best way to do HoT at the non-trivial level is to rotate 2-3 55+ warriors as MT, so you always have defensive up. Good luck and bind a cleric outside just in case =).</div></div><hr />

BTW Kail, I do have a GSoT, I use it quite often but my skill isnt maxed in 2 hb yet =(  <br />
<br />
You proc even on misses, so that doesn't matter. I started out with my GSoT at about 100 2hb skill, and had no problems holding agro, which, leads me to believe that misses generate as much agro as a hit (theres a post in the library that re-enforces that statement).<br />
<br />
I don't know about all you other warriors out there, but I'd save myself hours of time or 25k plat and just spend 100 PP on a GSoT. Its a much better weapon overall (in my opinion), simply because you don't take as much riposte damage (gogo less wasted mana!), its great DPS, and the proc gets a mobs attention quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was doing Hall of Testing with 7 people at level 60 with me tanking in Thurgadin armor.  With 65s it's cake.  And with 30 people that are 60+ you could do NToV with a decent turnout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, a family member of mine used to do HoT with just him boxing a shm, clr, and ench and another family member playing a war.  All were level 60 at the time I believe, maybe the cleric was only 56-58, all in mostly PoG armor.  I would join them at times with my wiz.  You can gear up in HoT with just one group of 60+ in Thurg quest or equivalent gear.  Although you need to stay near the entrance and it's pretty dull...  although killing dragons is never that dull.  :)<br />
<br />
The times I've done NToV have been with 25-35 people, avg raid level 58-60, and it's np clearing it with those numbers.  However, you do need to know the strats, Aaryonar is no push-over.  What I found most important was positioning of the casters to avoid the ae's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there is no key to HoT. Make sure no one is KoS to dragons or the door drakes will agro when they sit near the door. I two grouped it with a pick-up group and kept the enchanter alive with my 59th druid alt (with kick butt NToV gear). Your guild could do NToV and it is fun as all hell, tell the wis casters a 6FT shield drops there, you won't be able to stop them wanting to go now!</div></div><hr />
