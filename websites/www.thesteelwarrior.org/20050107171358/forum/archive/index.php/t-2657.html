<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick note: I was messing with my magelo earlier and set my defense skill to its cap. Its in reality 212, not 252, the correct AC value is actually about 1020.<br />
<br />
Quick Edit #2: Magelo is being a bit buggy with me right now, and i'm not sure of my level updated correctly.  I'm level 52, not 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some time ago, when I was at level 40ish, I took a quick break from leveling and whored rallic packs, and on occasion silks to get some equipment upgrades. This worked well, because at the time I had no access whatsoever to any better ways of making money, and upgrades back then took 30-60 minutes of farming to grab enough cash for.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm level 52, bags and silks are just far too slow for moneymaking, it'd take weeks of money-making using those methods to get any sort of upgrade to my equipments.<br />
<br />
To give a bit of info, the guild I'm in (Legions of Ragnarok) isn't very raid oriented, and it shows if you had access to the guild manager. Not very many active high level characters =\<br />
<br />
However, theres usually at least enough on to form a group at any given time. Thats not to say that they'll always be available to group with me, but...I also frequently duo with a shaman friend.<br />
<br />
Anyways, now that I'm planar capable, I noticed a severe lack in my ability to tank. I was just fine as a tank when mobs hit for an average of 50 each time, but now that they can do up to 500 damage in a single combat round, I seriously need some HP upgrades. As I've explained already, our guild isn't raid oriented, so smacking up some gods or high end planar zones to get some upgrades isn't an option. <br />
<br />
Are there any upgrades out there that I could perhaps net by duoing somewhere with my shaman friend, or bringing a guild group to? I don't really have the means to make any sort of cash to afford the upgrades, so I'm looking for questables/droppables that a group/duo could do.</div></div><hr />

Hit sebilis, or maybe gunthak, for some blue diamond drops.   Then, find a human smith on your server, and have him use those to craft you some Fine Heraldic armour.  Off the top of my head, in my fairly limited experience, your gear looks not too bad, and from what I can think of upgrades, doing them with a group around your level (53-54) could be tough.  <br />
<br />
Or, if your group is geared decently, go and hit Kael for some drops.  Once you're done with upgrades there, hopefully you can get enough people together to hit SS/HoT for the upgrades there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">UP, farming Moktar/Ralduken.  Not the greatest stuff in the world, but would represent some upgrades, and good exp, and can make a few plat from the gems.  Kael by the bank should be single groupable, provided you have some one 57+ to single pull, and Thurg quest armor does drop their(rarely), and the exp is not terrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had my eyes on the thurgadin quest armors for awhile, but I couldn't get enough guild interest in that.<br />
<br />
I was told it'd take quite some time to get some of the rarer pieces, let alone a whole set, and it'd be best to use the guilds time getting better armors - like the dragon quest armors.<br />
<br />
However, the guild hasn't shown much interest in that, either. O_o<br />
<br />
A friend gave me a new equipment today, and my magelos been updated.<br />
<br />
I'll have to see about doing the moktor/raldukan, single groupable areas, especially if it wields decent experience will definetly be a good &quot;carrot&quot; so to speak to get some help ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er... Zito... I think fine heraldic is flagged BAR HUM HEF only.  Renix's magelo indicates he is a VAH SHIR.  Therefore, it would not be much use to him buying human cultural.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I'd drag a group of friends to KD for faction farming.  Here's a BIG FAT CLUE to your guild:  If you want HoT armor, you need Claws of Veeshan faction.  Unless you want to spend even more of an arseload of time factioning in GD/WL, doing the arena in kael is your BEST bet.  Once you have the faction to do it, do the draconic pauldrons and 2 bracer of benevolence quests.  These 2 quests alone are worth the factioning, in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
If that does not work, take a group of friends to Veksar and LIVE there.  The kylong armor (seeing that you have the greaves) is pretty darn close to (and a tad better, in some cases) thurg armor.  It is very good exp in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shmashed</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Youve got some really good equipment recommendations, but as someone who was in the same situation as you, i just want to say a few things.  I thought my items were junk when I was level 52 in planes because i was getting ripped to bits.  Then, I went to poj.   I noticed the experience was considerably slower, but since I could take those so easily groups tended to be more stable, so the exp/day  I was getting far exceeded other zones.  Around level 54/55 is when I finally was able to tank the other three and do a great job.  The problem wasnt my items, it was the level difference.  Not only did the experience in poj exceed the others over time, it also made me feel better my class choice.  I was seriously getting ticked off when I was getting annihalated in PoD at 52/53 but then a paladin would come along one level higher and do the job infinitely better with their spells.<br />
<br />
I will be the first to say take my advice lightly, as I am a newbie compared to many people in here, 58 warrior being my only character.  Dont bog yourself down for days on getting items, push through it, level 52 and 53 were the hardest levels I have experienced as of yet due to the fact the tank should generally be the highest level in the group and that doesnt cut it in the other planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shmashed</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck, looking again at your magelo your stuff is great.  Only gaps I see are bracers started to look dated along with your boots.<br />
<br />
Weapon choice....not so sure.  I dunno if you can keep aggro with these honestly from my experience, but...you know best what works for you.  The old if it aint broke dont fix it addage.  I got a gsot at 55 and havent looked back, but before then was using a troll crafted yak and frosty.  Did what I thought to be a nice job if you needed suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eeeeeeeeeep !!!  Kiya, you are absolutely correct, Vah Shir can't wear the human cultural.  Me bad, hope that didn't cause any hassles for ya Renix.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, where in Magelo profiles does it give that info ?  I just clicked on the magelo link, saw &quot;agnostic&quot; listed under deity, but didn't see any racial info ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at your gear and remembering myself at 54 (seems like yesterday) I would have to say you're very well equipped.  My war is an Ogre, so I had a jump on you for stats, but you're gear is quite nice compared to what I had.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?  I would think about the following items in order:<br />
<br />
1)  Hitting level 60 is a huge difference.  I didn't believe it, but you take so much less damage that you'll feel like superman.  I was in the exact same gear from 52 - 65 (how sad) and I noticed a huge difference fighting the Netlings in PoN (did that or several levels and was there for 58- 61).  60 is the biggest jump and benefit you'll get by far.  I noticed I kept doing better up until 65, but 59 vs 60 is very noticeable.<br />
<br />
2)  Grab your Kael armor, I did it all through my low 50's.  A single group of mid 50's can fight there, so long as you have a FD puller.  The fights will be hard and the drop rate is low.  You will get a nice set of armor in the end that will fill your main slots for a while.<br />
<br />
3)  Or, be smart (unlike me) and just level your butt to low 60's.  Then hit Halls of Testing.  Talk about amazing drop levels.  Every hunt there has made me regret the months of wasted time in Kael.  All because I thought I'd never be able to 1 group HoT.  HoT can be done (very slowly) with one group in your 60's.  At 65, I find the fights take 9minutes tops, but I don't have the perfect group for there.  The grind, in your existing gear, to low 60's then doing HoT is very nice.  Of course, resist gear helps a lot in HoT, but just having a mage and a druid in their 60's does help quite a bit.  You got druid seasons spells plus 40 or so MR on the mage DS, that you'll be pretty high even without specific gear.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit, sorry I can't think of much else right now.  I've done fine in my group in full thurgadin gear through all the planes, as it wasn't until recently at 65 that I hit full SS armor.  The difference helps, but the cleric/druid buffs were really the meat of my HPs to offset my crappy gear.  The last thing I will recommend is saving your PP and focus on getting better weapons.  What you have is good, but there are some decent weapons at reasonable prices that will boost your sta/hp a bit more.  Shortblade of Lightning, new droga weapons (copper hammer / bloodsword) as well as old reliable Swiftblade of Zek.  They'll up your damage a bit as well as up your HPs quite a bit and they'll last you a while until you get better.  On my server those weapons are rather cheap in the 10-30K top range, but my server is a bit wacky on prices as I've seen a lot of other servers cheap.<br />

Guessing it's probably just a mistake when you upgraded your magelo or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, thanks for all the suggestions :) <br />
<br />
Perhaps if I mention that smashing in kael wouldn't be to get the thurg quest armors alone, but for the faction, then I could net a chance at a few quick upgrades as I work my way towards dragon faction and their armors.<br />
<br />
And my weapons bag (bag of sewn evil eye) has my other weapons, including a GSoT i plan to use at level 55.</div></div><hr />
