<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gankan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love playing my warrior and while I have played since Kunark I am also known for leveling my chars to twenty, deleting them and remaking them. -- which is probably why none of my characters have made it to 65 yet. lol <br />
<br />
My main is Orinthial Starbearer, a 61st wizard. He was my first toon and I have put my heart and soul into him over the years. <br />
<br />
Gankan, my warrior, was an escape into the world of melee and what a wonderful trip it has been thus far. I enjoy almost every second I play him, well for the most part at least, however I must be doing something wrong here...<br />

<br />
Having sunk a lot of pp as well as blood an sweat into this character sofar, I keep hearing all of you talk about 8k HP unbuffed and I wonder... where in the heck is that all going to come from? <br />
<br />
What's worse is I'm seeing alot of posts (and not in the Overlord section either) saying that you aren't good unless you've got 8K unbuffed hp and 1300+ unbuffed AC <br />
<br />
I was told there was a large HP bonus at 52 yet I just got him there and only gained about 100 or so. Granted I'm only 3% into 52 thus far, but I was expecting much more.<br />
<br />
I thought having almost 3K HP and over 1K AC unbuffed at 52 was pretty good but... maybe not?<br />
<br />
I love this little guy to death and there's no way I would give him up -- just looking for a little hope, explanation, something?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear is very nice, and almost 3k hp and over 1k ac IS pretty good.<br />
<br />
Few people see 8k unbuffed.. heck, not that many even see 8k fully buffed, and they are almost all level 65 with lots of AAs. You being concerned about not being close to 8k hp is like me asking why your wizard doesnt have a 6k manapool - its just not gonna happen until 65 and when your in a raid guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your gear is fine, so is your current HP/AC.<br />
<br />
 You have to remember, a LOT of the posters here are VT/EP/Time Warriors, with some of (If not most of) the best droppable Warrior gear in game. They min/max for HP/AC and on top of that a lot of them have 100+AA that they've spent on better stats, more mitigation, more HP, etc.<br />
<br />
 Forget about them. You're fine. Go tank and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">8k hp is elemental and up gear.<br />
<br />
as for bougt gear take all the money you have spent on your wizzys gear and spells and dubble it. since wars are gear only we get the big sidways shaft without lube. the only releese is free raid gear.<br />
<br />
but 3k and 1k at 52 is good.<br />
<br />
ok so first thing would be to change the items with +str and no hp out with items with raw hp. the shaman buff will max it for a long time. neck and shoulders look like good canidates. next would be +sta items changed to +sta and +hp, boots, bracer, arm, face is iffy goods ones break the bank or drop ac, same with legs prolly best for a while, another bloodmetal ear.<br />
<br />
key thing is don't be pressured to upgrade save for something good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye id say with bought gear/LDoN and not raiding youd be looking at 6k hp unbuffed at most, maybe a little more, not 8khp+ unless you start getting loot in Elemental Planes or time...I have 6700hp unbuffed with mostly Fierce Heraldic and VT loot...still awaiting to get my first piece of Raexs :(, and our guild MA had about 7khp unbuffed before EP...but he had a lot of VT loot and spent his DKP wisely...</div></div><hr />
