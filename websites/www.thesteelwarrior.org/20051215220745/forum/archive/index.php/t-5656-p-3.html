Maybe I should restate that.  What proof could you provide to show that over long periods of time it has never happened.  Even logs and parses cannot show this to any degree of certainity.  It would be much easier in this case to prove that it can happen than to prove it can't.   <br />
<br />
Yes it would be easier to prove it can happen, but it is very simple to prove to a resonable degree of confidence that this can not happen.  Take a statistics class and you will understand.  In fact i would argue that it is far easier to prove it cannot happen via parsing and statistics, than it is to read over ever proc message and prove that you have double parsed.</div></div><hr />

In the post it was explained how a weapon would go through the succession of procs checking for a successful proc.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, there are hundreds of hours of parses that have been done by various people on this board, even if the possibility where statistically insignificant, we would have seen proof of this by now.<br />
<br />
Post a screen shot, all you have to do is scroll back up when it happens, no excuse for missing it. I would venture a guess that what you have noticed is procs on successive swings, one being a hit and one a miss. You do have misses turned off right?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Innate&quot; procs, such as imbued procs are NOT affected by weapons affinity, as has been stated 10000 times.   <br />
<br />
Just curious as to what you're referring to by &quot;imbued&quot; procs ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you have a link to the thread where the dev stated that information, I'd like to see it.  The date at least would be pretty important, to see how current it is.</div></div><hr />

3 - remembering to SS it before it scrolls off the window<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to why you're so sure it can't happen if you don't even have augmented weapons with innate procs.  <br />
A SS won't mean a thing because you can have the same proc fire on a double attack round but on each seperate swing.  With any packet info lag, it's even possible to see a triple proc.  There's  a screenshot on the rogue forum showing this &quot;triple proc&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stikka</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Rogue who used 4 destinct and parsable procs on 2 weapons for a long while I can safely say I have never had a double proc on a swing.<br />
<br />
I was using JTB in main with Rujark venom aug and Ifir in off with Vampire kiss aug. <br />
In a 28 meg logfile there is not 1 single incidence of a double proc of any of the 4 possibles on a single swing. Easy enough to check in a word processor if you think about it.<br />
<br />
Very interested to read the Combat effects and WA statistics, as I now use a Ritual Spineslicer in main hand the proc is rather handy (150 tap that appears unresistable). Thanks for the huge parsing effort.</div></div><hr />
