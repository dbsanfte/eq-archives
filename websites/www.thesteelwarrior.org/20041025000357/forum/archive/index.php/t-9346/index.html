Also, there are no promises made as to when/if this is going live:<br />
 <br />
<br />
Decaying Lord Galuk Drek<br />
<br />
This NPC in Veksar is having a make over! Woo! Changes:<br />
<br />
• Triggered NPC. When a warrior with the appropriate flags (read, once you reach this point of the quest) enters Veksar, if Galuk isn't up already, he'll spawn. This happens when you zone-in only.<br />
• If you recently spawned him, you will have to wait 2 hours before spawning him again (if he depops or is killed). This respawn time is on a per-person basis, so if you spawn it and he despawns, you'll have to wait 2 hours, but the warrior next to you can try spawning him right away for his or her chance.<br />
• You have a 15-minute grace period where he will not depop. This is to allow you time for a death or to zone out and back in, go LD, etc.<br />
• If you've previously spawned him and he despawned before you could kill him, you'll get a message indicating *approximately* how much time you have to wait. This is not exact, so you'll have to make a guess on it.<br />
• When you zone in, if you are the one to spawn Galuk, you'll receive a message on screen and in your chat window indicating so.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that helps.<br />
<br />
Dragorn Champion<br />
<br />
• Lowered the respawn of this fellow from 24 hour hours (with a variance) to 2 hours (with a variance).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iyacc@work</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is there a despawn time or deadline to kill him once you zone in?<br />
<br />
If you take a group there and have two warriors in it who need, will it spawn two, or will it not spawn the second one? I would assume it wouldn't spawn one, if one was already up, but......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garthud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That looks like a good, direct solution.  How refreshing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the updated news.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WOOOO.. =) Been camping that punk for 2 weeks now with no luck :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is awesome news.  I really hope that this makes it to the live servers.  There are many aa's I would rather be getting and other guildees I can help with epics instead of waiting in an insanely long line only to have someone waltz in and kill it before I can muster the group or so it would take to kill it.<br />
<br />
One question I have though, I don't understand the 15 min thing.  Is that 15 min from the time the warrior zones in?  From looking at the map, it appears it spawns in the opposite corner of the zone from the zone in unless I am mistaken and might take some time to cut back to.<br />
<br />
Fried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd think it will be 15 mins post agro-ing him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaikachi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let's say you're the one he spawns for. As long as you remain in the zone, he'll remain up.<br />
<br />
Once you leave the zone (whether it's because you died, zoned, LD or logged), he will remain up for another 15 minutes. If you happen to come back into the zone before he despawns, he'll reset this 15 minute timer.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that clarifies it a bit more.<br />

<br />
Unlike, say, COH, where everything is always up in the instanced zones you enter?   :p <br />
<br />
We play a PvE game.  The issue should be whether or not we have the power to pit ourselves against the environment.  Not whether we have the mental stamina to camp in that environment for 48 hours, fighting off any other warriors who are to the same spot.<br />
<br />
Great change, IMO, and it brings our camps in line with other epic camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lets not get another group vs group debate going in a thread that is serving as an information conduit. It's not the hardest, it's also not the easiest of the current epic quests - down the middle as it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it is a good change.  Competeing for spawns with 200+ other warriors on the same server is  hard enough without random_group_05 taking the spawn you waited 2 weeks for before you can get a force in.<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 is definitely better implemented than epic 1.0 was.  <br />

<br />
Spawn times have  nothing to do with difficulty. If you happen to have no job or life, awesome. I don't have time to waste on crap like that.<br />
<br />
If you want something to be difficult, make the mob badass. Make it an encounter like Pojustice where you need to do it with 1-2 groups or whatever but he is really hard. Don't just increase a timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gurunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Galuk drek can be dropped with a half-decent pickup group,  the hardest fight in our epic 1.5 takes 3-4 elemental level groups, with no real tricks or tactics needed.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;challenge&quot;  in our epic was the (poorly designed)  ground spawn timers and the repop times of Galuk and the Champ.   There are no interesting fights, no special events, no real story... (and ogre has visions of a weapon.. ok sure)<br />
<br />
If Galuk and the Champ are no longer any bottleneck at all, maybe they should at least be a half decent challenge, is what I was saying, rather than speedbumps.   I do think overly easy mobs on overly long timers for epics is BAD.  Long timer hard mobs are ok, they wont' get dropped by every random grp that wanders by...  Short timer hard mobs are the best middle ground, to have a challenge but not have the drama and boredom of camping long pops while competing with everyone else on the server for it.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'd rather we had a boring and easy epic quest than an overly hard one like the wizard's.<br />
<br />
The other epic quests just seem to have more story, more unique seeming events.. ours is just errands and simple mobs to roll over,  not very epic seeming.  Then again, our epic IS a fine steel longsword with a fancy hilt... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Glad they are at least looking at this. The changes should help out a ton with the bottlenecks there.<br />
<br />
Complain if you like Gurunt, but the bottle neck that is Galuk has no real point either. The mob is not that hard, just hard to catch up when you have people able to help faster than anyone else is. I spent about 70 hours total getting that part, and am happy few other warriors will have to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
The Champ was not as bad, but mostly becouse the larger bottleneck is the step before it. And he is a bit harder to kill than your normal WoS group is going to stumble upon and win.<br />
<br />
Got my Epic 1.5 last night, hopefully my guilds fellow warriors will have a much easier time of it.<br />
(And thanks again for the help Brutall  :) )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gurunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Galuk as it is now on live is the worst setup they could make.<br />
<br />
He's 2boxable with a 2 day timer.... ANY change can't make it worse.   Just being up all the time and still 2 boxable makes it a pointless step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Funny, I could not 3 box him. Cleric went OOM at 9%<br />
<br />
Not everyone is in Time+ gear you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks VERY much for fixing this spawn! I can get on with my life!  :D <br />
<br />
Gurunt, epic v1.5 is supposed to be easy, it's working as intended. I'm confident that 2.0 will be a bit more difficult, worry about that being too easy if you must.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think that waiting forever for a mob that 2 people (or 1 talented M-boxxer, or about any group of lesser-geared folks) can kill easily to be Epic in difficulty, call that kind of crap Test of Mind Numbing Stupidity Endurance or something, but don't call it Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I tend to think that our epic has fights that are too easy, but not so bad that we have a legitimate complaint.  Pretty much every epic has....<br />
<br />
Some 1 group content<br />
Some 2 group content<br />
One 3-4 group fight<br />
<br />
If Girplan were a bit hader (Kill 4 slashers, then spawn Girplan Devourer + 4 unmez slashers), and the last fight were a bit harder (add a single target banish to the throne nearby every 30 seconds+ Unresistable root in place and Drop from hatelist, in other words, remove tanks from the fight) it'd be right in line with all other epics.<br />
<br />
The thing is, just because some of the fights are too easy (which I'll certainly agree with) doesn't necessarily mean that removing bottlenecks is bad.   Bottlenecks and preventing people from engaging in fights that are too easy isn't a justifiable way of overcoming the problem of the fights being too easy in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you, together with making these mobs triggerable (what I agree since long spaw times sux) will make our epic so easy, but so easy that for sure I will do it for my friends 67 warrior alt. Together with the changes they should make these 2 mobs harder to make epic a litle hmmmmmm........EPIC!<br />

<br />
Spawn timers needed changing regardless of the difficulty of the encounters.   The two issues are 100% separate, and the quest is no more or less rewarding based on spawn times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The only difficulty in camping 48hour spawns is finding excuses to call into work and how to avoid a numb ass from sitting 12+ consecutive hours in your chair.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes, I'd have to agree our quest is quite simple for an average warrior.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bloodeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">For those wanting for example a harder final fight, don't forget too that warriors loose all if they fail Krekk, and than not all warriors are in time+ equiped guilds. So better to come for an overkill and pray your isp doesn't go down.<br />
<br />
Until now, I saw no other class epic requiring 3+ groups where they could loose all too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think u guys represent .1% of the warriors.  Most of us are in guilds where<br />
people work late irl and it's a struggle to put together 3 groups for an epic<br />

<br />
We'll be working epics for our guild for a long time; and instead of bragging that I<br />
got my epic in one day, if I'm lucky I might be able to say I got mine in a month.<br />
For most of us the 1.5 Epic is......... epic.<br />

When you zone in, if he's not up, he will spawn for you. This doesn't mean that you will have exclusive kill/loot rights. This is a double-edged sword, but I think the benefits of the change outweigh the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">So I take this to mean that he can still be looted out of order, if you get someone else to zone in and spawn him? Hence the need for the respawn delay per spawner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Can this part still be looted out of turn?  What I mean is say theres a warrior there that is not to this part, I zone in and spawn the mob and he kills it.  Will he be able to loot the item or is it now locked like Dragorn Champion's eye?  Also if someone else kills the mob that I spawned, if I wait a while and zone back in it will respawn for me correct?</div></div><hr />
