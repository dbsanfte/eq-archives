<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how about LDON for kedge.<br />
<br />
also for highend we could put in Ldon Wayfarers in time after each god dies. you could do a time raid in Time via LDON and be able to get 1 or  2 items of that god to make up for no true instancing.<br />
<br />
also how about for older raid zones like ToV and Ssra and VT where the mobs are to weak the loot to old to be worth bothering. they could put wayfares there to make those zones harder. like a Ntov but for lvl 65 charaters. etc etc.<br />
<br />
just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">so you want to be able to get drops with one group of the same quality as nameds with a week repop in VT/Ssra/NToV ?<br />
<br />
Yah ok and I want 20.001hp so I can live through DeathTouches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im talking about LDON raids. chane it so you can hae 72 in the raid or something. right now you clear Time and then you have nothing else to do. some do LDON othes look for tier 3/4 stuff that is up for recruits. but if they made it so you could rai dtov or ssra or vt but at various difficulties then there would be more then enough to do.<br />
<br />
as for time ldon place holders. right now there is no true instancing in time. yeah they could make it but i doubt it. this way other guilds that are in time could do a ldon in time (like 1 week per succesful raid) this way they at least get something but not they whole kit n kaboodle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are already some drops from LDoN hard that are equal to or better then NToV/Ssra/VT stuff, so in that respect it wouldn't be a change.  But yea I think raids for 36 is what was ment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Norfolk:Brell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After the success of LDoN, I wouldnt be surprised to see the next expansion be Lost dungeons of Kunark or Lost dungeons of Velious. Maybe even Luclin, but they may also add them in onesies and twosies with optional patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ranna Swiftpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hahahaha, oh yes.  Blackburrow would be good.<br />
<br />
Or even Paw or Dalnir.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deity/Cultural armor?  HAH<br />
<br />
<br />
The Vah Shir are *STILL* waiting!  At least the Iksar were addressed with Velious and later.  It's been how many expanions now and they've conveniently ignored us?  We can make Shar Vahl spiritstones now at least.  That's progress!<br />
<br />
The frogs have had everything handed to them in a plate.  It almost makes me feel sorry for the trolls.</div></div><hr />
