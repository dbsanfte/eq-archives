We're currently at HoT atm and have done mostly epics and other parts.  We have taken down Vindi but not statue yet.  I guess my question is, after we finish gearing up at HoT, what next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT, Tunare, Early SoL(IV, Grieg, etc) come to mind<br />
<br />
Also, don't be afraid to try RoBurrower and you have alot on. Really only need 1 tank, and enough clerics to keep a LONG chain going. Look up on it, FT for the guild is necessary to keep things going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After HoT there is NToV / Dain / King T / Statue / AoW.<br />
Then the complete SoL / IV / Ssra / Grieg / THO / Burrower / Shei .<br />
<br />
Then starting VT Key farming and Emperor key farming......<br />
<br />
Next step Cursed / XtC .. in Ssraa // Emperor and Lord Seru.<br />
<br />
Starting flagging in PoP until Berto and Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
Lots to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Directly after HoT I'd start in on ST keys.  Primal (Prismatic) is a healthy dps boost for your entire raid and should get you over the hump to start doing those things everyone is listing.</div></div><hr />

So does Velk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malric</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We killed Vindi quite a few times and never saw a ST key drop and only got 1 off of Velketor. We eventually just started killing First Broods for keys and since we were about the only guild working on them for a month or so we averaged about 4-5 keys a week once we started farming Sontalak heavy plus the other ones we managed to catch up. If you guys are done w/ HoT (or just really burned out on it like we were) I'd say just start hitting the dragons asap. Sont drops high lvl Kunark spells like Torpor and Malo very often, Yeli drops his head every time to turn in for gauntlets of dragon slaying, lenidira has a couple decent drops. Plus while you're killing LtK and the other named in wtov you can pick up kael quest armor if you still need anymore of that. I think our best so far is 1-2 pieces off almost every guard in LtK's room when clearing it to kill her including 1 leather bp and a couple pairs of legs. If you don't worry about cov faction you can get into ST pretty quickly in force if you work at it and all the primals you'll get make a big difference.<br />

<br />
Gotta kill Zlandi in Dragon nec. He isn't on CoV.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you want to progress, you cant worry about faction, or else you will be eternally stuck in HoT.<br />
<br />
You need to be aware, that once you pass the HoT stage, you dont whine over faction.  Trash it, get better stuff, progress further.<br />
<br />
if you dont, most of your raiders will leave, because you arnt moving forward.<br />
<br />
When you do, some of your members will leave, because they value their precious faction too much ... <br />
<br />
no easy way to do this step in the ladder, you either trash your faction and move to boss mob encounters, or you stay in HoT forever, and watch all your guildmates move on to guilds that dont care about faction, and actually progress.<br />
<br />
If you are willing to make that sacrifice for progression ... after Vindi, in this order ... which is what i would do anyway .. ::<br />
<br />
Velkator (your casters will love you)<br />
Statue of Rallos Zek<br />
Rumblecrush<br />
Doomshade<br />
Servitor of Luclin<br />
Rhag 1 &amp; 2 ( i dont know the true names off the top of my head, and am to lazy to look em up)<br />
Grieg Venificus<br />
<br />
After this point, once you farmed a bit of gear out of these guys, you may want to look into Creator, as your first BIG kill in Ssra, hes the easiest kill in ssra other than Rhags, and drops some really nice stuff, including Hategiver.  Ive done him with less than 3 groups, 1 cleric and 2 druids.  He does less damage than PoV mobs once hes slowed, and a druid can keep up the rampage tank.  But its definatly an endurance fight, hes got killer mitigation, and for a first kill, you would want a full size force there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after we finish gearing up at HoT <br />
<br />
Pretty much like is said here you want to equip and gear up for NToV then VT.<br />
<br />
Here is some of the things the guild my old main did between HoT and VT (well we fell apart before VT cause too much stress was put into getting Emp keys in short time)<br />
<br />
Farm UP raid names for needed items if any.<br />
Started with easy mobs who drop level 60 spells(BoA, Torpor, KEI, Focus) (TVD, maybe Trak, The Burrower Beast) You can prob buy these spells now a days without breaking the bank but the practice of mobilizing for names is nice.<br />
Our guild did this before PoP so maybe, depending on your level, you can farm BoT names for runes.<br />
Get healers the Spell Haste and IH IV items from PoI, Prototype somethings I think. If you can kill Vindi you can do these imo. The drop allot and are really nice stat wise too. We did this later but there mobs were a joke by then. If you can do Vindi I think you can do these.<br />
Start hitting easier ST key mobs (Zland, Kland) Gettin all the keys you need will be take a while.<br />
Also maybe wanna farm WW. Dragonbane is nice for ToV and ST keys mobs.<br />
Lord Vyrmm(sp?) should be doable and gives your monks/BLs nice upgrades.<br />
Also look for easy FT items, Cazic Thule, Burrower in AC. Maybe there is some other easy ones that have come out in last 5 ot 6 months too.<br />
Dain is nice too. Just about everyone can use that belt. <br />
<br />
Important thing here is allot of mobs drop specialized loot, need to keep everyone happy so hit allot of targets.<br />
<br />
While you are doing all of this push your people to go to Ssra on their own and farm for emp keys and other places to farm for VT shards. This process could take a while and more time spent on it here is less time spent when you need to hit Emp cause you are ready.<br />
<br />
Once you have upgraded/levled/aapts some start going for Yeli (has ST key and quest drop for ubah haste item) , Sont (ST key + spells), King Tormax(St key + quest item with $$ stats), and statue (St key + nice melee stuff) Lendiniara the Keeper.<br />
<br />
This is about the time you start doing Aary and the rest of NToV names as well. Also other ToV names drop nice dps stuff for hybrids.<br />
<br />
Once you get 2-3 groups (assuming close to 65) ST keyed start farming the 1st two ST names for Primals.<br />
<br />
Also kill mobs who drop RGC you will need it allot soon and prob should need it now and then already.<br />
<br />
After a few month of all of this, start focusing on Ssra names and geting people keyed for Emp for VT keys. <br />
<br />
Depending on how hard core your guild is you will be doing VT in less than a year.<br />
<br />
Also you will need to read up allot about all of these phases. From here on out it is not about just healing and doing damage but allot of strat(MT details, phantom effects, AE avoidance, use of AA skills ect) as well, well 95% of it atleast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saying what mobs your guild is for is really only a question your raid leaders know.<br />
<br />
Some mobs need strong MAs more(King Tormax, Statue) some need ubah DPS (Sont) some are all about positioning (Aary)<br />
<br />
One of the things you noticed is you are going from CoV faction to KoS to all. It happens. You want to keep a mage on CoV faction tho. For CoHs to ToV mobs and eventually CoH to Yeli. If you can get CoH bish then planting one in deep NToV then later deep ST would be nice.<br />
<br />
I used allot of abrevialtions cause I am lazy so feel free to ask what they meant.<br />
<br />
edit - all this took my guild about 6 or 7 months raiding 4-6 nights a week. So do not expect to do it all in a month or to be able to do some of the mobs on the list in a month. It is a progression.</div></div><hr />

The key to Xanamech is DPS and speed and group heals.  You can't CH there, because his AE stuns.</div></div><hr />
