Upcoming July 2004<br />
We have an update tentatively scheduled for July 8th.  Some of the highlights include;<br />
<br />
The ability to remove augments from items and retain them.<br />
<br />
The new Veeshan's Peak! <br />
<br />
Brenlo the Updated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>doranski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">so if you have the ability to remove and retain, when ya remove an augment that was bought does that mean ya think we could turn right around and hand it in for a refund of points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really makes me wish I had the anger III augment I melted out of my Blade of Carnage back :/.  Could use that thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Right now, it doesnt seem like theres refunding.  However, this essentially means when you upgrade gear, you can just pop it out and put it in the new item.  Or, people like me who in a drunken fit put a 15ac aug in ornate legs instead of Raex Gloves...</div></div><hr />

You can turn purchased augs in to a gnome at the South Ro camp to get a refund in points.  Only works on purchased augs.</div></div><hr />

Good,  I bought an anger II aug cause it was cheaper at the time.  Would be nice to be able to  take that out, turn it in for points, and use the points toward upgrading it to Anger III.</div></div><hr />

This gnome is being removed.  The new adventure merchant screen will now have a &quot;sell&quot; option as well as a buy.  It will work like a regular merchant.  You will only be able to &quot;sell&quot; back an item (aug or item) for 50 percent of the points it takes to buy it.</div></div><hr />
