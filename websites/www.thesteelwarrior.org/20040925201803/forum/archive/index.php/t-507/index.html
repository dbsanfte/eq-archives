<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">questions:<br />
<br />
how long does it take to get faction<br />
<br />
how hard is the quest<br />
<br />
is it still good even though only 12ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Factioning for chardok quests is long. If yer max KoS, I think its around 3400 till amiable. Keep in mind, for each green goblin skin or 2 mt death salts u get 3 faction hits (turn in to Herald in Chard).<br />
<br />
As far as it being worth it, ya...most tanks could use the 100hp on the bracer plus the aura - a dozen ac wouldnt stop me from using it.<br />
<br />
Druesella is also a PITA though, so don't plan on wrapping this quest up in short order. I usually have a number of ongoing quests and claw away at them over time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The really frustrating part is factioning in Droga and seeing the damn Angry Goblin up when you are KOS. If you plan on completing the quest take some advice. Camp out the night before a server reset at the Angry Goblins spawn point. Do what ever it takes to log in as soon as your server goes live. The Goblin as well as Druesella is both up upon a server reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sabek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bracer is nice, and its hard to beat ac5 5stam 85hps on a ring. At 65 I am using the 2nd chardok ring, and dain ring.  Now if I could just wack drusilla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heheh.... he said whack.... heheheh<br />
<br />
no, seriously, if ya doing faction solo it's a pain.  Definately take a healer with ya.  Enjoy mosstroopers. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">only dovan would think of it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Faction is a pain somewhat, but at 65 I never really needed to stop for healing.  Mosstroopers and other sk's suck, as do ds's, but other than that it's not bad.  Plus I would walk away with around 500p per night of factioning.  The worst parts of all are the Angry Goblin and Drus, they are simply evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok. my guild does chardok alot so i think i can get a aein'g mage and a rogue to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">took me about 2 weeks of factioning with 2 boxed druid and about 10 hours of that AE.<br />
faction is the worst part<br />
angry gob just time him while doing faction<br />
drus can be a bitch<br />
juggs are just ez and so is Trak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sabek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did most of my faction solo. <br />
10th coldain ring+scimitar of lifestealing+iksar regen=no downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends at what level of play your guild is at.<br />
<br />
If your guild has killed Bert or is anywhere further in PoP then that, I would say the quest isn't worthwhile.  I completed the quest in late Sept or so spending maybe 50 hours total on it.  In April I banked them, 50 hours for 7 months of use just didn't seem quite worthwhile.  Small group Dozekar farming is a better investment of time in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
