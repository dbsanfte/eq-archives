I have done some upgrades but not sure where I should go now. My guild is just now starting to take on NTOV so I am looking for upgrades that will help me in that area. I am not the MT usually SA. My magelo is current, so any thoughts on equipment that is within my current guild's capabilities would be muchly appreciated.<br />

In fact all of this will be coming from foggy memory of two years ago, sorry in advance for any errors.<br />
<br />
Beldron's Vambraces of Impiety - rare drop off of Lord Feshlak.<br />
Mask of the Sky - uncommon drop off of Eashen of the Sky.<br />
Belt of the Destroyer - Dagarn the Destroyer.<br />
Cloak of Thorns - oh crap, uh rare drop off of Lady Mirenella, or the other blue dragon whose name I always forget.  :rolleyes: <br />
Can't remember the name of the necklace but the warrior only one that can drop from any of the named drakes.<br />
<br />
I don't think you'll find too many weapons in NToV that are better than your current ones when it comes to holding aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also get plate drops off static spawns (wurms mostly) in NToV so you might be able to replace your non-myrmidon armor with Warlord's armor if you don't score any melee gear on the clearing.</div></div><hr />

it's uber and will last you prob till elementals and more<br />
<br />
If your guild can do NToV you can Kill Lord Yeli for his head to get gaunt of dragon slaying and or ST neck haste item thing<br />
<br />
Also dain should be easy for ya for an awesome 100HP belt with aura of battle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">upgrade glimmering mithril torque to something with hitpoints AND armor class like amulet of mummy wrappings (about 1500pp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Miniature nosering would be an easy upgrade for your face slot.  Take a group in to Siren's Grotto from Cobalt Scar, and either run over if ya know the way, or succor over, but get over to the Western Wastes side.  From there, go back in the hallway leading from the zone out, take your first left, and follow that to the open area with the pool in the middle.  Kill everything in sight.  The miniature nosering is the common drop from a fairly common named mob, and enthralled something I think?  Instead of looking like the usual Siren's Grotto walrus/elephant mutant mob, these look like tundra kodiaks.  If you bring a group in there, everyone in the group should have their own within a few hours.<br />
<br />
If you have a single group or 2, go to HoT, and get yourself some gauntlets of the myrmidon.<br />
<br />
If you know a smith, or depending on what your server's bazaar is like, a smithed cultural collar would be an upgrade for you, at possibly a very cheap price..fine heraldic if you're human/barb/half elf, or the elven full mithril version for any of the elven flavours. <br />
<br />
That, and do as much LDoN as you can.  Even if you don't buy the armour from there, the augments you can buy are all well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Face mask of frozen mana would be a nice upgrade.  Drops in normal miragul's adventures.  I have no idea what it costs if you buy it in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EgatBearskinner</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I misread your post, Kelor.  I thought you were looking for just the upgrades you will get in NToV alone.  If you are looking for upgrades you can get anywhere I am almost going to have to point you to the LDoN armor you can buy in Takish Hills.  Get that and a few augs to go with them and you'll be tanking in NToV far better equipped than most anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cloak of thorns is the one item you want to come out of NToV with.  Frankly, you can get NToV or better loot from the bazaar these days so if you are DKP I would save my points and look for gear in exp groups and the bazaar.  NToV is fun to do, but I don't think most guilds would bother trying to gear up there, and would just leapfrog to PoP flag mobs and Ssra/VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakatsu</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what your pp income is like but I would consider saving it for ornate molds, it will hold you through the long run well into PoP zones. The Cloak of Thorns is awesome, well worth spinning in circles for a couple mins  :D , not to mention instant self buff damage sheild. If you are not fortunate enough to win a CoT, consider buying a Cloak of greater pernicity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things you might DKP in the future:<br />
Blood Frenzy<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
<br />
Things you might quest:<br />
Ring of Dain Frostreaver<br />
Charm of Defence<br />
Binen Concertina (can't finish till you get to the EP's)<br />
<br />
Things you might buy:<br />
2 Bloodmetal Earings of Engagement<br />
Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
<br />
The things I listed might be a ways out in front of you, but all of them should be useful for a very long time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelor Silverblade</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK guys thanks for all the info. My guild is a small guild but we are slowly making our way through the progression. We just started NTOV so I will look out for these things. But I wanted upgrades in general. I have LDON so I will start looking for Takish groups for points and augs. <br />
<br />
The DKP/loot thing is one of the things our guild is struggling with right now. We have always been a family guild, not a raiding guild, but now most of our mains are 63-65 range we are trying harder stuff. <br />
Thanks for all of your thoughts.<br />

I apologize - I can't remember the name of it.  It's got about 10AC, 30ish hp, and +10 to all five resists.  A really decent necklace and dirt cheap.  It's all/all, so your whole guild could score one to bump up their resists without giving up too much in the hp/ac department.<br />
