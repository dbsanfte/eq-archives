<br />
I just recently got the ornate bracer mold, and I upgraded my Fierce Heraldic Breacer to the Kizrak's one.  Its not too much of an upgrade, but it did add Veng II.<br />
<br />
My question is that if I get another ornate mold (say bracer, or boots), should I turn them into kizrak's or should I sell them for other upgrades?  My helm would be a better upgrade and Im thinking that maybe I should have tried to trade a bracer mold for a helm mold.  Ive read the thread about how little upgrade fierce heraldic --&gt; kizrak greaves would be.  <br />
<br />
I guess my other question is which pieces are worth upgrading and/or is there an order of which gives the most benefit.  Also would selling a few molds and buying something like boots of the storm be a better idea?</div></div><hr />

One of the collars from tactics (iron bound collar?) would be a good upgrade for you too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BP and arm molds were, IMO, the best pieces to upgrade from cultural. <br />
<br />
Gauntlets - I still use my myrmidon's gaunts as I didn't want to give up the hp on em. <br />
<br />
Greaves - I have ornate legs and at times I do debate the wisdom of keeping them vs selling: the upgrade really wasn't that significant.<br />
<br />
Bracers -  they would be a little bit of an upgrade, but I play with a pretty regular bunch and I would rather see FT2 on a cleric than Veng 2 on me :p If the clerics don't need 40-60K (price on Veeshan) goes a long ways on other upgrades.<br />
<br />
Boots - I have thought about but I ended up with the dark rites ones instead<br />
<br />
Helm - I actually had one but it was banked in favour of the Helm of Rallos off AoW. I do actively regret using that mold now:could have passed to a freind or sold.</div></div><hr />

Kizrak's is better than FH, but if you can get plat to make bigger upgrades in other slots I'd do it.  Of course the FH is worth a fair amout of plat as well, so that's something to consider.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently Im looking for +HP gear.  Usually in groups or raids my Stam is maxed so I dont gain any additional HPs from Sta gear.  Then next is AC or Dex, which allows procs.  Its nice to have a +31 sta, but basically that mold would cost me 100k+.   I could use that to upgrade other stuff.</div></div><hr />
