<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There it was - the pulling bow of my dreams, almost.<br />
<br />
Sturdy Warped Bow effect: Calamity. A fear with a 0 second stun.<br />
<br />
I find a mob I can shoot for awhile, right click Symbol of the Planemasters effect: 75DD 0 second stun and empty my quiver. Errrr ummmmm 8 procs??!!! 180 arrows and I got 8 procs??!!!!<br />
<br />
Now I was concidering getting a Strike of YKesha aug for the bow giving me 3 different procs with a stun component. But, even it this doubled the proc rate it would still be less than 1 proc every 10 arrows (probably if I was lucky every 20 arrows).<br />
<br />
Have bow proc rates always been this bad? Has anyone looked at bow proc rates?<br />
<br />
I'd put a Strike of YKesha aug on the bow and report back my results, but given what I've seen I'm a little reluctant.<br />
<br />
What do ya think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bow proc rates have always sucked. How many arrows do you plan on pulling with anyway?? Putting a proc on a bow is about as useful as putting a proc on an earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I found this out about 2 years ago when I got my bow of the Huntsman...180 dd or some shit.  Seemed awesome for my twink 30 warrior....wasn't so awesome after I spent about an hour bow kiting shit around.</div></div><hr />

Imbue procs like the buff from the Symbol of The Planesmaster don't work on archery.  And sad as is it, 1 proc from the innate bow effect every 22 arrows is pretty good... for a bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I enjoy having my bow of rallos zek proc occasionally, it helps me get a start up on a few mobs. But I doubt I would ever buy another proc for it, unless I had excess points (which I doubt I ever will have). Just too infrequent to go out of your way to get another proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarn_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a lvl 65 Ranger Main, with Stonewood &amp; Featherwood.<br />
<br />
Bow procs are the absolute worst....  When playing my Ranger, I use my bow almost 100% of the time unless there are LoS issues.<br />
<br />
I've gone upwards of 5 mobs in a row without seeing a bow proc.<br />
<br />
The bow I've seen that seemed to proc the most had the useless effect on it for me, and that was the Nightmare Bow.<br />
<br />
So, yes, Bow procs are the suck, and should not rely on them.<br />
<br />
Then again, if you are a Ranger Root &amp; shooting, your DD proc on your bow will ALWAYS proc and break root right when you don't want it too...<br />
<br />
*mutters.*<br />

I'm glad I made a warrior instead. /kick the Ranger.</div></div><hr />
