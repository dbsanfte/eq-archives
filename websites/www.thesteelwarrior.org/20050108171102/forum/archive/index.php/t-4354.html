<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogmol</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ran into a problem last night on an adventure in MM, had a cleric talking about how he was &quot;46-1&quot; on adventures, and that we had to do things his way, blah blah blah. Anyway, most of us are &quot;ok, no need to be anal, we will do it your way.&quot; Here is where the problem comes in, he plays ultraconservative, pacs EVERY SINGLE MOB, which slows us down, then,  when the guildie ranger of his, who had to be pulling, goes down, he insists we sit and do nothing till he gets ranger rezzed and he himself is full mana... <br />
<br />
Needless to say, we fail the mission, with 4 collection items left to obtain, and then he doesn't even want to bother hanging around to try and get SOME points from completing it after time ran out. Here is my problem, pac pulling is needed, no doubt, especially the way some rooms are arranged mob wise, but it was rediculous to pac every single room, and do single pulls on top of having to be sure the cleric had FM all the time. <br />
<br />
One thing is for sure, that's one cleric I plan to avoid in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT, and I stress this, BUT she does this pacifying while we are fighting.  Thus, there is no down time due to pacification, unless we rapidly switch directions due to finding out we are going the wrong way.  As it is, we pull faster than any FD puller could do, and really the only way to go faster would be to charge rooms with an enchanter.  (and we do 80 / 90 percent of LDON with no enchanter).  It certainly is faster than bard pulling.  (cleric DPS is less than Bard dps, so if cleric is the missing member pulling, thats better than missing the bard).<br />
<br />
However, if a cleric was replacing her and wanted to do pacifying such that it slowed down the group, I would be .. uncomfortable with that as well.  I think it all is a matter of what slows down the group or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Side rant:<br />
i hate it when pullers think they have to wait until the mob dies to go get another mob.   Mobs dieing yo~  get another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sonan</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually give the &quot;do it my way&quot; pac'ers about 10 kills to see if they are too slow. If they are not generating about a kill per minute then they are too slow. The pac'er needs to get the room done for the puller before the previous kill is done. Bards, in my little experience have been the best as they can mez their resists and even the pull until we are done. A good bard can give you zero downtime. A few nights ago I think I wasn't swinging my swords for about 10 seconds total with our bard puller. Finished a 60 mass kill with 53 mins to go.</div></div><hr />

Probably would have gone a lot smoother with a monk/cleric-pac combo.<br />

If we have a mezzer, there is no need for delecate pulling but on boss mobs in assassinate. <br />

<br />
I have run into over passification and hate it myself. But unless the cleric is a complete tard, jsut pull anyway.</div></div><hr />

Clerics don't do impressive damage, so that mana is better spent on making sure 1-2 mobs are *always* in camp, especially on Maelin where having a mezzer (or even a slower) in group is pretty much a luxury.<br />
<br />
One problem with pac is that mob reaction ranges are pretty much the same in 4 themes - ~8.<br />
In Guk, mob reaction range is about 25. That, plus the fact that mobs in Guk hide, means overlulling has to be done. Bugged spawn points where more than one mob can be in the same spot (sometimes tough to see) happen mostly in Guk and Tak. So a cleric that overlulls, is probably used to Guk. <br />
<br />
and 5 is about the bigest pull I can see anyone getting <br />
<br />
I've had some reaction-range clusterfucks (getting too close to an unlulled mob while trying to lull a mob behind it) that aggro'd the whole room of 7-9 (&lt;3 Takish)<br />
<br />
Some of the boss rooms on MMC assassinates are pretty insane as well:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what frodlin said^^<br />
<br />
although i've yet to go in a pickup LDoN group; i pretty much only go with guildies...after the few PoP pickup groups I kinda lay low most of the time now.<br />
<br />
i'm a n00b and all but i'm a n00b with a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a cleric who pacify pulls in LDoN.<br />
<br />
When do I pull?  I pull when (a) the group makeup is such that pulling is more efficient than charging, and (b) I'm the character with the least damage output in the group and therefore I'm the one who can be best spared to do the job.<br />
<br />
How do I pull?  In such a way as to ensure that the group is fighting at least one monster 100% of the time wherever possible, and using Mark of the Righteous, which generates near-zero aggro.<br />
<br />
It's fairly safe to assume that if you were worried about pulling, you're in a group with no mezzer, so what I have to say below is based on the assumption that the group is dealing with adds by rooting them or by just slow and ignore.<br />
<br />
How do I feel about pickup group warriors pulling?  Frankly, unless I know the warrior, I don't like it at all, and I sympathize with the cleric who wanted to pacify.  I've seen enough warriors fire an arrow and go, &quot;Umm, lots&quot; just before their health drops like a stone and eight monsters come charging round the corner that I'm leery of pulling warriors.<br />
<br />
The problem is that sucky warriors frequently insist on pulling in LDoN.  As a class, warriors like to take charge, and I think they're working on the theory that if they get initial aggro, the chances of them hanging onto that aggro are thereby increased.<br />
<br />
Now, pulling is largely about the abilities, experience, and knowledge of the guy behind the keyboard - and unfortunately, while many pickup group warriors are able pullers, others just tend to stick an arrow in the nearest thing without the faintest idea of how many monsters will come when they do it.<br />
<br />
As a cleric faced with a pickup group warrior you don't know, it's unwise to assume that your warrior is a competent puller.  After all, warrior is a class which lacks any of the key special abilities for pulling.<br />
<br />
In fact, I can't think of a class which is less well qualified, by nature of its innate abilities, to pull than a warrior.  Maybe mage, although mages can use pet pulling in creative ways; but pretty much every other class has some ability which would be helpful, even if it's only sneak or root.<br />
<br />
So those warriors who are skilled at pulling - and they certainly exist - have become skilled despite the limitations of their class.<br />
<br />
As for that &quot;assist me and pacify my target&quot; thing - henceforth to be known as &quot;assify&quot; - that's just pathetic.  Melees who do this are generally unaware of key information, like how long before the paci wears off, which monsters are paci-immune, or how much paci mana their cleric can afford to blow.  If you need a room pacified, kindly get the hell out of the way and let me pull it, please and thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">which mobs in ldon are paci immune?  (or are you talking level limits?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Melees like me who do it are generally aware of EXACTLY what the fuck we're doing. As you yourself said, it's about knowledge, abilities, and experience. I can't count the number of times a pacifier has paci'd a mob they had no reason to - it wastes time and it wastes mana. If that's what you're into, go Imbue some gems or some such bullshit. Further, if you're so hot to pull, YOU tank. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I do most of the pulling in LDoN, the few times I pull more than I intended an early rampage and AET after the first heal lands is enough to allow the rest of the group to get everything under control (with mezzing, offtanking or parking) 99% of the times.</div></div><hr />

hard adventure? Use it *very* sparingly.</div></div><hr />

If 6 mobs flood the room, sure I can tank them all, but I certainly cant hold agro on all of them, and oh, sorry, dont care to get a shaman to slow them, so the int casters or healers might die.<br />
<br />
Mind telling us how you keep agro on 5 or 6 mobs if you are a warrior?   Because it might be just the answer we have all been waiting for.  I mean, god, if it was as easy as being as cocky and arogant as you, hell, our agro problems are solved!</div></div><hr />

<br />
my abrasive and generally annoying personality keeps everyone in the whole room agroed on me, PC's included.<br />
<br />
no, the real point is this - any group worth grouping with has no difficulty whatsoever dealing with 5 mobs.  root park 2, I tank 2, some other melee tanks one.  Or, Cazoc forbid, maybe your enchanter/bard actually mezzes??<br />
<br />
PS - omg.  you called me a knight? /blindrage on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Further, if you're so hot to pull, YOU tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's that kind of BULLSHIT that got my class NERFED in the first place!<br />
<br />
/snicker<br />
<br />
Seriously though ... pulling and tanking are two different things. Just ask any monk past level 17.<br />
<br />
I'll gladly team up with a pacify casting class for those rooms in LDoN adventures that I KNOW are gonna draw 6 or 7 mobs due to bad geometry (heloooooooo TAK!).<br />
<br />
The rest of the time, it's pretty easy to keep pulls down to 2 and 3 at a time. And due to time limits, the better moving LDoN groups are designed to handle 2 to 3 at a time (usually with root parking or the slow and ignore tactic mentioned above).<br />
<br />
This shit's all about DPS. So it's best to keep the mobs in the camp at all times. Which is why warriors pull fine in LDoN easy adventures.<br />
<br />
But even then, a monk can do it, do it safer.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
And pacify helps from time to time.<br />
<br />
And I DON'T WANT TO FREAKIN TANK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you missed the part where i said that I dont do LDON with enchanters / bards usually.  And you think its more effiecient or timely to root park 2 mobs than to have the cleric spend 300 mana so that the mob doesnt add in the first place, when they cast that pacify while you are busy killing?  Sure, you COULD have people wasting time root parking, but why should they be wasting time doing that when they could be doing damage.  IMO, you are wasting dps with crowd control issues that a cleric can gladly solve if they show some initiative and activity.<br />
<br />
Sheesh, some of you in the elemental planes need to get your head out of the clouds (or something else) and realize that not everyone has hps / mana / ft on a par with you.  Or if you dont do pickup groups, then realize that a pickup group has highly different safety issues than a group of six people, who have the right mix groupwise.<br />
<br />
You do things your way, Ill do things my way, but calling people names for thier successful strategies is rather asinine.<br />
(and yes, we do kill 60 missions in 50 min, so the pace isnt slower  than would be expected for a group of non elemental pickups)</div></div><hr />

You had 2 melee, one of which was a plate tank...and the cleric still felt the need to pacify at all? 3 mobs on a warrior and 2 mobs on a ranger is not completely unmanageable, especially if you have at least 1 root casting class along, and 5 is about the bigest pull I can see anyone getting.  <br />
<br />
I forgot to mention, the other classes were an enc and druid, the enc was told to stick to C'ing and hasting, and the druid was to patch heal. No nuking from either, and no dot's from the druid.<br />
<br />
Didn't really pay attention to all the cleric was saying at the beginning, now i realize why our dps was so crappy.<br />
<br />
Edit: just thinking back, the reason I didn't argue at the time, I wanted to see if this guy had a clue, and I don't have a perfect record, and was satisfied to get the exp I needed, though the AP would have been nice. The best thing I got out of my experience was, this strategy doesn't work, period. From now on, I will be a little more assertive about how things get pulled and when things get pacified. I have spent enough time in groups without pac spells to have a good feel for when and where a pac is needed or best choice in an iffy pull situation. I have to admit I did get a certain bit of pleasure from watching the control freak FUBAR the adventure. sick freak that I am. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that if you have to fight 4 or 5 mobs consistently with no slow and no CC, it gets annoying even on normal.  Sooner or later one of the weaker member of your party will get slapped and die and it's especially annoying if that person is the cleric.  I don't know how many times I have seen a caster get slapped by an enchanter hasted mob that they're trying to show off their tanking skills (their DPS is like 75% of a hard mob unslowed, which is considerable) since everything is supposed to be easy so they don't slow and they don't know what mobs are the enchanter types.  Heck I have been slapped pretty badly by normal bosses that are enchanter hasted (quad 900 X 70% haste = equivalent of quad 1500) because people thought it was supposed to be easy even though I told them this named is hasted so if they can't slow it right away at least get the 70% haste off.<br />
<br />
Aside from Takish, there's really no reason to pull more than 3 mobs at once even if you just blindly run into the room.  If that's still too much handle then by all menas use Pacify.  I find it annoying for people to pacify 25 mobs and then try to sneak past them because someone will invariably trip over all 25 and that leads to a huge mess though.</div></div><hr />
