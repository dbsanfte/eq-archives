<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild has tried RZ 2 times bow and have gotten him to 65% so far we are forming ideas on how to take him down.<br />
<br />
Our biggest prob is the adds in the pits, Keep im mind we are tring to do him with about 50 to 60 peps most are 65 or so any one have some advise or strats on how to take this guy out ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember my wife walking the Rallos script for what seemed like every night for 2 weeks.  Keep trying, it'll feel better if you figure it out yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(great strat stolen from the safehouse)<br />
<br />
Try the encounter first, figure out what you did wrong, then take steps to do it better next time. Repeat until mob is dead. <br />
<br />
It's worked for every encounter i've ever been a part of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see 2 probs with your strat ...<br />
<br />
Our guild has tried RZ 2 times <br />
Only 2 times? Wait until you have tried 2 times a night for a week, then get frustrated.<br />
<br />
most are 65<br />
Most? Tell anyone who is not 65 to get off their lazy asses and level up. If your guild is seriously trying RZ, then you obviously have some focus on raiding. If your guild raids a lot, then everyone needs to make an effort to get 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its a little harder now, you use to be able to kill corpses on the ground to limit the number of wrath spawns, but that no longer works now. i cant see anyone doing this encounter without it getting really messy at the end.<br />
<br />
need massive dps and ton of cc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, we raid almost 7 days a week, as for the most peps being lower than 65 they are working very hard at it. For Most of us all we need is MM and RZ then we hit the SOLRO tower.. &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The recent change with the corpses make things lots messier now than before. We had an awesome corpse team, we'd usually only get one or two wraiths and had very few adds at the end of the fight. We dropped Rz again the other night and nearly wiped to the adds at the end, something we hadnt done since the beginnings of our Rz days.<br />
<br />
Was that an intended change? Its really taken some of the strategy and teamwork out of the encounter and reduced it to another mindless mass dps/kill as fast as you can before adds overwhelm encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you've tried the script 2 times, and already have him in the pit and to 65% I think you're doing just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are you from MidWinter, Slammer?<br />
<br />
It's the third time they got to RZTW, and brought him to 65% as well.<br />
Although they've been going at the script itself for quite sometime now.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing hard about RZTW is his adds though :p.<br />
Once you got those figured out, you beat the guy.<br />
<br />
Pity how the God of War himself is really just a big gimp :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Effectively dealing with the adds is the key to the whole event.  However, even if one guild told you how they did RZtW, it is unlikely it would work for your guild unless you had nearly the same number of key classes.  If you are light or heavy with certain classes you'll need to adjust how you approach the event accordingly.<br />
<br />
Lost track of how many attempts it took us overall since learning just how to spawn him was an ordeal because a few parts are highly susceptible to one idiot causing a wipe due to inattentiveness.  :mad:   I believe we got it on the fifth actual spawning of RZtW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Make sure you have alot chanters (4+) and start with charmed pets (ogres) from the get go. Its really a burn down fight.<br />
Get a strat down for a kiting team too (they need to get bard speed outside if needed, since sk and pal indoor horse got fixed / nerfed)<br />
<br />
AE casted heals will help too, EE / Woods / Paragon etc.<br />
Let the melee / pets do the first 15ish pct of RZ, so your casters can burn thru the rest, if they have mana/aggro problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">YEAH, we got him on the 5th try, We had 1 chanter at that...But we had alot of druids use charm and we AOW styled RZW in the SW corner of the pit.. Took him out and WOW the adds were everywhere..<br />
PS...NO im not from Midwinter...LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grats :p,<br />
and what mean ass comments? :p.. is there another midwinter out there, that has a bad reputation? lol<br />
<br />
And didn't know druids could charm boars o_o... we usually just used them all for snare duties :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry was a true Monday morning for me.. :)..i did edit it though after i read it i was like /DOH!!</div></div><hr />
