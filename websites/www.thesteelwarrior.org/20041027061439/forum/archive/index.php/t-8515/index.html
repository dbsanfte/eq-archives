<br />
Nonsense:<br />
<br />
Backstab works on just about every mob.   Feign Death works on every mob.   Harmtouch, Lay Hands, Heals, etc work on about every mob.  As a matter of fact, there is no basic skill that DOESN'T work with semi predictability on every mob with one exception:  Taunt.<br />
<br />
Certainly there's mobs where Backstab doesn't work on due to mechanics, like Fennin, Devastating Construct, etc, but for the most part, it works great.<br />
<br />
Stuns have a valid reason to not work, and while a good case CAN be made for taunt not to be as successful on red con mobs, the fact is, it's too extreme.   The good news is that SoE is currently evaluating the request for a better scale rate on taunt, particularly on yellow/red con mobs.</div></div><hr />

Thats exactly why taunt shouldnt be so random. They should add some code to make taunt success probability raise with each failed taunt, say first taunt failed with a 10% success rate, the following taunt should be raised to a 25% success rate, then 50% and so on. Failures are all fine and dandy but there should never be streaks that long, if you went with a 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% scaled rate the most failed taunts possible would be 4 which is more in line with how the skill should work imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Taunt is a significant tool of the Warrior class.  Having that tool routinely fail in long strings isn't acceptable.  It's one thing to have a particular boss mob be immune or very close to immune to taunt.  It's another thing altogether to have the tool routinely fail repeatedly against all sorts of mobs, trash, mini-bosses, bosses not intended to be immune, and so forth.  The tool is and always has been horribly unreliable.  No other tool of any other class is relied on as much and fails as frequently.  And I find it particularly ironic that some of the very people who rely on the tool are the first to jump up and attempt to explain it's broken nature away as being perfectly fine and acceptable.</div></div><hr />

Oh don't even go there.  I have seen a thread that proved that the fail/succeed of a taunt is NON RANDOM.  It did not pass &quot;random&quot; tests.  You are right.

Wrong... this makes sense until you remeber that having aggro doesn't mean you necessarily have the most hate (distance factors in). Doesnt really matter so much in exp groups where everyone is right on top of each other, but on raids you should be a taunt masher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh boy, here we go again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I really question if you know anything about probabilities if you think taunt is anything but random.  It works fine and if you think it's broken you don't understand what random means.  And if you think it shouldn't be random, I'd like to know why you think another model will be better than the random model that's used to basically handle any game where there's a % thing involved.<br />
<br />
The % taunt works looks okay when you consider that taunt stacks, and applying the same principles of probabilities you get the conclusion that it is very unlikely for a group of individuals to fail taunt at the same time.  This is exactly what happens on a raid, provided everyone's paying attention.  No one person's taunt has a very high chance of success but when you put enough people's taunt together, it's very unlikely for everyone to fail at the same time.<br />
<br />
And if you're dealing with one group situations, it's better to exercise caution as opposed to complaining taunt doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Better taunt system?<br />
<br />
Make it so that if you fail 3 times in a row, you get a 30% bonus to taunt success rates, DnD (which EQ used to use as a model) had something like this, ever hear a joke about &quot;insert smart ass item name&quot; +1? (tho most times those bonuses are there at all times, not as a result of a failure unless it is a high magic point item)<br />
<br />
Just an example, I don't know the average failure rate for these groupings<br />
<br />
lets say taunt is 0 to 1000, 500+ is a taunt on a green and light blue monster, anything lower is a fail, 600+ is a good taunt for blue, 700+ is yellow and 800+ is a good taunt for red.<br />
<br />
Lets say you fail 3 times, 30% of 1000 would be 300.<br />
<br />
So on the 4th taunt you roll a 400 on a yellow, add the 30% bonus you get 700, a bad taunt becomes a good taunt.<br />
<br />
Also how about some trade-off effects? potion of onion breath +5% to taunt, -20 Cha (used for DI, the trade off is DI may not fire)<br />
<br />
Special endurance ability, &quot;I fart in you general direction&quot; 200 hate and a 30 second 10% taunt mod, the downside is you have a 20% chance to turn your greaves into the soiled breech cloth item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Why would anyone think taunt in its current form is how it should be? For me (and likely anyone that thinks taunt is fiine) it doesnt really matter because by the time I've had a few failed taunts I've had enough procs for it not to matter, that doesnt change the fact taunt sucks. <br />
<br />
Theres no other game in existence that uses a taunt system like EQ does, why not? Because its stupid and it shouldnt be that way probably. If it was a save check versus stamina or something, great, anything would be better than the totally random bullshit it is today. Seven failed taunts on a level 1 rat is just ridiculous, 23 failed taunts on anything at all is almost as ridiculous. It doesnt matter if you have agro or its a high level mob or whatever other lame excuse anyone can come up with, one of our core skills should never, ever fail 23 times in a row. <br />
<br />
EQ uses the rng way to damn much anyway, they need to use real rolls vs stat/skill for all resists, abilities and tradeskills. That likely wont ever happen ofcourse, but they could atleast change taunt. to either a scaled probability or a taunt skill vs stamina check, ie a roll 1-230 vs 15 stamina of a level 1 rat. Then add 20 points every 10 levels of the mob so a level 10 mob would be 21-251 vs 55 stam, level 65 mob 131-361 vs 250 stam etc..<br />
<br />
And it wouldnt be so bad if they actually showed the roll results in a filterable fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It's not a matter of the RNG, but the pass/fail nature that hoses taunt when compared to other class skills.    0%/100% is far worse than the success rate, because there are no partial successes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Errr a dice isn't any different than the system popping out the number 0.123165 and says it was a failure.  They're the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
If you want to roll a d20 or whatever against your taunt skill, it'd still work out that you're going to succeed the same % of the time as you did before.  Just because you're rolling a dice doesn't change the probabilites any, other than the fact that a dice is inferior to a RNG because it doesn't have as much precision.  <br />
<br />
Likewise if there's some kind of bonus for failing taunt there would be some kind of penalty for succeeding taunt too much.<br />
<br />
Aggro is a warrior's core skill.  Taunt is a tool to achieve that.  That's like saying if a mob has some anti-CH abilities (and there's plenty of those) then the cleric would 'fail' to be able to heal because CH doesn't work.  Just like CH is the most powerful tool a cleric has to heal, taunt is the warrior's most powerful tool for aggro.  <br />
<br />
Frankly Warrior's taunt doesn't fail very often because there's AE Taunt for ubers which taunt pretty much never works on (at least not anything resembly reliable).  Versus trash yellow+ con mobs you can just stack taunt.  If everyone has a 25% chance to taunt a mob, then with 10 people taunting there's a 5.6% chance that no one's taunt will work before considering anything else.  10 is not an unreasonable number of tanks when you add SK and Paladins (they can taunt too).  As for any 1 group related thing, I believe in making adjustment in the groups more than complaining our skills don't work.  Last time I checked Knights are still complaining they can't tank in one group situations so at least enough people besides us perceive the situation to be difficult, and thus it's not just a warrior problem.  It's fine things are hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Unless the other people are doing something really weird, a Warrior should never be very far behind people who needs the mob to be taunted off them (clerics, casters, etc).  If you view a 50% successful taunt as giving you half of the aggro needed to go to the top, it'd not really make much of a difference in most situations when you're probably behind by less than 1000 hate.<br />
<br />
And besides if you make it not 0/100%, who's to say some of the 100% taunts you've gotten before wouldn't get hosed to be 90% successful taunt instead and then get your group killed because it's not quite enough?<br />
<br />
I don't see anything wrong with the system itself.  It seems like most people who think there's a problem with taunt really just wants it to work more often because I don't see any compelling reason to believe why another system is needed, or why it'd be any better than the current one if you leave the current success rate % in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">AoE taunt is not always an option, the recent pathing problems bring this to full light.<br />
<br />
Phant, the differance between the dice and this system is in a dice system you can get feats or ability score modifiers, meaning a 0 roll is a 5, a 10 is a 15, etc.<br />
<br />
The reason an ability modifier would be nice is that it would increase the success rate, and I do agree with frod, healers can fizzle, they can have it land, they can score a critical spell and *gasp* they can have ability modifiers thru focus effect gear!<br />
<br />
would be nice to see some of that come our way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Nah it'd work exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Some guy up there decides taunt should work 25% or 40% or some # of the time against a certain level of mob.  This isn't going to change unless you can convince the guy up there.<br />
<br />
So let's say it's decided taunt works 25% of the taunt on yellow mobs.  In a RNG you probably roll a number between 0 and 1 and if it's greater than 0.75, you taunted succesfully.<br />
<br />
Now you can have one based on feat D20 or whatever, but in the game, it still works 25% of the time because that's the number decided by the designers.  Changing the system doesn't change the underlying success rate.</div></div><hr />

A rogue with blooded gains +2 to his rolls, or since this is out of 10 possible numbers, a 20% bonus, this means that he has a 70% chance to avoid the dragon breath, but this bonus is applyed AFTER the roll, meaning he can roll a 3, add his bonus of 2 and he has a total of 5, the rogue lives to see another day, another way this can be done if you want to increase the difficulty of the game you can make it so that bonus is applyed to the low end, making the roll 3 to 10 instead of 1 to 10, this means the player looses 1 and 2 as possiblitys but what makes it harder is since it is not added at the end he can not have a critcal success.<br />
<br />
Eq is not a 1-0, it is a 0 100 so the taunt skill can have an effect on success and differentciat(sp?) paladins and sks from warriors.<br />
<br />
bah let me boil it down, do not bullshit me on DnD rules or MMORPG games in general.<br />
<br />
(it is not called feat d20 btw, feat is a nice word for abilitys, modifers and misc abilitys that one has to pick from every few level ups, it keeps characters unique)<br />
<br />
The system is bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">argh what have I started?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">And every mob will have some checks against this system that you describe of to ensure the same % success as it does before.  You get your +2 to taunt and the mob gets its 'needed 2 more than usual to taunt' modifier to make sure you still only succeed exactly as much as you did before.<br />
<br />
No matter what system it's based on, the concept of 'taunt' has to work the same % as it did in any other system.  What you're basically saying is that it'd be nice if taunt worked say 35% instead of 25%, and it has nothing to do with the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Why would it? I do not recall any monsters that have a anti flowing thought, anti backstab mod, anti extended infliction, anti burning effliction.<br />
<br />
The fact is it wouldn't because the game does not scale as it is now, a monster does not hit harder when you have more hp, just like it would not have taunt resistance because that would fuck over knights in general, and adding a bonus that scales up as fails in a row went up would drastically change the system, for example if you get a 15% bonus per failed taunt until the next success that would mean you could only fail about 9-10 times because that would be a BONUS applyed after the random number is generated, something that is not done in EQ very often EXCEPT for casters with focus items.<br />
<br />
Lets change this around, you say why change it so I say why shouldn't we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">If mobs now have anti Flowing Thought -10 then you'd be able to get FT25 to compensate it, and itemization would be far more generous than it currently is (FT is hard to come by in GoD).<br />
<br />
Someone at one point decided it was a good idea for taunt to work X% of the time on Y mobs.  The current system is one way to implement this sytem.  But even if it's another one, the same person making the decision still will want taunt to work the same as it did before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">The point Phantron is trying to make is that your idea, Gerrick, would improve the overall succesrate of taunt instead of just delivering a &quot;fairer&quot; distribution of successes and failures. You can adjust the current system just as easily to give it a greater succesrate, no need to change the system for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The difference in a d20 roll or whatever # they use would be each mob would need a stat or skill to save against the taunt, so a level 1 rat taunt would very rarely if ever fail considering his save check would be very low compared to the skill check of the warrior. <br />
<br />
Granted we dont need or want taunt on a level 1 rat in WFP but were talking about extremities that shouldnt happen here, and success rate of taunt should be more relative to the mobs level / type not seemingly totally random like it is today.<br />
<br />
I dont have any issues with taunt for a mob I'm on, but only because of procs, taunt still sucks. Theres no reason I shouldnt be able to taunt a mob off a chanter that had a failed mez without me touching the mob and breaking mez when it actually lands. Paladin, SK's and Rangers have no problems doing this with 100% success thanks to spells, why cant we get a succesful taunt with some higher success? We would still lose agro if the enchanter did anything else over 1pt of agro unlike the other classes chain stunning / snaring.<br />
<br />
Even FFXI's system of provoke is far and away better than EQ's, a fading hate value for taunt would work very well in EQ with how they use procs also. Point is anything is better than the way it is now, and Phant is right 'some guy up there decided' and that guy was wrong and theres no reason not to change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I hafta disagree with Frodlin here.  FD can fail on every mob, backstab can be mitigated, nobody heals mobs, and nukes can be resisted/partially resisted.<br />
<br />
The only difference here is that failing FD is based on if a mob is a caster, backstab mitigation is flagged via the mob's AC/damage mitigation specifically, and nukes are based on the mob's resist...but warrior taunt is based solely on the level.  You can stun a caster, you can lower the AC or resists of a mob, but you cannot lower the effective fighting level of a warrior.<br />
<br />
I started to say that I'd be in favor of a &quot;partial&quot; taunt -- IE, if you fail, you also have a shot to at least get some hate instead...but the only way I can see this not being abused is if it checks to make sure you aren't already getting aggro.....and even then, I can see it being abused/complained about.<br />
<br />
Taunt HAS to have some sort of randomness.  Putting in a limit as to how many times you can fail makes no sense -- it means a level 1 can run up to a Nagafen raid and take aggro after failing taunt so many times -- and that isn't what has been intended.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see actual screenshots of a level 65 failing 7 taunts in a row on a level 1 mob in freeport...because I find that hard to believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Yea taunt shouldnt be changed cause that level 1 running through solb to nagafens lair and taunting nagafen once before he dies is the main concern here, even though the level difference would make it impossible.<br />
<br />
If taunt had a scaled increase in probability each failure it would still be very random, just not as random. Someone could theoritically try to get 3 failed taunts on purpose so their next taunt would have a very high success rate then though, oh noz forget that idea too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I am not in favor of partial successes in taunt. Not sure how that could effectively be implimented anyway.<br />
<br />
Progressively increasing the percent of taunt over time is another issue altogether which I never really considered much.<br />
<br />
Increasing the existing system's success rate on mobs that con harder than blue has merit, and sufficient for my tastes. I didn't read into Frod's post to do anything beyond this really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'd say make it so the value of failed taunts in a row is unique to one monster, meaning you can not go taunt an unkillable NPC to build it up and then hit taunt on the monster you really want.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest that the skill is checked agenst the monster, raid mobs could be flagged to ignore the taunt bonus past a certain point, perhaps a max of 20% increase on red raid monsters, 25% on yellow raid monsters.<br />
<br />
Also, if they did partial I could see this fitting in to a game setting, if someone insults you and it is a crappy insult it does get on your nerves after a few times.<br />
<br />
I would make it so you can not get additional aggro once you are the monsters target, this way there is no taunt lock.<br />
<br />
Has anyone noticed that taunt seems to fail more often on messed monsters? just something I've seen, I have also noticed AoE taunt not working in underwater zones like SG or KK, is it like this in the plane of water? just wondering as I get the distracted message when underwater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Problem is that there's no such thing as a free lunch.  I don't think you'll ever see SoE decide overnight that Warrior's taunt needs to work from whatever it was before (say 25%) to 35% or whatever number you believe in.  If you want partial success taunts, does that mean some of your successful taunts now become partials and get your group killed?  If you want a +taunt bonus for consecutive fails, does that mean you get a negative taunt modifier if you got lucky with taunt for a while?  Someone up there decides taunt needs to work soandso percent of the time and a system is just a way of getting that guy's idea to work.  Changing the system doesn't change the outcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres no reason we would have to trade something off for a taunt improvement when its still broken in the first place, and getting something fixed isnt getting a free ride, having 2 hate proccing weapons with an anger 3 aug in each one is much more akin to a free ride than a long overdue overhaul of the taunt system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sure taunt isnt the perfect skill but in a group environment i think they give us the necissary tools to overcome it. the reason you have aggro problems is because YOU havent dont the ldons needed for anger 3 augs and YOU havent done the AAs needed for weapons affinity. if you get the things available to you then youlle depend so much less on the taunt button.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">The &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;feat&quot; based system will only help hide the true problem, regardless of these changes you are still going to have a chance to have a ridiculous number of failures in a row.  It will be a smaller chance, but it will still happen.<br />
<br />
The way to correct the problems is to give every 3 or 4 failed taunts a % higher chance to succeed until you succeed the next time, and make that % substantial so that we aren't waiting until the 16th failure to have a substantial chance to succeed.  Then it will reset.<br />
<br />
With current content and how hard mobs are hitting, failing taunt 4 times in a row to get a bonus will not be game breaking.<br />
<br />
The other thing that could be added is an AA or something that allows us to have a hate mod on a failed taunt.  Your taunt wasn't good enough to completely enrage the mob, but you talked enough about their momma to make them at least raise an eyebrow at you.</div></div><hr />

As to the level 1 running up to nagafen...that was a dramatization.  Making taunt scale like that will give a level 10 virtually taunt the same as a level 15...or how about the level 40 paladin with the same taunt skill as a level 45 vs reds, or a level 55 twink tag-a-long who can taunt just as well as you can in GoD.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Yea, go collect all the bandaids so you can play your class, wtf were you thinking Gerick<br />
<br />
why does the taunt button have to be the ultimate skill for us? why is taunt such a better and more required thing to have than added anger procs to weapons? i really cant see any reason why taunt in its current form is such a horrible thing when its balanced out by other abilities. <br />
<br />
i see it as WA and augs are tools of aggro loss prevention, whereas taunt is aggro loss solution. for taunt to be effective, aside from the proximity aspect of it, you have to lose aggro first and then hope you get a successful taunt back before the aggro theif dies. more procs come in to help when youre building aggro and are more effective in making it harder for someone to take it. so when do you want aggro, before your caster nukes, or after?<br />
<br />
i also NEVER remember taunt being more effective than it is now, i havent played for as long as some of you, but can anyone enlighten me to if it ever had a better success rate? if the answer is no, then why is a skill we have never been good at our class defining role according to paen? i would think the thing that defines our class is what makes us good, and in the case of holding aggro i think that is procs because of augs and AA.<br />

Absor: *Bumpper-Test* Will Taunt be increased for warriors?...Its a simple question that I know a lot of warriors want to know <br />
<br />
John Troy: Yes, we're giving warriors skills to better gain and keep hate.<br />
<br />
John Troy: We're not changing the way Taunt itself works. We're adding a new skill that doesn't require an opening, as well as others that do, to address the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yes taunt is broken were adding incite as yet another bandaid to fix the issue though, is what he said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Absor: *Adorae* just fix taunt? LOL <br />
<br />
John Troy: Saying that taunt is the one and only issue is fairly shortsighted, I think. Pure melee have very few strategic decisions to make, don't get new abilities with an expansion the way casters do, and don't get as much from an item with both hp and mana. These are all issues that people have raised, and this system gives us a way to address them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes we know taunt is broken, but its not the only thing broken is what this guy said.<br />
<br />
from 1 of the fan faires<br />
<br />
Right now Taunt seems to take a second place to Enraging Blow items – is this intended? <br />
<br />
Taunt has been reviewed and should work much better now, on any NPC level, and have a sane progression up to the characters’ 65th level. We are aware that the Enraging Blow items are subjugating the Taunt Skill and we will be looking into this. We don’t particularly like when abilities are obsoleted by items. Enraging Blow items were a temporary fix for a systems problem that has unfortunately stuck around too long. <br />
<br />
We’d much rather have character skills make more sense. Please check out Taunt again as you progress – It now has a much better chance of working for PoP-level players vs PoP-level NPCs. <br />
<br />
Why is the Taunt Skill capped at 230 then? <br />
<br />
The mechanics are already based around the fact that 230 is the max, so it doesn’t really matter that it doesn’t go all the way to 250. <br />
<br />
<br />
And theyre still a crutch to a broken skill, and I guess theyre still &quot;looking in to it&quot;<br />
<br />
I can probably find more if you want.<br />
<br />
And I couldnt care less if a level 55 or 60's taunt skill worked as well as mine, the level differential would still be there so it wouldnt though. If a level 50 taunting over a level 55 is actually a reason they wouldnt change taunt I would be sorely disappointed. Not to mention the level 65 vs 55 argument the level 65 would have bettter agro generation ac and hp's so it would be stupid for the level 55 to taunt in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
additionally, why is taunt such a better solution than weapons? so what if a warrior in a txevu guild is generating more aggro on his raid mobs than the warrior tanking for an xp group in BoT? the people that the raid warrior are playing with generate higher amounts of dps and aggro than the BoT group people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Way to oversimplify things tremendously.<br />
<br />
Wizards main job is DPS.  Not casting a nuke.  Sustaining DPS.  To do this, they need a decent sized mana pool and FT through gear, and up-to-date spells from drops/vendors.<br />
<br />
Clerics main job is healing.  Not casting one CH.  Sustained CH.  Repeat what I said about wizards.<br />
<br />
Warriors main job is to take hits.  Not aggro.  Taking hits.  To do this, they need to sustain aggro through gear acquisition and skill acquisition as well as leveling up, and they need a competent group to allow them to hold aggro, and they need gear to be able to survive the hits.<br />
<br />
Paen:<br />
<br />
The first quote showed the developer saying that aggro would be increased because they didnt feel aggro was working as intended, not simply taunt.  The word &quot;taunt&quot; was used, but anybody who played EQ in the past few years know that &quot;taunt&quot; and &quot;aggro&quot; are largely interchangable.  I remember reading somewhere of a shaman complaining about the taunt of crit dots.<br />
<br />
The second quote was really the same as the first quote.  The question was &quot;why not just 'fix' taunt?&quot;, and the response is that it wasnt a simple fix.  Taunt as a skill is not inherantly broken; warrior aggro generation was (as per the prior quote, where Mr. Troy answered the question using the term &quot;hate&quot; and not &quot;taunt&quot;)<br />
<br />
The third quote was when they DID fix taunt...it dates back to pre-LDoN I believe, and talked about when they improved taunt...it used to fail a lot more than it does now, and people were satisfied with things for a while.</div></div><hr />

taunt in its current form has a 25% chance at grabbing it, also incite is nice as if it needs to be locked down quickly then its probably fresh into camp and not much other aggro is on its list.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I want to get aggro before a mes break, I can not use a weapon proc.<br />

<br />
we have other skills too. taunt rate isnt as astronomical as you make it sound either. the 23 failed taunts in a row is over exaggerated to a degree because it was on a badass plane of fire mini. how often do you see people come up with these numbers on trash mobs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">with 'skill' or 'feat' you'd still fail exactly as much as you did before because the game is designed this way.  A lot of people seem to have this belief that if we somehow have another system our chance of succeeding taunt goes up.  Our chance of succeeding taunt is determined by the SoE higher-ups, not the system which combat is implemented.  For example healers get a +40% or whatever that number is to their heals but this doesn't make it 40% easier to heal because all the encounters do enough damage to account for the 40%.  If there's a system that grants you save 10% better chance to taunt, then the encounters where taunt ought to be difficult will just be 10% harder to taunt as well.<br />
<br />
And like I said if you're going to get better taunt after failing a bunch the reverse will be implemented as well and then you'll probaly hear stories like 'I successfully taunted 3 blue mobs in a row and then it didn't work on a red mob that I needed to taunt because of the taunt modifier, this system sucks'.  <br />
<br />
Maybe what people really want is just a higher chance to succeed taunt outright, and that can be implemented in the current system as well.  In fact I'm almost certain if you want taunt to work say 35% or 45% or whatever people believe is adequate on yellow+ mobs the current system will be the best one.  Any partial systems necessarily reduces the number of complete successes.  For example if taunt works 40% of the time in the current system, a partial system can't possibly have 40% complete successes (because it'd be working more than 40% of the time), so you might end up with say, 30% complete success, 20% partial successes.  But, with an ability like taunt, partial successes simply doesn't do very much so you'll actually have more problems than before.<br />
<br />
Likewise if you want to say some fails lead to better successes, then the system can't have 40% complete successes either.  Either you end up with say, 35% complete successes and a progressive taunt, or you end up with say a 40% complete successes but you can also fail catastrophically for succeeding too much.</div></div><hr />

I'll give you a example of where your wrong, extended range.<br />
<br />
The blizzard tower has an AoE set up so that it requires more than 2 groups because of mana contraints, but using a player crafted ranged item from the same expantion you may avoid the AoE, this is an example of a percentage bonus NOT being accounted for.<br />
<br />
How about luclin and mana conservation items? many fights were designed to last for hours and to require a nice amount of warm bodys, but again, mana conservation and FT from the same expantion massively cut this down.<br />
<br />
I do not think having a cap on failures in a row would be asking to much, by the 4th failed taunt the healer is dead anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;but you can also fail catastrophically for succeeding too much.&quot;<br />

If a pickup raid comes along, I can not just rip out the anger augments from my GBoS, even without anger it can cause problems, that is my point, but that is really off on a tangent.<br />
<br />
My point is taunt, as a core skill of tanks in general, has room for improvement and the line of thinking that the monsters will just compensate is a poor one as not every skill increase warrents another thing to change, infact taunt NEEDS to be improve because all other areas of aggro have grown in size and multitude, heal aggro, slow aggro, nuke aggro ETC have all doubled and trippled since taunt was put in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does.  It trivializes having taunt as a skill, and turns every mob into being a mob of the same level.  Some mobs are SUPPOSED to have 4+ failures.  Some mobs are SUPPOSED to have a 10% success rate.  That's why their level is where it is at.  Taunt is SUPPOSED to be purely random.  SOE is happy with the pure randomness of it, and the fact you can fail it 100x in a row if you have crappy luck.  It reflects the notion of the skill in RL, and reflects how other boolean skills in the game work.  There is no reason to change it, and you're just a whining fucktard if you think the only way for taunt to be fixed is to change the fundamental system of it.  All it needs is a boost in the formula for negative level differences. That's it.  Whoever came up with the &quot;4x and automatic success&quot; idea needs to have his testicles ripped off and force-fed to himself.  Jesus.<br />

Welcome to RANDOM.  Especially when it comes to the RESILIENCE OF A CREATURE TO INSULTS.  I mean -- how do you, from a roleplaying standpoint, justify your taunt fix?  &quot;Well, I figure that after trying 3 different insults on the guy to get his attention, no matter what my 4th insult will be so bad he will want to kick my ass instantly&quot;.  The only reason people want this 4-taunt rule is because they think that they should get aggro whenever they want to get it (within an 18sec timeframe), period.  4mins into the fight we want to switch tanks, but rather than getting AETaunt all we need to do is let him taunt 4x and viola, a clean instant aggro transfer!  Just use AETaunt fer chrissakes.<br />

I'll show your ass skill, warrior skill is limited to know your monsters, know how to outlive them and how to work with other classes, aggro is not skill until we have a really means to get it, a paladin or sk for example, need to time their spells between melee rounds and enemy spells, that is skill, a cleric that knows how far away he needs to be to avoid the AoE in blizzard, that is skill, a necro that DOESN'T steal aggro, that is skill.<br />

And so many people asking for a free lunch and try to disguise it.  And of course if this somehow gets in the game you'd be complaining that sometimes you fail twice and people die so maybe it should be changed to two.  Never mind that this will increase your taunt by an immeasurable amount by things that are virtually untauntable (most ubers).  What's wrong with an automatic success after 3 fails?  I don't know, maybe having an AE taunt that works every 24 seconds instead of 10 minutes isn't the way this game is meant to be played?</div></div><hr />

I don't hear Knights complain about how their aggro is messed up because it's unrealistic.  Anger 3 line procs are huge in aggro generation and they're part of your character progression, not a band-aid fix.  They're purposely not given to Knights (which can actually use some help on aggro on the high end) because Warriors are supposed to be best at aggro.  It's hard to take compliants seriously when people can't even see the value of 2 Anger 3 procs that have been consistently denied to the Knight class.<br />

I can hold aggro just fine without even using taunt.  Because this game is easy, the only conclusion I can come to if you fail to do so with the same gear that either you or your group is missing something fundamental about how aggro works.  It's because this game is easy to play that gives you no ground to complain aggro is broken because anything I can do is easily replicable (within the same gear).  If even one person can hold aggro with a given set up anyone else can easily replicate it using the same gear setup assuming you at least have a minimal understanding of the game.  If you can't do it, you're the problem, not the game.</div></div><hr />

Theres zero skill in holding agro, maybe you consider hitting taunt and hoping for a success then hitting incite if it failed then hitting ae taunt if its necessary skillful, but I dont. Even if I did, a taunt change wouldnt trivialize it in the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Why shouldn't the casters be rooting a mob you're going to break mez, seeing root is still one of the most powerful CC tools avaliable?  Enchanters have a ton of tools to deal with aggro.  I remember Enchanters used to cast Boogle so they don't die after you break a mez.  Now it seems like everyone's lazy and can't be bothered to save themselves because it's too much work.<br />
<br />
So we lose to Knights in damageless aggro (which has always been their speciality).  It was never said we've to be absolutely the best at every possible thing related to tanking/aggro, and I'd say at least 90% of the time you need damage-based aggro as opposed to damage-less aggro, and we beat Knights very easily on damage-based aggro unless the mob is being pingponged.<br />
<br />
Exactly why is it asking too much for a root if all you got is a Warrior dealing with mez breaks?  That's like saying Knights are broken because they can't tank ubers if clerics are too lazy to cast Vie (which is pretty much the foundation of Knight tanking).  You want to do something your class isn't good at, you're going to need all the help you can get.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it can be frustrating with a raid waiting for you to break a red con and all you see is fail fail.It's why I look to other tanks to cover for me on breaks and most especially knights to act as a buffer on any loose aggro.Heck I'd like a better success taunt,but, it would diminsh the benefits of knight  snap aggro support to the same degree taunt was improved.Some of the pucker factor that loose aggro can cause would go too.Getting any improvement to taunt would make it easier to do my job,but, similarily affects other balances.Balance is a tough argument to make here.As it stands with your suggestion I would engage every mob and taunt 3 times as early as possible around debuffs hehe.Takes some of the fun out of it imo.You don't have to tell me about early aggro being the tense moment, or,warriors with good gear having aggro lock...I've ma'd everything we've done from pop to time  and I know the score.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gerick,Your idea about taunt success building over time has some merit imo.It's still gonna be subject to chance and avoid the ridiculous instance of taunting over 10 times before a break.However,any improvements in this regard will still have to be balanced with regard to encounters and knights.You would after all be asking for an increase in the margin of aggro security a warrior can provide.That will affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
Gerick, i've used ae taunt on all the mobs in pow and it's worked everytime.I'm not saying there are not possible issues with ae taunt failing due to axis etc.Just that I haven't run into them yet pre - god except possibly once on the big poe croc.Large mobs with big hit boxes seem to take some care with positioning.That could use a look.<br />

Gerick, the stuff about your hate generation when on assist is your fault...nothing to do with taunt.Focusing solely on weapon choice, your selection must take into account the ma's hate generation and the mob in question.If you draw aggro when you don't want it you are using the wrong weapons at that particular time.I don't know how your ma was geared ,but,anger auged weapons are not good assist choices if you want to avoid aggro.You can use them with care of course,but, if you don't want aggro you're probably better off with something else.High dps weapons(relative to your mt) are also dangerous early fight and require some delay or sensitivity to use.This is basic stuff that you know I'm sure.BTW I'm not suggesting that all tanks everywhere bag their aggro weapons when assisting hehe.Delay on engage,proximity to target and luck are pretty big factors to play with.<br />
<br />
The way I see it taunt was developed very early on without the benefit of foreknowledge of the game today.Like most things in eq we see aggro tweaked here and there to keep up with changing times.However,taunt has an absolute value.Tweaking taunt is more difficult to balance than adding some raw hate generation.In order to keep the challenge in it the variables have to remain unpredictable to a degree and certainly unreliable.Gerick's idea of upgrading taunt's chance of success with each use has some potential I think,though I have no idea how difficult it would be to implemant as finding  the reboot button is tough enough for me.I think it would have to have a very rapid decay attatched to it.In any case Phant is right.If we improve our overall ability to taunt mobs to the point that we benefit from it then we affect balance whether some people think that it would be trivial or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">AE taunt has nothing to do with the success rate of taunt, if anything its a boon to the fact taunt needs to be changed if they needed to add the AA in the first place.<br />
<br />
A raised success probability on each taunt following a failed taunt is exactly what I suggested on page 2 of this thread I'm not asking for anything Gerick isnt.<br />
<br />
It wouldnt be hard to add a 'if lasttaunt=kyvheartstriker01 use taunt*.20' or something so it only raises success of a failure on the same target.<br />
<br />
If you really wanted to change targets and try to get 3 taunts off on a mezzed mob while youre killing another then ffs it should work for ya if you go through all that trouble imo, I personally wouldnt do it though and it wouldnt be any different than changing targets and doing the same thing now 90% of the time, its the other 10% of the time thats stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Look, if taunt was changed to a 4x max (24sec) failure rate then you could still root mobs and break them immediately if you want to, it doesnt change anything for you at all.<br />
<br />
My reply to your version of a solution was with regard to your posts suggesting the above.It is a differant thing Imo.As well ,as I said any improvement given to our ability to taunt will have larger balance issues to some degree.<br />
<br />
My 3 taunt  example was with regard to any boss I was tanking.With referance to your above suggestion(where your posts seemed to lead as a valid solution for improving taunt)I would always engage a given boss and taunt 3 times asap to hold my forth taunt as an ae taunt equivilent.<br />
<br />
If you didn't actually mean what you said with regard to making taunt always successful on the 4th try then thats fine too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">If success rate scaled up its going to cap somewhere, I used 4 as an example I think would work well for two reasons. First it would still take 24sec and 3 failed taunts for a guaranteed taunt, and anyone attacking for 24sec has agro anyway if they wanted it, so it would only be useful for initial agro on mezzed mobs and such. And secondly it doesnt take anything away from hybrids agro abilities since they would still be 4x as fast.<br />
<br />
I honestly dont care if it just scaled up and didnt cap at 100% but it should scale up and cap very high. I also dont think there should be a guaranteed taunt on any uber mob other than ae taunt. I never said that, Daabu just implied I did, every yellow and red con mob isnt an uber anymore though. Theres so much yellow and red con 'trash' and xp mobs now that shouldnt fall under the old rules of taunt that it needs to change, its as simple as that really.<br />
<br />
edit: oh and I think it should change for everyone with taunt not just warriors also, taunt as a skill is fucked not just warrior taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Aye ,well I agree in part as my previous post states, tho again I believe balance would be difficult to achieve.Level 70 around the corner will have a big  impact on this stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Yea level 70 is close but theyre not going to make mobs any easier, and since xp value is tied directly to the level of the mob and the ZEM theres no way were going back to blue and white mobs.</div></div><hr />

Doh!  Silly me!  How could I have forgotten that post count is such an important measuring stick for epenises?  And everybody knows that epenis size is far more important than anything else here, eh?  As for arrogant punk adolescents, I don't see how I could ever measure up to the rather amazing standard set here by so many of those who've come before me, so I suppose I should be honored that a long-time denizen like you has decided to single me out.<br />

Still and all, I'm glad to have been of service.  I wouldn't want you to waste any of your precious time wondering about me.  Certainly the post that I lampooned left me with little doubt as to that person's attitude.  Now if only you and a few others would quit putting actual thought into the majority of your posts it'd take a lot less of my time to keep up with this board.</div></div><hr />
