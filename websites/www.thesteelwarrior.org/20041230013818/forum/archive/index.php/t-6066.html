<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that I have some Leadership AA I'm running out of room on my 1st Hotbutton page.<br />
<br />
My current setup is:<br />
<br />
Sit<br />
Taunt<br />
Slam<br />
/assist followed by /shield<br />
Warlord's Tenacity<br />
AE Taunt<br />
Holgresh Elder Beads<br />
Range attack<br />
/assist Main Assist<br />
Group Mark NPC1 (replaced /g Assist me on %t.)<br />
<br />
I'm using Group Mark NPC1 instead of an attack call and it is actually better, but people need to get used to it.<br />
<br />
If I need to use an acutal Assist message or if I got Rampage, Warcry, Find Path to PC, or if I want to use additional clickies on a multiple buff dispelling mob, I gotta replace important stuff.  /disarm, /Loc, /beg, /assist Puller, /shield (without assisting my target 1st), other clickies and spots taken for swapping weapons quickly and easily are long gone!<br />
<br />
I tried using custom UIs but I can't stand the bugs and having to wait for a new one every time theres a patch, meanwhile being all jammed up because things are not how I expect them to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drop the sit and holgresh beads hotkeys, neither seem to be too immediate to me at least that you'd need them on the first page, just get used to using ctrl s to sit/stand.  For weapons download just a hotkey/inventory mod seperatly.  I hardly ever have to update my hotkey/inventory mod after patches, and when you do it's always an easy fix instead of using a complete mod package.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ctrl-S was just the advice I needed.  Thank you.  Now I just need to unlearn the habit of hitting 1 for years.<br />
<br />
As far as the Holgresh Elder Beads, I use them constantly.  If I'm pulling, they're amazing.  If I'm tagging off a puller they're even better.  I do put a clicky item there on raids though.<br />
<br />
The best part of Ctrl-S instead of 1 will be that I currently have Incite on both Alt-1 and Alt-2 because I was fat-fingering too much.  Now I can free up one of those for another disipline, Resistant or Healing Will or maybe even that new agro disc I never got to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Careful on the ctrl-s...when I started using ctrl-s for sitting, I occasionally hit ctrl-d.  disband.  thats bad, so remaped disband to ctrl-p :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Qest, why do you have /shield tied to your /assist key? <br />
That key assists the mob then shields whoever its hitting, right? If thats the case, you can open up another hotkey by simply typing /as followed by /sh to get the same task done.<br />
<br />
Also, could you explain a little more about how your HEB helps with pulling/tagging?<br />
<br />
Lastly, where is Incite?<br />
<br />
Lens, I remapped mine to Ctrl+Shift+D, that way my fingers still to basically the same movements, so no harsh learning curve getting used to the buttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My /shield hotbutton assists the mob and then does /shield with a short delay to make sure it works.  I find this effective because most of the time I want to /shield whoever the mob is hitting and, since I don't have Health of Target's Target I don't necessarily know who that is or care.  Heck, a lot of the time it tries to shield myself and doesn't blow the ability since I got agro back.  I expect I'm far too slow a typist to do /as and /sh, but it looks like a good tip for when I don't want to assist the mob to do a /shield.<br />
<br />
Incite is in my Combat Abilities box as Alt-1 and Alt-2 because I too often missed when trying to hit Alt-1 and blowing whatever disc was assigned to Alt-2.<br />
<br />
The HEB cast Eye of Zomm.  It's a non-agro movable viewpoint.  That means I can scout ahead in complete safety and judge distances between mobs, check for roamers, con everything and form a plan to deal with casters, unrootables, unmezzables, high cons, etc.<br />
<br />
For tagging imagine this common scenario: The monk pulls a bunch of mobs around a corner in view of camp.  Mobs wander off at various intervals, but with my eye around the corner, I know better than the monk how far the the mobs have gone and/or whether they've reached their spawn points and reset.  Thus, I know when it's safe to launch my arrow, which I do right before clicking off the Eye.</div></div><hr />

3. Taunt<br />
4. Assist<br />
5. Defensive<br />

<br />
 Omg, WASD movement!<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, where IS your incite key Qest? That's about the most vital thing to have on your main hotkey list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my sit/stand key mapped to Insert key.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys are <br />
1. Attack<br />
2. Slam<br />
3. Assist<br />
4. Taunt<br />
5. Assist<br />
6. Berate<br />
7. Incoming message<br />
8. Range<br />
9. Add call<br />
0. Shield<br />
<br />
I have all my disc available in my combat screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine are:<br />
<br />
1. Attack<br />

5. Assist 1 (either /assist soandso or /g assist me on %T)<br />
6. Defensive<br />
7. Assist 2 (/assist 2ndary for raids)<br />
8. Furious (saved me more times than I can count)<br />
9. Shield (either /shield cleric or enchanter or /assist /pause 4 /shield)<br />
10. Range Attack<br />
<br />
Once I get AE taunt I'll probably take out the 2nd assist key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbo</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my discs mapped to my numpad, like this:<br />
<br />
(7) Evasive (8) Defensive (9) Stonewall<br />
(4) SoRage (5) Fellstrike (6) Furious<br />
(1) Incite (2) Healing Will<br />
(0) Autoattack<br />
<br />
Since I use mainly my right hand on arrows to move, with left hand on hotkeys, this works great for me (I 2box with EQW).  Almost unconciously can reach over and tap 1 with my ring finger, same with autoattack.  This frees up all the hotkey spaces for discs.  Of course, this doesn't work if you use the numpad for movement...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You never sit?  You must group with a lot of enchanters and bards and not with rangers or magicians.  If you don't have a mezzer, or you need to position for bows and bolts, you need to move mobs apart and the best way I've found is to get some agro, move away and sit.  Mobs love you when you sit, ask any caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could get enough aggro to make the mob follow you.  Sitting is pretty unreliable when the mob already has everyone in your group on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just use the combat abilities box (ctrl+1-8) to save a lot of hotkey space.  Once you're used to it, it's just as fast.</div></div><hr />

my thinking was, first keybank needs things which you need to heal faster than you can type, and in my mind, switching targets is probably the fastest thing you need to communicate.</div></div><hr />

I keep all my discs nice and out of the way on page 6 (but not so far away I can't get to em when I need em). Furious is in the 6th slot on page 6, so I can hit Shift+6, 6 and be riposting in a jiff</div></div><hr />

I don't hotkey disc furious, because I fatfingered it too many times, and it takes so long to reset.  Instead, I got used to alt-C to open my combat abilities box, and I set the box right in the middle of my screen where my cursor usually is.  I should probably train myself to use the alt-# combo instead to hit the skills directly.</div></div><hr />
