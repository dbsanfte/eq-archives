<br />
Swift like the wind - 60% haste, single target, 16(24 mins with aa ext) minute duration,  250 mana<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity - 50% haste, group buff, 36 minute duration(54 mins with aa ext), 750 mana<br />
<br />
There are currently two camps over at the crucible on haste: Those that think ToA is the haste to use in groups, and those that think SLTW is the haste to use.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this is to both enlighten those of you who don't know what  haste is being cast on you, and to let those of you who do your damage via melee chime in on the issue over at the crucible and help enlighten shaman on the importance of haste to melee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Need an option that states &quot;Depends on if the shammy is on top of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would rather have a longer-duration, but worse, haste if I'm going to have to ask 5 times in group for the shaman to re-do SLTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crist0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assume you get a good shaman, as the debate is currently which is the better haste - sltw because it allows for 10% more haste, or toa because it is group vs single target, and lasts longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it depends on the situation.  Group full of melee, then group haste, only a couple then SLTW.  Also, if the shaman has an ornate bp, might as well use SLTW (the click on the bp).  Obviously I prefer more haste, but you also have to consider the shamans mana and amount of time recasting takes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crist0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just to toss a few figures out there(assuming scrm(50% aa extension):<br />
<br />
SLTW mana cost in one hour(5 melee in group): 3750 mana<br />
<br />
ToA mana cost in one hour: 1500<br />
<br />
So a difference of 2250 mana over an hour. <br />
<br />
Assuming  base(no item or spell)  total melee dps to be 250:<br />
<br />
SLTW(41% item haste will be assumed for all comparisons): 502.5dps<br />
<br />
ToA: 477.5dps<br />
<br />
Given perfect conditions, damage difference in one hour: 90,000<br />
<br />
The more melee you add to the group the more the damage difference will be between the two, and the more dps prehaste the larger the gap as well.<br />
<br />
For instance if the group's unhasted dps was 500 there would be a 50dps advantage using sltw and a damage difference of 180,000 over the hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd prefer ToA. Makes life easier on the Shaman, gets the entire group hasted for more DPS and its obvious when it fades, so no time wasted asking for rebuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think its purely situational and also depends on the shaman.  Can't ever recall having complained either way a shaman chooses to do it though.  <br />
<br />
One thing to remember though is ToA + item haste will never equal the haste cap.  ToA + item haste + bard haste/overhaste does however.  Assuming a shaman is on top of his game and rehastes as needed, mana isn't a problem, and there is no bard in group, I can't see a reason why you wouldn't want to have max haste on and cast SLTW other than the shaman just doesn't feel like it.  My alt is a 60 shaman so I understand shaman have a lot to do in most groups, but honestly, thats their job: to slow and buff.  Have a shaman as main healer for some reason?  I'm sure most of us are fine with ToA in such a situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It really depends on how melee heavy the group is in my opinion. If the group has mostly casters, then ToA is going to be pretty much wasted and it'll probably be more mana efficient and better DPS for SLTW.<br />
<br />
 One thing to keep in mind, though, is that most raid melee will have 41% haste. This actually means that there is an effective 9% haste difference due to the haste cap, rather than 10%, which is almost negliable. Keep it in mind though for crunching numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To say the least, I don't care. If it's haste I'm all set. Persoanlly I would use ToA just because the fact that it's easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kruscher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, as a person who has both played a warr and a sham, I would say i am going to go with ToA. One cast versus several casts is a pain in the arse, especially if you do no have that ornate bp. Yeah sltw would put you at the cap but ToA will get you close enough.  You get ToA and like it, no need to make the game more work then play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Any shaman not using SLTW is a lazy fuck, period.<br />
<br />
Name me a way to do 90k damage with 2250 mana in an hour and you can use ToA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kruscher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lazy fuck i am then, you get ToA.  If you want max haste get an ench.  Beyond slowing, malosing, maybe crippling, healing, doing dmg by dots or crappy nukes you want me to cast (assuming scrm and 5 melee) SLTW 15 times versus two casts of TOA.  If you have an ornate bp to cast it off of, go ahead, but i am not taking up a spell gem so you can have max haste.  Then there is the time factor. Assuming 8 second cast and 2.25 sec refresh (10.25 total), you will have a total casting time of slightly over 2 and a half minutes, as opposed to 2 casts of ToA (20.5 total).  That could be time spent cannibalizing, slowing, healing or whatever.  I realize that these durations run over the hour limit, but they are close.  These cookie cutter situations crack me up, in a perfect setting i would have that ornate bp to cast free sltw so it wouldnt lapse, but invariably I have to heal, or slow, or am waiting for spell refresh from canni, and hastes may lapse at these times.  Dps suffers then.  I can give you a sure thing, where I know with one cast everyone has haste and will for a while.  You get ToA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I prefer SLTW all the way. I like it as a warrior, and always cast it instead of ToA when I play shaman.<br />

ToA will not get anyone to haste cap. SLTW will. If a shaman's not using SLTW, they're not maximizing the effectiveness of their melee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Shaman here. First post on this board, so take my info as you will. This is a very interesting topic that I might have a bit of insight on. <br />
<br />
Given perfect conditions, damage difference in one hour: 90,000 <br />
<br />
<br />
This is very true. As a Shaman, I am concerned about what would be most effective. This does not really mean most efficient. I have little concern about mana cost, but I am concerned about DPS. Per the statement above 90K/hour seems like quite a bit of damage, but it would be under PERFECT conditions.<br />
<br />
This does not take into account SLTW fading during a 4+ mob pull, which would offset the entire line and all melee would be going without haste for a bit until the mobs were controlled. Or during combat with mobs that will last more than 60 seconds or so, in which a shaman could be pumping out dots, increasing group DPS. I'm sure you get the idea, so I won't ramble.<br />
<br />
I suppose the most efficient way would be to have both on. That way when you are not operating under 60% haste, you would still have the 50%. Of course, that would take another valuable buff slot and it would pretty much be wasted effort 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
Being a concerned shaman, I ask you. Is it worth the extra effort in maintaining SLTW during imperfect conditions. Should both spells be used in order to maintain the highest possible melee efficiency? Is it worth loosing the added damage a shaman can put out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Had to post on the &quot;lazy Shaman&quot; comment. :)<br />
<br />
I am a mere pre-elemental Shaman, so my reference may be a bit out of perspective for you. Also, I don't speak for other Shaman, just myself.<br />
<br />
I tend to run with high melee stacked groups. In doing so, I take on most of the caster functions in a group. (with a good mix of melee types this actually works better than most traditional group make ups). This being said, I tend to be the puller, Slower, CC, Healer and I throw in damage when I can. <br />
<br />
I believe that since my DPS isn't even in the same class as melee as a whole, I should be contributing in a way that maximizes on the DPS of the melee. So, I line up the mobs in a nice and orderly fashion so a group of melee can mow down the line and basically not worry about anything, except maybe running out of mobs. Point is, I usually do not cast SLTW because it really isn't worth the down time. It really sucks to hold pulls to continually rebuff the entire group with a single person haste. I kinda take offense at being called lazy. So to show how hurt I am...<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here it is, I'm gonna be really Mean here &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
After all, it's not like I just have to walk up to a mob, hit attack and mash the taunt button!<br />
<br />
Point is, if you have a good shaman, chances are your gonna have a really busy shaman. Most of you realize this and if the poll would have shown a high demand for SLTW over ToA, I would have tried that much harder to keep SLTW up. Hell I probably will anyhow, but that remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Any shaman who, on multi-mob pulls uses individual slows rather than AE slow (note: all of them) has no business attempting to justify their lazy ass using ToA rather than SLTW, for EVERY SINGLE argument they make regarding ToA can be easily turned against them when using individual slows.<br />
<br />
A shaman who, for NO realistic reason limits MY functionality in a group for his or her convenience will not group with me ever again.    I mean, the EXACT same argument could be made for the Shaman telling a warrior to use his Ornate Gloves rather than getting the Shaman haste, since it's &quot;only 10% difference&quot; and costs the Shaman less mana (none).<br />
<br />
If a Shaman, who's ENTIRE FUNCTION in Everquest is twofold:<br />
<br />
1. To make others more effective<br />
<br />
2. To make opponents less effective<br />
<br />
chooses not to make his group as effective as he is able to, then he's intentionally, for his or her convenience, limiting the abilities of his group.    <br />
<br />
SLTW over PoA is *significantly* more important than giving themselves or other casters Primal Essence, or any other hitpoint buff, yet they do so all the time.<br />
<br />
Shamans can kiss my ass if they're not willing, because.... get this... A Beastlord can slow pretty damn close to as well as they can, and can give me Alacrity, so why on EARTH would I pick your attitude exuding ass over a beastlord if you provide me with no appreciable benefit to your presence?   You REFUSE to give me what you're capable of giving me, and ON PURPOSE lower the gap between you and a Beastlord.</div></div><hr />

My shaman is Sssythe Malosepsis.  I play on Fennin Ro.  I have played this char since the beginning of kunark, I never have been an uber and I will never be.  I don't have the time or the desire first of all, and If the 90k dmg you MIGHT lose (considering melee oor, afk or whatever) over the course of an hour is that eggregious, I encourage you to never ever group me again.  I am a gimp player in a small guild, you can find better peeps to cast swift like the wind anyways.  I also play a warrior.  I do NOT 2 box, as I am one of those weird types that think that two boxing is just wrong, or lame, or whatever, or just don't want to deal with the hassle of an extra keyboard and monitor, or the lag on my already ancient system.  If this is such a huge deal, perhaps you should petition SOE to upgrade a spell that isn't an upgrade, to one that at least matches the previous haste allowed us.<br />

Yes, it is extremely low..and the more melee and/or more dps the greater the difference in damage using sltw over toa.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't have the time or the desire first of all, and If the 90k dmg you MIGHT lose (considering melee oor, afk or whatever)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you look closely through the crucible thread this was addressed - the melee would need to be afk for an extreme amount of time(along the lines of 75-85% or more) in order for the shaman to be able to make up the damage difference with the mana saved using toa over sltw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">:: puts his shaman hat on ::<br />
<br />
First of all, Talisman of Alacrity is a misnomer. It should be called Talisman of Celerity, so - no, your beastlord does not have the same level of haste to offer.<br />
<br />
Second of all, all your argument about lost dps you can shove squarely up your ass until all you melees who have Ferine Avatar on your bazaar mule for 50K start passing it out to shamans who need it. Dps problem solved, k thks. Stupid fucking argument.<br />
<br />
If you're so anal about what haste spell you get, I wouldnt want to group with your whining little ass. Go get a beastlord for christ's sake. Contrary to popular belief, even with CannV we do not have an endless supply of mana, and most of us are busy doing several things already in a group and dont have enough spell slots to keep haste (ANY haste spell) permanently in memory. So, when we do have to haste, it's a hell of a lot easier to swap the group version in - use it and forget about it for 45 mins so we can concentrate on all the other things we need to do.</div></div><hr />

 I personally don't rag out Shamans who don't max haste, but that amount of indifference to the group situation.....Iesu.</div></div><hr />

In case you don't want to follow the link, beastlords get celerity at level 63...so yes, they do indeed have the same haste % as shaman if the shaman only uses toa.</div></div><hr />

I play a level 65 shaman, and level 65 warrior.  Not at the same time - one account.  :)<br />
<br />
When I'm playing the shaman, I generally use SLTW because I have SCRM and it's not that painful to keep up.<br />
<br />
I'll use ToA if:<br />
<br />
1) there's a bard in the group.  In this case they're generally singing Warsong of Zek + Rizlona's/Muse, so my haste spell only serves the purpose of putting up a haste looking icon for everyone who turns their bard box off and complains they're not being hasted.  This is more for the bard's sanity than any real use.<br />
<br />
2) If mana's very tight - and I know my mana situation better than you do.<br />
<br />
3) If I really want to.<br />
<br />
Any group that cares to complain about that will note that, as someone who plays both a melee class AND a shaman, I know exactly how much less time it will take me to get another group than it will take you to get another slower.  :)</div></div><hr />

hahahah. great reply.<br />
<br />
I generally play this game to have fun. If a shaman is up to keeping SLTW on all the melees, cool. If he/she wants to relax, just as cool. I don't find min/maxing to be the best use of my time and I won't cry or bitch because a shaman is doing other things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This is not a question of laziness, and it is not a question of mana (canni cures mana issues -- usually).<br />
<br />
The use of SLTW vs ToA is situational.  And if you are getting ToA, there is likely a reason for it.  Not every shammy has an ornate BP and extended enhancements.  In those cases, you pretty much have to keep SLTW mem'd to keep it up if there are 3 or more melee.  You certainly have to keep FA mem'd b/c it takes 1 minute for the spell gem to refresh.  This means, on mobs that are highly resistant, you need malos and malosinia up in order to get them slowed and are now down to 0 extra spell slots.  (Malos, Malosinia [might have AE slow too], Turgurs, Tnarg's Mending, Canni, Quies, SLTW, and FA).  But, in this situation (where the shammy is hasting), he is almost certainly your crowd control.  How bad would it suck if a bunch of mobs come into camp and he's got SLTW mem'd cause he is the process of rehasting and now he can't sit long enough to get root into his gem slots?  A shammy caught with his pants down, is peeing down everyone's legs.<br />
<br />
ToA, because of its longer duration and the fact it hits everyone in the group at once, can be mem'd and forgotten much easier than SLTW.<br />
<br />
When it is practical to to swap SLTW in and out -- single pulls, someone else doing CC, less resistant mobs, etc., I see no reason not to use SLTW, but don't assume your shammy is lazy if you aren't getting it.  He might be lazy (judging by some of things I've read), but he might also be saving your ass.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people who choose Shamans generally have a gene which causes them to in some sort of maternal way, feel that they are the final arbitors of hwo EQ shoudl be played, and they get concerned about balance only when they feel that they cannot be insistent that everyone tailor their playstyle around theirs.    When this &quot;You'll do as I say you'll do&quot; role is threatened by the presence of someone who can perform many of their more desired tasks and they're chosen because of personality rather than need, they feel that there's a balance issue.<br />
<br />
Many of the biggest problems with players in EQ have been with Shamans, starting way back at level 40ish when they get their stupid dogs and let PC's die while healing Spot, to a whole series of deluded thoughts of inflated self-importance.<br />

It's not that much of a hassle really.  Anything else is just an excuse for being too lazy to hit F2-F6 and target everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If its a choice between SLTW/ToA,  its a no-brainer, of course everyone would want more haste.<br />
<br />
However...  If the shaman is Pre-C5 and pre-buff extension AAs (ooo,  like my one!) and low FT (FT2!).  Then...  since SLTW takes so DAMN freaking LONG to cast on 3+ people, you miss alot more mana regen time in an indoor/no mana buffs situation than ToAing...<br />
<br />
So...  personally,  if there's more than a couple of melee I tend to ToA and make sure FA never drops.  FA makes a shitload more difference than the difference (~10-15%) than that between SLTW and TOA (5% assuming 41% haste).<br />
<br />
Using ToA is a situational judgement call though.  Sometimes its just better to get the hell going (ToA) and then switch to SLTW as/if mana allows (e.g. LDoN).<br />
<br />
[edit:]  Pre- Spell Haste 4 + Quickbuff 2 + SCR3 + SCRM + EE4 +C5 FAing and SLTWing 3-4 is rather different Haass. Once you have em though,  you're right, there's no excuse...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well speaking as a 65 shaman. I am normally the only shaman in our raids above 60.

However when our chanters are present this is not an issue.</div></div><hr />

I think if a shaman claimed to be low on mana and they hadn't just get done with a 10 minute+ fight or something, I'd run from them screaming.  NO shaman I know ever goes OOM except in extreme circumstances.<br />

Maybe if you hadn't been such a lazy ass and gotten 41% haste instead of that 36% it wouldn't make such a difference?  Fuckin' pussy whining warriors.... All this god damn bitching about maximizing haste, all in the name of the quest TO MAKE THE GROUP MORE EFFICIENT.  Yet, this is the same fuckin' bunch who whined to high heaven about paladins being chosen to tank over warriors pre-incite, for that exact same reason.  If you're in your pickup group, and you're bitching at that shammy because you're not getting that last 10% haste, and you've already decided that you're not gonna group your ooober bad-ass self with him/her again; well that's cool, because I'm sure that he/she has already decided that same thing, based on the fact that you're an asshole.  And quite frankly, I'll remember you as being a fuckwit a helluva lot longer then I remember them being lazy for casting a different haste spell.</div></div><hr />

Groups ask you your unbuffed HP/AC because your gear, by far more than any other person's gear, or any person's spellbook, affects whethere you will live or die, and thus effect the success of the group.  I've seen lvl 60+ warriors still using crusty armour and centi LS.  That is going to weaken a group a helluva lot more than a shaman using ToA over SLtW, or a pally casting BMB over BSS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ToA - lower group haste, lasts longer and is quicker to buff<br />
<br />
If the shaman needs to buff the group with haste now, I frankly don't mind if they toss ToA real quick to tide everyone over while they work on slowing/buffing/throwing SLTW.<br />
<br />
It's a different tool...like AE slow.  Single target is better, but sometimes you need something on everyone now, even if it's not the best.  It all depends on the situation, however it's hard to say that ToA is overall better...SLTW is still better.<br />
<br />
Personally, as long as the haste is 50%, I don't care what they toss on my beastlord.  I'll have 50% haste soon and I'll toss it on myself if they give a 40% (Alacrity, not ToA)</div></div><hr />

No, you missed my point entirely, genius. You all are complaining about the difference in haste compromising your dps, and at the same time there are many melees who have FA for sale at ludicrous prices. Think about it.<br />
<br />
You want to pick a fight with shamans? The one class who's majority of spell lines are designed for one, and only one thing - that's to make YOU better in combat. Seems like a dumb idea to me. (Haass, doesnt have to answer. I already can see you hate shamans for some reason or another, but thankfully none of the warriors my shaman has ever grouped with were assholes like you).<br />
<br />
No warrior, or any other melee type, has ever complained to me about ToA. None have ever asked for Swift like the Wind instead. If they ever did, I would cast it on them. Just like I cast agility on people when they ask for it. Or IoS on the stupid battle cleric. Or charisma on the MT for death pact. <br />
<br />
The first one that copped an attitude like Haass or Frodlin when they asked for it would get fucking Flurry, and like it. Or go LFG again. And if that gives you more proof that all us shamans are powertripping jackasses, Haass, then maybe you ought to think about how your own shitty attitude contributes to our reaction.<br />
<br />
:: puts his warrior hat back on ::<br />
<br />
As a warrior, I dont care what haste I get as long as I get haste - if there is somebody who can cast it or sing it. Even +10% haste is better than I would get on my own. <br />
<br />
And I tell the cleric my hps not so he can judge whether I'm a worthy tank - I tell him so he knows better how to judge his heals. No party has ever rejected me because I wasnt uber enough, and as you can see I'm not that well equipped (by today's standards). Of course, I'm not a moron like some people these days and try to hunt in Plane of Valor at level 52 in crafted armor. I imagine they might get laughed at or turned down for groups. Yes, I know that's not realistic - it's an illustration..you get the point.</div></div><hr />

Lol...I love how no one reads.  I AM the shaman.  I'm the shaman that everyone in my guild groups with..the only one.  And ya know what, I'd never short change my group because I was too lazy to reach over to the other comp and click ALT 7 a few more times to haste everyone.<br />
<br />
No, you missed my point entirely, genius. You all are complaining about the difference in haste compromising your dps, and at the same time there are many melees who have FA for sale at ludicrous prices. Think about it. <br />
<br />
I did think about it.  I thought about it when I bought my first Ykesha from a caster for 10k, I thought about it when I bought that Lamentation from a caster for 10k, I thought about it when I bought my sceptre of destruction for 200k.  You don't think I'm aware of what I'm selling shit for?  Rape or be raped, that's the economy.  Play it or camp it yourself.  <br />
<br />
And don't talk to me about power tripping anymore.  The thing is that not only do I have an opinion, but I back it up with the fact that I LIVE that opinion every day.  Every melee in my group has 4 goddamned buffs from my shaman, Focus, Stamina, Avatard and Swift like the Wind.  If i'm on a raid, exactly 9 fucking melees at any time have Ferine Avatar.  You think it's an attitude?  It's the truth.  And if I can do that while 2 boxing the main tank, slowing with the shaman, AND patch healing, then you lame ass one boxed motherfuckers can turn auto attack off for 5 seconds and use the buffs that best help your group.<br />
<br />
If you can't...oh well, doesn't bother me any.  I haven't grouped with a shaman that wasn't my own in 4 years, and there's a good chance I won't in the next 4 years either.</div></div><hr />

You, on the other hand, think because you have that buffbot whore sitting on your second pc that makes you an expert.<br />

Oh, WOW, 4 hotkeyed buffs! Good golly, you are good. Is that the extent of what you've learned about shamans in your 4 years? I can think of twice as many buffs that I keep up regularly in most groups. <br />
<br />
What's the matter, group replenishment not good enough for your friends? Or is it too inconvenient? You'd have to make another hotkey, huh? <br />
<br />
Do you even know what cannibalize is? How much mana regen do you lose while your bot stands there contemplating his navel? <br />
<br />
How much dps do you lose when you reach over alt + 2 (or whatever) and bounce a slow and the mob runs over to your shaman and your warrior stands there auto-attacking the air? Dont tell me it doesnt happen, because you stand next to your warrior - I see 2-boxers play all the time. They make little mistakes like that all the time. <br />

Judging by your magelos, I'd guess it must be your friends that are so elite to have all maxxed stats and dont need you to cast any of these other buffs. Well, goodie for you - you're in the minority. <br />
<br />
Most of us still have to cast all these other spells regularly - why? Because melees ask for them. I dont bother to inject my opinion about what buffs people want - if they ask for it, I cast it on them. Nobody has ever asked for Swift like the Wind instead of Talisman of Alacrity. If they did, they would get it. But, maybe they dont ask because they can see that I'm doing quite a lot already - and it's not that big of a deal. I think most warriors get that - you dont.<br />
<br />
But, hey, what would I know. I've only played my shaman almost 5 years. I was level 50 and nearly full planar armor months before Kunark came out - probably about the time you started. I was a moderator for my server's shaman boards and planar armor loot list. I have been the leader of my guild, and only leader, for over 4 years. In short, you have no clue what kind of shaman I am so your stupid remarks about turning off auto-attack are based in fantasy. Just like your notion that your bot is a better shaman than any 'lame ass one boxed motherfuckers', to use your term.</div></div><hr />

You're the one bitching about lazy shaman who aren't doing enough to maximize the group's potential, not I.  Getting that last 5% of haste would cover half of the shaman's &quot;laziness&quot;.   Even with SLtW, you're still going to be at only 96%.  That's 4% of additional DPS missing from your side of the equation.  But hell, you can't be bothered, why should the shammy?<br />
<br />
And, to be honest, had you asked, I'd have said up front I'm one of the laziest guys going.  However, in this case, &quot;relaxed&quot; is probably a better word than lazy.  I'll agree, I want to get as much done in the least amount of time possible; however, I'm also more than willing to balance that against the fact that this is a game which some ppl will be &quot;lazy&quot; about, and I'm quite happy with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior - 100dps<br />
Monk - 120dps<br />

Shadowknight - 80dps (not including spells)<br />

Monk - 132dps<br />
Rogue - 154dps<br />
Shadowknight - 87dps<br />

<br />
41% haste is available from PoI dragon (neck), scale cracker from CT (primary/range), a number of slots from Dozer/HoT quests (back/wrist/range/secondary etc), Yelinak in SS (neck, hands), Doomshade in UP (ear), etc.  All of these can be done with 3 groups or less, which is about the same as the BoT tower boss you took down for your GSot4W.  Dozer in fact can reliably be done with a single group.  Saying 41% isn't available to you is simply a bunch of bullshit.<br />
<br />
As for your above group...  First off, you're going to bitch at a shammy who's slowing, as well as buffing, healing, and hasting 5 other group members?  Get real.  I'm fairly confident most shammys would tell you to shove your argument up your backside when you &quot;demanded&quot; your SLtW.   Secondly, if I were in a situation where the group I was in completed a mission only a few minutes late; I'd congratulate the group on a good attempt, be happy with the experience I got, and go and either try again or do something else.  Feel free to bitch at your group/shammy about the lack of that last 9% of DPS, as I'm positive that of course every other group member was perfect, with you having perfect positioning, every melee have perfect reaction times, etc. etc.  Also, be prepared to not get another group again, as after your wonderful lesson on the value of maximizing the group's DPS, in future they decide to go with a pally tank who can lock agro, and allow the group even higher DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You group with shitty 2 boxers.  I've been slowing for Haass for over 2 years now...from wurmslayer to lamentations to windblade, to sceptre of destruction to blade of carnage.  I know how much aggro Haass generates.  I've slowed literally MILLIONS of mobs he's tanked.  Unlike your normal shaman, this system is actually superior, because I draw aggro with the shaman next to never.<br />
<br />
Oh, and when I pull, I bring the mob right up to the shaman anyway.  But good job not thinking about that.  Work smarter, not harder.  Why move 2 toons when you can position them both by moving one?<br />
<br />
<br />
What happens when you need to VP and do crowd control and heal on a bad pull? My guess is, people die.  <br />
<br />
What happens when you have to VP and Heal at the same time?  My guess is that people die.  You can't make your spells refresh any faster than I can just because you're only playing one character.  <br />
<br />
Of course, since you obviously group with shitty 2 boxers, I'll enlighten you a little.  This is an SUPERIOR situation to you playing a shaman and someone else playing a warrior.  I know in advance I'm gonna have to do extra things, not just when the warrior comes back with 5 fucking mobs.  I know a solid 5-10 seconds before anyone else could possibly know that I fucked up the pull, or repop hit or whatever, because I'm the one bringing the mobs back.  The mob I have targeted is fucking rooted the instant it gets into range, because i know exactly what's coming.  You keep trying to turn these situations into disadvantages, but it's very clear that you either haven't grouped with anyone who knows what they're doing, or you just haven't thought it far enough thru.<br />
<br />
Doesnt anyone ask you for Bih'Li? Seems like that's the first thing melees want these days - you do know that gives a little bit of ATK too, right? Or acumen? Diaku? Wrulan? IoS? These are all worthless buffs, huh? Only us lamer n00bs use those - even though people keep asking for them.<br />
<br />
What a joke.  Bih'li?  Sorry sir, I don't hunt in outdoor zones.  I prefer the dungeon crawl thank you.  On the odd day I take a trip to BoT, I'll click off SoE and do Bih'li, sure.  But that's about once a month.<br />
<br />
Acumen?  You mean that thing that does exactly what my ornate helm does?  And exactly what the ornate helms on all the rest of my guild does?  Ya, it's a prime buff for me these days.<br />

You're right.  I'm lazy because I can't tolerate enough people on EQ to form 3 groups.  The best I can do for turn out due to scheduling is 2 groups, and only one cleric.  Guess 41 haste will have to wait.  In the meantime, why gimp myself more by using inferior buffs?</div></div><hr />

I generally avoid 2-boxers because from my experience, even the best ones are not capable of playing 2 toons as well as they could be playing just one. I've played with some very good 2-boxers, and even 3 or 4-boxers. But no matter how good they were at hydra'ing, they were still better when they concentrated solely on one character. I dont allow my guildmates to 2-box on raids, unless there is a dire need for an extra key class - which is hardly ever required. No matter how much you huff and puff, I'm sure you're no exception to the hydra quality rule - except maybe in your own mind.<br />
<br />
What happens when you have to VP and Heal at the same time? My guess is that people die. You can't make your spells refresh any faster than I can just because you're only playing one character.<br />
<br />
No, but since I am only paying attention to one character I can be casting other needed spells during the refresh time of slow/malo/root etc. I'm not hitting alt + 2 to try to slow a mob, then fucking around strafing or taunt/incite on another pc for 5 or 6 seconds - meanwhile the shaman has been free to cast another spell (other than the one you just cast) for about 3 to 4 seconds...which with your spell haste is more than enough time to cast an additional root or heal or even Q (if you have QB3). Instead, your shaman is just standing there looking stupid and doing zero to help control an overpull. Because, you see, that 10 second recast time on Malos, for example - only applies to Malos. Your other spells will refresh and be ready to cast a couple seconds later. But you probably never noticed that because you were too busy fucking around on your warrior when that happened.<br />
<br />
No, people dont die when I have to do crowd control, Haass. If you think I've thrived for over 4 years as a guildleader with little or no skill (as you like to insinuate), then you must be stupider than I thought.<br />
<br />
What a joke. Bih'li? Sorry sir, I don't hunt in outdoor zones. I prefer the dungeon crawl thank you. On the odd day I take a trip to BoT, I'll click off SoE and do Bih'li, sure.<br />
<br />
See, there's this thing called Lost Dungeons of Norrath. You know, it's like a dungeon, but you gather up in an outdoor area and do buffs. Most every melee asks to get Bih`li before you enter these. Other people actually do group with different people on a daily basis, in lots of different places (indoor and outdoor), with many different group makeups - not just the same 3 or 4 guild buddies.<br />
<br />
Acumen? You mean that thing that does exactly what my ornate helm does? And exactly what the ornate helms on all the rest of my guild does? Ya, it's a prime buff for me these days.<br />
<br />
Oh, did they start passing out ornate helms at character creation now? I must have missed that. Other people dont always have plainsight.<br />
<br />
Diaku? Haven't you been reading? AVATAR.<br />
<br />
Wrulon? AVATAR<br />
<br />
IOS? AVATAR<br />
<br />
Not everyone has FA. Have you seen the price on it? Other people still have to cast those buffs.<br />
<br />
Of course, since you obviously group with shitty 2 boxers, I'll enlighten you a little. This is an SUPERIOR situation to you playing a shaman and someone else playing a warrior.<br />
<br />
I guess that would make Sam Deathlancer-prancer-financer-whatever-the-fuck his name is SUPERIOR to all us other gimpy 1-boxed warriors, huh? I mean, he 8-boxes...that's gotta make him like even better than you, wouldnt it? Or maybe not...<br />
<br />
Well, after basically refuting everything you just said, yes, I am wondering exactly what you know.<br />
<br />
You didnt refute a single thing I said. All you proved was you dont play in the same real world situation as most other shamans. You're doing the exact thing that you despise shamans for, and that's thrusting your solitary, limited view of how things should be done upon everyone else. <br />
<br />
And that is the crux of this entire thread, and the ones that Jharrasik started on all the other melee boards - his limited little view on how all other people should play the game being spammed and forced down the throat of anybody who will listen.</div></div><hr />

Looks like that speaks for itself.  Sorry your friends are underequipped.<br />
<br />
Not according to you magelo. Says there you have half as much FT as you claim. Did you get some FT 3 item in GoD. Lucky you, if you did. Not everyone has FT 6, or MP4, or even CannV. <br />
<br />
By golly, you're right.  Except I have MC3, which for all intents and purposes is FT3.  I just don't feel like typing it out.  Apparantly I have to because the spot that says &quot;6 mana per tick regen&quot; is glossed over by some people.  And quite honestly, if you can't get the FT I have, or Cann 5, you're just plain not trying.  MP4 I'll cut you some slack on tho.<br />

What<br />

Are<br />
You<br />
Talking<br />
About<br />
<br />
This has absolutely nothing to do with what you said, which was what do I do when I have to root for CC and heal at the same time.  I told you that the mob is rooted before you even know it's there and now you're trying to tell me that I don't know how long malos is greyed out for.  Jesus christ, you could at least TRY here.<br />
<br />
See, there's this thing called Lost Dungeons of Norrath <br />
<br />
Really?  Sorry to hear that.  I stopped buying shitty expansions after PoP.  Hope that 6 INT augment works out for ya tho.<br />
<br />

<br />
For someone who was so top of the game 4 years ago, you've sure fallen behind if you can't even finish a spellbook.  Yes, I've seen the price on it, I forked over the cash for every single rune spell I've bought, because in the end, spells &gt; everything else, and I'd much rather pay 50k, or even 100k for a spell that saves me from wasting as much time buffing as you apparantly do.<br />
<br />

<br />
You're right.   If that's the &quot;real world,&quot; then I've clearly been playing fucking candyland for the past 4 years.  So I'll just continue playing the game where people actually have appropriate gear and spells for their level, and you can continue doing whatever you do in your &quot;real world.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
ill put it like this, i use a GSo4W with 36% haste, you want me to keep aggro and i do to, why not help me out with giving me a few more hits, and a few more chances at procs, hell i can manage with just my eyepatch but why not maximize what your tank is able to do and handle?</div></div><hr />
