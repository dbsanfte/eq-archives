This maybe old news to you guys, but I just wandered over to the EQLive site as I do so occasionally. I've been asking for this since SWG was released. Now that I have PS, SWG. EQ, and EQ2 all under one low subrscription price its very hard to justify paying for just WoW. I may have to reconsider reactivation...<br />
<br />
Arrgg, I guess this means I'm gonna be stuck buying the JTL expansion, which I was avoiding...</div></div><hr />

I didn't think people actually still played SWG.  And, from what I hear, EQ2 is already experiancing a mass exodus of EQ1 players leaving it to come back to EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some friends that play SWG and they say it has come a long way from when it first came out and is actually a pretty decent game now.  Have seen a few people start to come back from EQ2/WoW but I dunno if I'd call it a &quot;mass exodus&quot;.  Seems to be opposite problems though hehe, the EQ2 people gave up cause the leveling was too hard and the WoW people got bored because the leveling was too easy.   Can't make everybody happy I guess.</div></div><hr />

Just because I can go buy Pac Man for 5 bucks in the value bin at the grocery store doesn't make the game any more fun.</div></div><hr />

I am really pissed off though because I heard miss pac man holds aggro better than I do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry, couldnt help it, lol</div></div><hr />

I can't figure it out, and I don't want to pay for 3 things lol :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd contact customer service for help merging those accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On another note, it seems that the SWG team is allowing players to play Jump to Lightspeed on a 10 day trial. Its nice to know that I can get a feel for the expansion and make up my mind before purchasing.<br />
<br />
I wish more expansions were this way. Imagine what would have happened when GoD was released. It'd be cool if they did this for DoN. Hell, even OoW which I haven't bought yet. I imagine I'll get back in EQ some more after they do some server merges. It's nearly impossible to try and get a lvl 60ish group together on Vazaelle. I still enjoy the game, but LFG is absolutely no fun, when I know I can just jump on EQ2, WoW, or CoH and be kickin butt in as much time as it is to log on and travel to the baddies.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna say that EQ is doomed or whatever, but they will have to address this issue, and quickly, if they wish to keep maintaining the game. I can't speak for others, but I just don't have the time, nor the inclination to stare at my screen for hours on end waiting to do something to progress my character. I heard the task system was supposed to address this, but I haven't heard very good things about this *major* feature of the OoW expansion.</div></div><hr />
