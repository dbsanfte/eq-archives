<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild is elemental now, and we spend our days farming the minis in the planes.  We dropped one BoW off RZ in the process of getting our flags, and we have another one on a warrior that joined us recently.  I've noticed the superior aggro our BoW equipped warriors get, and I want it.  But at the same time, I seem to be doing ok with a BoC/Blackout combo.<br />
<br />
What I'm pondering is, how long should I keep hoarding my dkp in hopes that a BoW comes my way?  Guild isn't farming RZ at this point, the elemental planes are like candy land, and it just doesn't make sense to spend our raid time on a 2 hour event that yields 2 so-so drops if you don't get a BoW.  Can I keep dual wielding effectively all the way to Quarm?  Or is BoW so much better that I should bite the bullet and go without upgrades for a few months, during which we will hopefully hit RZ a few more times when there isn't anything better available?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get the armor. assumeing you dont do seperate armor/ accesory/ weapon dkp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">figure the going DKP rate for a BoW in your guild; bank it plus about 10 extra or so in case a hybrid tries to grow a brain...rest dump towards new gear.<br />
<br />
i know murphy real well. believe me as soon as a BoW would come available to you as you're shining up your new BP or legs...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get armor AFTER you get a BoW. That's what I'm doing now although I splurged on some Crimson gloves off Aten in VT for the proc. Just couldn't pass those up. Right now most of the elemental armor we get is going for a decent amount of points (bidding system). I know in another month or two a lot of it will be close to rotting or rotting. We've gotten 3 BoWs now out of 9-10 RZ kills in the past few months so you tell me which is easier to come by. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">as being in Gerald's guild i can attest to that, I horded DKP for 3 months. The day i spent it and said F! it on Aten BP, we killed RZ the following day and he dropped BoW... IMO armor &gt; BoW but that all depends on your guilds points system. You can tank just fine with 1hers i was using BF and render or BBB on every EP mob so far minus gods. Weve cleared water, earth, fire, air and i havent had any problems with agro pre BoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For many people (myself included) a Ykesha auged BoWar is a superior MTing weapon set than even the much flaunted Darkblade/EoE setup, which you won't even stand a chance of getting until your been farming all of PoTime for a few months.<br />
<br />
Keep yourself within reach of the top, and pick up the key pieces of elemental molds. Ignore non-mold-slot pieces for the moment unless you have really weak slots. If you miss out on looting a BoW if/when one drops you'll end up kicking yourself when PlateMold65 rots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ps: I'm a professional horder, as several people on these boards will attest to.<br />
<br />
Waited 3 months for the first Aten gloves to drop. Looted them, then another dropped the following week.<br />
<br />
Waited 3 months for the first Time BP mold to drop. Looted then, then another dropped the following week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never recommend trying to wait on one item like that.  I would say to try to balance waiting with getting other gear, and further, I'd tell you to look more at a SEWs over a bow since your chances are much higher on that.<br />
<br />
Things don't always work out like you might get a piece of armor or a sews and then next day your guild kills RZ and a bow drops but you can't sit and hope for one item because theres a chance that things work in reverse, where you don't get anything and a bow doesn't drop, your guild gets into time and you're left with lots of points, but the same old weak weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are two parts to yur game. Offense and Defense.<br />
<br />
Offense is determined by one or two slots.<br />
<br />
Defense is dertermined by like 20 or whatever it is.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS get your weapons FIRST before anything, go naked but get the best weapon you can. Don't even think of getting armor until you have a BoW in hand (the item I am also shooting for but as its no drop Ill never see it). 1/2 of ALL the money or DKP you spend on yur toon should go to your weapon.<br />
<br />
But as you say if you can pick up a super weapon for cheap then you dont have to spend money. I moved to the WMBS, a cheapo item for sure instead of items in the 50K range, cause its just better DPS. But BoW dosnt really have much competiton.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is no black-and-white response to this. depends on how your guild works, how points are handled and whether there are any class modifiers for somthing like a BoW. It also depends on your current role and how you view your progression. Your current kit factors in as well.<br />
<br />
all I can say is GOOD LUCK P~<br />
<br />
I had to hoard, had the most points when we killed RZtW the first time BUT wasnt online. I got the next. We have seen 4 BoWs on something like 18 kills. 2 warriors have bought SEWS since they were just plain tired of waiting. Armor is common, well most slots are. Weapons are pretty rare comparatively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah. bow &gt; armor mo.<br />
2 reasons really.<br />
in eps, 3k+ hitters + 1hander = winner ripostes<br />
its superb dps/aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the way i've always seen it, there's not point in holding agro if you cant survive it. if your agro is already enough to keep a mobs attention off the DPS go for the armor,  you'll get the weapons soon enough. pallies and SK's dont count as DPS, if they die no one cares =D by the time they are in a guild that can attempt RZ they should know how to manage agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BoW first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another way to look at it though, what good is aggro if you can't take the hits. If you can do that without any problem currently, save for the BoW. Otherwise bank some points for it but get some armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since you say your guild rarely does RZ; I'd recommend taking whatever armor you can get. All of the saved DKP wont mean anything if you dont have the hp to tank. <br />
<br />
If you can, just try to keep more points saved than your other warriors...When your guild starts to think about doing RZ more, then you should go into hardcore hoarding mode :D<br />
<br />
Snag yourself a nice 2 hander when you can (such as BBB) though; something to hold you over until you get a BoW...ripostes are killer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">WAIT AND SAVE TILL YOU GET A BOW!!!<br />
I cannot say it more simpel.<br />
<br />
I presume you are a regular player. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rolyaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, I am in a simular place.  I got the DKP saved to actually win the next BoW, but I am not ready to step up and MT or ST yet, I lack HP, AA and level.  I am slowly chewing away at it, but I know I am not ready.<br />
<br />
Odds are some paladin or SK is gonna win the BoW if I don't bid on it. (Don't start in on the who is best suited for a BoW, the battle has been foughten and lost)  My guild has been lucky on BoWs, 9 total so far 7 on warriors 2 on SK.<br />
<br />
Soon my guild will quit the farm cycle for RZtW so its one of those GET IT NOW or never get it.  Should I get the BoW or armor/hp up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Derrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you get a chance at a SEWS, grab it.  It will serve you just as well as a BoW would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">erm... no it won't</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Derrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Demorgoth, do you make your statement based on personal experience or through tales from another warrior complaining about a SEWS?  I'm guessing not.  I use a SEWS and do not have aggro problems when I MT.  So I stand by my statement: If you get a chance at a SEWS, grab it. It will serve you just as well as a BoW would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">BoW to sk ? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Riaden D'Marr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">having both bow and sews get either they both do great job with agro.  SEWs has very few mobs that it cannt hold agro on.</div></div><hr />
