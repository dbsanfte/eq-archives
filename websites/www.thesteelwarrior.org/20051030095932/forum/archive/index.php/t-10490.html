<br />
one time a guildie was describing this mage he had in an SM group that AE'd EVERYTHING. one mob, five mobs, he dropped an AE. when they pulled Mograine, guess what.<br />
<br />
AE.<br />
<br />
I said that this mage may revere Arcanist Doan too much, that he literally says BURN IN RIGHTEOUS FIRE out loud every time he AEs.<br />
<br />
the guildmate said this was not an unrealistic supposition.<br />
<br />
then last night in a mostly all guild Zul'Farrak group, we had an interesting priest. he kept bitching about how he hated FFA because I kept looting everything (I redistribute stuff at the end of the group). I stopped looting so fast and guess what, he looted damn near everything I didn't. then he started bitching about me getting a lot of the mageweave because his alt is a tailor. he liked to grab aggro by not assisting me and firing his wand, then bitched about getting beat on. we ended up cheesing the riot and got out with only a few deaths. <br />
<br />
as we were leaving, he said it was the best group he had ever been in and that more groups should be like us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was doing BFD with an alt because for some god unknown reason, I never did it, so hey, why not!<br />
<br />
Saryn, this crazy bitch paladin, insisted on rolling on everying, just because she's an enchanter and &quot;it'd benifit the whole group&quot; because she gives discounts. I think to myself, well, I guess I'll put up with it, it can't be that bad right?<br />
<br />
After losing 3-4 green items to, you know, someone who could fucking use them, instead of getting fed to the disenchant button, she begins to whine about how she can't loot and how it's unfair that no one will help her do Enchanting. I tell her off, because it's enough fucking bullshit that she's rolling on everything, I really don't care if she wins or not because I'm there for my profit too, not hers. We finally finish the boss area, light the candles, and she proceeds to light two at a fucking time so we get absolutely swamped with mobs. Luckily, I was on my feet with the priest, so we barely made it out alive.<br />
<br />
You'd think after this, you'd finally disband, but nope, we're almost to the hydra, I'll disband then. I didn't know she was going to blame ME for casting hunter's mark on a mob beforehand 5 minutes ago. To top this shit off, she insists that only the warrior and paladin loot the sword because only they can use swords. Hunters can use swords too, I pointed out, in which she replied &quot;You're a RANGE FIGHTER, idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
So after we beat the hydra, and the disenchant button wins the leech pants, I told the group members to move, and proceeded to warp train her. Hopefully, these shitcocks decide to quit, or they're chased out very quickly, because I'm definetely not going to be able to handle them during BRD/BRS.</div></div><hr />

I understand now why you couldn't 6 box EQ: having to group with yourself was barely acceptable but having to group with 6 times yourself ! what a shock ! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grouped with this one guy who was constantly running off in the instance to either mine a node, or loot some herb drop on the ground for a quest, without bothering to tell anyone. Mid fight, mid travel, it didnt matter to him, if he spotted something he wouldnt say anything, he would just run off and grab it. It wouldnt have been so bad if he was say, the mage, or a hunter, but he was the WARRIOR! Our group tank and that schmuk is running off while I, as the shaman, hold agro off the preist to go mine some frigging tin. Oh, and even better, he would loot mid fight, a mob dies, and he ignores the other 3 we are fighting just long enough to loot whatever the dead one dropped.</div></div><hr />
