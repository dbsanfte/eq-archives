<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone, i finanlly found the real boards =)<br />
<br />
Tried some tribute abilities today, great stuff for sure. Was just wondering a couple of things about the haste tribute.<br />
Does anyone know what kind of haste this is? Sais something like &quot;the bards of Norrath improve your worn haste&quot;. So item haste? or spell haste? If item haste does it stack with other items or should i just sell my hand wraps and get some ac/hp? <br />
The other question is of course, does anyone here know the haste % for the different  ranks?<br />
<br />
Any replyes would be great. <br />
<br />
Btw dont give the tribute master any pp, really crappy items give plenty of points (band of flesh 1728points, darkedged 2hander 1200 points, lightcrawler antenna 1400ish points)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhomiir</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehehe, I had bought 4 Greatstaff of Thunder's about month ago in hopes that some guildies would want one (since they were selling in the baz for 20-100pp at the time).  I ran over to the guy in my hometown and gave him one.... 27K tribute per.  I still have 3 but for how much they are (or used to be worth in pp) not a bad deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meecham</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Opal Encrusted Steins go for about 1.3k each. Lots of crappy stuff goes for over 1k, it's kind of strange.<br />
<br />
I did some very brief tests last night which indicated the haste tribute is item haste. I tested with and without Tier 4 (of 6) haste, with and without my epic (Swiftwind) haste. The Tier 4 haste seemed to be close to my epic haste but didn't stack with it.<br />
Assuming that's true, I guess I don't need to save up for that haste aug any more. I'll do actual parsing tomorrow if I don't see real tests show up from anyone; I can't find any.</div></div><hr />

Swiftwind is worn 41% haste right? I thought the purpose of that TE (Tribute Effect..coining a term here) was to increase the haste of your worn items, IE making your Swiftwind be 46% per haste or something.</div></div><hr />

Thats how I read it.<br />

No idea if they just intend to lower the value of some common items, but if so it might be an idea to trade some of what you got.<br />
That parse would be awesome btw Baadan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No... the problem was you could make a stack of animated bait for 2cp and turn it in for something like 20k points per stack.  Rightfully nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meecham</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, all the tribute merchants poofed around 9pm pst. I was hoping to do some parsing tonight but now I can't buy the haste tribute. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how would the haste percentage be determined?<br />
<br />
take a long long parse and them do some rough division with a margin of error?<br />
<br />
(ie, a 44 delay weapon would attack every 4.4 seconds with zero haste?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tribute haste is item haste. With the release of the expansion, you now have 5 more inventory slots than you used to, they are just invisible. A tribute benefit is an item (hidden from you) that is added to one of those 5 slots. The haste items (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=percent+benefit) are 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40% item haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's fascinating, but I am moved to ask, how the hell do you know that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So wait ... does it or doesn't it stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the link he has what looks like the Lucy information about it. If I am reading it right it sais that is does not stack so it gives you 20-40% *ITEM* haste even though there is no item.<br />
<br />
While sounds mostly useless but if you can dich a lower stat haste item to put something better on it may be worth it if the tribute cost is not too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">doing parse tests, i found the haste to be 41 percent.  shrug<br />
<br />
And yes, it did not appear to stack with my CoF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meecham</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the same thing I found. It seemed a little too good to be true but there it is - who needs a pricey item with iffy stats when you can just go rent 36% haste for 170/hr.<br />
It's plain old item haste so it doesn't stack with other items but does stack with spells, as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be more intersted in a much smaller haste that was from the bard added haste line, even 5-15% would be well worth it so long as the value was not too steep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm this is kinda lame them.  I sorta assumed that the swift arms tribute was haste that stacked with your haste item.  I guess I won't be using this at all then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well here is some quick math. note the assumptions. your assumptions will vary.<br />
<br />
assume i play my warrior 13 hours a week. assume i have haste on all the time. assume its 40points per 10 minutes since i honestly cant remember what it costs. assume 5 points cost 1 plat worth of items.<br />
<br />
total cost per year is 13 hours x 6 (10 minute segments) x 40 times 52 weeks  /(5 points per plat) = 32448plat.<br />
<br />
nowthen assume i can replace my runed bolster belt (5ac) with a heavy rubicite girdle (25ac) and sell my rbb for 30k and buy the rubicite for 8k. i save 22k immediately gain 20 raw ac and have to pay 32k over the course of one year. assume also that the rbb and rubicite lose one third of their value in one year so that it would have cost 22k/3 or 7333 to hold onto the rbb for the year. subtract the 7k from the 32448k to get 25117k as my yearly cost of trading the haste tribute stat and 20 extra raw ac for the 34 or so haste on the rbb.<br />
<br />
i gain 6 haste and 20 raw ac for 25k per year.<br />
<br />
some people would trade their rbb for a cloak of flames worth 70k to get that upgrade on haste which i think is less than 6 percent and that 70 would also depreciate by 26k in one year's time.<br />
<br />
what it all comes down to is ... if you have a lot of money it may be worth it. if you dont then it wont. but i know people pay 200k for certain choice items  so for the likes of them it certainly appears it would be well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tribute actualy costs 1 per 1 plat so it would actualy cost 162,240pp a year with those figgures or 3,120 pp a week, imo far too much to be worth it, the only way it makes sence is if you can get items that will let you spend far less than the 1-1 ratio. For it to be worth it to me it would need to get below 1k if not 500pp a week and thats with a lot of play, not likely to happen with the changes to item value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talk about differences in economies. Saw a heavy rubicite girdle for sale for the first time in months last night and it was 90k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the place i got that 8kpp on the rubicite was .. well it was like this .... i was in the middle of writing this post and i wanted to compare the rbb i owned to a good ac waist item so i alt-entered back to my eq trader gimp. i sorted waste items by ac and found a rubicite girdle for 8k. i alt-entered back and finished the post.<br />
<br />
i got to thinking about what i posted and decided to buy the girdle. but it was no longer for sale. however the next day there was one for sale for 30k.<br />
<br />
/cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using items for tribute, it probably is possible to get 3 tribute for 1 plat, if you buy right.  Maybe 2 tribute to 1 plat if the market responds to those items with higher tribute value.</div></div><hr />
