<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So do these guys EVER drop any Molds.  We have killed them like 10 times total and seen 2 Leather Helms drop and 1 Plate Arms.  Anyone else notice they are stingy with molds they always drop Haste Rings and those stupid Belts  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have killed the 3 of the 4 Avatars approx. 13 times and have received a bunch of molds.  They didn't drop every time but some times they dropped 2.  So mathematically i think our ratio is around 1:1 on molds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My experiences with them is they always dropped molds and not their gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never had issues with them dropping molds.  Did one of them once and got 2 fek SK weapons that rot'd =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We have been getting a lot of molds lately, but before it seemed that weren't as common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Be HAPPY you're note getting molds !<br />
<br />
Sonner or later you're gonna end up : <br />
&quot;Fuck no Cloack/Pauldrons&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck where is the haste ring&quot;<br />
Etc etc etc ....<br />
<br />
Trust me, every god damned EP mob drops molds (some rarer than other).<br />
But not all of them drop non visible armor... <br />
<br />
And in the end, you're gonna just wish you get more non visible armor</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that rare when I was there. I saw either 6 or 7 Puresteel Mantles, from 17 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Puresteel was rare for us... went about 8 kills before we saw one then got 2 in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">0 mantles for 5 kills. Another guild on tunare has gotten the mantle almost every kill I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mantles have been farily rare for us, I think we have 3 out of too many avatar runs.  As far as mold drops, I think we have been about 50/50 molds/items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">mantle dropped on the first kill. now resides in my magelo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We've probably killed that bird 7-8 times now, but only one Mantle.  The humor of it all is that I got so fed up with waiting for it to drop, that I went for the Spiked Shoulderpads (30ac 90hp and nice stats) out of Vex Thal.  I honestly can't complain.  Those shoulders are hella nice.  Next bird kill . . . mantle drops!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We have seen quite a few mantles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh... you're complaining about getting the haste rings? Don't look a gifthorse in the mouth. We'd kill for Mist to drop more Bands for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm waiting for our luck to run out.  So far we have about 50% total drop rate on PLATE molds on air avatars in the past 2 months.</div></div><hr />
