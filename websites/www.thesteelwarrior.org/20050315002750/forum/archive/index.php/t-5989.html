Can anyone more knowledgable on this trial shed some light on this for me?<br />
<br />
If they do have to be killed closely together, what kind of time frame are we looking at? Not looking for exact numbers, just a rough estimate like &quot;very short time&quot; or &quot;you have time to prepare between the two&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Around a minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure on the killing within a certain time frame, but I do know that a couple of days ago when we got a priest dead for first time we had to evac. Loaded back in with intention of medding a couple and going for other for us to get a zone emote about him ressing his comrade and lo the other priest respawned - I can check on time - tho it might just be if they are not agro for a set period they'll ress a dead one.<br />
<br />
Oh if you do have to evac and try again I'd take a bard - coz having to run into a room where you gonna get summoned right away isn't fun with out entire group being DA'd :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had an interesting evening of it last night. We got to the Priests and made them killable, but we didnt run into the summon thing though. We were in the right Priest room and starting applying a beatdown to him when the other Priest either felt left out, or wanted to know what was happening to his buddy, cause he came over to eat our cleric.<br />
<br />
We were trying creative ways of separating the two, but if the timer for killing both is that small, then theres really not much point in exploring that little avenue anymore.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never tried this myself though, if you can kill one and have a full party alive, you can probably kill the other one too.</div></div><hr />

We fought on but healers ran lom and we wiped. Once survivors left room the mob reset and went back to 11%. No idea why, any ideas at all? Like was said before about 3 mins after this the first one was 'rezzed'.<br />
<br />
Also, might be my imagination but damage seemed to get less as fight went on, does this make sense at all or did I imagine this? Any clues appreciated but this truely is fun event to play with.<br />

We haven't been able to win yet, but it appears that they priest life jumps to 100% when they leave their cubby area. As long as you keep em in the back, their life seems to stay put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are not forced to fight both at the same time.<br />
And you have something likz 60 seconds before REZ occurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it 60 seconds of no aggro or 60 seconds at all? My group is very under geared for this, I'm not even sure if we can kill one in 60 seconds.</div></div><hr />

They are temporarily at 100% when they leash, and if you engage them when they are 100% they don't get reset back down unfortunately.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly how the res thing works on them, there was one time where we killed one, backed out, res'd two or so people, got a bit of mana and went to try to kill the remaining one, it was well over a minute between when we killed the one and engaged the other.<br />
<br />
I would say though that the best way to do it is to fight both at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phal</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info on them resetting to 100%, really makes a lot of sense now.  To be fair we probably didnt take the right group to fight them at same time so I was trying to work out ways to fight them one by one. Seems the encounter might be better designed to go with a set group config but really would be nice to beat it with the group who have been working on these trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have roughly 10 minutes before the one you killed gets rezzed.  It seems to vary quite a bit, but it's definately longer than 1 minute.  I've usually tried killed one, then the other, but half the time we end up aggroing both anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrowsong</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just charge the right side priest and use 2 wiz to burn it down fast while keeping 1 MT up against both of them...once u get rid of 1 of them...tanking 1 would be easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are not forced to fight both at the same time.I tried this trial a little bit a while ago, and whenever we fought 1, the other would add. So can the add be faded/blurred then? I guess if you need to kill the 2nd within a minute if it's not aggro, need to get on him quick or even before the 1st is dead... if the timer isn't that bad atm it would really help as I'm thinking of trying these again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you aggroed the 2nd one, you're not set up far enough away from him.  Blurring it won't do any good since he'll just re-aggro you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrabler</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gone at Ikkinz 2 a few times and last night we got the 2nd boss to 0%.  Used this group makeup:  cleric, cleric, bard, ranger, monk, warrior.  We died the first time so on the 2nd go I had DA on me which worked very well for dragging them both into he same room to pop furious on.  The bard got LHA fairly early on and got crushed so I think having him up would have made it a win.<br />
<br />
Just to agree with everyone else hehe, they did res right at 10min after the first died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A group of 2 Warriors, 2 Clerics and 2 dps (Rogue + Bard is nice)  is ideal i think. Rogue pops dam discs early so one Priest dies quick. A cleric doing chain sup/holy-light on a defensive timeequipped tank can keep it up until one of the Priests is dead, then clerics can shift to CHs.<br />
<br />
Remember to be properly buffed (BSS, Focus, DS).<br />
<br />
Bard singing Veeshan + Warsong = 100 DS. On 2 unslowable mobs that each quad it adds up really nice.</div></div><hr />
