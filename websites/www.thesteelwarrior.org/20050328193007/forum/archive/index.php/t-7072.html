<br />
Where can I find a little ditty on how to get the Vadd's armor drops?  I have heard a bunch of rumors regarding which zone they come from, what targets need to be raided, and how much the components cost...<br />
<br />
is anyone talkin?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vadd's is the warrior armor set that is made from the drops in qvic.  It's similair to Elemental armor in that it has to be &quot;quested&quot; to be combined.  The armor is slightly better than the high quality potime gear, and the gloves have the effect &quot;Echo of Anger&quot; on them...mmmmmm so nice...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriously doubt it will.  They will just put a cap on the %'age for EoA.  For instance already having FT15, adding a FT3 item still nets you FT15.  Same with ATK cap and Regen cap etc.</div></div><hr />

Boots : 60ac 225hp +8 Accuraty (I still prefer the 52/190 2% shielding boots)<br />
Helm : 65ac 230hp 5% Shielding (HOLY SHIT ! bye bye Raex/Faerune)<br />
Gloves : 60ac 225hp +5 Avoidance EoAnger (Really Really nice even if they dont stack)<br />
Arms : 65ac 230hp 5% Spellshield (Nice arms)<br />
BP : 110ac 300hp 4% Shielding 4% Spellshield (Owns despite the useless effect)<br />
<br />
Overall a reasonably better than Raex set. <br />
Some pieces cant compete with Time/Inkkiz Loot which is sad.<br />
I doubt legs will be better than Jointed Scale Greaves.<br />
Nice charisma (1 buff slot opened). <br />
<br />
Something tells me Shielding &amp; Spellshield are gonna be vital later in GoD.<br />
Since 20% of each isnt so impossible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the bp --<br />
<br />
Vadd's bp, from what I've heard, is only mined, and is most likely a fake mine (or not an updated link).<br />
<br />
Compare the other pieces (bracer, say) with Raex, and you'll notice a significant increase (75hp increase from a 145hp bracer = 50%'ish)<br />
<br />
Now look at raex bp vs vadd bp: 50hp increase over 250hp = 20%?  I doubt it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now look at effects. Raex Gaunts = AoB, datamined Raex bp = clicky Avatar<br />
<br />
Vadd Gauntlets = EoA, datamined Vadd BP = crappy crit bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Re: HP/AC on god armor, its sorta fucked up, clerics get as much hp and ac as paladins and shm get as much HP, but i doub i'll get much sympathy here p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think increasingly in EQ at the highest level of the game, the inherent skill/stats of a player outweigh the comparative ac/hp.<br />
<br />
I mean, if a cleric has the same AC/HP as a Paladin, you still won't have the cleric tanking... the paladin's defense and avoidance skills like parry etc are WAY higher.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately to last through some of these fights its not just the tanks that need superb ac/hp to live -- everybody does. It's time for people to put their envy behind and come to grips with the fact that to survive some of this Gates content everybody needs to be extremely well equipped.<br />
<br />
For what its worth, the amount of spell shielding and shielding on Vadd's armor is scaring the snot out of me re: what's to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you define the zone?<br />
<br />
Is it like pre-nerfed fire (where 3 groups could take most minis that dropped EP, single group could still get what equal'ed tier2-3 loot)?  So 3 groups can get 2xQvic loot, and one group can get KT/Ikkinz raid style loot?</div></div><hr />

<br />
also, i doubt the vadd gloves and raex BP will stack, since precentage based focus effects dont stack, like nuke focus that increases damage%</div></div><hr />

Aside from the hp upgrade, the rest of the upgrade is marginal at best when comparing elemental, now compare the items to equivalent time items, and the upgrade isnt even worth taking for the most part.

<br />
What about the days when going from NToV to Ssra named loot...  I don't think that VT to Elemental should be the rule to this game but rather an exception.  You can't keep giving players 40+ hp upgrades in every slot every tier of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, gotta pony up the cash for the solvent for the combine.  I think its 10,499 exactly, not sure as i didnt get any pieces yet =)<br />
<br />
On the flip side, the zone was taken down for like 5 minutes earlier today, and the named spawns havent popped since, this happen for anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So just to recap on the BP; so far, only 5(?) guilds are in Qvic, where pieces necessary to the armor quests drop.

<br />
Yup apprently the repop time is like 5 hours now per mini (im not sure exactly) but when the zone went down on Tunare (I Assume across all servers) the first named did not pop until 12pm EST.  I was not online when the zone went down so if you can give a time it was taken down than there is your repop time give or take a little.<br />
<br />
I guess SoE figured 60 armor pieces + in 1 weekend drop for our guild was to much :) hehehe.  Thankfully I have most of the pieces I was interested in now.</div></div><hr />

It can't be that hard to take every loot dropper in the named and just have their respawn time increase by 8 times or whatever.</div></div><hr />

I dunno cant log on to check yet, hope not, wouldnt make sense though unless they replaced it with a totally different effect since each item has a % effect of something, either accuracy, avoidance, spell shield, shield etc.</div></div><hr />
