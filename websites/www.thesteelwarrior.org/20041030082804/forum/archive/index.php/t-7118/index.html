<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey i need help upgrading my gear please! my magelo is kinda screwed atm.<br />
<br />
currently for back slot im using a cloak of flames which i wont be using any longer cos it's my friends, and intended to replace this with a cloak of greater pernicity but then im left with no Haste item! so i was thinking of doing LDoN's Sro to get a Foul smelling gore belt and hasting that, or perhaps doing Nro and getting a royal attendant helmet and adding haste and 40hp aug onto it. Would this be a good setup or not? the stats and stuff are a little lower than helmet of rallos zek which i attended to use for helm but saw that the attendant armour had the augment slot oppurtunity..  and also im using Kingly boots of splendor atm, would a good upgrade be Bloodied Boots of Dark rites or once again do LDoN's and augment the attendant boots? the only downside to LDoN is all the points im going to have to accumalate. thanks for your help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rallos zek helm is miles above its nearest alternative among bazaar items. if you get the royal helm and aug it you will never be able to upgrade to the rallos. so id think twice before committing that route. then again if you get a haste helmet you can wear a heavy rubicite belt and 10ac aug that.<br />

ring of dreadful dreams with 33 haste with actually decent stats! this is what i wear and recommend over anything tradeable. dont forget ... many times you will have vallon buff which gets you up to the 100 percent haste cap with this ring anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would consider tribute haste as an option until you get a haste item you&quot;d wear for a long time</div></div><hr />
