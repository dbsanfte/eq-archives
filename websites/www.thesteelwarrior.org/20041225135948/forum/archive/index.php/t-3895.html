My skill lvl is 125 atm and Im a lvl 52 Warrior. I use it in every battle(espisially in the last 6 lvls) and have Yet to see it work at all!I try and keep a close watch for the message on it and its always said <br />
&quot;your attempt to disarm has Failed&quot; Is there a specific skill level or lvl when this starts working? is it a total random thing? does it depend on who your fighting?<br />
thanks all :)</div></div><hr />

It will cause them to drop their weapon on the ground.  Unfortunately you only get skill-ups against monsters using non-magical weapons also.<br />
<br />
Kobolds in solb and berserkers in OT use weapons that can be disarmed.  Haven't really been looking around for new monsters to disarm.  I think some of the LDoN weapons aren't magic, so they should be disarmable, although I haven't tried to see if it's better or not (some mobs will increase damage if you disarm them).</div></div><hr />

but if you really wanna pick a 3/45 1hs up off the ground rather then kill the mob for it, its what yer lookin for!</div></div><hr />

Now remember when you disarm certain mobs, their dps goes up so watch what you practice and use it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think its a totally retarded skill, it has close to no use since 90% of the mobs use magic weapons. Altho, on a duel, you do can disarm your oponent, so maybe thats its only use.</div></div><hr />

It's also funny if they're not paying attention while they're meleeing you and they end up punching you for a few rounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaluas</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm i think it gives hate... sometimes the mob turns to me after i pressed disarm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does not give a detectable amount of hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It gives a small amount of hate, and it wasnt so useless a few expansions ago when most everything used fine steel.  I still mash the key out of habit to gain what tiny bit of hate disarm generates.  Oh, and as was mentioned previously, if a mob is using a slow weapon and you disarm him, his dps will increase.  Figured that out after disarming a HG with a fine steel 2hander back in the day. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are links down at the bottom of this page to other threads about disarm that could help answer a few questions, just fyi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use it for the possiblity of the extra bit of hate it might generate.<br />
<br />
Best uses for it: <br />
<br />
-Disarming Seru guards who give a funny msg when you do.<br />
-Duels.  Just be careful to explain to the uninitiated that you don't have their weapon, it's in their bag somewhere.  I disarmed a druid friend after he'd gotten his epic recently and the poor guy panicked for a good 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disarm gives a tiny amount of hate if the mob is not aggrod on you.  After that, it doesn't give any aggro.  Varaho provided tests proving such, which I later confirmed.<br />
<br />
The only place disarm is really useful is PvP.  Nice doing it to a warrior or monk who was using a 2hander, especially if you have a damage shield.</div></div><hr />
