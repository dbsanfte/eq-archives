<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy all.  A friend and I want to see if we can, between the 2 of us, kill Vox and Naggy.  She currently 2 boxes, I currently only play 1 toon, but have been looking at getting a 2nd cpu as well *almost finished building a new CPU, so will have my current one for the 2nd box*.  Anyways, my question is this.  Have any of you ever seen any confirmed Vox/Naggy kills done by 2-4 toons?  Please, I really don't wanna hear the &quot;well that monk solo'd it&quot; story, as quite frankly I don't believe it happened.  So has anyone seen Vox and/or Naggy killed with 4 or less toons?  Right now, we're looking at her cleric and warrior alts, and my shammy alt.  What would be a good 4th toon.. bard, or dps, such as rogue or wizzy?  Maybe drop the cleric for another dps, and rely on shammy healing?  All the existing toons are pretty well twinked, with at least Skyshrine/cultural lvl gear or up, and all 4 will end up the same way.  Any suggestions here, or is that not even really possible?  <br />
<br />
Another question I have on the matter is AA's.   Each toon is going to have all of their applicable lvl 51 AA's.  But, something we were thinking about was levelling a couple of the toons up higher, such as say level 55.. get the nice lvl 55 AA's *CA3/CS3 for the warrior, for example*, and then get sacc'ed back to 52.  Anyone know if the AA's will be &quot;lost&quot; if that happens, or if they'll still be in effect?  Would really suck to put in all that time gaining extra levels that will just be thrown away, and a bunch of AA's that won't be in effect :p<br />
<br />
Anyways, just looking for some feedback here.  Any input is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

shammy healing at 52 isn't that hot, so i'd keep the cleric.<br />
should be a walk in the park with the team you have + any dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure your aa remain intact regardless of level.  just can't spend aa unless the right level.  I know you keep the title anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried this with my monk at 52 with pretty sick gear for his level had Seru arms, legs, AoW pants, random ssra and luclin loot. He got rocked =D so i brought a friends cleric and tank and barely won. Only thing that made it close to hard on Vox was fear, so buff up MR lots and should be very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to duo Naggy quite a bit with a deleveled Cleric and my old 52 war twink, My war had about 3400 unbuffed HP's at level 52, most important thing is to have high MR/FR so you don't eat AE and MR so you don't get feared and have cleric snacks for naggy. Cleric was fairly well geared had FT10, we were always fully raid/junk buffed so that always helps. Wasn't all that difficult really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cant really do it anymore since there fabled now and flurry like 2k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naggy and Vox were not changed to Fabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And also you're talking out of your ass because a 65 druid will get ported out as soon as he throws a heal.<br />
<br />
So, got any more you wanna cook up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you can use a higher level healer for Vox/Naggy. If your twink is decked enough to be doing this, all you need to do is bind right outside port out range. You don't actually get booted until the heal lands, so as soon as you get ported, gate back. Vox/Naggy were permacamped on my server by a good friend of mine who used his 52 monk/65 cleric to farm loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought you could not bind in dungeons. Is Permarfrost an exception?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thorvan</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can bind in most old world dungeons. Kunark was the one that brought that one about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both permafrost and sol b were bindable last I checked, and yes, you can duo them using a healer &gt; 52 bound there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">keane how could you not have heard the millions of stories out there of people who forgot to re bind after naggy raids outside of buff hall and get continuously eaten when they went back to bind</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
(Someone else had cleared them before we got there, no way to tell when /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest I never raided Naggy or Vox. I started playing just after Velious was released and I really wanted to but there were never any public raids that fit my schedule.<br />
<br />
But reading this brings back the stories I used to hear about raids bind rushing the two dragons and people getting caught in death loops.<br />
<br />
Ahh, the life of a caster :)</div></div><hr />

Yessir and a common tactic was to drop copper pieces on the ground so as you did the bind rush you would have something on your body so it did not poof.  Ahh how I miss dropping CP on the ground :)</div></div><hr />
