Don't pull that crap with me, you'll get your answer better in TSW compared to the 6 same people that AFK in SW =D<br />
<br />
We also have MoTD//Banbot (soon)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People really give serverwide.TSW more shit then it deserves. It's far from the cesspool of warriors, that some warriors make it out to be.<br />
<br />
It's very rare that a question goes unanswered there. Even with the advent of things like lucy-link-bot, people are still asking for links and getting links in return.<br />
 <br />
If you have a question about an item, it will most likely be answered. If you have a question about a mob, it will most likely be answered. If you have a gear issue, it will most likely be answered.  If you are on the topmost of content, then your question may not be answered, but there's still a decent chance.<br />
<br />
It's more then a chat for strats, leet items, etc, etc, it's a community.  A cheering section, a place to be congratulated when warrior goals are achieved (DBoTW, ep access whatever).  Have fun predicting loot, or just hanging out and getting to know people.<br />
<br />

/join serverwide.thesteelwarrior:thesteelwarrior next time you log in, and join the community !<br />

(please note: asking retarded questions like &quot;8 ac bracelet, vs this 10int bracelet&quot; will get you flamed.)</div></div><hr />

Yeh, we all know the 10int is better for warrior mana, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Some people just don't like the fucking idiocy of the mainstream population.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but after the 400th time I heard &quot;Ding XX&quot; where XX is some level other than 50/60/65 (depending on expansion), I stopped giving a flying fuck.  Likewise for anyone who's happy they got a piece of loot that's not anything new.  I'm happy that you're happy, but don't expect a fucking pat on the back for doing normal shit, and stop soliciting for it.</div></div><hr />
