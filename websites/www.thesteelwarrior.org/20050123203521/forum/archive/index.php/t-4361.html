I was grouped with a guildie sk who had aggro at the time, proc went off and was resisted. The mob turned to me despite the resist without me taunting. Im  -guessing-  the aggro portion is intact on a resist but i wanted to be sure.</div></div><hr />

If red epic procs, then the agro still goes through even if the DD is resisted.  I'm pretty sure hate from procs is unresistable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the hate is unresistable due to the fact resist or not all spells/items generate the same innate hate (not factoring in dmg done)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id have to disagree here.  If red epic proc is resisted then it is resisted, the hate does not transfer.  <br />
<br />
This is different then stuns and slows being resisted.<br />
<br />
The proc on the Copper Hammer has a DD and a stun, it is resisted (both stun and the DD) post 55 mobs but the resist factor on the stun is what generates the agro.  <br />
<br />
Mobs don't like being tried to be slowed or stunned, they don't give a damn wether you tried to proc a resisted hate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never noticed any additional aggro when my Red Epic is resisted.  And that is why it went into the bank before my blue epic :-/ <br />
<br />
Who'da thunk it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynlore</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed increased aggro even when the effect is resisted.  I may not understand it right, be even if a caster's spell is resisted, it still draws an amount of aggro related to the spell ability and level of the caster.<br />
<br />
  I'm sure the same holds true for the warrior epic as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its hard to say. Obviously theres 2 different ways to apply aggro.<br />
Most spells don't have an internal aggro effect that you can see with lucy. Obviously they still aggro, and its fairly easy to see that they still do full aggro even when resisted. So, weapons like SoD do full aggro when resisted.<br />
<br />
But what about when a spell has an internal aggro adjustment? Like EB, Jolt, Concussion, Red Epic proc, etc.  Do they have some external aggro factor in addition to the internal one? Is the internal one just a dummy? No other spell has any of its internal effects work when they are resisted, yet most tests show that for example Concussion works just fine when its resisted.<br />
<br />
But if aggro is not related to resist, then why is EB unresistable and other direct aggro effects aren't? Why do rangers get 2 IDENTICAL jolt spells on different resist checks?<br />
<br />
Who knows.</div></div><hr />
