<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest a one groupable mask with decent HP and AC?  I would like to get something from the newer zones, more fun to camp with xp.  My mask is my weakest piece of gear right now but I've kept it for the haste.  I'm planning on either grabbing a haste belt from the sewers or possibly the haste cloak from a Hard LDoN in EF.  Hell, I might even just use tribute for haste, but I need to ditch this mask cause it lacks.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.<br />

maybe killing her every week yields you that mask</div></div><hr />

It's in my magelo if you'd like to see it. Subtract the 25hp aug though for the stats.</div></div><hr />

Drops off trash in MPG, fairly rare but a damn fine mask. You should be able to tank MPG, although it would be hard for you to find a group there. I would suggest bringing your own )</div></div><hr />

You sure about that? His magello has him at CA2 CS2 and obviously no ID or LR... could be un-updated buuut...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, he has 6.3k unbuffed, but his AC is quite low.<br />
<br />
I doubt he could really do the pickup thing in MPG, but with a group of people that he knew and played well with they could probably manage alright.</div></div><hr />

Only random drop i have seen was my ring (off a noc near zone in).</div></div><hr />

It was just chance that it dropped off Blind Hunter. It is a random trash drop, and Blind Hunter just happened to be the random trash who spawned with it.<br />

These masks are pretty darn rare. I wouldn't make it a goal to get one. If it drops great, but it is just too rare to &quot;camp.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Drops from Lcea Katta, 1-groupable mob.  I think the mask is pretty rare tho.<br />
<br />
Plus it hurts your Katta faction (if you plan on doing Sigil Earring quest, tho I'm not sure how hard it would be to correct - probably not hard, farming all those damn reports and killing the praesertums and seru...)<br />

Someone already suggested, but the easiest way to upgrade would be to farm the GoD Sewer trial for the stonemite carapace mask...  Just take a tracker with you, get expedition, send tracker in for named... if no named or too far away to bother with, leave expedition and try again.  You could also get an upgrade to your arm slot... pitted vambraces.</div></div><hr />

Never saw it in 10+ kills</div></div><hr />
