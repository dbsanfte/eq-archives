<br />
For example the sparkling shortsword 14/18 with 4magic dmg .<br />
<br />
Is this weapon ratio 18/18 on any non magic immune mob and 14/18 for immune magic mobs ?<br />
<br />
Or is there some kind of magic resistance check for every swing you make ? or something else  ?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

So with the weapon you mentioned, it could be 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 damage, depending on if the mob resists.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understood it, damage bonus like magic +4 are (after resist checks) added *after* your damage roll, so your example would make it a 14/18 +4 weapon, wheras bane damage modifiers are added to the ratio itself... so a 14/18 sword with +4 Bane damage Undead would be a 18/18 sword vs undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hussar had it right.  Extensive parsing has shown damage histograms with characteristic &quot;magic number&quot; spikes for each possible weapon damage number.  <br />
<br />
If it worked the other way (just adding 4 to the end) then it would simply shift the curve over, and that isn't what parsing reveals.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the difference is with &quot;bane&quot; weapons (I always assumed that with a bane weapon the extra damage was just unresistable... but until very recently I never had one to test it with).  However, I am positive that +magic/fire/cold/disease damage weapons work exactly as Hussar described.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm could be the difference being that Bane is unresistable then, i'll buy that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocaly</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a sparkling short sword and get 120 as a max hit with it.  I would assume that the roll for magic happens before damage roll since it obviously calculates with the damage bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is true.  When I used an Axe of the Warmaster (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=7388) which is 12 damage +3 magic, in exp groups, the max hit with the axe was the same as my BoC which was just plain 15 damage.  I'm guessing that after a successful hit roll, a check is made against the mob's MR to determine whether you hit with a 12, 13, 14, or 15 damage weapon and then the actual damage is calculated based on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elemental DMG and Bane DMG are added to the weapons base damage. Bane DMG is unresistable, Elemental DMG is.<br />
<br />
Dmg Bonus is added onto the end.<br />
<br />
With a Axe of the Warmaster as Brutul mentioned (at level 60) you would have a 12+3/20 +11 weapon. The +3 comes from the Magic DMG and the +11 is from the Dmg Bonus. On any given swing, the weapon could be 12/20, 13/20, 14/20, or 15/20, depending on MoB resists.</div></div><hr />
