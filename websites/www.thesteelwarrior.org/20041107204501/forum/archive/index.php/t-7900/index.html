May you and me be in each others hearts and souls from now and into the endless days of this world, not even death will take you away from me,<br />
I love you wil every thing in my heart, now and forever, I will be true to you till the day this earth ends,<br />
Now lets us take hand in hand and walk done the paths set before us one step at a time in harmony,<br />
My life wouldn't be a life with out you my love, I would cross the endless world and what ever crossed my path to you,<br />
Please my love, let us be true to each other for now and ever, I will love you with the deepest heart.<br />
I love you now and forever, nothing can take that away from me, I love you,<br />
I mean it I love you hun and no a thing in this cruel world take that way from me or you, not even the pain of death, even the darkest of times I love you.<br />
Please take my hand and walk down this path, one step at a time, I will be your protecter now and even the plane of death that would try to take me away from you.<br />
I love you even when I'm sleeping I can't get your mind off you, even when the crapest of all days comes I will love you as true as my heart can take it.<br />
Please I love you and I wish to hear those words from you, I love you now and forever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mistersparkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">honestly i got bored after 3 lines so i wont rate it. its not that it sucked. its that i was expecting a poem about warriors  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WTF is this piece of crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to admit, if I were looking for some literary input on a poem I wrote about love, it would never occur to me to come TSW. <br />
<br />
Sure, all of us are sensitive, thoughtful people who have heard about the concept of love while waiting for raid buffs (I &quot;love&quot; Fo7!),  but there aren't many of us who dwell too much on meter and rhyme and stuff ...<br />
<br />
You're a brave man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your like an irish black islamic man walking into the middle of a redneck trailer park in south texas..... you are brave :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got kind of a stalker vibe from it.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of misspellings and grammatical errors. I also think you've got too much about love, especially when the last line seems to indicate this person doesnt 'love' you back. It's got the naivety of someone who's heart hasn't been broken. When you're in love with someone it doesn't need to be stated every sentence. You don't have to declare it like that -- it's overbearing.<br />
<br />
Also, you repeat the idea of 'now and forever' a few too many times - kinda creepy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You're more patient than I am, Raaj. <br />
<br />
I read the first line and gagged. The grammar of the second line pissed me off. I got 3 words into the 3rd line and hit &quot;Post Quick Reply&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now I'm watching the responses because I'm so astounded that somebody actually posted a poem here.<br />
<br />
Wow.</div></div><hr />

I got this feeling too.. kind of chilling :-/ Ive had some experience with people saying these sorts of things to me when they were really desperate.</div></div><hr />

This line moved my soul...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Careful man, this sounds like something that could be used to establish your state of mind in a murder trial.  You know, after they finally find her badly decade body buried under you house so you could always be close to your love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">although i rated it highly its only because if you wrote this to your sweetheart she probably teary eyed over it. what it lacks in poetic style it makes up for in determination and courage.<br />
<br />
posting it on tsw was also courageous. most of the guys on this board who are married probably had to have their girlfriends propose to THEM. and then their answers were probably something like &quot;um... sure&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're already dating the chick then she'll probably appreciate the heart felt gesture.  <br />
<br />
If its for someone you want to ask out or to win back an ex or something then bag it.  Its got that creepy stalker obsessed and desperate feel to it.<br />
<br />
If it arrived on my desk annonymously in a scented envelope with a heart shaped sticker on the front and I was a chick I'd prolly go home sick and not leave the house for a week.  <br />
<br />
Seeing as Im not a chick though it'd actually get passed round the lad's at work and we'd all have a good laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's my own haiku:<br />
<br />
/rs I am attacking (  %T   )==ASSIST ME NOW!!!<br />
/rs I am the MA!!!  HEAL ME!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can't get your mind off you!<br />
<br />
this struck me as funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Althought reading the poem gave me diarhea and and a facial tick, I'm enjoying the different criticisms you all have to offer. For me, this is about as scary as they come... &quot;not even death will take you away from me&quot;.  Someones gonna end up in the trunk of this guys car.</div></div><hr />
