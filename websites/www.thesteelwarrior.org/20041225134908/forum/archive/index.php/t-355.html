I almost always group with 4 or 5 of the following:  57 Necro, 55 Druid, 55 Magician or 60 Cleric (same acct), 55 Enchie, 57 Beastlord, or 52 Shammy.  We've been grouping together for months and we have our tactics down pretty well - so we can handle mobs that are often difficult for a grp of our lvl (plus, the 60 cleric was in a semi-uber guild for a couple years and knows how to fight the tough mobs ;) )  I expect to stay in PoP until close to 60, with occasional trips to Kael hoping for armor drops.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of the following upgrades, but I'm open to suggestions:<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle (20k)<br />
Earring of the Solstice (6k)<br />
2 Valorium Gallantry Rings (10k each)<br />
Mosquito Earring (24k)<br />
<br />
That's actually a bit over my budget, but I can earn the extra plat over the next month while I shop for good prices.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wear a pair of the Valorium rings, and they are awesome. Let's not forget that they give you decent AC for rings, they have +8 to all 4 major melee stats, AND 65 HP.... You just can't beat that in tradable rings in that price range...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When upgrading I usually put my want list in order due relative upgrade compared to the price.  For me a few of my upgrades were clattering bone necklace, cloak of the maelstrom, and valoriums rings.  I mainly just wanted to buff up my hp so when I ranked the things in order of want it went mainly clattering neck, cloak and then valorium rings last just because 6/65 are easily available so like the other poster said above it's only 8sta then per ring while upgrading my hp-less neck(glimmering mithril) and back slot benefited more for a lesser price.  If I were you I'd personally wait on the valorium rings cause it takes out a decent chunk of your money and use it instead to buy SS MQ's.  On my server at least you bracer/gloves/boots/vambraces all for 5kpp a piece.  I guess it's mainly server dependent though, but I know at least with my guild, you could find deals cause when we switched from CoV to giant faction we basically cleared out our bank of uneeded SS pieces, nice way to buy some stuff for a good price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I forgot to mention...I'm trying to get to 1200 ac by lvl 55...which is why I was thinking of the rubicite girdle (12 more raw ac than my current belt.)  The reasons for this are;  (1) it's taking about 2 weeks per lvl in PoP now, so getting to 60 will take awhile - not even thinking about 65 yet...:( , (2) once I hit 55 I plan to go 90/10 or 80/20 AA so levelling'll probably slow down even more then, and (3) I hear 1200 is a significant ac lvl...after I get that I was planning to go for hp over ac.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like the right approach?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont bother with splitting percentage experience, its a waste of time IMO. get run3 if you want, then just level to 60/61 then do 100 aaxp.<br />
<br />
you want the levels because tanking at 55 can be hard in pop and the experience at 60 is much better than say at 59.<br />
<br />
1200 is a good goal to aim for. thats what mine is at atm and i have no major problems with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toga</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get some Black Sapphire Earrings for the HP - roughly 400pp each<br />
Get a better shoulder slot , quest the draconic pauldrons, easy.<br />
Buy a Clattering Bone Neck - 4k or so, cheap.<br />
Replace Cobalt with a Silver Chitin Bracer - 5k.<br />
Quest the Eyepatch of Plunder, easy for 1 group to do, Free.<br />
Buy ANY boots/arms/gauntlets that have &gt;30 HP and you can afford.<br />
Get the Rubicite Girdle, major upgrade.<br />
<br />
Do NOT put on AA XP , it's a waste of time in the low 50's.<br />
HP &gt; AC for XP grinds. If you're not raiding and getting smacked on by level 65 mobs you'll do fine with any AC over 1000.<br />
Your LEVELS will improve your AC drastically, don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />
