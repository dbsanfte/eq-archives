<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think you have a couple of choices.<br />
First, if you're new to the game, or even new to melee classes, i'd do at least a few newbie armor quests. the armor's okay until lvl 20ish, but better than that you'll start to get a feel for the advantages and disadvantages of the class.<br />
The other thing to do is get some crustacean armor, which is good/standard gear for warriors and will last a good while. Look for those pieces (couple hundred plat per item, I would think) in the bazaar, and then do various searches by class/race/diety to see what else is out there for a similar price. Use crafted/crusty as a baseline, but get the best bang for the buck. Sometimes there's frosted or sandblasted armor around too that is roughly equivalent, but make sure you're buying a size that will fit you.<br />
Look for AC, STA &amp; hitpoints in your armor. Other stats will come later, but these are always good things to have.<br />
The Centi short sword is a pretty good warrior weapon early on &amp; none of the centi stuff has level restrictions, as far as I know.<br />
If you can find a bow with 150 or better range, that will do you for a good long time (basically until you start looking for stats in the range slot).<br />
Don't know what your capacity to raise plat is (on other characters) but if it's limited, this stuff will give you a decent start and should be in your stated budget. And, even if you have tons of potential plat, this stuff will allow you to do your job as a warrior for 30 levels or so, and by that time you'll hav fallen into some upgrades.<br />
Also note it's been a while since I leveled a new warrior, and my advice is free, and as with so many things, you're kinda gettin what ya pay for here, heh.<br />
