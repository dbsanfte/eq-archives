<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dorkaAB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know its early ...<br />
<br />
But does any have experience with adding a proc augment in a weapon which allready got a proc?<br />
<br />
Would like to hear some experiences with this :)<br />
<br />
Lets say you mount a lifedrain augment in a Blade of Carnage, does it then :<br />
<br />
1. Add a chance for a an additional life drain proc to go off random, with the Enraging blow also proccing random.<br />
<br />
2. Add a lifedrain proc that procs with the Enranging Blow<br />
<br />
3. &quot;Overwrite&quot; the Enraging Blow proc, so it will only proc the lifedrain - and the only way to get enraging blow to proc again, is to remove the augment.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows ... please share your experiences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Absor has stated that an augmentation proc won't overwrite an existing proc on a weapon.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering which proc aug would be better to add to say, a Blade of War, Anger III (+300 hate) or Force of Ykesha (125dd 0.0 sec stun, MR based).<br />
<br />
Using Call of Sky all the time with my BoW atm, and I'm pretty curious about it will stack with an augmentation, meaning I can possibly have 3 procs on one single weapon.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's too early to experiment with augmentations if they can't be undone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get an NDT and you've got a fourth :p<br />
<br />
Ok, all you people that prolly know a lot more than me. Lets see what is the most number of procs we can get.<br />
<br />
Ok, I see<br />
Dual Wield 2 proccing weapons.... 2 procs<br />
Augment each with another proc.... 2 procs<br />
NDT 1 proc.... 1 proc<br />
Call of Sky 1 proc.... 1 proc<br />
<br />
Cool, go into combat with 6 active procs :)<br />
<br />
Note: not sure if CoS stacks with NDT<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty sure you can only have 1 buff proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dorkaAB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know that rogue PoP poison doesnt stack with NDT, mostlikely because they both take a buff slot.<br />
<br />
So if they appli a poison and get NDT afterwards, its only the lifedrain proc that procs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am thinking that the force of ykesha will be more agro than 300 hate.  Plus its a DD so it would be more DPS too</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can be undone but you will loose the augmentation effect permanently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I now have Heated Blade(50hp dd) on my Bloodfrenzy, too soon to tell if I am getting more bang for the buck though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another thing I'd like to know is which of the following is true:<br />
<br />
1. The augmented proc goes off at the same time as the built-in proc so the typical net effect is an increase in DD/dps<br />
<br />
2. The augmented proc goes off separate from the built-in proc so the net effect is not only an increase in DD DPS but also in hate.<br />
<br />
If 1 is true, I would think +300 hate would be the way to go. If 2 is true, I would think 125 DD with 0.0 stun is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think 2 procs can go off on the same swing.  I think adding the 2nd proc just adds a chance for it to proc, if the first proc doesn't fire, on every swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So far the procs have been independent of eachother. I am sure they could both proc in the same round though, have had EB proc of BF twice in one round quite a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Are you sure it wasn't from double attack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Agaroo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone find any hate augments other than the Anger # line?<br />
<br />
Anger I (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4392&amp;source=Live) <br />
Anger II (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4393&amp;source=Live)<br />
Anger III (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4394&amp;source=Live)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zebedi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I added Ryjorkian Mist (75dd poison based) to my Hategiver (EB)<br />
<br />
Some facts:<br />
They both proc, independantly of each other.<br />
Proc rate on EB wasn't noticeably changed.<br />
The 75dd proc rate seemed to be the same as the EB proc rate.<br />
<br />
Some speculation:<br />
We know that certain weapons have a higher proc% than others. A Hategiver will be more likely to proc EB than a BoC. The fact that the 75dd proc I added to my hategiver was going off aproximately the same number of times per fight as EB leads me to believe that the proc rate on the WEAPON determines the number of procs for the Augment.<br />
<br />
This would suggest that if you add a proc augment to a high frequency proccing weapon, that you'll get more bang for your buck than a lower frequency weapon. <br />
<br />
We'll know for sure when some cleric adds a proc to a Zek hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you check another post about the cleric Zek hammers, they have tried this, and the augment procs ALOT slower than the innate proc of the hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zebedi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Lens,<br />
<br />
Now we know that Ryjorkian Mist just happens to have nearly the same proc rate as a Hategiver.<br />
<br />
I dared to dream ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Has anyone shown that the hategiver procs more than a BoC?  I don't think it does.</div></div><hr />
