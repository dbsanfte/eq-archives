Just be glad you got the oppertunity to work with them and that you enjoyed it. My last year or so at Best Buy turned into a joy ride of flaming death until I finally had enough. The best thing about retail is the people you meet, the worst thing is all the rest of the people :D</div></div><hr />

Sometimes in life you have to move past what is comfortable for new and better opportunities.  I realize you have met some very nice people in your current job but I think they will be very happy for you.  If you cannot see yourself staying in your current job forever, then I would suggest taking the new opportunity that has presented itself.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I am confident that everything will work out for you.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Still waiting to see the pictures from your spray painting adventures *grins*</div></div><hr />
