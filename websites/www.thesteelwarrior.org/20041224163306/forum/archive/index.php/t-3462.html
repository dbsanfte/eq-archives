 Propaganda (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=578.topic) <br />
<br />
This part, though, is easily the most spin since 78's.<br />

 Knights have enough hitpoints and AC to realistically &quot;add-tank&quot;. There is one encounter in the plane of time that may have been designed by SOE for hybrids, but many guilds found a way to use Warriors on that encounter anyways. In small groups, Paladins and Shadowknights now bring more to the table than they did during CKaV. They offer &quot;acceptable&quot; tanking skills with one added benefit (SHD's add the benefit of tremendous aggro, and PAL's offer the benefit of decent support healing). If the healers have good mana regeneration and can afford to spend the extra mana healing a Pal/Shd then a small group will gain more from the Pal/Shd than they would with the Warrior. Currently in a 65th level, LDON normal mode adventure where the cleric (or alternate healers) have VOQ or KEI, most groups if given a choice of the 3-Tank classes would pick Paladin or Shadowknight. This isn't imbalanced in and of itself, its just a trade-off that most people at the moment will make. <br />

Any poster to brings up Thott's &quot;Hybrid Problem&quot; immediately loses credibility with me. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior Advantages (when compared to Knights) Summarized:<br />
------------------------------<br />
12 percent higher hps than Knights in similar gear.<br />
Disc Defensive scales up with more difficult encounters.<br />
The advantage of high hitpoints scales up with disc defensive.<br />
Warriors do not need to make &quot;sacrifices&quot; in gear to gain FT, Focuses, or other Magic Related things.<br />
Warriors get the most from their AA points. (Covered in Thott's Article, &quot;The Hybrid Problem&quot;)<br />
Warriors will always be the class that gets to stand toe to toe with the highest encounters.<br />
Warriors will always have at least 20 percent more melee dps than a Knight with the same weapon due to skill caps.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Um yeah,  Paladin's/sk don't have to make NEARLY as much of a sacrafice aas they used to to get the nifty effect on items..... lemme see,  Click me!!!! (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12456)   Anyone remember this?   Apparently this paladin... or SK ::Shrug:: completely forgot that almost half his gear has mana/hp/some nifty caster effect,  and it also says WAR on it.<br />
<br />
And how often do you see a paladin wielding a mithrill edged short sword?  or a BoC for that matter?   You don't you see them wielding the 30/24's ect that VI put in the game for them,  so yeah, our off-hand add's 20% more DPS..... your point?   I know I sure as hell don't duel wield on raids,  if I did I'd take 20% more dmg :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
