<br />
Does anyone have any factual information on the state of EQ, or online games in general?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sony and the upper management have made plenty.  The GMs, guides and support people barely make enough to buy food.  Not sure about the devs, but it can't be too much, it's certainly a lot less than I make ;P<br />
<br />
It's also almost certain that a large part of the EQ profits go to finance other SoE games...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what is the total of accounts like 400,000 worldwide? (might be way off here)<br />
<br />
400,000X13.00=5,200,000.00 a month  <br />
5,200,000.00X12=62,400,000.00 a year<br />
<br />
Price to keep EQ running for a year I say atleast 6 million.<br />
So they are making 56,400,000.00 a year profit on the game.<br />
<br />
This doesn't include game sales just monthly subscription costs</div></div><hr />

Insurance for employee's etc etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
see how they would take to investing in their company if applicable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they weren't turning a viable profit you wouldn't see any more expansions, and the game would be left on auto-pilot until the subscriptions were so low that it started to lose money. Then they would pull the plug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macbrea</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Their cost might be alittle higher then you think.  Lets assume that each server has a T-3. Because, that would allow 3500 players to play on the server at one time.  This has been stated as the optimal number before and is obviously the way they set up their servers from SWG.   There are 50 servers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Working in the Telecom industry, we charge 15k per month for a T-3.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, doing some very simple math:  $15,000 x 50 servers = 750,000 per month x 12 months = $9,000,000 just in cost of connection per year. <br />
<br />
So, I would make a rough guess they make about 1/3 of that money you listed in profit. But, you could check the financials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scott Hartsman stated at the vegas fan faire that the fan faires themselves were profitable for Sony, through registration fees and merchandise sales.   While this was not the case for the first several fan faires, in his words &quot;after about the first 3&quot; they became profitable.<br />
<br />
As for the cost of running EQ...  While indeed your company may charge 15k monthly per T3 line, they would also give a sizeable discount to any customer who required 50 of them.  In fact, given the size of Sony/SOE, I wouldn't be surprised if they would start their own company to provide them with this service.  When you have a guaranteed customer buying services in the millions of dollars each year, it would make sense.<br />
<br />
While a lot of the MMORPG's may indeed be in the hole,  Everquest definitely isn't of them.  And I think it may be a bit tough to check the financial statements Macbrea, as from what I remember hearing, SOE is simply a division of Sony Inc, and not listed as it's own company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there was a column not too long back with the president of SoE being interviewed that showed that SoE was making millions in profits off of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just played golf with the CFO of Sony Pictures a couple months ago. (Randomly, didn't find out till the 13th hole or something ha ha)<br />
<br />
p.s. EQ makes money :)</div></div><hr />
