<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the graphic on this sword? It's a 14/19 from South Ro camp for 1150, could aug it to make it 16/19 with ykesha maybe. Still not sure if it's worth the points though. Of course, if it looks really nice it would certainly make a decent weapon.  I have the points for it right now, along with a ykesha or anger 3, and tempted to buy it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>albyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice Blade, would like input from other wars, <br />
<br />
Would it be better to save up the pts for the curse-smelted blade, get it fully augmented and add anger3 or just add an anger3 augment to my SOTB?<br />
<br />
Currently I'm DWing BOC in primary and SOTB in Offhand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't imagine it bieng more aggro then a weapon with a proc on it aug'd with anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ranger sword.... just like the split blade should be ranger only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd consider Aug3 on the CHoS, and possibly replacing the SotB with the +2 dam augmented Guk Sword, if you want a strong off-hand weapon.<br />
<br />
I was disappointed with the performance of the SotB in my off-hand.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder if GSoT + Anger3 is better than all of the above however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahz and I have spoken about this weapon and The Club of the Mad Researcher from EF in PM extensively.  Adding an Anger 3 or Ykesha augment plus the 2 dmg modifier would make either of them very good weapons in my opinion.  I personally am working toward the club since I could make it a 17/20 weapon with the plus 2 damage, Anger 3 plus the 8 str 8 dex modifier for the slot 1 augment.  Anyone have any opinions as to that set up, should I put something else in the slot 1 or keep it as is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gleb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't get why anyone would want the CSLB over the club, unless you already have the club, that is ;)</div></div><hr />

8ac and a slighty faster swing makes CSLB &gt; CMR, especially in the on-hand, though they are quite similar.  It would be hard to parse the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gleb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll take the CMR over the CSLB any day.  17 20 &gt; 16 19.  Since no weapon can get below 10 delay... 17/10 &gt; 16/10.  AC means nothing if you cannot get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you'll be hard pressed to land the max hit more often to make make up the extra damage, or you'd need a LOT of extra attack. the 17 over 16 is only better if you land max hits. if i recall right, the extra 1 damage factoring into the (theoritical)damage formula wont make a massive differance on the adverage hit with a base of 17 over 16 either. the slight advantage of speed will serve better most of the time, even tho it's only a 0.1 second increase in speed you're doing the adverage hit more often.<br />
also, i believe the min 10 delay thing was proven false in a phrase. i think it was something like the EQlog only clocks by the second and not 10ths of a second that wepons swings are caculated by. so if a weapon was fast enough it would have multible hits clocking in the same time stamp. i think the breaking point of the delay was supose to be multible hits in the same 100ths of a second. which is why they dont make weapons with a delay under 17. i know there are a few weapons with a lower delay, the min i saw on one that still drops is 15, but those weapons are limited to classes, unlike the moss covered twig that was open to every melee class, if not all all. <br />
<br />
anyhoo, in closing, it should really be your personal perferance. both factors are so small the weapons would need some serious phrasing to show any differance in DPS. it would really come down to your perferance in stats. and if your still undicisive, you might as well go with the weapon that has the better graphic.<br />
<br />
how many points are these weapons anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since no weapon can get below 10 delay<br />
This is a common misconception. Weapon delay can indeed go below 10. The myth stems from the fact that log timestamps only have a 1 second resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zynth,<br />
<br />
CSLB is 1150 pts in Guk.<br />
<br />
CMR is 1150 pts in Miragul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was the easiest to see back when Moss Covered Twig was the best weapon in the game.  Parse yourself with and without haste while using it.  If you get more swings with haste then you're below 10 delay...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, i just fully augmented it. Now it's a 16/19 with ykesha. About to see how it works. So far the 14/19 with ykesha has been decent.<br />
Of course i'm doing this mostly for DPS, my main hand is a BoC with anger 3 and i have no problems with aggro. But this should provide even more aggro, so can't complain :)<br />
I'll try mainhanding this over the BoC for DPS in exp groups and see how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've put this in mainhand and did a few adventures. Still no aggro problems, more dps...me like :)<br />
Of course on raids BoC with anger 3 in mainhand would be much better but for exp groups this works nice. This took 3k adventure points though :P</div></div><hr />
