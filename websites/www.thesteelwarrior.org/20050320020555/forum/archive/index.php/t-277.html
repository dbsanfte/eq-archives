<br />
the cleric is botted by me<br />
<br />
How will this group hold up at say 53+?<br />
<br />
Right now I am 49, the chanter is 45 and the cleric is 53.<br />
<br />
The cleric is out of the group right now to allow me and the chanter to catch up<br />
<br />
I will be 50 this weekend. Any suggestions as to if this group will last?<br />
<br />
My other options for a botted healer are a 44 shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That group will work fine.  While people now accept that groups can be different and not require those 3, that doesn't mean that those 3 don't make a good group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a sham is always really useful to have, if possible keep the sham levelled within a few levels of your warrior and cleric so you can use him on a situational basis. however, i see no reason why you cant stick with the current setup you have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I swear I dont know how you guys farm dungeons, it has been one headache after another for me in dungeons<br />
<br />
Like seb, that place is always crowded as hell, and I cant get anywhere with getting massive agro <br />
<br />
Would like to try velks, but I dont know velks at all<br />
<br />
Karnors, the front is always camped<br />
<br />
I just suck in dungeons I always get lost and its just brutal.<br />
<br />
Im an outdoor zone kinda person.</div></div><hr />

Ya get more buffs (lesser haste, but still its icon haste), and the extra healing in a pinch is bonus.  Root parking for crowd control generally works in a pinch.  Depending on gear, and the zone's you're xp'ing in, you should be able to take this trio all the way to 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops i replied in the wrong thread lol i will cut and paste here<br />
<br />
thanks for the responses<br />
<br />
heh i have levelled to 51 already with the cleric chanter combo so all is good so far <br />
<br />
the combo is highly lethal<br />
<br />
we have the ability to add a shaman friend every now and then but we are doing ok for now.<br />
<br />
much rather have my rogue buddy join<br />
<br />
chanter provides us with mana and haste and slow as well as a wealth of other talents, I would rather have her in the group right now. We let the shaman slow if he joins the party. With my new gear this weekend (guard captains mallet etc etc) i am having little trouble maintaining agro so we are set on cruise control<br />
<br />
basically at this point, and I know she cant do this later, she single pulls and lines the mobs up for me to totally destroy <br />
<br />
and she has a new haste coming up<br />
<br />
I love chanters <br />
<br />
&quot;Then healing is just there to reduce downtime and you are looking entirely at their secondary powers&quot;<br />
<br />
Correct, and when chanter hits 54 we already have bought Clarity 2 and the cleric will be even happier. AS it is right now the cleric is ssitting so much that she is nuking to finish the mobs<br />
<br />
All of our strategies will change later of course when we play with the big boy mobs but at this point I would not swap the cleric out for anything. We can add a 51 ranger also to our group so im not worried about that.<br />
<br />
Can also add a shaman friend each night but right now his XP take is only slowing us down, we get more XP in the 3 group and kill just as fast. I will be 51 tonight.<br />
<br />
For me its all about the sweet mez, root park, the haste that is uber, (and we still get a slow) my DPS and the sweet cleric buffs and finishing nukes plus at level 54 free crack 2 to the cleric.<br />
<br />
At our levels, leaving the cleric and adding my 44 shaman just doesnt cut it. Their heals really suck lol. We will just add a shaman friend later and besides once the cleric hits 56 the free rezzing will be great. I dont like to shout for rez and pay off others to get a 96% rez. I'll do it myself  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my group now is 61 war (me) 62 cleric, 61 enchanter and 62 shamman.  We flew through the 50s but 60+ the low dps realy starts to make most fights insanely dificult.  Our DPS isn't terrible, a few levels ago we did do the PoJ trials with the shammy in the group so it isn't that bad.  But as soon as you hit the harder mobs of tier 1 and anything in tier 2 you will find that your lack of DPS makes the groups boring.  This is where you make more friends, rogues, necros, mages, wizzies, and some monks can realy fill in a nice 5th/6th spot.  <br />
<br />
It all depends on where you want to go.  We now have a long friends list of all these classes and while tier 2 is still hard to tank as a 61 warrior with 5600/1200 group only buffed hp/ac (as in we don't run around finding buffs outside the group) it is doable.  This is farther then you are realy looking though.<br />
<br />
Try the Hobgoblin camp in PoN.  That seems to be the tier 1 litmus test.  Yes there are tougher mobs and harder 1 group encounters then that in tier 1, but if you can constently pull that camp, with the occasional add (unmezzable unrootable) without trying to hard then you are doing ok.  If not, you need to rethink your group.  There are dozens of options concerning who you can add to make the group work.  For a while when the enchanter and shaman couldn't play I was doign a 2 cleric, necro, mage, bard, and me group; just stacking damage shields and letting unslowed mobs impale themselves... worked well.<br />
<br />
Again, its all about what you want to do.  I get the impression that you are just worried about cranking out the exp.  In that case, forget the shaman, grab 3 rogues and take only the safest camps you can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">War, Clr, Chanter is not a good trio once you hit PoP imo.  You will lack DPS unless you fill the other spots.  You can kill most mobs, but paint will dry in the time it takes the three of you get it done.<br />
<br />
A better trio is War, Clr, DPS.... Chanter is replaced by long lasting C3 purchased in the baz and cleric handles CC with pacified pulls.  I personally like the mage for DPS (cause i bot one), but any DPS will do.<br />
<br />
Mourn chanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can bot a mage too :)<br />
<br />
I have a 55 mage, he's naked cause Verant has reduced him to meaningless crap, but he can be used if needed.<br />
<br />
But its odd you would not throw in chanter with ability to haste and weaken?<br />
<br />
Depends on mob and zone but if it can be slowed and I can be hasted, I'm good :) lol<br />
<br />
Mages are the /mourn<br />
<br />
I see nothing they can bring to my trio whatsoever, they are certainly the neglected class of EQ. I wish I had those 55 levels back.<br />
<br />
But I can avoid the nasty areas if my friends are not in heh heh.<br />
<br />
Take in mind im talking about pre 60 stuff here heh heh. I can still XP in Luclin and other &quot;old pre pop&quot; places. <br />
<br />
Normally I will have a ranger and a shaman with me if all goes well.<br />
<br />
Levelling a mage beyond 55 is pointless since they get COTH there and since the mass rod was nerfed at 56 to make it ineffective. Many high level raids want you to kill the pet anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh oh... keep that mage..<br />
<br />
Your gonna love him in PoP and get yourself a trunch of doom asap.<br />
<br />
Pets no longer carry aggro like they used to .... No need to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok :)<br />
<br />
heh heh. I hope he gets better :(<br />
<br />
I wont delete him or anything but I put his gear on my wiz<br />
<br />
I just heard that in the Bertoxx ring and some other uber raid situations they are not too welcomed<br />
<br />
I also have a 52 SK im not too fond of lol. But I know in POP so far they are agro kings wth the pallies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mage DPS really picks up pst 60, they got thrown some nice stuff, and the 61 mage pet makes the epic pet look like a lvl 4 gnome warrior in bronze.<br />
<br />
Chanter &gt; Truncheon of Doom.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, but my ToD only ever procs when the mob's running away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that trio will do fine<br />
I 2 box me and my druid in potactics(self buffed except kei) its risky but very doable with cleric and chanter should be cake</div></div><hr />
