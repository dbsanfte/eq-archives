<br />
I'm a 60 prot tank and lately i've been getting gear that have higher ac but less stats etc...<br />
<br />
Stuff like princess legs on maraudon vs this plate legs i got from brd which is basically:<br />
<br />
232 AC , 1% extra miti, +22 Defense (i have no idea what Defense does exactly) vs 180hp , 20 STR and other jank stat.<br />
<br />
Now is there a soft cap formula for AC like EQ did? As in hit that AC and then work on hp etc? (This is for 60+ instanced tanks).  I've seen some people mention 7K ac etc... what's the miti when you hit 7K and is it critical to sacrifice prob more then 1K hp to get it?<br />
<br />
How does +X defense, +X% dodge/parry work out, from what i saw personally defense did not do much for me (so i ditched anticipation).  Seems to me though gears are either decent AC with pretty stats, or uber AC with +defense.  So can anyone shed some light from tanking end game instances?  thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each point in defense increases your chance to block, dodge, parry and supposedly reduces critical hits done against you. You can check it out yourself by not wearing any gear with +defense and observing your dodge/block/parry % in the skill book window, and then equipping anything with +defense. The bonus per point is pretty small, but from what I hear, gear with +defense on it is pretty common, and they give big bonuses too. I imagine it'd all add up to an amount noticable without parsing easily, but whether or not thats worth sacrificing stats or HP for is not something I feel i'm eligible to comment on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finding the AC cap should be easy, if there is one. Just unequip all your items and put them on one by one while noticing the increase in damage reduction (you can see damage reduction % value by moving your mouse pointer over the AC value in the character screen). I think it will behave linearly to a certain limit which should be the AC cap. Either way the graph will start to flatten out at some value where the damage reduction gained due to AC starts getting small. That should be the first cap.</div></div><hr />

Now, remove the defense piece and you'll see that number change.<br />
If you have no agi on that piece, then the drop in % is 100% related to the defense change.<br />
I'm pretty sure that there's another talent that affected by defense but the servers are down and I can't check it out.<br />
