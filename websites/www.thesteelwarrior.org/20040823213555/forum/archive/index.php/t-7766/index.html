<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These questions were raised on the board in various places, they were asked and got the following answers:<br />
<br />
Q:  An soe rep was quoted from eqlive as saying shields rased the ac cap. Is this referring to a softcap, or the obvious raise in AC by adding a higher ac item?<br />
A:&quot;Shields do indeed raise the soft cap by the amount of AC on the shield. We were also looking into the possibility of allowing people who use shields to get a chance to block with them. &quot;<br />
<br />
Q:  Is the timeweaver pet nerf intentional?<br />
A: &quot;There was an issue with the NPC's skills related to recent skill changes. It will be fixed for the next Live update.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q: Any updates on augment removal?<br />
A: &quot;The base system will be on Test today. Which features a new window when you click on the Augmentation Sealer world container.  The functionality to remove augments using new solvents is in, however you may not be able to get the new solvents just yet. Design is still finalizing that process.  In addition to this, the process to delete augments has changed slightly. You don't need a specific solvent and you delete the augment you want by selecting the slot.<br />
 <br />
Btw, the augment refund guy will be removed. This won't be a way to get refunds for all your unwanted augments. <br />
<br />
The price for the solvents is going to scale based on the value of the augment. &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
UGH! Even after we were told we could get refunds on eqlive forums? That blows. &gt;:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ozox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hopefully there will be an alternate method for getting refunds for unwanted augs.  I hope they dont remove the refund aspect of the system all toghter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errr... what softcap?  I thought the old Velious era AC softcap that gimped even the plate tank's AC far below what was achievable with north tov gear was long gone.  I thought at least from PoP on, whatever AC you could achieve actually &quot;worked&quot;.  Otherwise why would you have gear in the game that allows ACs to go above the point where they do anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Please read the source thread before you comment on the softcap statement:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7643<br />
<br />
A &quot;softcap&quot; means you still benefit from AC beyond the cap, you just benefit less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, I guess my question would be, if shields are already so good because the raise the AC softcap (which is quite significant), why add a chance to block on them too?  The only way shields will be a viable choice for warriors is if we can keep aggro effectively with them.  It sounds like they're already a viable and excellent option for knights against hard hitting mobs.  Adding a chance to block too may risk making them overpowered for knights in the effort to make them viable for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The ac softcap is tough to hit, generally only happening on trivial mobs. Beyond that, we don't know how good they are beyond that softcap, AKA whether or not it's worth using even then. Increased defensive bonuses might make the loss of aggro worth it. It'd make them better for knights too, sure, but I don't suspect it'd be overpowering as we'd probably keep the same gap between warrior and knight tanking abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think we need a new term for the &quot;ac softcap&quot; that occurs when your ac &gt;&gt; mobs atk. I understand kavhoks statements in the shield tanking to mean there is also a fixed ac softcap, which is the one which is raised with mitigation aa and shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When your AC is enough greater than the mob's ATK, you will certainly observe diminishing returns of adding more AC.  That's simply a function of the curve.  As it gets closer and closer to zero (not really zero, but rather the mob's minimum hits), there's less damage for the AC to mitigate.  I wouldn't really call that a softcap.  <br />
<br />
Now the softcap he was talking about varies by class, level, mitigation AA, and the presence of a shield.  I didn't see anywhere where he said it had a thing to do with the mob's ATK.  If it does, could someone point me to the post?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't. Mob Atk has nothing to do with the softcap he (the dev) speaks of. The only people who think otherwise are obviously incapable of comprehension. You are correct, atk &lt; ac does give decreasing non-0 returns on mob DPS until you reach minimum hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not being able to exchange augments makes the whole deal a lot less fair to player. There are Type7 and Type8  armor and augs. Being able get your augment back is meaningless if you can't use it when you upgrade.<br />
<br />
I'm not doing 20+ hours more of LDoN to get an augment for a slot having done it before. I'm tired of these stupid timesinks where tedium is substituted for fun. After obtaining LDoN augs for almost every slot multiple times already, I'll be GD'd if I'll do it yet again.<br />

That seems to defeat the purpose of makeing them removeable. This is truely retarded.<br />

<br />

<br />
Sounds ok unless the upper end ones cost a few k to remove, if I am paying more than a few hundred to remove them it will be too much.</div></div><hr />

You will be able to return purchased augments to the NPC however the ones that drop in the dungeon's can not be traded in but you will be able to place them in other items once you remove them. <br />

man,why they changing their tune now?<br />

where was that augment unsellable post made,cant find it on eqlive,some other class forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">nah it's so you can take the +40hp off your raex gloves and put it on so other piece when you upgrade to vads.<br />

or anyother aug. say your anger 3 from your bow to your dbowl or chos or ect...</div></div><hr />

Look again Mokor. You can't take that 40HP augment off your Raex or Warlord's Gauntlets and put it on your Vadd's Gauntlets when you upgrade.<br />
<br />
Raex and Warlord's Gauntlets use Type 7 augments. Vadd's uses Type 8.<br />

Oh.<br />

But then I started thinking...<br />
<br />
How can that be a smartass thing?  I think it's retardedass.<br />
<br />
bieng able to switch out slots sounds great, when I get out of some of this cultural/kizraks I can just move my aug, but when I get vadd that's pure ass suckage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The aug removal thing is more of an answer to the cry out regarding the augs that drop as loot in GoD raids.  Spending 54 peoples time to get a 70hp aug that will get destroyed as soon as the item is replaced is regoddamntarded.  Now, at least, when people upgrade their potime loot (helms, arms, legs, etc.), they'll just be going from one type 8 armor, to another, so they can swap their 40hp aug no problem.  Same with pre-potime, kizrak's -&gt; raex's, type 7 to type 7.  Just gonna have to do some work when you go from the type 7's to the type 8's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not nearly as retarded as one person spending 3 weeks getting a 40 hp aug only to see it go when they get a new drop.  This is great for non raiding folks too.  I'd rather see the point turn in thing active, and wouldn't be surprised if they let it happen down the road.  For now, being able to recycle aug's is great.</div></div><hr />

- Augment Buy Back System:<br />
<br />
Players can now sell LDoN items back to adventure merchants and receive half of the points they spent (rounded up).<br />
<br />
The Adventure Merchant Window now contains a &quot;Sell&quot; button, which is used similarly to the Sell button with regular merchants --<br />
<br />
click the item in your inventory or bag and the Sell button will enable. Only items with an adventure point cost, and that were bought from an adventure merchant can be sold back.</div></div><hr />

A mobs damage can only be effected by your AC up to a certain point. mobs level -vs- your AC sort of thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&lt;&lt;A:&quot;Shields do indeed raise the soft cap by the amount of AC on the shield... &quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
i hate to throw a wrench into this but isnt raising the softcap synonymous with giving the mob a higher ATK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">No. We're using one word to describe 2 different effects. There is the AC-ATK breakpoint, which is how the AC softcap is usually described. Further, for each class, there is a single number beyond which the AC displayed over this number is divided by a constant when actually applied to find the effect of AC - the linearity of the formula changes above a certain AC value. I will hereforth call this a 'codecap'<br />
<br />
For example, let's make the completely unfounded assumption that the warrior AC codecap is 1500 AC, and the constant of new linearity is 4: All AC over 1500 is effectively divided by four. To get the same gains that you got going from 1400 AC to 1500 AC, you must now go from 1500 AC to -1900- AC. The shield AC bypasses this effect, however, and equipping a 50 AC shield at 1500 AC means you only need to go to 1750 AC to get the same effect as you would going to 1900 AC without the shield. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
I hope that's comprehensible, because it makes me want to check my Dr. Pepper for crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Great description Arathena. There seems to be a lot of different opinions about this, but you're on the same page I am with it. <br />
<br />
I'm of the opinion that the softcap has to be pretty low, too, probably more like 1100 or 1200 though. If it's much higher, kavhoks comment that the median 65 warrior has enough AC to gain full benefit from mitigation AA doesn't fit the model well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">2-Methyl-3ß-hydroxy-1aH,5aH-tropane-2ß-carboxylate benzoate (ester)! In my sweetened carbonated water with natural and artificial flavors!<br />
<br />
Judging from Brael attempting to play pattycake with a frog in Valor for the information we need here to make a proper judgement, and not finding it, Imma go right ahead and postulate that for day-to-day combat, where a well geared tank is likely beyond the AC/ATK breakpoint, a shield is pointless. The primary use will be tanking stuff you don't technically have the gear for. Conclusion? Shield still need a little help.</div></div><hr />
