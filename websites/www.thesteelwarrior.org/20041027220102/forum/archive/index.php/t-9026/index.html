<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some others on my server (Brell) tried RZtW script tonight.<br />
<br />
I heard fourth hand that VZ and TZ spawned on top of each other with the result of a lotta nekkid toons popping really quickly at the 5 stones in tranq.<br />
<br />
Anyone done RZtW *very* recently?<br />
<br />
Maybe if anyone who was there could post the actual details rather than my fourth hand account it would lend some clarity to the problem.<br />
<br />
*edit*  found this over on EQ Live http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=36505<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, sounds like TZ is warping to VZ, aggroing him, then warping back.  The posts don't say if all of VZ's guards are comign with him or not.  Maybe it's possible to kill the decorins down by the arena, far enough away from TZ that he doesn't aggro?  Otherwise, it may be necessary to TL the raid after killing the decorins, to break the aggro, then zone back in and pull TZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we fight VZ first, right where he spawns, and the last 2 times, TZ comes charging in from his  room...and we make sure _noone_ is near the stairs....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We had that happen once a couple months ago (Vallon showing up in the middle of the Tallon fight) but figured somebody got close to the stairs.  Have done it a couple times since then without a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">has in fact buffed most of the PoP mobs. <br />
<br />
Be forewarned ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problems with TZ/VZ aggroing raid have been reported since the release of OoW. From what I can see a number of strategies have been tried to avoid them both aggroing at the same time, with the result always the same; both mobs aggro at the same time. This has been reported by a number of different folks, so I'm thinking it's legit. One strategy involved fighting VZ at his spawn point, so warping is not the cause of this.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping it's a bug and it get's fixed. If it's an intentional change, then I'm disappointed the encounter has been changed. I like the challenge of finding a working strategy that doesn't involve piling on bodies to get it done. This change just encourages that, imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm fairly certain they revamped nearly the entire zone. Yesterday I went and a flayer was standing directly to the left of the zone in hallway, in a stationary spawn location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">VZ isnt a very dps intenseive mob ... especially once slowed.  A couple of clerics/druids and a fat offtank should work wonders.<br />
<br />
Just use your heads .. this isnt rocket science.  I, for one, like the change.  I'm looking forward to giving it a whirl in a day or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We just did the Rztw script two nights ago, and indeed the moment TZ popped, VZ came charging at us as well.  It was a riot defeating both of the gods at the same time, but I must admit, it was a bit of an eye opener as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>doranski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We attempted last night the RZTW run and in fact as it says TZ and VZ agro automatically.  VZ will come down the stairs with about 4-8 adds,(which we had cleared before engage, but repoped)  To make matters worse after we could not mez the Lt's so we had to tank TZ VZ and kill off the lieutentants.  Well we managed to kill TZ and VZ and all but two adds before we declared it a total wipe.  even trying to recover from that you will run out of time if you can not keep three heal rotations going.  We are hoping this is a bug as this encounter is already a difficult one made even harder, who knows when you kill the fake RZ perhaps now you get kill RZTW with his two sons just to really make it impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the point is going back and changing old content based on newer levels/content is a bad idea. What this does is remove content  for those not as far along.<br />
<br />
Revamping underused zones to make them more interesting and appealing to a wider audience is one thing. Going back and changing old content to make it &quot;harder&quot; just takes content away. New challenges for higher levels is what new content is for. Leave the older content alone. This expansion is what, 3 years old?<br />
<br />
If they were going to go back and change things in PoP, I'd rather see them fixing problems like the backflagging mess then retuning encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While it might be fun for some who have already beaten RZtW and got their guild into elementals, it is definitely not fun for people who have yet to defeat him, it's just another cockblock on an already very difficult event.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine this change being intentional. We've beaten it several times but there are lots of guilds who haven't and if this change stays they probably won't any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I certainly like the way the encounter is now, but I definitely agree with Fenring.  My guild has farmed the elementals for months and is now Time flagged.  We prevailed during the script, but I can't say the same for a guild who's just now beginning their run up the PoP flag checklist.  To put it plainly, the difference in overall strength between a guild just entering the elementals and a guild just leaving is astronomical.  I do not believe that is a gap that could be made up simply by AAs and levels alone, and hell, one of the rewards for getting into the elementals is access to better exp/kill mobs anyways!<br />
<br />
So, like, wtf.  Hehe.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I always thought it felt weird to be huddling in the corridors avoiding corners etc. during this script.  It seemed to me that the event was intended to be played out in the map room, with both Zeks attacking at once, from opposite doors.  Small consolation to the guilds that are up and coming, I know.</div></div><hr />
