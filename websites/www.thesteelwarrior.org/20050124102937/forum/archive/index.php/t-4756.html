I was thinking about getting it for my dad for christmas and just wondering if it better than regualrr cable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DirecTV is decent. The only bad about it if the weather is really cloudy and there is precipitation, do not expect to get a signal.  I had cable most of my life up until 9 months ago, so sattv was a nice change.  Great picture too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashbomba</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its good till you get heavy clouds then it sorta fades out and in.<br />
if you have the option of getting broadcast tv stations its just like cable for the most part then.<br />
if not then you have to have the antenna for them.<br />
cost is compareable to cable for the most part.<br />
<br />
wierd i have DSL yet dont have cable where i live go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had DirecTV for years, and the only times I've ever seen it lose signal is during particularly heavy fucking storms. IMO if your satellite is losing signal just because it's sort of cloudy or raining, it needs to recalibrated. I personally spent hours on my roof setting that dish at precisely the right orientation and signal testing until it was perfect - I don't know how dedicated a company installer will be...<br />
An advantage over cable is that you can often get several channels in both EST and PST time zones, which I guess is really cool for catching all your prime-time shows and sports games and such, but I don't really watch TV except by accident, so I can't vouch for that myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Directv is great. Get it with a Tivo enabled reciever and you won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">D TV is pretty good, TIVO is a great add on.  Just make sure you get that son of booch lined up right or when it rains/snows ya might have problems.<br />
<br />
Other than that, much much much better selection than cable ever gives ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorthaf</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Directv is really good imo, it has to be a very bad day to not get any reception at all.  By far better than digital cable or anything else I've seen.  If you can get Tivo it's great, you can record programs while away from the house to watch later.  <br />
<br />
My mom's business sells and installs for pegasus and directv.  Also sells Tivo :O so nice, I can't stand to watch anything else now.  I always go over to her house and watch tv for free heh.  It does require a credit check though, some people hate that, if you have bad credit you have to make a downpayment, not sure how much it is though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your worried about fade from storms or trees get a 36&quot; dish.. that will pick up signal through another building.<br />
<br />
normal dish is 18&quot;. <br />
<br />
they sell it on a few websites online.<br />
<br />
with mine i get 98% signal and i lose signal on a really bad storm for about 2-3 min till the front passes. the rest of the time the pic on it is as good as digital cable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am planning to get 20 inch dish for it and get three receivers.  Any brand names you guys  recommend I was think about RCA or is there better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This might be just bad luck but my folks have had their directv/tivo reciever made by Sony meltdown twice now. Where as I've never had a problem with my Hughes reciever and my first generation Philips Tivo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taenk</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had my DirecTv dish for about 3 years and have NEVER had any bad reception.  Course I live in San Diego where there is no weather, may have something to do with it ;)<br />
<br />
Couldn't recommend it more though, great system</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wudgurorm</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I have Direct TV, OMG I love it...Best Part about it for me, Movie Comes on I want to Watch, but its Mid Raid Pop it over to the West Coast Feed in a Couple of Hours and BINGO.<br />
<br />
Of Course if i had Tivo, I would have it while those damn pally SK only weapons is awarded for next to nothing DKPwise.</div></div><hr />
