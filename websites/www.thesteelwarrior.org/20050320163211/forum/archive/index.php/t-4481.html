Probably get a  lot worse when you can sign up for beta, and when beta starts, and every stage though beta and then release....</div></div><hr />

Also &quot;WOW&quot; can be misleading in the thread title :confused:</div></div><hr />

I got some advice for ya.  Shut the fuck up, no one wants to hear your opinion either.<br />

Too bad the male gnomes look like those troll dolls[the ones with the gems in their belly buttons].</div></div><hr />

<br />
Choosing class, eh, is something I'll decide when the game actually comes out.<br />
<br />
But wandering the lands, in search of good &quot;brain food&quot; is going to be fun, fun, fun.<br />

<br />
While gnomes way of saying &quot;get lost&quot;, may be rather harsh and not very friendly, I think he is right. World of Warcraft may end up being a great game, it is just as likely that it could end up being a MMO-Diablo 2 hack/click fest for 12 year old newbs who want a level every 10 minutes. However either way, the point is, it was my understanding that www.thesteelwarrior.org was a fan site for the Everquest Warrior? I too find these &quot;WoW&quot; posts to be &quot;Off Topic&quot;. Perhaps a special section called &quot;Other Games&quot; could be added to the form where these people could go and post their thoughts on WoW, Horizons, etc.. but in &quot;The Tavern&quot;, which I believe is for Everquest Warriors, perhaps the game of topic should remain that.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion, no offence intended.</div></div><hr />

Those gnomes look kinda gimpy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Arena <br />
Stats and Skills<br />
<br />
So regarding skills, who here is a proficent c++ programmer? I know I am, I also have many skills in basket ball that I would like to discuss further... etc..<br />
<br />
 <br />
 The Battlefield <br />
Faction, Foes, and Zones<br />
<br />
Foes? well I suppose I consider the taliban a foe, what does everyone think of them? in addition while we are talking about zones, does anyone know the actual legal dimensions of a parking zone? thanks!<br />
 <br />
 The Bunker <br />
Armor, Weapons, and Equipment <br />
<br />
On the topic of weapons, Id like to discuss a phase plasma rifle in the 40 watt range, those are excellent weapons, for armor I prefere multi-phasing shielding.<br />
 <br />
etc.. <br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
I believe its obvious that the context of the sub titles for each sub section of the form are within the Everquest universe... <br />

Just my opinion, no offence =D</div></div><hr />

Its a forum about a video game, not the itinerary of the US Congress.  Lighten up already.  Its up to the board moderators whether a topic is not suited for these boards and a moderator obviously read it and didn't remove the thread so if you don't like it, just don't read it.</div></div><hr />

Hi~<br />
<br />
Please to not be acting like a dumbass.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
PS: The General forum. probably means there's Generals here right?!<br />
<br />
RIGHT?!<br />
<br />
So I'd advise you to stay away from this forum.<br />
<br />
Just as a precaution.</div></div><hr />

Pretty funny coming from someone who keeps saying you can't judge a game before it's out.<br />
<br />
And this thread is not about Hype at all..  did you post before even reading the subject?<br />
<br />
I hope you do realise that going in the General Topics forum, and clicking on a link that says WoW, and posting how you think the thread is retarded....<br />
makes you look like a dumbass?<br />
---<br />
<br />
back on topic,<br />
I adore the look of the women gnomes. So damn cute, and I thought EQ gnomes looked cute :p<br />
Though the male ones are... well.. ugly as hell.. (NO, NOT like in EQ, us gnomes in EQ are actually handsome!)</div></div><hr />

Now, take the advice of the people who have proved themselves to be more intelligent than you, and shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />
