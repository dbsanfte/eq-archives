<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best place to get AAs?  I'm a 65 warrior that is pre EP sub 8k buffed and trying to figure out the best place to get AA vs time spent.  I have heard people talk about getting as much as an AA an hour.  Right now in a good group I can get 1AA per 2-2.5 hours and thats on a good night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hugely depends on your group and availabilty of mobs.Major dps and mana efficency contrasts in groups make more differance than the zone.HOH was good when we were short on flags because it was empty hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got literally hundreds of AA's in BoT. HoH is also good. If you can get access to Tactics and Sol Ro tower those are also good spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It will be very hard, and you WILL die occasionally if you spend hours at it, but the best XP zone available to you at this time is Vxed.  Deaths aside, you should exceed 1 AA/hour there, without resorting to stupid charmed pet tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heard people talk about getting as much as an AA an hour<br />
<br />
Yes, but you have to fight mobs at your level or higher or kill twice as many lower level mobs.   A level 65 mob might net you 3.25% aa and a level 60 might only net you 1.15%.  So you wil have to kill almost 3:1 mobs per level.<br />
<br />
There aren't many places you can go that have level 65 mobs that you can kill in 3 minutes continuosly.<br />
<br />
It may be better for you to hunt in a &quot;safer&quot; area with mobs of lesser level and maintain the aa per 2/2.5 hours.<br />
<br />
BoT, HoH, CoD (mice are good exp), Droga, GoD sewers Crematory/Sludge, LDoN hards (though they seem a little less then normal on the aaexp per kill) and PoM hedge area (the apes / rabbits are level 65).  Even Tier4 Hate area is good exp:loot ratio.<br />
<br />
If you can hunt in an area that could net money or drops then the aa:hour ratio may be less of a concern.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to try Droga, Hate, PoM (can suck getting there first time though), and Tier2 PoP and GoD sewers.  LDoN hards could be an option also though the AA seems lower then normal for lvl 63-65 mobs.<br />

<br />
Don't you have to complete Smith Rondo or Sewer trials to get into Vxed?<br />
<br />
And he said he was sub 8k buffed  That might be a little low for Vxed?<br />

Prior to being EP flagged (well, still ongoing really), I strived to find the best spot possible as well.  One difference that can offset things one way or the other, depending on your view, is that I 6 box, so my group integration is tight.<br />
<br />
Classes: 65 warrior, cleric, druid, enchanter, magician and necromancer.<br />
<br />
In plane of tactics pits ~1 hour AAs.  I found this to be, by far, the best place pre-EP for me.  I would DC the lightblue pigs with the enchanter and druid which helps a bit.  Sometimes I would DC the gnome at the zone in and fight my way down.  Do not underestimate the DPS on that little gnome, I'd rather have him over a DC'able pig anyday.  I have pretty consistantly pumped out 1hour AAs there and this was with skyshrine armor and some minor pop, non-visible slot items.<br />
<br />
I tried plane of storms giants, halls of honor (quite a bit), some camps in bastion of thunder (never done back earth area), chardok B and find they all pale in comparison.  Halls of Honor I would clear the 'named' legion camps as well as some of the surrounding armor suits and the XP was nowhere near as good.  I will grant, my lack of a monk/bard means I need to paci which can eat into time, plus not keeping up the pace can prevent you from keeping the spawns 'broken' up properly.  Supposedly XP in back earth is great, but I always find it camped and simply do not bother.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, all of the above are group centric.  If you are going to solo with just a couple folks then things change as you care much more on single pulls, kite area, etc.<br />
<br />
Personally, if you have folks who all have the tactics key (which can be obtained with a single group as well) then you can get some great XP.<br />
<br />
As for the GoD zones, to enter Vxed you need a single party member that has killed Smith Rondo or completed the four sewer trials in order to enter that zone.  This also gets you access to Tipt.  I can say as a 8900hp buffed tank (clr/dru/self only) that vxed/tipt mobs put out some serious hits and I die a great number of times.  However, through in an enchanter willing to charm a mob as a pet and things get easier and XP flows a great deal faster.  However, even at my hp/ac, I cast CH a little before the mob engages me and sometimes I can drop before CH lands, so patching is a good idea.<br />
<br />
The GoD sewer zones are decent XP but still challenging, definately more so than say PoTactics pits.  You can expect to die more and will have travel time / deaths at a higher percentage than a 'lesser' zone.<br />
<br />
If you have a good crew and an enchanter/snarer to do a charmed pet then vxed would be outstanding for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, having the best group you can to suit the environment makes xp fly if there are enough mobs.Vxed is my best aa spot at the moment.It does not require any flags.However,a lot of people who have yet to flag at all in pop may find it unusually tough imo.A  smart group with good pet control could probably exploit pet power there tho.Especially if they remain zi.I prefer not using pets there myself.<br />
<br />
Ps. er no flags required for vxed or tipt.First place I did was Tipt with no GOD flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no flags required for vxed or tipt.First place I did was Tipt with no GOD flags<br />
<br />
Well that's great news.  I had heard wrong.  That zone-in is in Barundi, far north corner?<br />
<br />
Thanks,  Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Found this about Vxed:<br />
<br />
Actually after you have sewers complete you need to talk to apprentice Urdana not the scribe. Yes Scribe is like Gamesh. She will give out instances to Tipt and vxed if you haven’t completed sewers. <br />
<br />
To start the first trial in Vxed Hail Urdana and say &quot;pay heed&quot; <br />
<br />
Thanks for inforation folks.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GoD will be real tough unless you have an uber group. I am just  over 9K raid buffed and I have a slightly hard time tanking it. Atleast the first and 3rd trial so far. Altho you might be ok to just hang out at entrance and gain the XP. But the down time/death will be great. I would hit up some kiting spots. This is where your rangers/druids/SK's become your best friends. Since you are more DPS than a SK you can duo with one and get good XP. If your real lucky and get a necro or 2 to kite with you can leach alot of good XP in tactics or HoH. also I would go to PoV caves. Those are great XP and with a slower/healer you shouldnt have a problem tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BoT is good xp, Tactics pits is even better since you get non stop pulls even if you don't try :P<br />
<br />
Sewers are nice xp if your group has the mana regen to keep up with heals or killer dps (suckers hit hard)<br />
<br />
HoH is decent xp, but the mobs are placed fairly far apart in some spots so pulls could be slow. Haven't tried HoHb for xp, that might be interesting ;)<br />
<br />
Basically try to find stuff that is within 5 levels of you for the best xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Basically try to find stuff that is within 5 levels of you for the best xp<br />
<br />
I'd have to narrow that to within 2 levels of yourself.  Fight mobs 64-66 seems to be the sweet spot.  Sewers Pool / Crematory and Bot krigers give 3.1% - 3.3% per kill were 62 mobs in same area give less then 2%, closer to 1.5%.  I'd rather kill one plague skeeter in 40 seconds then 2 BoT brauns in 1.5 minutes (with pull time possibly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you say &quot;Vxed&quot; or &quot;Tipt&quot; she will give you a flag mission of the appropiate type.If you do stuff out of order like I did you just see the scribe to straighten out your flags when done.<br />
<br />
I don't know much about clericing.However,if they are having trouble keeping you up with ch lag you might want them to mix in superlights or holylights(erm god thingy if I got that right).That's what they often use on me...probably more mana intensive.Also, if using a pet and you feel unable to stand thru slowing let the pet engage first.Lower geared tanks/groups could use this to great effect probably with some risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't know much about clericing.However,if they are having trouble keeping you up with ch lag you might want them to mix in superlights or holylights(erm god thingy if I got that right).That's what they often use on me...probably more mana intensive.<br />
It's the cleric in me....<br />
<br />
Complete Healing = 400mana base<br />
Supernal Light = 600mana base<br />
Holy Light = 650mana base<br />
<br />
Yeah, a lot more intensive  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, Vxed will be very hard at 8k.  But I think it is the best XP spot open to Curdlex.<br />
<br />
Nobody said that the best XP would be easy. :)  Hopefully Curdlex didn't expect it to be easy, either.  But I have a feeling that it would be very profitable even if he dies on 1/3 of the fights.<br />
<br />
A good way to test if you are ready for Vxed is to go to Plane of Tactics and try the yellow/red con ogres to the left and right of zone in.  They are hard, and may require your disciplines, and your healer is unlikely to be able to just use CH on you; but they ARE doable by a group with an 8k tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I really cannot see Vxed/Tipt being better experience at that stage without using a charmpet for at the very least the dps.  They can be excellent experience using charmed pets however but that severely limits your group composition.  Frankly the mobs stretch healing quite a bit and without the crutch of super dps they won't be efficient over time for grinding.  For where you are at BoT, Tactics, SolRo and perhaps LDoN High-risks would all serve quite well I imagine.<br />
<br />
Best experience I've found to so far is in Kod'Taz (for a traditional tanking group) but that again requires flags and some pretty buff companions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>beeafraid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ps. er no flags required for vxed or tipt.First place I did was Tipt with no GOD flags.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not entirely accurate.  Everyone in the group does not have to have sewers or Rondo.  However, I believe at least one person in the group does.<br />
<br />
Without eplane access, there are places in Bot that are good.  HoH is also good.  I think the best xp may be Crypt of Decay because I think it has a dungeon bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Vxed is good experience, and allows you to fight right at the zone for it.  Downside is that if your rezzer dies, you have to wait for them to run back from thier bind, closest point for which is abysmal.<br />
<br />
Another issue I have with Vxed is that you almost always wind up with a chanter who just has to do the charm pooka thing.  On the surface, a charmed pooka is a good idea, the dps is massive.  In my experience of this camp, however, ultimately it leads to more downtime due to mez breaks, which in turn result in deaths and full wipes.  But the chanters insist on it, because otherwise the camp is even more boring for them.<br />
<br />
Finally, you need a good crew for it, especially with a tank that lightly geared.  Vxed is meant to keep sub-elemental folks out of Kod Taz, and it does a pretty good job of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Look around for the rampage + earthshaker threads.  I was getting 5aa/hour solo (with bots) with rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Beeafraid ...how shall I put this...er no.<br />
No flags required for vxed or tipt lest the rules are differant on your server.I have always been further flagged than the rest of my regular group.We were in tipt and vxed many times with no one in the group having done all sewers or Rondo.First place I went to was tipt with no one having any god flags second was Vxed... then we did sewers.Those flags are for kt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Don't worry about AA's, and don't grind.  It's not worth it.  Point your efforts toward &quot;xping&quot; in zones that will provide you with a gear upgrade that you are working toward.<br />
<br />
XP is fairly decent just about everywhere, but gear is hard to come by.  Work toward xping where you can gear upgrade.  If ya dont' get what your'e lookin for, LDON it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for the information. It has been helpfull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you are sub 8k buffed and pre EP do LDON missions.  Try to get a group together and do 2 normal adventures in 2 hours.  This will net you about 1 AA for the 2 and 102 adventure points.  The AA is a little slower than a good BOT group for example, but you are earning points which would yield some significant upgrades for a sub 8k buffed tank.  This way you are getting reasonable AA rate and earning gear upgrades<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">GOD is king imo for good xp and upgrades rolled into one.Still gotta grind LDON points tho...sniff. :) I've been doing hards without cc lately hehe makes it kinda fun again.!</div></div><hr />
