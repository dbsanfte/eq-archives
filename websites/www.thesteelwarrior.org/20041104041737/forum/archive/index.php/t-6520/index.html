<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walasi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well long story short, got pissed about 3 hours plus lfg, cant hold aggro when I had a group and such so quit my warrior at level 50, played a ranger to 65 and quite a few aa's but liked tanking more, so after changes giving it another try heh.  So far its great, no longer than 30 40 mins lfg, can keep aggro pretty easily, (except for one stupid chain stunning paladin who ended up snuffing it to an archaic in POI) so now for my question first the gear I am using now I purchased with the thinking for gear ac&gt;hp&gt;sta would like for the more experienced of the board to take a look at the gear that I currently have and make suggestions.  Secondly I seem to be holding aggro fine (except for that stupid paladin with my current weapon setup sbod/fleshgrinder, would I do better to change weapons though, also for 2her after a 8 hour camp finally got Fabled Exe Axe, problem is it wont seem to hold aggro, if I pull and pull with bellow I can hold aggro for a while but have to keep re- applying bellow when it refreshes or it turns on others.  Any suggestions would be appreciated, want to make sure that I can get and keep aggro, since with this game reputation will get you group invites alot more than your class type will.<br />

<br />
Sell your SBoD.  Get a CHoS (main) and a SotB (sec).  You'll get comparable DPS and MUCH better aggro.  Keep your Fab Exec Axe for DPS when you are not tanking.<br />
<br />
As far as your gear, looks pretty good for a level 52.  Save the pp you have and get some ornate when you hit 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fabled exe axe has decent low agro dps if you are not tanking but it will never be a good agro weapon.  Looking at what you have, the copper hammer in your bag should be in main hand and probably the fleshgrinder in off hand for best agro combo.  If you can, pick up a sword of the bloodsworn to replace the fleshgrinder and that will get you to 65.<br />
<br />
Looking at your gear, its really not bad for your level.  You can wear ornate in 3 levels and I would wait until then to get some of that.  Also concentrate on leveling until you hit 65.  I know LFG for hours sucks bad because I did it for a long time but as an example I have 3100 hp naked at 65 so just leveling and then doing a few hp AA skills will make your hit points go up a lot.  You will mitigate better and resist more nukes etc.  Once you get decent agro weapons then the word will get around that you are a tank who can hold agro and it will make the LFG time less and less the closer to 65 you get.<br />

<br />
Side note: Here is what you do with the chain stunning pally if he pulls that chain stunning crap on a boss mob:<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
<br />
No more problem.  Once he dies a few times then perhaps he will learn.  In a raid the clerics will be healing you as he takes the damage and probably won't have time to switch to him before he dies.  He won't last long until he figures it out.</div></div><hr />

Like he implied, SBoD over-priced PoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walasi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well cound out the sbod, traded it for a cobalt bp and zlandicars heart for my necro and sword of the bloodsworn, still have fleshgrinder to sell, though I do like the 75hp and the 160 dmg proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stormrager</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a CHoS (main) and a SotB (sec).  <br />
<br />
And that is an extremely cheap setup as well.  What?  20k for both?  At least on Tholuxe Paells.  CHoS goes from 9-13k.  SotB is around 7-8k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walasi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CHoS 8k, SoBS 3.5k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stormrager</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agreed.<br />
<br />
Those prices are much cheaper than dumping it on a SBoD.</div></div><hr />
