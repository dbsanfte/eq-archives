Well now at least it qualifies as a rant, right?  Errrr, wait...<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">04-25-2005, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HeHe Ya FUCK PALADINS! Thiers no reason for them to wear valor, maybe cause it looks cooler than fucking light forge ( looks like a pussy set) :) with my lvl 60 warrior ( well not mine my friends that i will play, cause hes seeing his g-ma shes like sick or something) but ya and so i got to play with this warrior, this was my second day playing with a lvl 60 warrior, let me tell u awesome lol. But i was in a group with a 2 other pallys when Valor Droped, ( Chest Piece) ( Shoulders) both droped on diff days, now can u believe that fuckin luck, when my friend called and i told him he wasnt to happy! But no i asked if i could have since i was the only warrior, nicely one pally said sure since he couldnt use and he just wanted lightforge anyways. the other pallys just rolled, he rolled a 100 and a 97 i couldnt believe it i mean it just wasent fucking cool! ( i guess it didnt matter not my char) but still i wanted to wear it i rolled a 87 and 92 i was so mad, he later ignored me cause i kept asking him if i could wear, later when i saw him he was wearing them. i told someone else to whisper him for me saying if he wants to look all big and buff he shoulda chose a warrior! <br />
<br />
So as a post to all pallys that read this! DONT ROLL OR TOUCH OUR VALOR OR MIGHT SETS! TOUCH UR OWN GOD DAMN LIGHTFORGE! <br />
<br />
Just you wait till im lvl 60 and get valor or if im really lucky might sets and then i will roll on all forge pieces just to sell and fuck u pallys over! ha bitch's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">04-25-2005, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, wow sometimes you thank me and sometimes you beat me down. And No i will not cross the street when a car goes by, although i got hit by a car once i didn't die. :) So again i will try somemore just sometimes it doesn't come out right. hehe... I always had a clear line with you. Each time you get closer to it I pet you, each time you get farer I beat you. Like it or not it's the best way to teach something to weak nimded creatures.<br />
<br />
BTW, why do I feel that your rage against paladins is artificial ? When browsing through your post here, it appears to me that you are so mad at them only because we have clearly here a bad opinion of most of players that we met and that play paladins. You seams not to see that we don't dislike paladins as a class but that we dislike the kind of people that plays most of them. Ir's very sad that you missed that particular point, because while you seams to attack paladins to get our sympathy you actually act more and more like them. And thus, by doing so you loose more and more sympathy, credibility, and acceptance within our community of warrior, or should I say of TSW.<br />
<br />
You should calm down a little bit and not just rant because it's fun or because it looks 'in'. I as told you, work your langage and your expression and you will be tolerated ; be humble when you ask something and don't troll other advises and you won't be discredited ; don't take pleasure from bitching and creating flaming-contest and you will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I have a level 15 one my self, just that people who play them think their so great! When their not a godly class! If anything rogues and mages kick their ass's! They are pretty great at soloing through! They do lack combat and dps skills. But no again I will take in what you have said! And use more expression...</div></div><hr />

Ca va bien merci, le temps est magnifique (meme si ce n'est pas ettonent pour Marseille). Tu sais, les langues ne sont pas mon fort non plus. C'est un peu plus facile ici parce que tu peux toujours prendre tout le temps que tu veux pour repondre. Le principal est d'avoir le bon ton et la forme, le reste vient tout seul. <br />

well I will continue in english because I want ZsGohan to understand it too. As I just said the most important thing is to use the right tune. My previous post (where I replied to ZsGohan) is the best exemple for it: <br />
I always like to play with the line between a troll and a normal poster, and thus I often got some warning from mods (especially you Isk, I like playing Tom &amp; Jerry with you just to make you mad). And when I read this post I just made (and even when I was writing it) I know this is my roughtest post I ever made here. But look, because I kept a very cold tune, and that I positionned myself as the master, I won on every fields: I increased even further my sympathy with other members, I decreased the loudlyness of ZsGohan from yells to babillages, and on top of it the one that should have warned me is following me like a blind.<br />
My english isn't that great (BTW, only Varaho is truly the greatest user of english here), but because I put attention most of the time and that I keep a correct &quot;word flow&quot; my posts aren't to often critizised for it's grammar (even if I already got linked to by an ordi to teach english for 5-year kids).<br />
Each laguages (and their sub dialects) have their own way of thinking linked to it, if you can get the way of thinking of a particular group of poeple then you will be able to use their language with ease, but every languages are used by human thus by the same kind of brain and thus we all use the same kind of analyser. Thus whatever language you use there is always things that should never be done and other that should always be done to ease the comprehension.<br />
