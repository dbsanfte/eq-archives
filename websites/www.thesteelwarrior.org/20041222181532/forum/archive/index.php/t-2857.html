<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Want to fix warrior exp group aggro and not trivialize raid encounters? <br />
<br />
Give us an /aggro disc that works like voice of thule (but stacks, so we don't take away SK utility) and has a toggle (like they wanted to give paladins with slay undead). And while we have that active, we can't use any other disc. <br />
<br />
Easy enough... can't use it while tanking anything that requires defensive, so it shouldn't cause any balance issues on high end content.  And knight's always say that we shouldn't get better aggro control because we have /disc defensive and that makes us much better tanks.  Well, this forces us to choose between better aggro control or our famous disc.<br />
<br />
Unlike many other suggestions I've read, this on also has the benefit of not causing ping-pong between two warriors, because this is something we can control, rather than &quot;always on.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you don't want it on a toggle, then make it a 60 second disc with an 80 second reuse timer.<br />
<br />
We still won't have &quot;snap aggro&quot; but it WILL improve our initial DPS aggro while we are waiting for a proc.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps an easier way to do it would be to give us another skill that procs some hate.  It could be a skill like kick, or like shield, or an aa with a hotbutton.  Hell, maybe they could even just add 100 hate to all taunts to every class that could taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since your agro generation would go up tremendously when<br />
 def/eva drops and you pop this one.<br />
<br />
Thus enabling the raid to go bull burn.  (easier than its done atm).<br />
Your proposal on its own will raise raid DPS by 15-20% during time when the warrior isnt under defensive.<br />
<br />
This will make fights more trivial because<br />
1) warrior will have complete insane agro lock<br />
2) you will be able to nuke a lot more<br />
3) the fight will be sensibly faster<br />
4) CH line will be even shorter.<br />
<br />
Shorter fights + Tigher heals + Agro lock = Too trivial</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taunt<br />
Bellow (yelling at a mob, taunt from further away)<br />
Aggrivate (same chance of success as Taunt, generates more hate)<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are more to think of, also would like to see us &quot;use our armor better&quot; and have an upgrade to Slam... Ram anyone? (Stun, minor knockback, higher hate)<br />
<br />
And why is it that we &quot;can use any weapon&quot; but not Hand to Hand weapons?</div></div><hr />

I can't think of any offhand.</div></div><hr />
