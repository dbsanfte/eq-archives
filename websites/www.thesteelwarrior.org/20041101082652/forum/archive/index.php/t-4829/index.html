<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I started my warrior back in 1999, barbarian and really enjoyed him till the mid 50's. Aggro issues, and being totally group dependant combined with being somewhere around #8 in the line of warriors in my guild was enough to make me spend too much time on alts. I went to the dark side and now have an ep 65 Necro as my main. <br />
<br />
It's been 2 years now since I played Car but i kept him equipped in the hopes that someday they would fix taunt and makes the class slightly less gear dependant.<br />
<br />
I am excited about the attention warriors are getting now, and look forward to test driving the old boy again. <br />
<br />
I have a question though and could use some advice. Back when I put Car on the shelf was just before Luclin came out and the rule was AC&gt;&gt;&gt;All. Times change of course and now I hear it's HP&gt;&gt;&gt;All. But to what extent? Car is level 56 and has about 3500hp unbuffed without any AA's and right at 1200ac. Gear is mostly a mix of SS armor and some of the more current bazaar purchasable gear that is best called a balance of Hp/AC. <br />
<br />
I just find it hard to get out of the old AC mentality after working so hard to raise it back then. For example, my SS boots are <br />
ac 28 <br />
dex 2<br />
sta 4<br />
hp 25<br />
1 vs All<br />
<br />
vs say Kingly Boots of Splendor <br />
ac 14<br />
str 8<br />
sta 8<br />
wis4/int 4<br />
hp 65, mana 25<br />
7 vs F,C,M<br />
<br />
14 ac seems a lot to give up but an extra 60 hp is great as well. Is there any kind of general rule of thumb for hp/ac tradeoff? Like 1ac = 5hp or something like that to make comparisons mathematical?<br />
<br />
I doubt he will ever replace my Necro as my main again but hey you never know. Any advice would be appreciated as I want to at least have some fun with him again, and do what I can to change the perceptions of the class vs what it was before these new tools we just got. Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at level 56, 14 raw ac isnt going to be that much of a factor.   Between the two, I'd say the KBoS are clearly superior.  Hell, at 65 I was using them until I got my Seru boots.<br />
<br />
[edit - btw, welcome back :)]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are an LDoNer, score armor from Miraguls, and you won't look back.  Except for the BP, get that from Tak.<br />
<br />
If you're not, HoT armor is about the best you can win.  It's hard to do better than HoT armor in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
If your necro is in a DKP guild, you might be able to score some nice drops for your warrior, but you already know what's possible there.<br />

Necros rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies. I thought I was doing ok on gear with the updates I had made but after being away so long, I am lacking a bit of confidence with the class.  Just didn't know if my HoT armor was completely outdated or not. Nice to see it isn't after so much work to get the peices I have.<br />
<br />
Took him out last night for an LDoN run. Group was a 54 SK, 52 Rngr, 56 chanter, 59 rogue, 58 shaman as only healer and myself. SK said he had been planning to tank but then showed his maturity by asking me my ac and hp. He then suggested I tank, which I agreed to. Was a bit nervous about only having a shaman as a healer but went for it. It was an assasination in Tak, and no one died and we finished successfully with about 22 min to go. Shaman only had to med once and although I felt rusty as a worn out door hinge, everyone commented on how smooth it went. Group seemed surprised that I had as many hp's as I did and I didnt even have focus or brells. That did a lot for confidence as well. Average fight would take me down about 30-35% on health, and the new provoke ability made much easier to hold aggro than the old days, even against the rogue. Boss fight was crazy, as the pacify on the additional mobs in room failed and brought the boss and 3 adds at once, chanter ran oom after locking down 2 adds and shaman ran oom when boss was at 40% and I was at half health, SK at 40% from tanking the add, till the chanter could get enough back to lock it down too. Defensive saved our ass and I was damn proud to be a warrior as the boss fell and I stood at 6% health foamin at the mouth in a berserker rage! Good stuff!<br />
<br />
Overall a very positive experience. I really didn't know what goal I should have for AC and HP for my level. If this run was any indication though, I feel much better about where I am at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People are whacked if they are giving up 14 AC (raw) for 40 HP and 6 stm. WHile you want both, AC is the main stat unless you are expecting to go against alot magic or AE damage. If you are MTing LDoN, AC pays more.<br />
<br />
I would aslo strongly suggest that you NOT go Mir for your armor. Its not as good as our ornate or the 1492 stuff. Its half the work of Tak, but then you still have 2 viable upgrades in those slots where you will just end up throwing those points away. The 2 weakest peices are your BP, legs and possibly back. All 3 I would replace with Tundra Helenic. Better AC and HP (and stm) than your current gear, droppable and probably fairly afordable (particularly if you talk to a smith adn get all 3 at once). <br />
<br />
That gear shoudl be more than enough to get you to 65 and/or Sands armor. <br />
<br />
PS add your defensive skill so we have a real feal of your AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Caramin's selection of Mir v Tak v Ornate armor depends entirely on his playtime, devotion to his alt, and financial means.  For a raiding warrior, the difference is about 15HPs and a few ACs per piece.  It's up to the individual to decide if 2x the work is worth that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Love the title to this thread, as it is kinda walking a line, trading off sometimes one for te other.  Kailyn is right that your SS boots are definatly better than Kingly Boots of Splendor.  14 ac + 4 sta &gt; 40 hp's.  I have used a formula that I found on this board that roughly 1 ac = 1 sta = 6 hp's.  It is not exact, but should give you a rough idea on how to balance gear.  Simply put, you cannot have too much AC, nor too many hp's.  I found myself alot deciding to not upgrade a slot for marginal returns, and holding out for clear gains(ie, getting both more ac and hp's).  In the example you gave on boots, changing is not a clear gain, so keep what you have(note that I still wear SS boots, and will not change them till I get ornate or better).<br />
<br />
I disagree with Kailyn tho on her comments about Tak vs Mir armor somewhat.  750 points vs 1450 pts, with a difference of a few ac and hp's.  if you have the time and patients, go for Tak armor, but if, like me, your schedule would make it unreasonable to get Tak in any kind of timely fasion(don't forget, a new expansion is 3 months away, with probably tons of new gear making a lot of what is out there obsolete), then get Mir armor and enjoy a nice upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually Caraman, in your case there is no point comparing the Kingly boots with SS boots as your warrior is Tribunal deity. <br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra boots for example are cheaper, have better ac than SS and are allmost the same hp as Kingly boots. <br />
<br />
Most other HT pieces are very good too (it is 10 times cheaper than ornate, has the same or more hp and a bit less ac generally) and they will last you a long time.</div></div><hr />
