Any help would be great thanks</div></div><hr />

i know of someone who has 3-boxed dozer was pally, shaman, and cleric.  and the pally was a twink and prolly buffed up to 6-7k HP at the time it was done.</div></div><hr />

I've gotten 5 pieces of doze loot, and I think at least one elemental group is overkill really.   One group is a good number to shoot for, but EP flag definitely isn't required (I'm not EP flagged myself.)  The original poster's 4 man group isn't likely to do it however, with a group that small you probably want a 65 tank with all defensive AAs, and a lot more DPS, the 60 SK would be more of a healing liability (to the AEs) than a help.  And while a 65 druid defnitely could heal, I'd rather have a cleric or a higher level backup healer.</div></div><hr />

I've got a bank full of tears to prove it.  And I had a druid healing me.<br />

However, you're not gonna get him slowed with a 62 shaman.  Get a chanter and get Malos and you have a chance.  You just need to keep him slowed and he's a pussy.  It's gonna be a LONG fight, but he's a pussy.</div></div><hr />

I thought Doze was slowable by a 60 shaman back in Velious :)<br />

<br />
Dozekar is the east wing of ToV(Halls of Testing) and is right behind the &quot;pit&quot; in his little room.  The drakes are spread out all over the halls, and are static.<br />
<br />
It is very possible that with that group set up you can kill him.  Despite what some other people have said, it really comes down to you and your groupmates skill. <br />
<br />
You're also going to need an indoor insta-click item, and, anyone who plans on attacking will as well... trying to dodge that AE is just pointless.<br />
<br />
On positioning, you can fight him wherever you like, I prefer to use a corner so I can press the &quot;A&quot; key and actually play a class that requires button pushing.</div></div><hr />

He is. <br />
<br />
However, if you plan on doing anything except chain casting Turgur's Insects, you're gonna want a chanter...especially since most 60 shaman love to bitch about the fact that they can't get Malo.<br />
<br />
Doze is yellow to 65.  That's a helluva resist check for a level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnie</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do him often 6 boxing.  65 War/Cle/Enc/Shm/Rog/Dru.  Piece of cake.  My warrior has about 8700 buffed for the fight (lose some hp for the 3 clickies I wear).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done Dozekar 23 times now, probably half of those on my own 6boxing 65 war/clr/dru/enc/nec/mag.  Don't underestimate Dozekar as he's a decent fighter when he isn't slowed.  Even tashed and mala'd he can be hard to slow and I've had 3 (pretty common) to 9 resists in a row.  There are some keys to him and understanding them can make him pretty trivial:<br />
<br />
1)  MT must have a clicky item OR have a group member cast a buff on him to act as a clicky.  The same is true for anyone else staying in his AE range, for me doing group MR on the enchanter makes it very easy, I however keep a clicky on my warrior.  Take the time to order your buffs and put a good 6 or so junk buffs up in there, keeping the vital ones for each class very low on the list, just in case.  He doesn't cast that often, but pre-planning doesn't hurt any either.<br />
<br />
2)  His AE debuff with 400dmg is unresistable, hence follow rule 1.<br />
<br />
3)  Positioning him and keeping healers out of AE is helpful, but not 100% necessary.  However, if you're cutting it close, why add the extra risk?  I fight doze in the fire pot to the left as you face into HoT.  I place all my casters to the left wall, before the fire pot (basically before the wall indents for the fire pot)<br />
<br />
4)  Yes, he can be done in all Skyshrine armor as that was how I did him about 6 times, since then I've added some ornate armor and more recently EP level armor (very little).  That has only made him easier, it was never necessary in the first place.  Can you do him with the group you have?  I cannot say, but I can say it will be a decent challenge.  When I first did him it was hard for my druid and cleric to keep up on the heals when he's unslowed, so you must slow him asap and keep him slowed, do not let that slip.  Once slowed, you will have a long fight ahead of you, very very long.  I do him in 23minutes by having one toon at a time go up and nuke (must be in melee distance) until I need to reslow.  My necro keeps a lot of dots on him (about 1400/tick) fairly consistent through the fight, so with just a war/sk on him your DPS will be much lower.<br />
<br />
Basic info I've gathered on Dozekar:<br />
Dozekar the Cursed <br />
This mob [Summons] [Enrages] [Casts Spells] <br />
Max Hit 900<br />
Ave Hit 405<br />
DPS 138 <br />
Max Spell 400<br />
Average 19 min 56 sec to kill <br />
Average Total HP 371,604 (he has high regen, fastest kill was 6 or so minutes and we clocked him at 320K then)<br />
20 wins out of 23 encounters <br />
<br />
If you can do Dozekar then the other minis will not be a problem.  The problem, sort of, will be getting to them.  You will have to clear your way to them unless your SK is top notch and ballsy enough to run to the minis and pull them to the first entrance way.  I do this with my warrior and have the mage CotH me back up to the doorway and it can be tough making the runs.  If you can get an enchanter with Dire Charm AAs then grab a wyvern from NToV and you can plow through to the minis quite easily.  You will also be able to do 2 at once if necessary, once slowed (pet can offtank a slowed mini, with some backup healing).<br />
<br />
Also, I made the following chart that I use when collecting items, which makes lookups much easier:<br />
HoT Quests (http://www.dicknjane.net/EVERQUEST/covenants/main.aspx) <br />
I would simply print it out and change the numbers to X's, that way you can quickly see what item is for what quest and work it out so that folks can get what they need.  Keep in mind, as long as everyone involved in a MQ is max CoV then you only need one of the rune/tears to get the item.<br />
<br />
edit - removed rampage from his abilities, screwed up my copy/pastes from my webpage, thanks Holywrath.<br />
updated fastest kill time as I checked my DB, I thought 12 minutes turns out it was 6 minutes, with 2 groups (2 wizzies in there)</div></div><hr />

Oh, and the key to killing him in a timely fashion is to keep a disease dot on him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope you don't mean what I think you mean, because if you do, you're wrong.<br />
<br />
Disease DOT's do not stop regen, and never have.</div></div><hr />
