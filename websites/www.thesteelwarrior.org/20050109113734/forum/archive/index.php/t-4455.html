<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy,<br />
<br />
There are alot of topics about the upcoming melee changes, but I wanted to start a post about things we should expect to see, a wish list of sorts, for the 3 melee classes.<br />
<br />
For questions we should be asking at the Chat, go here:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4428<br />
<br />
For an overview of the changes and a bunch of arguments, go here:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4420<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for are suggestions/help for Warrior skills as well as Monk and Rogue skills.  I assume that there will be some &quot;general&quot; skills that all 3 melee classes can learn, as well as class specific skills.<br />
<br />
We know that some skills will be activated and others will require an event and then a twitch based player activation.  We know that not all skills will work for all events, and that position will affect how effective the skill was (no specification that position will open any new skills)<br />
<br />
Known Skills- Warrior<br />
Stun<br />
some sort of aggro dot (hate over few rounds, perhaps increased hate per combat hit?)<br />
some sort of Mob AC decrease (makes it easier for the group to hit the NPC)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Skills we'd like to see:<br />
Warrior<br />
Activatable, ranged aggro - believe this is self explanatory<br />
<br />
Some avoidance/mitigation effect, Event = Dual Wield check<br />
While dual wielding, you can perform an &quot;exceptional off hand strike&quot; that when you twitch the button, prevents mob from Riposting for X seconds.  This would help prevent spiky riposte dmg while dual wielding.  Hopefully, while dual wielding, the skill goes off enough that the riposte dmg from dual wielding is reduced down to what it is using 2handers.  This helps War DPS and aggro by itself, and may even give some warriors a reason to buy the Ambidexterity AA.<br />
<br />
some sort of cripple affect, activated<br />
akin to /shield in spirit but different in use.  Skill is used on mob A, warrior flings himself in front of mob, reducing the mobs damage output but increasing warriors damage received.  it can be 50/75 just like shield is, just without the akward /targetting issues.  hell just call this shield and call it a day.<br />
<br />
obviously some sort of rage effect, self haste<br />
<br />
some sort of temporary stat increaser,<br />
<br />
perhaps some sort of grapple/snare effect?<br />
<br />
something that allows a check to dodge attacks from behind? <br />
<br />
all warrior effects that generate aggro should be just as effective from all angles.  being the king of combat should mean something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks<br />
I don't know much about monks.  I would assume that most of their effects should be DPS increasing, and that they should be more effective from the rear than the front, perhaps 75% are rear attacks and 25% frontal? the 25% frontal being more about raising their AC/ability to take hits and less about raising their DPS? as long as the frontal ones do not suck completely or making them vastly superior at tanking I don't see a problem with it.<br />
<br />
Probably most important monk skill which would give them a role again would be this:<br />
<br />
Comatose, event = Feign Death (or rather, its only activatable from FD position, but it always activated, no need for an 'exceptional' FD)<br />
wipes Hate list, costs a metric shit ton of Endurance similiar to Fading Memories.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
Rogue attacks should be primarily about raising their DPS.  They should be most effective from the rear arc.  <br />
<br />
an example defensive skill for them:<br />
<br />
Evasion, event= parry/riposte/dodge (ensures can only happen if rogue is being attacked)<br />
if an exceptional dodge, parry, or riposte occurs (any of the 3, so more chances of occuring) then rogue can twitch click his evasion skill to reduce his hate by XXX amount.<br />
<br />
example offensive skill:<br />
<br />
impale, event = backstab<br />
twitch button hit and gives chance for rogue to immediately backstab again (ungreys button).  because backstab is on a timer this 'exceptional backstab' will not go off that often but due to RNG its possible for 3 or more backstabs in a row (extremely rare).<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, please add your own thoughts about skills that Melees should get to even the playing field against all classes.  remember Melees are unbalanced compared to Hybrids, which are weak compared to Casters.  The end result should leave all classes balanced against each other, which requires melees to be brought up above where hybrids are now, not just &quot;equal to.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pure melees need the ability to attack through defensive aa in pvp vs casters/hybrids.  They are pathetically underpowered.  For example with 2200 full buffed attack i hit a full defensive aa druid about 50% of the time for an average hit of 90ish.  I hit int casters for about 130, but for the most part with avoidance ect a caster with forceshield can forceshield+ds tank me for a significant amount of time.  Yes this is with using blade of war, and vanazir isnt much better.  Now add a warrior vs an sk who has 6k mana and an unresistable 450 point tap, assuming average elemental mr focus, + 1800+ ac and 9500+hps buffed.  Can you say unbalanced?  Now take a monk whose dps is a bit higher but has 2k less hps, or a rogue who has 2k less hps and is forced to use dual wield on a high end char with a 10+ point ds, or a rogue vs a druid with a 53 pt self cast ds and no stun ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I don't know much about monks.

<br />
<br />
Monks, as described by Scott Hartsman are supposed to be the most effective melee damage from &quot;any angle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning we should be effective, good, HIGH DPS from both the front and the back, IF we're to be in line with the so-called CLASS VISION that was fed to us after the nerf.<br />
<br />
&quot; the 25% frontal being more about raising their AC/ability to take hits and less about raising their DPS? as long as the frontal ones do not suck completely or making them vastly superior at tanking I don't see a problem with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The issue is more with getting rid of penalties for attacking from the front rather than making monks tank from the front.<br />
<br />
In other words, monk DPS improvements should be useful from all angles. And monks should be able to utilize attacks from all angles with less of a penalty than they currently face (i.e. do something about the damn ripostes).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Comatose, event = Feign Death (or rather, its only activatable from FD position, but it always activated, no need for an 'exceptional' FD)<br />
wipes Hate list, costs a metric shit ton of Endurance similiar to Fading Memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
We'll see if they think that too.<br />
<br />
But definitely interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see, thank you for the Monk insight.  Also thank you for the view from the PVP world, I never thought about that at all, they are both similiar tho, and that is overcoming mob defenses.<br />
<br />
for General Melee abilities, how about skills similiar to +strikethrough?  how about constant effects? such as lvl based + Strikethrough for melee classes? +10 strikethrough at 65 natural, can learn skill at lvl 20  at +1 strike through and scale it up from there?<br />
<br />
for Warriors, monks, and Rogues, if the mob parries/dodges/ripostes you're attack, you get a chance to perform an exceptional attack?<br />
<br />
If mob Parries, then twitch = guranteed riposte next mob attack?<br />
if mob dodges, then twitch = trip mob? (1ft KB+FD effect), or a shield bash, or something?<br />
*If mob Ripostes, then twitch = riposte the riposted attack?<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit just realized that couldn't work since the return hit is instantly, you'd never have time to hit the button.  how about an activated skill for all melee, as follows:<br />
<br />
Uncounterable defense, activated<br />
this skill lasts until toggled off or until Endurance points are exhausted.  while using this skill, the character will automatically dodge all riposte's that would have hit him.  each attack that is dodged in this manner takes some amount of Endurance points that is some ratio of the damage that was negated.  a level 65 melee could dodge riposted damage all day long from greens, but against a mob like RZ or Quarm would not have the endurance to last very long at all (not to mention that /defensive will now use endurance so it would have to be sort of a pick and choose thing).<br />
<br />
<br />
Little rough but maybe we can work on these and add new ones to help SOE come up with something, since I doubt they've really considered alot of these other than just + damage /yawn.</div></div><hr />
