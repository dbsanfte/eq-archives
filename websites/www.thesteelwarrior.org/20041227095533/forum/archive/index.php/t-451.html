We've had like half the forice die on a bad pull but still beat him with like 25 or os...<br />
<br />
Real one I hate, so we usually only due him when we have a lot and just burn him... But it definatly doesnt take 100... Easily beatable with 50, and beatable with a lot less also  once you get strat down... Just an annoying mob to learn the strat due to no good palce to CR</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shadowstep as far as I know is just one of his things. Take advantage that he's rooted and doesnt summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no real strat but to spread out as much as possible so he doesnt gank everyone with a single bow shot. i saw him go down yesturday to about 45 i think it was by another guild.<br />
<br />
really a caster fight, melee are just there to distract him while they do the real dmg. <br />
<br />
ive had one bow shot strip off 8 buffs, dispell is so ebil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard some people set up a paladin/SK or 2 in the middle of the room and chainstun etc to get agro and keep him facing the middle and on them. Clerics stand outta the AE range(biggest dmg one is only 50 feet from targetted person).<br />
<br />
 1st time we killed him was with 62 and we actually melee'd him down. It was ugly and took 2-3 tries. And from there on we figured out to just use archery. Have done em with as few as 43 I think, and with a big ranger/wizard force I imagine 4 groups could do him with some luck.</div></div><hr />
