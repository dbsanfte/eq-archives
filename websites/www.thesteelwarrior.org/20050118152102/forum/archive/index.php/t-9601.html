&lt;-- My magelo is up to date so I'd like a few recommendations from the experts out there in (A) which items/slots to upgrade first and (B) what to upgrade them with.  Drops I could get with a reasonable group would be fine but saving &amp; buying is also an option.<br />

I believe I'm right in suggesting that at your level, with your present magelo and budget, your first priority should be to obtain a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />

I'll probably wait on my Gloves because they're also my Haste item until I can afford a different/better one.<br />
<br />
So Boots &amp; Bracers before any other slot?  I thought maybe a new Earring or Shoulder before Boots?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah since champion boots is a very small progression from yours you can wait longer and thus get better earrings/shoulders but your gloves are really bad so you have to find a new haste and new gloves. <br />
when your visible slots are weaker than the unvisibles you have to rethink your item evaluation because it's much easier to get upgrade for visible slots usually. Moreover a lvl 55 warrior with so few visible plate armor will be rejected easily during the LFG procedure.<br />
BTW, I made a mistake, it's not your wirsts but one wirst and your arm that is weak. and the champion vambrace is much much better than yours (which isn't your haste item so you have no excuse this time).<br />
<br />
so if you can afford it buy a soulscream belt so that you can focus on your two weakest slot : gloves and vembraces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, although the droga pair would be a good bet eventually, I'd suggest another course for now: get the Great Staff of Thunder for a couple of hundred plat and use it to tank. <br />
Start saving your plat now. You mention 5K, but you really need 20-30K (on my server) for 31-36% haste. Or, start whining to your guildmates about how it's time to go to Veksar or Sirens Grotto to get your own. Looting your own haste 31 or 34 or 36 percent haste saves you a LOT of farming at 55.<br />
if you get haste in your belt slot, you can upgrade the AC in your hands. you've got a weak bracer, and could use better ear pieces, boots...uh, well, your BP is good. Do the bazaar search thing, and search by AC.<br />
You might be worried about your low 2hb skill and using the GSoT, but it will only hurt your dps, not your aggro. You have mighty strike, so if you want to practice your skills, head to the ice giants in Everfrost, get the back camp, kill giant, bind wound, rinse and repeat. the giants will be light blue and darkblue; you'll weapons skill-ups, fair loot for 55, and there's a zoneline right nearby (you shouldn't need it, but it's there).<br />
Try to get a feel for what your weakest pieces are and upgrade with an eye toward best bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uganok</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saw the Armguards of Repentance (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30536) for sale in the bazaar for 4k, down from the 10k+ they had been so snatched it up.  I've been thinking about buying a cheap Greatstaff of Thunder and then trying to camp the Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt  (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6279) as my new Haste item next.  Or perhaps I should just farm plat and buy a Sword of the Bloodsworn &amp; Copper Hammer of Striking instead?  Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the CHoS / SotB is better than GSoT but cost more so you can start with the staff (you will keep it nevertheless so why not buying it first).<br />
But if you have aggro you will die fast with your gear so maybe getting this nice arm then farming the belt then buying the aggro weapon then farming champion or better might be your better plan.<br />
Nevertheless warrior's gears are very very costly above lvl 60 so you really need to think of pp farming at one point if you can't gears with your group/raid.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the suggestion!  I didn't know about the Champion armor but after looking it up online think it might be possible with a few friends to help.  Unless there is better armor that's easier or as easy to get at level 55?<br />

Thanks!<br />

kael is fun. i wish ( on test ) i could drag more people to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Shik. Taking a mid-50s group into Kael is fun. i'm a little reluctant to suggest champions as a normal upgrade progression, because the parts of kael you can deal with just won't drop the quest armor bits that often, and it can be hard to drag people there just to exp/loot (as opposed to raid). But when I can go and when I can get some friends to go, I enjoy it.</div></div><hr />
