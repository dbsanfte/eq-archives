<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has just recently entered EPs, we have 11 active warriors on our roster. Thankfully I'm up the top of the pecking order, being our best geared Tank and a raid leader. I normally tank any first encounter mobs but will rotate MT duties around as best I can on subsequent attempts, try and give everyone a shot at it. My question is, how have other guilds dealt with having to many of a particular class? A guild really doesnt need more than 5-6 active warriors and the thought of trying to gear up 11 warriors (we're a merit based guild) is not pleasant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stop recruiting them? Start getting to many stop the recruiting. Not much you can do unless you can boot some out for being craptastic. Most people join guilds for gear, if they don't get it they get pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a time when we had a lot of inactivity due to real life matters and such, so we sort of accepted some extra warriors here and there that were more actively playing (raid and grouping). However, as luck would have it, most of the real life matters got sorted out, so suddenly we have a splurge of warriors active once more. I can only guess the headache that would arise when we finally get our first BoW to drop (grrr crappy drop rates). So yeah, I'm curious too, are there many other guilds out there with lots of warriors that are actively raiding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, you dont need 12 warriors for EP farming. But looking ahead, there are many encounters that in some parts requires a good amount of tanks.<br />
<br />
Uqua, Inktuta, and many of the Txevu/Tacvi events requires/benefits from 5-6 warriors at each raid imo. And to consistantly hit that number you need 10 warriors on your roster.<br />
<br />
A common scenario in Txevu/Tacvi atm seems to be Boss + 2-4 flurrying adds that need offtanking with defensive. So basically you need 2-3 Wars for MT rota on boss, and 1-2 wars pr add(+ a shitload of clerics, but thats a different topic :p)<br />
<br />
IMO just stop recruiting more warriors, sooner or later some of them will quit and you will reach a more reasonable amount of warriors(9-10 or so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tunk, we are a modified DKP guild, so we're kinda the same.. ish. Lotsa warriors. <br />
<br />
I'm our MT and our raidleader so sometimes items can be awarded to me (still at lootcost) over, say, a bard. <br />
<br />
You need to think, do you want to have Fennin dead in 2 weeks, or do you want to have to farm for 3 months, but by the end of 3months, EVERYONE being *geared very well* ?<br />
<br />
In the end everyone's 10k. And, in the end, everyone quits. Any guild who beats a gatekeeper mob will see attendance taper off afterwards... so your warrior population will fix itself.<br />
<br />
I would go against recruiting more warriors. Set the requirements for warriors to your best warrior - for example, we don't want many more warriors, so any warrior short of 9.5khp buffed, sturdy3 wa3 all aa is useless to us. (ele flagged, too) that way, if you get any more war, they rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Rathe Council is real warrior heavy, and now that we can incite to hold agro, we also fulfill the tank mezzing duties exceptionally well since we can cycle Evasive.<br />
<br />
Also because the Councilmen quad fast for ~3000.  You definitely want a Warrior to Furious/Defensive all that shit on inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as long as you have people showing up and no one is left out it's nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
if it wasn't plate molds it would be chain or cloth or leather classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild has 9 warriors on our roster atm if I remember right, and it seems to be just about right... currently clearing Time and working through GoD. I think we had a couple more when we were in elementals and you better believe we used every single one we could get online when we did Rathe Council.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gundahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As more warriors you get, as harder it's to gear them up. When you are in a common dkp guild and have to compete with other classes, you have to play more than your average guildmate who isn't depending on stuff as you are.<br />
<br />
So how to deal with it, when you already got a bunch of them ? First build a core with the diligent ones who are raiding every day and let them do tank duties in rotation - it raises their motivation when they feel needed and they learn to replace each other. Ignore the lazy fucks with higher absence and exclude them from every task. After a while one or another of these may get disatified and hit rl. Once you shrinked your class to a reasonable size, set high requirements for new recruits, not only about stats but also on playtime. It's better to discourage someone than creating wrong expectations and end up with some casual player who is of no use and just blocks a spot in raid the days he shows up or grabs loot what would be more effective on someone else.<br />
<br />
Being class leader for more than a year now and this method works quite well. We have 6 active warriors and one on break, all geared up with nearly similiar stats and a very high attendance. I won't add another one as long as he don't fit among his mates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xolerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild has a roster of 16 warriors (the only high level asian guild and in Time) and I would say at least 11 HARDCORE (75% or more raids) warriors. For sure it is hard to equip we all. We cleared Time up to 5 times now (including Quarm) only 1 armguards of brute and 1 boots of despair, no helm, no darkblade, no greaves....It is sad but I I like it, for sure will take a LOT of time to equip all raiding warriors but like people said here, people come and go, and at a certain point some will quit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cruel perhaps but very well put Gundahar.  If you try to please everyone, you are bound to fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Transfer to saryrn and join my guild? We need 2 more warriors heh, a total of 4 warriors, 4 wizards, 1 bard, 8 clerics, 8 druids, 6 monks, 8 beastlords, 3 enchanters, 6 shamans, 4 necromancers, 4 rogues, 3 pallies, 3 sk's, 3 rangers..<br />
<br />
Average raids of 42 people max, plenty of loot to go around due to our low numbers, thus we gear up faster (also we dont limit mobs like seru, cursed, shei, etc.. we still kill them for one or two items for each person).<br />
<br />
Killed Fennin Ro and gotten this far with these numbers, So like I said, if you dont find a solution on your server (either warriors being removed, inactive or something of the sort) leave the idea to server xfering to join CA in the corner of your head =p <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh ya and the reason we have such low numbers is because were picky with who we pick up. The anti-idiot rule took effect somewhere after we were clearing ssra out with 16-24 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">IMO just stop recruiting more warriors <br />
<br />
This is the part that cracks me up about high end raiding guilds and warrs.  It also is the reason there is so much politics at the high end with warrs...too few spots for too popular a class (especially when you include people who have abandoned their native class to pursue warrior MA glory).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We have 16 active warriors on our roster, but we are a 3 guild alliance whos members are somewhat casual about attendance (prob 50% attendance is average), so we get 7-8 per raid normally. We've not had any problems getting people geared up really, I tend to be the warrior lead on raids I attend and I rotate people in depending on the encounter. I think most are happy with the shots at tanking they get and understand why some warriors tank certain things over them. Just be up front about it and try to motivate your people to get some gear outside of raids, GoD has a lot of elemental+ quality items that are farmable with 1 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We had about 12 warriors just as we ended EP and were entering Time, but as the months wore on we lost warrior after warrior...and then as we entered GoD we lost even more...nowadays we get about 4 for GoD raids and about 6 or 7 for Time (mostly cos its a fixed day and ppl know to log in) So my advice is keep warr apps open, but only for exceptional cases (ie ppl u wont have to flag or gear up as much) As you play over the next few months you'll be glad of the extra warriors...we've had to reopen our warr apps to try and get more to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this is more a matter of game-design. While you don't have any player-limit on pop-raids, it comes down to 72 once you reach time and later there are 54 spots left. You can't fill half of your raid just with tank-classes and you also knights who like to be in. So you have to keep focus on a few good warriors and being picky with new invites. It doesn't help anyone when half of them can't attend later for the limitations in GoD.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's cruel, I would call it ... reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't think it's cruel, I would call it ... reasonable. <br />
<br />
I never said it was cruel.  Just amusing.<br />
<br />
You also completely missed my point which has zip to do with you.</div></div><hr />
