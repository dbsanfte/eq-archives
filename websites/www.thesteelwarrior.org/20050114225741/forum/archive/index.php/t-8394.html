<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ansoul</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings my Fellow Warlords of New Sebilis, and soft skined warriors  I returned 2 months ago to Norath after leaving right after Luclin came out.  I left because the Lego mancatcher was the farthest our class quests went, sony finished the quest lines so here I stand bearing my Pride.<br />
<br />
With my absence for so many months my knowledge of gear is sourly lacking so I come before you to ask advice on what I should quest for or kill to gain better equiptment.  As of right now I am working on the necciary faction to start the Ethereal Bladed Naginata quest, most items gathered and smithing is high enough to forge it as Trivial.  I will not be doing my Epic Weapon quest unless the Epic 2 turns out to be Piercer.  I my be gimping myself but my primary weapon will be a poker of one kind or another from now until the day I again leave Norath for the final time.<br />
<br />
Keys - only for Old Sebilis atm, Though working on Vex, VP, Ssra Emperor's at the moment.<br />
<br />
Flags only PoJ at the moment though should be getting the rest of Teir 1 flags within the next week and half.<br />
<br />
I dont have any coin to afford an upgrade for much of anything 1436 plat to be exact.  So also would be looking for a suggestion as to a place to farm with my gear that i could solo at.  Aside from velium in velks as thats how i got all the plat that I do. selling it to venders as I dont want to start smithing it just yet.<br />
<br />
As for my guild, i dont exactly know what our exact full power is, Ive seen us kill Trakkanon, the Overlord in the LoY Mines, and a couple of Luclin name's (such as the one i got my BP from), Epic fights are generally done with a group.  PoP wise I know a couple are in Time, a handfull are Elemental, and most are somewhere between where I am and Elemental Flaged.   So From that I can make the assumption that most mobs Old World, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, LoY would be easy enough to kill and get a chance for a drop from them.<br />
<br />
I do have Narandi's Lance in my Vault waiting for when I gain another 3 more levels, Just included in my inventory to show that I have it.  <br />
<br />
I do not have a 1hs atm as my copper hammer of striking is better then the Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood which I replaced it with and then passed on my axe to another warrior.<br />
<br />
Basically my role in raids is 4th tank.  My goal is to be MA or SA at the least.  I did manage to get argo from the Overlord and Ragefire without taunting or provoking for a few moments, before our dwarf (ma) got it back both times.  So I know I can build argo pritty well and keep it if i wanted to.    Gear wise I think what I need is more HPS and a bit better ac.  Buffed I just bairly break 5k hps.   <br />
<br />
Any Suggestions or Advice that any of you could offer would be greatly appriceated.<br />

Before anyone says something about the name. My Former Iksar warrior Ssisal of Emar was granted that sir-name by Lord Valtron when he gained his Legionnaire Mancatcher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Valorium rings for your fingers.<br />
Earring of the solstice(quest) and Lupine Frenzy earring(ldon drop) until you can upgrade to Bloodmetal earrings.<br />
<br />
You could take a group to The Deep and camp Inscribed Mask of the Beyond http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62224 . Greebam the Lost drops it and his placeholder isn't far from the zone in. At your level the group would be getting decent exp too.<br />
<br />
If you do LDoNs much then getting enough points to buy an Everfrost bracer to replace the Bracer of Scavenging is an upgrade that will last you a good long while and will let you save your money for less easily upgraded items. <br />
<br />
This is just my opinion but sell your drogmor drum back and use the money to get a bow with stats. The bow I currently have should be available for less than what you get back for that drum.<br />
<br />
As far as farming goes to raise bazaar cash don't overlook Upper Guk. The spiders there are static spawns and drop plenty of silk. They run and you won't get exp but they'll provide you a means of generating some income when you're solo.<br />
<br />
That should get you started :)</div></div><hr />

Just curious here, how come?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ansoul</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice mask there that sounds like a plan.<br />
<br />
I dont really like LDoN's all that much infact havnt done once since level 30 was going to wait until 65 to do them as point wise that seems to be the better route to go.<br />
<br />
Last night I gave my Wind-worn BP to another iksar warrior that was using Ry'Gorr, as I had no use for it and hate selling things in the bazaar.  He gave me a Bracer of the Forgotten War.<br />
<br />
I do have that +2 dex bow that comes from getting the Seb Key parts.  I like the drogmor just because my character when sitting on it, with a shrink seems to regen hps as though I am sitting so its great to use any time a shammy is in the group and on any raid thats not underground.  I dont use a bow to pull, if I do have to pull I just throw a stone,  Generally though either the ranger in my normal party or the cleric in the normal party will pull.<br />
<br />
As for upper Guk I know those spiders very very well, I used to make combine there silks and sell the swaths as well as the brewing tannin over in East Commons before luclin.  I dont really want to do any tradeskilling in EQ though. Smithing for my two spears is enough.  If I want to do a tradeskill I'll log into Horizons or a couple of the games that im beta-testing.<br />
<br />
Reason for using a spear primary is a couple fold.  First of since 1987 been playing DnD in one form or another. Ive allways used a spear for my characters.  That habit followed me into Single player games and then into MMORPGs, even so much so that I ended up making a Huntress for Shadowbane durring the beta and after it went gold.  She is very very effective. I just like spears alot IRL I make and bring about a dozen or so to sell every time i go to a Renn Faire.  <br />
<br />
Considering the best weapon I know of right now is my Pride of the Legion, which IS a spear.. Im going to follow that route.  I dont care what weapon is offhand, probally the best weapon i can afford at the moment or can camp either solo with with a group or two of guildies.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responces.. Any other thoughts or suggestions feel free.</div></div><hr />

From an EQ player point of view you're pretty much nerfing yourself.  AFAIK all the best warrior weapons are either slashing or blunt.  Would be kinda cool if they'd whip out a pericing weap with Enraging Blow on it.</div></div><hr />

aye you sure can with LDoN.  But w/o a modified proc rate the Pride is not any better aggro than the droga weapons.  Would be lower DPS too I'd imagine.  There is a 1hp that drops in Chardokb that proc's a 0.0sec stun as well so you can dual wield stun piercers  :D</div></div><hr />
