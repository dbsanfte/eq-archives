<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I reading the forum espically the library, claiming that Cultural Armor is a good goal, and someone looked at my stuff and said that i should go for the Dark Prince Regent top of the Line Culteral Armor for my Dark Elf Innoruck Warrior. I hook up with a smith and spend all day yesterday camping stupid essesne of shadow the hardest item to get to make this stuffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I went by this written by Raaj:<br />
<br />
Next step and the Last one I will cover for now: Myrmidon/Warlord/Tradeskill<br />
<br />
Myrmidonarmor is the result of the Dragon quests in Velious. Much hp on this set of armor to gain this armor you need to kill in the Halls of Testing and return three gems along with unadorned plate to Skyshrine. This armor is Multi-questable but you need ally faction before you can think about getting this armor.<br />
<br />
Warlord armor is the result of the Giant quests in Velious. This armor is nice for people who dream about AC all night long. To get this armor you need to kill in the ToV. and turn in the ancient tarnished armor with three gems in Kael. This armor is Multi-questable but you need ally faction.<br />
<br />
Trade skill armor is where things get a bit touchy. Stats on these armor sets are comparable to the other sets at this level and in some instances better than the other two. For the full lowdown on these armors look at EQ Traders under the Cultural and Cazic Thule recipes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I look really close at the Dark Prince stuffs and the only POSSIBLE upgrades to what I have now (see my link) are a bracer and the arms. Really the Arms are about it, I just say the bracers are viable as nothing is really easy available thats better. Although the BP appears better then what I have now keep in mind I have a wind worn chestplate or perless dragonhide bp I can use. <br />
<br />
Prices have just come down to far other items now days to make cultural armor viable (no resists I might add - and why does all the stuff have wisdom instead of strenght or something), at least the Dark Prince stuffs. You can put together a bazzar potporie like I did and get way better total specifications then going with culteral armor.......<br />

All other Cultural is mostly lacking. You are correct, there will be a couple upgrades.<br />
<br />
FH and HT armor have a ton of pure HPS, which serve very well when you max out your stamina.<br />

I doubt he meant the Innoruuk stuff.</div></div><hr />

it's like a buffet table; pick and choose or those who aren't RZ/Trib.</div></div><hr />

You then said you had a Peerless Dragonhide BP you were selling for 30kpp and wearing Indicolite.<br />
<br />
The Step #1 upgrades I suggested were abolutely upgrades given what YOU SAID you were wearing.<br />
<br />
Naturally enough, the Step #2 upgrades are better.<br />
<br />
However, I can appreciate your concern about &quot;bad advice&quot;. To help you avoid it, no more advice of any kind will come from this quarter.<br />

<br />
.... Well I have all 3 BP's and 2 of the 3 will fit on the cleric, none have sold.<br />

Lose 15Str, 10sta, (assumimng agi and dex are same 'value&quot;), 10dex<br />
<br />
It really dosn't look like all that much of an upgrade expically considering that the Indicolite cannot be sold.... but its close, some would say that even 1 additional AC is an upgrade, I have spent more to upgrade less in the past thats for sure.<br />
<br />
Thats the BP slot. This DPR armor, cept for the arms and bracer, is not all that good to say the least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step #1 - as soon as you are of sufficient level<br />
<br />
Sell the Blood Earring of Rage, Bracer of Quickness, and all of your armor except the Helm of Raldukan and for now the Rock-Molded Wristguard.<br />
<br />
Replace it with a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, Bracer of Fortitude, and Dark Prince Regent Armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
But Battleblade, I did take your Excellent advise, as you can see, as to add a Bloodmetal ear and DPR bracer, thanx, solid suggestions there.<br />
<br />
Also there is probably a lot of unfamilerarity with DE innoruk stuff, I mean if you were going to start a warrior, I kinda think that DE innoruk we be pretty far down the list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well anyway live and learn, DPR is just not all that good anymore...... Just to much other items has entered the game...</div></div><hr />

Personally, I would go with the DPR BP vs. Indico... you box a shammy doncha?  With shammy lubbins you are so close to capping STA.<br />
<br />
Also, any slot without hps is virtually a wasted slot... vis a vis IGS.  Pick up chokidai hide spaulders, sell the IGS, get the DPR BP and see yourself with +95hps and better AC... Also I wouldn't give up 13 AC for 5 hps... i.e. your steel wrapped legs.  SS quest gaunts &gt; indico as well.  Also with LDON the crinose cape of the werewolf 80hp back slot is sweet and better than the pern cloak as you approach maxing STA.</div></div><hr />

Nice item but I am never going to use things with negative stats...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also someone said that 1 AC = 6 HP in another thread (I ahve no idea why that is) but if its true the IGS are like 90HP better than the CHS.<br />
<br />
But then using that the DPR greaves are better then the Steel Wrap... more to concsider for sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya true on the back but I am not max str yet, but good idea (or hero cloack) when the time comes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well if 1 AC = 6 HP then some of the DPR stuffs is looking much better.</div></div><hr />

Steps to take with your tardbot:  Sort armor items by slot and ac / hp in bazaar, find what is the best bang / buck<br />
 Sell your stat crap items, all you should care is HP AC<br />
 Realize you are in for the long haul, your war will suck nuts without the aa's to go with good gear. Prolly suck nuts from lack of controll anyway<br />

That way if you are looking at 2 pieces of armor, one with more AC, one with more HP, you can get an idea of which one is better. Generally, people throw around 1ac=10hp, but it varies.</div></div><hr />

Dont even bother with a BP. <br />
Good BPs are VERY VERY hard to find by design.<br />
<br />
I wore the crappy ac30 str9 hp50 from velketor until deep into my lvl60.<br />
You should probably do the same, will save you a lot of plat &amp; time.<br />
<br />
BP are a pain to upgrade and upgrading by small leaps aint worth it.<br />
Get a &quot;crappy to decent BP&quot; then wait for one you can keep for ever.<br />
<br />
Thurg/SS/Kael would be an alternative almost for ever<br />
(NFC on MQ on ur server, or if u want to camp thurgadim one)<br />
(Buying a Vindicator from a guild no longuer needing them ?)<br />
(Gank some BoT mini for that Droppable plate BP later ?)<br />
<br />
Just look for 2 things  :  AC &amp; HP  (in no particular order)<br />
<br />
All other stats (well exept stamina) are totally useless<br />
Or have an impact way too small to be of any importance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : If u plan to keep your warrior my advice would be to have<br />
some very unbalanced gear, thus easy to upgrade.<br />
Which seems is what you are doing (bloodmetal/gallantry etc)<br />
<br />
Dont forget some slots since they dont have &quot;PoP Dropable&quot;<br />
equivalent, are insanely hard to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If 1AC = 10HP (again how is this calculated) then suddenly the DPR stuffs is looking really good, as is cobalt.<br />
<br />
How is that figure derived?<br />
<br />
Well I gonna get the smith to make a few slots, bracer and arms for sure and maybe BP or Legs, and that kinda end the armor side of it.<br />
<br />
Saving up for Split Blade right now, one for sale for 40K gots to come ups with the cash though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Gimmel stated on the first page, the 1 raw ac = 10 hp equation was just an artificial means of judging two seemingly equal pieces of equipment.<br />
<br />
Cobalt will almost never look good when compared to other bazaar items. It's heavy, has next to no stats (none on most pieces, though the bp and legs are very attractive) and it has effects that are rather useless in the modern Norrath.<br />
<br />
As far as weapons go, for the price of the SBoD you can easily get a SotB and a CHoS, which are far better aggro weapons. If you're botting multiple wizards, you're going to want the aggro control more than the stats and the pretty graphic (otherwise, you're looking at mopping up wizard paste all night).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SotB and a CHoS, I had that and then got a SoLightning. In other threads I expalined why I dont think I need the random agro lock that the two procing weapons produce (basically I prefer to rely on DPS to get agro, as I can count on that). <br />
<br />
Chanter is puller and has a spell taht will reduce his agro by 50percnet, also there is spell taht increase warrior agro 10percent, given i just pull with a sinlge slow the chanter can hold his own (2000HP in runes, not to mention 3400HP with virute and a cleric to heal - and keep in mind the most important thing, the mob is slowed......) more then long enough for the warrior to get DPS / taunt agro. Once the warrior has agro none of the toons do anything until mob is like 72percent HP then the wizards can open up and almost never get agro... just wan tto get up the warrior DPS to make that &quot;get to 72 percent HP&quot; time go faster. <br />
<br />
SBoD and SoL should provide better dps then the agro weapons.<br />
<br />
Also remember before the warrior the wizard was my tank, I am used to wizards taking PHAT damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well the big question is is the 10Hp = 1AC accurate, I mean is it just a complete guess or does one AC save you 10HP of damage over a 2-3 mintues fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 AC at one time =6hp. Guess that changed. And sam. Stats are nice to have on armor. And as a DE your going to need stats. But you have to remember that you can get buffs to max your stats everytime(or come close hopefully) But base hp is normally what you are going to want from your items. At least thats my opinion. Get an A Amygdalan's Face Mask (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27867). Nice hp etc. And for a quick cheap neck item get a Clattering Bone Necklace (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6418) Other then that just wait until you hit 55 and go spend some of that plat you got on ornate.</div></div><hr />

I sure wish I know if 10HP = 1AC is accurate or not, heh. Ya I saw the mask, its like 18Kish... migth be a good item. My grimling contraption is like 50K (edit 50HP its like 8K cost lol) so its not to bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ouch expensive server. Think Amygdalan is 17ishk on our server, and the grimling contraption is 8k. As for the AC=hp. Pretty sure its a safe assumption to assume 1ac=6 or 7 hp. But I have heard that PoP mobs dont make an AC check. I dont know if thats true, but it is what I heard yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I plan on hunting PoP almost exclusivly... don't make a AC check lol humm that should be easy to test.... How come parses show that there is mitigation in PoP above 1200AC (I read that shomewhere) then... <br />
<br />
Well back to the level grind....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelissa</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any AC to HP conversion is based on the assumption that the two items are built in a balanced fashion and that your gear without the upgrade is also balanced.  To get a better estimate, you need to compare the AC of everything you have to the raw HP of everything you have and then weight that based on the ATK and damage output of the mobs you're planning on fighting.   Other stats aren't as critical (except as they convert to AC and HPs) but can definately weight a decision that would otherwise be close.<br />
<br />
If you have really high AC on most pieces, HPs gain in the ratio.  If you have really high HPs on most pieces, AC gains.  Once you've hit the AC soft cap of what you're going to fight, HPs are pretty much all you need to consider (the soft cap is based on the monster's ATK rating ... that's at least one reason why it's different in PoP than in older expansions).  In short, it's a balancing act.  There's no one simple equation that will answer the question for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall I think Fierce heraldric has about 500+ hp's for the whole set. But has less AC then the others. Not by alot, but by some. Warlord and Myrm has more AC but significantly less HP's. Has about 320+ for myrm and ~310 for Warlord. But neither matters cause your DE and arent RZ.</div></div><hr />
