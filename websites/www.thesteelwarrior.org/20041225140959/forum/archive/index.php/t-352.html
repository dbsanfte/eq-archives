<br />
Currently I don't have any weapons, just some no drop SS armour, haste item, that kinda stuff.<br />
<br />
I will be 2boxing with my bro a 60 cleric alot, as well as just raiding with peeps, Not MT. Only time I may tank would be an exp group, if such things exist :p <br />
<br />
KK to the POINT ... which do I go with ...<br />
<br />
1) Tae Ew 2handed Sword<br />
2) Narandi's Lance<br />
3) Wavecrasher / Frostbringer<br />
4) Frostbringer / Club of the Ice Ocean<br />
<br />
5) Your guys suggestions .... will have about 15k to spend (maybe more / maybe less)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, Sulace Blackrose 56th warrior</div></div><hr />

But, if it were me, I would get the Tae 2 hander and the Frostbringer/Club combo if it were possible.<br />
<br />
The 2 hander for two boxing and raiding (non MT) and the Frostbringer/Club for tanking exp groups when Tae 2 hander doesn't hold aggro well enough.<br />
<br />
This will probably run 15-20k though I would guess for all three.  Maybe less though if you wait for bargains in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frosty and CotIO is a nice combo I would imagine, and might even be viable in raid situations. I don't really like using 2 handers for their lack of speed, and not too reliable damage. If they hit in the upper part of their damage potential more often, I would be all over it. My 2h slashing skill is 250, so it's not like that is the problem either. Anyways, I would recomend the DW combo of frosty and CotIO</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with 2handers being slow, but I'm looking at 27-36%haste on top of the eyepatch (20% i think).<br />
<br />
You guys think a warrior with Frostbringer + CoIO would be able to deal enough damage without draining the cleric near death?<br />
<br />
Basically I'm worried that I'm gonna be a sponge (flash backs to the days of rangers getting taunt) hence why I put the wavecrasher in (possibility to slow 20%).<br />
<br />
Keep the juices flowing, and thanks again. Sulace Blackrose</div></div><hr />

<br />
This depends on what/where you are hunting.  I would say in nonPOP zones, SEB for example, you would be fine.  For POP, I am guessing you would soak up a lot of healing before anything ever died.  If you want to test this, go to POD and kill the Tsetsi flies straight out from the zone.  These are the weakest mobs I have encountered in PoP.  Velks would be another place I would think that you could duo without a large drain on the cleric.<br />
<br />
IMO the Wavecrasher is an aggro weapon purely from the proc.  A 9/19 weapon doesn't deal very good damage and that is what you need when duoing.  I personally would grab the best 2 hander I could get along with a Truncheon of Doom (50% slow and 33/44 2hb) if you need to slow mobs.  I use a ToD a lot swapping it with Prismatic 2 hander (45/44 2hs).  Sometimes I slow the mob almost immediately, other times I go the whole fight (doing subpar damage) without getting a proc.  Proc's are unrealiable at best and keep in mind I usually have a 200+ dex with Avatar on.  My point is that sometimes I would be better off trying to damage the mob as fast as possible instead of relying on a proc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cartolis</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at 58 in the top of the hole I can keep agg with the frost/club combo as long as my ranger behaves himself. only healer i have is a druid that has chloroblast.<br />
<br />
normally we can clear down to the ledge with minimal medding as long as the druid has a good kei.<br />
<br />
also have the lance for non mt situations. with a good haste it is nice, and the proc rate with haste is great.<br />
on a tt raid the other night It was swinging almost as fast as the club would have been and I was doubling for 250 or so. of course that was with uber raid buffage, but was still nice to see :)</div></div><hr />

Get them.<br />
Use them.<br />
Love them.<br />
<br />
I 2 Box with a cleric daily. These will be your 2 most used weapons, seriously.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with ToD and a decent 2her. <br />
<br />
stonebladed axe of dismay and reaver come to mind as being solid choices for damage.  since you aren't planning on MTing raids, i wouldn't sweat aggro weaps such as frosty or wavecrasher as you WON'T want aggro on raids and while two boxing you won't have the aggro competition.<br />
<br />
if you find that you are getting into more and more pickup groups, then you might consider going for a pure aggro combo.</div></div><hr />
