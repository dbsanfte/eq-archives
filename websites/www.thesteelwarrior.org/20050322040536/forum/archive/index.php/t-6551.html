This is due tomorrow and I screwed up big time by waiting until yesterday to start the last 2 pages and adding images.<br />
<br />
I'm taking a webpage development class in college this semester.  Earlier in the year we had to make a 3-page website.  I tried to think of something to do it on and I chose the warrior class.  I've been playing one now non-stop since early Velious and figured this would be informative to newer players.  Now it is time to extend on that project.  I had to add two more pages to it and add some images.  <br />
<br />
I was about to insert the images a few minutes ago then remembered that my nephew infected my virus with a computer over winter break making me reformat my computer.  When I reformatted, I lost over 400 screenshots.  That sucked.<br />
<br />
In these screenshots I had different ways to tank mobs (corner, wall-walk, firetruck, circle pin) and many others.<br />
<br />
This is where you come in!<br />
<br />
I'm looking for certain screenshots...<br />
<br />
An extreme high-end warrior<br />
An average warrior<br />
A low end warrior<br />
A raid mob being corner tanked<br />
A raid mob being Wall-Walked<br />
A raid mob being &quot;Fire Trucked&quot; (Not sure on official name)<br />
A raid mob being surrounded &amp; pounded<br />
A picture that says, &quot;Welcome to level 65&quot; (playtime not needed)<br />
A picture that says, &quot;Welcome to level 60&quot; (playtime not needed)<br />
A /who picture including a warrior<br />
A /who picture including a champion<br />
A /who picture including a myrmidon<br />
A /who picture including a warlord<br />
A /who picture including an overlord<br />
A picture of a text box when you rampage<br />
<br />
Fire Trucking = This is one of the more difficult methods of tanking. The reason for doing this method is if you are killing a caster mob. By keeping the mob moving, it will have a difficult time trying to cast spells upon you and your raid. In this method, the mob will NOT be touching a wall or corner. This technique only gets easier with practice of your raid force. When the mob is pulled into your camp, tag the mob as usual. Build up agro until you feel comfortable. Tell your raid to assist you on the mob. The mob will be pushed wildly in random directions the first few times you attempt this. Don't worry, its normal. Your responsibility is to hold agro and direct the mob's direction during this. Your entire raid will want to attack from the mobs backside and you will be walking backwards throughout the entire fight. Some tanks are random in the directions that they go. Some tanks prefer to just walk around backwards in a large circle. Some may even try to do a wall-walk without a wall! This method takes a little bit of time to get comfortable with, but in due time, it is very effective.<br />

Um, yeah :)<br />
<br />
And it's called tanking...walking a mob is just that, tanking.  No need to get elaborate with trucks and stuff :)</div></div><hr />

And thanks for making this a sticky topic.  I should be done with the last page in about an hour or so and these pictures are helpful.  The project is due in 3 hours.  Right now I'm working on the Alternate Advancement Points page.  I've covered the pros &amp; cons of playing a warrior, different types of warriors (high-end / average etc.), disciplines, and positions on mobs.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

It works fine.  The tank doesn't actually pull the mob around.  He just keeps backing up as the melees push it around.  If the rogs and monks are  paying attention they won't lose any dps.  &quot;Fire Trucking&quot; is kind of a cheesy name though :)  we always just called it &quot;walking&quot; the mob.</div></div><hr />

Do it in paint. Save as another type.</div></div><hr />

I guess its just called &quot;Fire Trucking&quot; on Fennin Ro for some reason.  The site looks nice and it should be graded sometime later this week.  You can un-sticky this or whatever if ya want.</div></div><hr />
