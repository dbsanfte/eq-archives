About ready to give up on pick up groups and just wait until I can get my friends to help me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't do trials with pick-up groups unless you are ready to be disappointed.  Most of the trials take some actual group play, and usually one screw up will kill your run.<br />
<br />
If you are just looking for a quick blast thru to get flagged for valor/storms, load up on 3 DPS types, one enchanter, one clreic, one tank and do the Trial of Execution.    If you aren't familiar with how they work, send me a tell Dobbo, I can give you some pointers on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was my last trial group:  uber 65 rogue, myself, 65 chanter, 61 cleric, 60 necro and 62 Druid.<br />
<br />
We almost lost on the 3rd mob of the 4th wave because someone sat down and the mob ran to them.  We almost lost on executioner when defensive wore off, rogue got low hp and died, druid died, but somehow, the cleric had enough mana to heal me once and we killed the exe after enrage wore off.<br />
<br />
To do the trials properly, you need loads of DPS, a decent tank, a cleric.  My best trail runs were:  me, 60 monk, 60 shaman, 60 ranger, 60 cleric, 62 beastlord.  We had so much time inbetween waves, cleric ended trial 70m.  There was much ass kicking going on there.<br />
<br />
Target fast, thats the best thing you can do as a tank, if you can, kill the rocks or the named mobs first.  it will save you head ache if you can have a mage or druid there to banish them as well.  Just make sure you and your group are familiar with each other, and are ready to die 10+ times to get it right.  Some times you just get lucky.  With the group that flagged me (60's + 62 beastlord), on the trial before we passed, our 4th wave was 4 rocks, I go dispelled to crap, lost all my buffs, and got eaten by the exe.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the ramble here, but way tired + message boards don't mix..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">me and some guildmates decided to play with the other trials (non-executioner) today. A buddy of mine wanted some help (57 warrior) getting PoV/S flagged so we decided to do a quick exe while we waited on a LD. our group was 3 65 warriors, 57 warrior, 64 cleric and 65 bard. <br />
<br />
with the /shield command, the warriors took turns shielding me for double DS (my ds, plus thier ds when mob hit them during shield) and the mobs were melting. hehe i never woulda thought 4 warriors a bard and a cleric would do so well. It wasn't even close and cleric was 90m by the time the Executioner spawned. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do trials with a mage, cleric and warrior. If we have any of these roles filled with experienced flaggers, the other 3 spots can be taken by just about any class / level and we succeed 99 % of the time. It's all about playing experience there... I swear to the gods our mages know the spawn and respawn times up to 0.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Tactic: Take a 7k+ 13kAC+ tank /w def AA's and shammy potion/mage DS for min. of 78hp DS.<br />
<br />
Cleri cast CelHeal just before spawns...  during wave only CelHeal if neccesary, CH between waves.<br />
<br />
Everyone else assists the first target called by the tank (using their assist key) and keeps on that target, even if tank switches. Casters use ~ 1 big bub of mana in nukes per wave, after first wave all casters 'rod so the rod becomes available just before named again. No-one sits when mobs spawn. <br />
<br />
@Thalzaar: I wish I'd tought of using shield that way.... LOL gonna try that next time we flag a warrior :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gloran1</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have been working through 20+ people in our guild for getting PoS/PoV flagged, and I swear by AoE (Area of Effect) groups.  <br />
<br />
Here is my group makeup:<br />
1) 65 Warrior (me)<br />
2) 65 Cleric (my wife)<br />
3) 65 Enchanter<br />
4) Wizard/Mage<br />
5) Wizard/Mage<br />
6) Anyone on Norrath who wants to be flagged :)<br />
<br />
So far this group has not failed a single time.  <br />
<br />
We all get into a small group in the center of the Exe room, with me sitting down.  When the mobs pop, they all run to me from sit aggro.  The enchanter chain stuns, while the AoEers nuke.  My job is to target the named mobs first, the rocks second, and the fiends last.  <br />
<br />
With this group, the hardest part is the first mob in each wave.  Once the first mob in each wave is dead, the second, third and fourth are low on HP's from the AoE and I finish them off one by one.  <br />
<br />
The key is to target fast and keep all the mobs in AoE range during the wave.  <br />
<br />
On our last trial run, just for fun, I did not hit Defensive on the Exe, my wife asked me if I was defensive, and I told her yes.  She was sweating wondering if the Exe had been beefed up in some way, and I just kept laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About ready to give up on pick up groups and just wait until I can get my friends to help me. <br />
<br />
I finally got thru the trials last week with a pickup group(first person in my small family guild flagged), so it is doable(group makeup was 61 war, 62 cleric, 65 ench, 62 shaman 2 62 mages), if you are patient and willing to accept <br />
alot  of failures.  From what I have seen, for your role as the tank what you need to do is this.<br />
<br />
1) Buy DS potions, both you and the enchanter at least should use them.<br />
<br />
2) Target fast.  I moved the select closest NPC key to the delete key on my keyboard, so it was right by the arrow keys and handy for me.  I would switch targets actually before mob had completely dropped, unless it was close.  Let the pet's finish it off.<br />
<br />
3) Have a &quot;I am slowed&quot; hotkey.  Make sure a priest has a cure up when you go in.<br />
<br />
4) Don't panic.  If your enchanter is AE tashing and AE stunning, he is going to get hit much more than you.  Cleric should know that and be prepared.  Nothing you can do to keep him getting hit, so let it happen.  I did not get my first in fight heal until we where on prime executioner, but with all the chain stunning, and therefor mobs not hitting anyone much, cleric was at 95 % mana once we got there.<br />
<br />
5) And do not get discouraged.  I took a month off playing my Warrior due to shear frustration with trying to get flagged.  I came back and third try in first trials group got thru.  Only one person in the group was over 62(the enchanter), the group included a shaman(who are not normally considered a DPS/good trial class), only the cleric and enchanter where already flagged and it was not even close, in fact it was easy.  <br />
<br />
Most of the(many) failures I had came from either poor coordination with the group(takes a couple tries to get it right), not targetting fast enough(simply cannot afford lost seconds of DPS), bad luck(4 rocks in one wave pounding the enchanter to a mush) and groups without enough DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One tactic we found that worked quite well was to have a decently geared cleric and a shaman with at least Torpor.<br />
<br />
Load up damage shield on the cleric. Cleric sits on horse near the tank and pops a high agro heal on him. The 3 MOBs not being tanked turn on cleric. Shaman torpors the cleric and the cleric (if needed) can drop a divarb and/or group heal.<br />
<br />
Normally the cleric only needed torpor really, cause stuff is dying very fast and we were always assured that the last couple MOBs already took 15-25% damage from DSes.<br />
<br />
This completely eliminates the need for a chanter, and in fact when we used a chanter, we normally had them nuke with insanity instead of doing any normal chanterly duties.<br />
<br />
1 war<br />
1 rog<br />
1 druid<br />
1 cleric<br />
1 Shaman<br />
1 anything<br />
<br />
With that set up, we were often bored by wave 2 or 3 because it was just too simple.<br />
<br />
I will say tho, that most were mid 60's and we maximised our buffing. Melee running 1500+ attack and tank at 7500 hp or so. Also the druid is maxxed nuke crits, tossing out the 1550 nuke.<br />
<br />
But.. it was SOO easy, I imagine a lower level group could still do it fine. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newbbarsher</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got thru trials first time with the help of some members of my alliance.<br />
Group was<br />
64 Warrior, uber gear<br />
64 Bard, uber gear<br />
57 Cleric, decent gear<br />
65 Mage, uber gear<br />
65 Beastlord, uber gear<br />
And me.<br />
It was pretty easy. Basically you just want a good healer, and tons of dps. Make sure everyone assists the MT, and go for the rock guys first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally got through with 62 cleric, 61 War, 2 63 Wizards, 60 BL, and 60 enchanter, using the AE method. With the chanter doing AE stuns and both wizards AE, the only fight that would be close was first mob of each wave. Other three would go down in quick order allowing more med time between waves.<br />
<br />
After a couple tries with that group we got to the final mob 3 times in a row easily, first time though I was slowed when he popped, and cleric didnt have a cure that would work so I couldnt hold aggro. Next time the chanter, BL and one wizard died on final before I could get aggro, and other three of us had to evacc with him at like 20%.<br />
<br />
Third time though we won, even though the chanter and BL both got whacked from throwing early slows and debuffs. Pickup groups can be tough for sure but basically there are a bunch of different strategies that will all work, its just a matter of keep on trying till the luck runs right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I see with the trials is that everyone and their dog thinks they can get through at lvl 60/61 and unless you get really lucky, thats not the case (unless you have an AE type set up like Gloran described).<br />
<br />
Levels make a lot of difference in this. I failed miserably probably 40 times on Exe in &quot;melee&quot; groups at 60-62. My guild got most of the troops flagged by the AE styles ( I sit in the middle with DSes to get initial aggro and they n00ked the bejesus outa everything).<br />
<br />
Went back at 65 with a 60 bard, 55 cleric, 65 ENC, 65 Rogue, and 65 Ranger. We won, with me tashed and slowed for 2 waves (cleric didn't have cure disease like I told her to :p). Cleric went into Exe at 90 mana and finished at 90.<br />
<br />
If you have problems at 60-61, kill the trash in the hall to Mavuin, PON, POD, POI or whatever, but get the extra levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fekkonu</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I passed the trial with a pickup group and I'm glad that hassle is over.  If I had to deal with another cleric still using the level 5 cure disease spell I would have seriously flipped out.  I even went out and bought the spell for one cleric after we failed 2 times in a row on the last mob of the 4th wave.</div></div><hr />
