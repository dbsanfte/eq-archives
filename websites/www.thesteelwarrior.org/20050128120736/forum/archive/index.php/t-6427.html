<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slovack</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres my question i have a GSot4W(Great Staff of the Four Winds) and i am considering augmenting it with an Anger aug. Would it be wiser to aug it with a Anger3 or just go with the Anger2 to save some points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you put an agro augment on a DPS weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That depends, do you want more aggro for more points or less aggro for less points?<br />
<br />
If it were me, I'd do anger 3 unless I thought I would be upgrading the weapon soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd put Ykesha so that I get a dps proc outta a dps weapon, AND get a bit of agro, so that I can use it to tank with in groups, but not have to worry about takin agro from the main tank in a raid.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, I guess I did that already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, it is a decent weapon for either purpose.  In terms of aggro from melee, this weapon is quite high.  It also has an increased proc rate on Lightning Surge.  I predict that you will have aggro troubles if you put Ykesha on it and then try to use it for DPS, unless your fellow tanks have BF or BOW or better.  For a DPS role I would try either a lifetap or Rujarkian Venom instead of Ykesha.  If you do put Anger 3 on it, then it will be quite solid aggro, probably only beaten by the above mentioned weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 2 camps here on this.  One like the post above and the other &quot;Only put hate augs on weapons with a hate proc&quot;.  The Copper and Blood combo with anger augs will OWN the staff with a hate aug.  Why would someone think that ONE hate aug will out aggro 2 (2h) or 4 (2 1h)?  Dont waste a very good dps weapon to make a soso aggro weapon.   One hate  proc on a 2h on the avg wtill proc 30 sec into the fight, 2 procs on a 2h will proc 15 sec into the fight and 4 on 2-1h will proc 10 sec into the fight.<br />
<br />
No one has aggro problems with a good group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if all you want is low riposte aggro anger3 a GSoT ... if you want aggro and dps for day to day situations, but have a duel wield setup for super aggro, yak aug the staff.<br />
<br />
yak and staff will give you a ton of aggro, at a much cheaper point price.</div></div><hr />

Because different weapons have different ratios and damage bonuses, and this results in different amounts of innate aggro.  Procs do not automatically overcome this.<br />
<br />
An unaugmented Vanazir totally outaggros my dual-wield weapons with Anger 2 and 3 and Force Shock and DOT (see magelo).  Clearly the Vanazir is not accomplishing this through its procs.  It is accomplishing this through its ratio and damage bonus.  The same is true, to a lesser degree, with the Greatstaff of 4 Winds.  Fast 2-handers are big aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm very happy with 125 ykesha on my GSo4W.  I do need to switch to my anger3 auged dual-wield combo when I absolutely need agro but 80% of the time, GSo4W + yak = great.</div></div><hr />
