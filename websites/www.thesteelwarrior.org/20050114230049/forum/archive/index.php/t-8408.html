The KOS-to-all lava basilisks intrigue me, however.  Does anyone know:<br />
<br />
- do any other mobs assist the basilisks?<br />
- do the basilisks give a RoS faction hit?<br />
- are the basilisks a reasonable XP target for ally people?</div></div><hr />

They are pretty hardcore.  You could give it a try but I think they are probably too hard and too spread out to be worth doing exp on.  Finish up the quests and go kill the RoS trash :).</div></div><hr />

I think some are traps too, because when I went to drop the bridge near Nex, I saw an emote and there was a basilisk where I was standing, but I was invis so it didn't aggro. Some do see invis too, I had two on me passing another lava part running to the zonein.</div></div><hr />
