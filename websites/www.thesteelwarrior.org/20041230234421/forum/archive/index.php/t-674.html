<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66813<br />
<br />
I haven't played actively in about a year and it's been on and off, mostly off for almost two years and when I have played, a lot of it has been grinding levels and not worrying about equipment. So mostly I'm 2 years behind the times on equipment and also on overall mudflation.<br />
<br />
The quest stuff I know and I'm looking for kael raids and such. I'm just looking to upgrade as much as possible with purchases. Here's the kicker--I only have 2k to work with. (They should give me interest on the time it's been in the bank.)<br />
<br />
Looking at me (and I had to look to remember what I had), I could use an offhand upgrade--my preference is piercing. I have a mudman enforcer, but i'm not sure that's overall better than the centi and I'm not sure how much better I can afford.<br />
<br />
The bracers and face need to go. After that I'm not sure what. And I'm not sure whether to sink my meager plat into a few decent items that will last or bring up a bunch of stuff by only a few points. <br />
<br />
Ideas? Someone recommended dwarven cultural since I'm small race. I have a possible source for that (if he still remembers me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I like to upgrade 1 slot and make it last.  You know about Kael and that's the place to be at your level. Your rings will hold you for a long time if you want, as the next upgrade is expensive. <br />
You could sell off your cloak and with the extra money get a Cloak of the Maelstrom ( 12ac, 55hp, 6 sta I think) for around 2-4k. That is a quality upgrade that can last until Hiero cloak (20-25k), or a haste back item (too expensive for me atm).<br />
<br />
Now for the goodies, Free Upgrades: <br />
-Goranga Spiked Club ( 12/23 1hb ) from Maidens Eye rots all the time <br />
<br />
-Axegeroth's Belt of Defense (spelling?) with is around 20ac plus 5 str, I think. will be a nice upgrade from ME.<br />
<br />
-Grodan's Idol is a nice upgrade from the Goranga Idol and it is free in ME as well.<br />
<br />
-Quest Praetor's Blade of Debility for a free aggro weapon, or buy a pair of Black Blade of Tormenting (9/22 + DoT proc) for around 400-800pp each.<br />
<br />
I had similar equipment at your level, as well as a short bank account which hasn't changed. Just level, save money and upgrade with quality items so you won't have to worry about that slot for a while.<br />
<br />
Also, hunt in PoJ! If you can get a lvl or 2 and hunt in the Enforcer Room ( full of rockgolem looking creatures and Ptarg fiend looking creatures on the way to Mauvin the prisoner ) you will get alot of Raw Diamonds, Diamonds and Blue Diamonds. When you feel comfortable enough to click one of the doors and take out a dangerous prisoner in this hall, you can get several different loots both selable and upgrades for caster friends. Also a nice 2hs drops there, 29/36 I think, the name eludes me atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will take the opposite side and recommend a lot of small upgrades. <br />
<br />
There's a lot of stuff that's pretty cheap now if you do a little shopping around.  Crusty armor, tattered mantle, coterie general cape, spider fur belt.  Crusty can be had for around 50 apiece, and the other ones 100-150p each.  An acrylia bp should be under 1k also.<br />
<br />
On a budget, you take what you can get for weapon upgrades.  snare whip is nice, bed leg clubs are pretty cheap, barnacle axe may also work.<br />
<br />
This should bring your equipment to a reasonable level, fill the holes and have a base to build on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thurg, naggy/vox and UP raids are going to be your friends.</div></div><hr />

Not lore. I used to swing 2 back in the day.</div></div><hr />
