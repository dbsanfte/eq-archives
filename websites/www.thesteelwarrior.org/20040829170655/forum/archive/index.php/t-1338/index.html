Ok after reading all the suggestions and ideas on how to fix us warriors let me run a few things by ya's<br />
Ok <br />
1.Warriors can hold taunt in xp groups if the right equipment is used AND the group know how to manage there Aggro<br />
2.Warriors Can take hits and damage as good as if not better than Knight class's(I certainly can)<br />
3.Warriors cant do as much Damage as Knight class's but we are not far behind.<br />
<br />
Ok thats what i beleive Flame as u will :)<br />
Now as to fixing warriors i dont actually beleive there is that much wrong with us apart from Taunt and how quick we can Generate aggro in the xp Grind and keep it <br />
Now here is my suggestion a simple one in Theory but a lot harder in Practice .<br />
Make warriors Proc a substantial amount more with weapons <br />
Now as far as i know All proccing weapons have the proc Rate coded into the weapon and there lies the problem with this idea.<br />
The Cure is to make a lot more Warrior Only weapons and make then more readily available through the Different lvls of the Game.<br />
As i said this is Just an Idea and not an argument .Post ya thoughts and exscuse my Grammar <br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
care to back up the following? To my knowledge and from what I have read warriors are supirior in DPS to knight's myabe not by a whole lot but they come out on top. Just curious what data you are using ot make the aobve statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last time i checked it was more like this<br />
1. Warriors can hold aggro if they have uber weapons and if the weapons will proc early, or if the group really knows what they're doing, which is not common<br />
2. Warriors can take damage better than knights<br />
3. Warriors do more damage that knights</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Donnel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ardnutz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well i wasnt using any Data i was just led to believe that they did more Damage withs the spells and such guess i was wrong .<br />
A lot of pple can actually play there class and manage there aggro.Sadly a lot cant and it only takes one bad player to ruin a group :(.<br />
But back to the point in question U say u need Ubba weapons wouldnt more aggro inducing weapons available only to warriors bring us back in Line?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I decided to borrow a friends SK the other night to test out the differences for myself. I ran a parser for 90 mins or so on both chars. DPS with SK using Blindfoe, and me using CHSD/Primal 1 hander was pretty much equal, although obviously the warrior had a lot more ATK. Both are level 65, neither have any offensive AA. My warrior has an 1800hp advantage when buffed.<br />
<br />
Aggro generation-wise, well with the SK I needed to cast a maximum of 2 spells and I could lock down aggro for the whole fight. Generally 1 darkness line spell on inc was enough, occasionally I chucked an extra DD or tap to make sure. Other classes in the group were at various times shaman, necro, cleric, wizard, ranger, enchanter and mage. The necro stole aggro once when he got a bit stack happy, and the shm took 2 or 3 hits when slow was resisted more than once.<br />
<br />
When I switched to my warrior, aggro was back to its usual random self. I was getting a lot of taunt failures and the debuffers were taking a lot more damage. Generally once the mob had been beaten down to 60% or so, or if I got a proc or 2 from hammer early on aggro was no problem.<br />
<br />
I personally was shocked at how easy it is for a knight to lock down aggro before the mob is even in camp, and how little they have to do to maintain it. I am lucky enough to have a pure hate proccing weapon on my warrior, and even so the difference between warrior and knight aggro is like night and day.<br />
<br />
Tanking wise, there was no noticable difference in the amount of healing required. My warriors 1800hp advantage was unnoticable. The cleric did have to use the odd fast heal on the shaman when I was tanking with warrior though.</div></div><hr />
