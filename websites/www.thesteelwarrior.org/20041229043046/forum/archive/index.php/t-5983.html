Yes, the higher ac you have, the less damage you will take.<br />
<br />
or does it also help to avoid damage (mob misses)?<br />
<br />
No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">or does it also help to avoid damage (mob misses <br />
<br />
Not quite no, actually. Agility adds to your shown ac, and is actually an avoidance modifier. Ac is made up of both mitigation and ac. Whether or not the avoidance ac makes mobs miss or whether it makes you dodge and whatnot more often is something I'm unsure of. Ac on armor is mitigation ac.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanks have higher avoidance due to higher defensive skill caps and skills like parry and riposte.  That's why we get hit less often. Part of the raw number you see as your AC is mitigation AC and part is avoidance AC, but I don't remember exactly how it breaks down anymore.  Right around release they used to be presented in your UI as separate numbers iirc.</div></div><hr />

Some time back, an experiment was posted here, in which a person tested the hit/miss rate of a level 1 creature each time their character levelled.  They found that the hit rate (BEFORE AA's) was approximately<br />
<br />
(60 + mob level - character level)%<br />
<br />
This tapered off a bit above level 50, because the hit rate never  quite reaches 0%.<br />
<br />
Most likely this is actually measured by the offense/defense skills of the mob &amp; character, which scale with their levels.  But for practical purposes, we can say that it is the mob's level (relative to yours) that determines its hit rate.  A white-con creature has a hit rate of about 60%.<br />
It sure seems to me like casters get hit not only harder but much more often than plate classes with higher AC. Or is that just based on the defense skill?<br />
Casters have much lower defense skills than melees.  But also, the combat system has inherent penalties for caster classes.  They get less AC from the same piece of equipment, and have worse mitigation when they do get hit.  That said, a caster with CA3 and LR5 AA's still has pretty impressive avoidance compared to one without them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if I'm reading this correctly, if me and another tank both have 1300 ac but I have 100 agi and he has 305 agi, I actually mitigate better than he does?  Of course I'll get hit more often, but technically I should get hit for less?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  If 1300 is what's showing up as your visible ac, then yes, you will mitigate some minute amount better and he'll avoid a tad better. It will be a nearly negligable difference though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monotonous</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the original EQ beta, phase 2 there was separate numbers for both parts of ATK, and AC.  Then in phase 3 of beta, they merged the AC numbers into 1 number due to confusion among the player base.  The back end is still 2 separate numbers; they are just represented as 1 number in the UI.<br />
<br />
ATK was merged into 1 number also in Beta Phase 4.  The back end of this number is also still 2 separate numbers, of which you only see 1.<br />
<br />
Verant’s line was that people were complaining and getting confused since, they did a STR buff it only raised 1 of their ATK numbers, and that an AGI buff only raised 1 of their AC numbers.  Today I think people would love to see those number made visible again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was parsed about 2 years ago on the monkey boards.  Agility does effect your AC but does not change your avoidance.  The parse was done with the monk having maxed agility in one (255 at the time) and no agility buffs on the other.  The avoidance percentage was exactly the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugnok</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to reinstate what I said before.   Agility does add AC.  It goes towards the avoidance AC pool and added to your mitigation AC pool thus coming up with the number you see for you AC.  But...actual avoidance is a set percentage depending on the class. <br />
<br />
Here is a grid of AC gain for agility.  As you can see here, you will gain 39 AC at 75 agi if your lvl 40 or higher.  Max gain at lvl 40 or higher is 65.  a 26 AC difference.<br />
<br />
Here's the full formula for AC: <br />
<br />
Avoidance = (T from table) + trunc(Defense * 16/9), but never less than 0 <br />
Caster Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/3) + trunc(Defense/2) + (Equipment + 1) <br />
Anyone else's Mitigation = trunc(Buffs/4) + trunc(Defense/3) + trunc(Equipment * 4/3) <br />
Displayed AC = trunc( (Avoidance + Mitigation) * 1000 / 847 )<br />
...<br />
The formula doesn't work for monks because of the weight limit thing, but it should work if they keep their weight under the limit.<br />
...<br />
The table for T: <br />

You can still see them seperated by typing:<br />

&amp;debug=true after your magelo number. I don't really know how to read all the extra information, but that's how to see it.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand what the T value is other than just part of the formula.  Is it a changeable mod?  And how do we calculate the value using &quot;trunc()?&quot;<br />
<br />
Khazzuz seems to think that raising avoidance lowers mitigation, though the quote he has doesn't say anything of the sort.  Is this true in any way?<br />
<br />
I just don't understand why buffing my agi from 220 to 305, getting 6AC, is worth a damn.  And also, the mobs ATK has a lot to do with whether or not it will hit.  People here seem to be suggesting that you will always avoid at a set % depending on class/level, and this makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

Its not IMHO. <br />

<br />
This is what is rumored.  I have seen the parses on the old warrior board but I cant find them anywhere on here.  The parses showed that your avoidance was a set % according to your class/level.  Anyone wanna volunteer to parse this?  Ill see if I can get a shammy agility buff and Ill work on a parse when I have the time...which might be awhile.</div></div><hr />

Untrue.  ATK only affects how much damage the hit is for, not whether it hits or misses.<br />

It would be best to run your own tests to satisfy yourself of this.  I agree that it doesn't make much sense, and I would not design a combat system that way, but that is how the EQ combat system appears to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Untrue. ATK only affects how much damage the hit is for, not whether it hits or misses. <br />
<br />
  That's a incorrect statement, as I understand things. For example, take a level 65 warrior with 0 skill in piercing. He won't just do less damage, he'll also miss much more often. Weapon skill affects both hit ratio and atk. Implication: Mobs can have individually tuned hit rates. <br />
<br />
People here seem to be suggesting that you will always avoid at a set % depending on class/level, and this makes no sense. <br />
<br />
Well, that's not how it goes. Most likely, a mob has some sort of base hit rate. Let's say it's 60% for a particular mob. Beyond that, defensive skills can decrease the actual number of landed hits. Because there are different avoidance skill caps for different classes, and because those are further modified by AAs, skill bonuses and stats, the actual landed hit rate will vary from the same mob on different people even of the same class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I always understood it is this:<br />
<br />
Hit rate is determined by mob offense skill vs player defense skill.<br />
<br />
Higher ATTK vs lower AC increases DMG per landed hit, up to a certain cut off point at which higher ATTK will give no affect, likewise there is a lowest AC that a player can functionally have vs high ATTK mobs.<br />
<br />
AC adds to MITIGATION AC.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Casters get owned because of low defense skill and because their AC vs the mob ATTK is so unfavorable.<br />
<br />
Mob hit rates DO tend to average out to exactly the same hit rate over time depending on mobATTK/PlayerAC and mobOffense/PlayerDefense, and MobLevel/PlayerLevel.  Agility does nothing here.<br />
<br />
Agility adds raw AC and we have determined it doesnt affect miss% so ----&gt; MITIGATION AC.<br />

Actually, I think this is a function of the lower defense skill caps on casters.  The defense skill combined with agility affects your avoidance, but defense also affects how well you utilize your armor.  You can see this by the amount of AC an item actually gives you when you put it on, a cobalt BP will help a level 50 warrior much more than a level 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  Defense doesn't factor in.  Int casters get about 1.2:1, everyone else gets about 1.55:1.  That being worn:item ratio.</div></div><hr />
