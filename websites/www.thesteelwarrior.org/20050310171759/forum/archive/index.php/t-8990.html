Yes once you equip it becomes no drop. Its worth what someone will pay for it and get used to sinking time/money into something with no return when u upgrade. Its called raiding. Attunable basically allows you to sell it in the bazaar but stops the mudflation somewhat by not making the stuff moveable. Great for the uber raiders since now they can loot the masses still while making sure that the casual just cant pass the stuff on. I am sure Yantis is wetting his pants over this one.<br />

There are some nasty trains there sometimes and amoung otherthigns, atunable means that anyone in the group can loot and then pass it to the winner when rezzed etc.<br />
<br />
It also allows fair class specific items to be passed to the proper class if they are not around wihen it drops.<br />
<br />
You are correct that the value paid is not recovereable...but that should help keep the prices down on them once they are on the market for a bit. <br />
<br />
Additionally I am XPing in WoS--one of the deeper zones in OoW and having lots of fun, seeing skills go up, earing upgrades and seeing a path were I can finally get significantly more value out of GoD. I think it may be possible for a hardcore-nonraider to get to time quality gear AND earn the 1.5 epics without raiding (assuming SoE did not screw them up). <br />
<br />
OoW just may be the best expantion since SoV for the non-raider.</div></div><hr />

One post is in the rant hall, after a bad couple of days and not heading into OoW, but taking the Pop/GoD mentality of haven't earned my way there yet.<br />
<br />
This post (and heck the later ones on my rant--which was the point, to blow off steam) are now said with a bit of knowledge about the zone and feeling less indigant that I will have to spend forever leveling up to 67 while the ubers are back to grinding. Will it take me significantly more time? Yup, but so far I am enjoying the trip and getting gear improvements, and seeing a way to gear and level up enough to be able to tank KT realistically and open up its upgrades.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a path for the 66th with the defensive AAs. If that is true for the 66th without we will see.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it for a few reasons.<br />
<br />
1) you can loot it right away and then give it out to the winner, no more people training your ass to steal no drop loot.<br />
<br />
2) you can have one for yourself and sell one much like ornate, since the item numbers are differnt (pre-atuned and then post-atuned)<br />
<br />
3) more gear for the bazaar is always good for those who can not spend 13 hours camping something<br />
<br />
4) finite value, use it once and it is removed from the game and cheaper since a person can use one and hold one... unlike lore items</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you get the frickin casters that insist on rolling for melee drops since they are droppable.  A drood won the only attunable drop I've seen...it was for melees and I was the only melee in the grp  :mad: ...hope I'm grouped with that druid when a spell or caster item drops. ;) <br />

<br />
I like the attunable idea. They are useing it well, in WoS I have seen 9 different type of droppable loot, 2 different attunables, and one no drop item. <br />
<br />
The spell runes are tradeable save for the lvl69 and 70 ones. Guess that makes the lvl66, 67, and 68 attunable (can't trade em one you turn em in, hehe) and the 69 and 70's no drop.<br />
<br />
The price on the attunables is not bad, and I have only seen the two items even in links with the tag. (Cloak and gloves)<br />
<br />
As long as they do not go overboard, I think it is a nice addition to the game that will help mudflation to some degree.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but when you go from &quot;Boycott OOW&quot; (with no real intention to ever boycott an EQ product nonetheless), to &quot;OMG WORST EXPANSION EVER&quot; on the first day of release, then after being told that you're a tard by people who actually went more than 2 zones in changing to &quot;OMG! BEST EXPANSION EVER KTHXLA!&quot;, you look like a fucking schmuck, and I get to call you fickle, and you get to like it that I stopped with fickle.</div></div><hr />

You are one angry little man, Haass! Do you get beat up for your lunch money in high school and take out your aggressions here? Why is it that 90% of your posts are attempts at belittling people and the other 10% are trying to make yourself look like your crap doesn't stink? Maybe you have something you need to compensate for? People make mistakes (like your parents). People learn from them just fine with positive encouragement. No need for you to try and make people feel like a pile of rat feces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So even though the druid could turn around and sell the item in the baz and buy a druid useable attuneable item, and be rewarded with his own upgrade, it's not fair for him to get to roll on the drop. Do you rant when someone who can't use an ornate pattern wins the roll, or is that accpeted?<br />
<br />
I've already lost runes to melees, and it's not a problem. The pp they get in the baz directly translates into upgrades for them, as much as the spell would be for me. Not letting them roll on it would have been ripping them off after they worked as hard as anyone else in the group. The fact they have to take the item to the baz to get their reward later doesn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
Also I think this is the most even way to distribute loot. If an enc built a group without any other casters (save healer), would it be fair to let her take half the runes and every droppable caster piece? It gets even worse if someone boxing makes the group, Warfust could take every single plate, silk and rune drop if he built his group right (just an example, not saying he would). The boxer would be working harder yes, but getting far more than half the loot on average. Not very fair imo when every one of the pieces is an upgrade for anyone in the baz.</div></div><hr />

No no no, this is the warrior board.  People here are strictly against need before greed....err, wait, unless it's an item that they can use, then it's definitely need before greed. <br />

I always play NBG.  If someone in the group can use it, I always give it to them without rolling.  I have never been in on a roll unless it was an upgrade for me, or it was not an upgrade for anyone in the group.  <br />
<br />
I realize not everyone plays that way, but it's the way I like to play.  <br />
<br />
And, yes, it was my mistake for not bringing this up when I joined the group.</div></div><hr />

If it was an upgrade for someone and they were going to equip it as soon as looted to make it no-drop then others would pass. If not, all would roll regardless of what classes could wear it/use it. Had a terror chain ring drop and it was an upgrade and the winner equipped it on the spot...thus making it no-drop.  Not saying thats the best way to do it, but was an interesting way to handle attunable stuff.</div></div><hr />

No I dont' think that everthing is roses in OoW and the core of my rant--that the raiders had/have 70th handed to them on a platter has not changed. I wil stand by that.<br />
<br />
Haass, <br />
<br />
You need to realize time passes and sometimes, just sometimes, a corparation will respond to its customers. Coke brought back its 2 liter bottles, SOE opened up significant areas of OoW to non-raiders and seems to have addressed the path issue.<br />
<br />
Now 1) unless you are me, don't tell me what I think. I did post the OoW boycot here, as I read Woody's strip and supported his point. Heck I posted many, many posts here trying to get my game-experiance represented by Raaj. I did buy OoW after I started reading the responces of those who went to the guild summit and said they heard us. Until then I had no intentention of buying OoW but did oder afterword to encourage this sort of continued behavior by SoE. NOTE the time frame for these posts is May/June.<br />
<br />
Then--the rant--and this seem to need sever repeating-RANT--was using old assumtions--that areas of the new expantions I had not earned the right to. Behaviors learned in PoP, LDoN and GoD. Before I had tried OoW but was playing in it the way the previous expantions--from a distance. And discovered that XP sucked in LDoN while reading of raiders who leveled to 70 in 21 hours played. In zones the got to, only because of the 71 friends they had. Notice: 1) Rant 2) posted 2nd day of release.<br />
<br />
Now I am posting some support of OoW, because it does seem to offer a path to get closer to the raiders--the step between LDoN/Ornate and EP seems like the biggest step in the game so far. <br />
<br />
So if learning is &quot;fickle&quot; to you, so be it. <br />
<br />
The first question I ask when I join a group is the loot rules. I much rather NBG--but its your responcibility to find out before the first drop happens. Much uglyness related to loot can be avoided by hammering out the rules first. <br />
<br />
BTW I am getting what seems to be good adivice to explore more OoW.</div></div><hr />
