<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since this is the rant section, I figured I can throw in my 2 cp!<br />
<br />
Uber I am not but that is because my playtime is limited due to RL.  Saturday I buffed up to 9200+ and 1779 ac at lv 70.  That is going the Steeloak + Kazaads + Ward route.  Being in a non uber raiding guild (and a new member of the guild at that), upgrades are few and far between.  So I put up lfg and I get 2 different tells from MPG members asking if I would replace their tank.  Np I say and start heading that way.  On the way ON BOTH occassions, I get the &quot;cleric wants to know your hps&quot;...  I say I buff around 9.2 etc...then I get the no thanks, cleric says he cant heal that.&quot;  I mean WTF people! The difference between a 10k hp tank and a 9k hp tank is what, one round?  1 hit and a Chaos Claw proc?  I know Im not 2k ac but I know I have much better ac than a lot of peoples magelos that went the hp route.  Tell me if Im wrong but doesnt better ac mean less hps a wack?  So with that said, isnt it ac&gt;hps?<br />
<br />
Having said that puts me on a roll so forgive me if Im burning steam.  Damn clerics are a load of shit.  Chanters and Clerics can ALWAYS get groups at lower lvs and much more demand than any other class.  Look in MPG next time and you will see 66 clerics and chanters all day long but do you think a 66 tank would ever get a group?  I think its pretty safe to say that most chanters and clerics have been on easy street as far as exp for the past 65+ levels.  They sit around and do next to nothing each fight, dont take hardly any licks, and then roll on the equal ac loot as the tanks?  Anyone remember the cleric always getting the gems deal with Seb back in the day?<br />
<br />
I have some jerk chanter in my guild who laughs (in guildchat nonetheless!) about none of the guilds tanks being able to handle this or that mob.  That person just needs an asswhippin.  I mean running around at 66 getting mpg groups when everyone else is struggling to get into overpopulated WoS groups and talking shit.<br />
<br />
Grow some balls bitches! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hear Hear! I tanked MPG yesterday just fine at 8700/1600 or something, so I'm sure you'd be fine. Not to say that I didn't get below 20% a few times though. Clerics (and everyone else) get lazy and stupid after too much pop XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a few camps in MPG. There's maybe one camp that you would have been ok at, and everywhere else you'd have been a liablity. (Even at the camp you would have been ok at, you'd have been one helluva mana sponge)<br />
<br />
Some zones are designed for the &quot;ubers&quot; man, you just gotta accept it. If you don't like it, join a raiding guild... <br />
<br />
PoP flagged these zones and casual players bitched. Now they give access and they feel entitled to groups they can't handle. If you had shown up to the group and died 7 times you'd be here bitching about how the cleric sucked, not that you couldn't handle Lightning Warriors flurrying for 8 hits at 800 each back to back. (Because with &lt;2k AC, they more than likely would hit max, alot)<br />
<br />
ps. 66 chanters don't get shit for groups in MPG or RSS on MT, they need some spells to be usefull, and a beastlord can slow while not sucking at DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think the problem is that MPG is quite stressful for clerics, especially with a low hp tank (sub 11k). <br />
So while it may appear rude to ask hps and turn you down, the hp number gives a good hint imo a 13k warrior will have 2k+ ac for sure, while a 9 k hp warrior can have from 1600 to 2k ac. Same goes for resists, its somehow all connected to high hp items.<br />
<br />
Its just not nice for a cleric to have a tank that might be 2 rounded (procs can make this happen, if you got so low hps) in mpg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MPG is not designed for &quot;ubers&quot;.  Riftseekers is for ubers, and is level 69 required I understand. <br />
<br />
The drops in MPG are decent but not extreme upgrades for a 9k tank. Anybody bigger will be rotting most of them. The whole point of MPG and zones like it is to have CHALLENGING arena for people to gain upgrades and have fun playing. <br />
<br />
Theres a fine line between mana-sponge and adequate IMO. Yes, a lower geared tank will take more damage and require more heals, but I haven't seen anything in MPG that will 2 round a 9k tank. It's far easier to tank than tipt/vxed because the damage is consistent, and even with a gimp tank like myself clerics can get away with using CH almost exclusively.<br />
<br />
If the cleric is better geared than you are I guess it's his prerogative to complain about your hp, but often the case is people will take some gimp cleric and then expect the tank to pick up the slack, which is stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye I know some of the mobs are a bitch I agree.  But honestly, how does a non raiding guild warrior improve?  Im maxed out on levels...I guess I could pick up a few more hp aas (but 60 aas to max out sturdiness?) but other than that how do you really improve?  We are so dependent on our gear as opposed to casters and such.  MPG is the way to improved gear plain and simple.  Nobody does LDONS hardly at all anymore.  Its not like I can say &quot;I will come back when I am lv 68-70&quot; because Im there!  So basically Im stuck at WoS where Im yet to really see anything that good drop (Im sorry but I dont believe in dropping 20ac for 60 additional hps).<br />
<br />
And I have seen quite a few 66-67 chanters and clerics grouping in MPG.  The chanter in question from my guild has lived there since 66.  I have a cleric friend who just dinged 67 last week who groups nowhere but MPG when she exps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you're heavily in the lvl 70 mob area, those lightning mobs... double flurry, quick quick quick way to lose 9khp.  hell i'm usually in the 14's, with 2600+ ac, and those things can still tear me apart.  and if you get an add in that part w/o a mezzer... well, you're toast probably.  if it's a group hanging out in the taskfiend area, or the blind hunter area, that's one thing, but if you've got a group going deep in, to a projection... well, that's just the way it is sometimes.<br />
<br />
i've seen a million groups of elementally geared people just wipe over and over and over in mpg.  and then stroll into RSS and just get steamrolled by mobs.  some levels of gear are just less efficient.  there's plenty of new, small 4 group content in causeway and bloodfields to do, so go do it!  have seen 150-200hp loot drops coming off that stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BossBeachBall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had a discussion along these lines with my guild's clerics on Sullon Zek, and they all pretty much agreed - if a cleric can't keep a 9k +hp tank with decent AC alive fairly easily in the likes of MPG, they're the liability not the warrior. Next time they grill you on HPs/AC ask them their Mana/FT totals. The problem I've found with clerics is they expect every new zone to be exactly along the lines of their play style from the previous exp zones, where their equip could get them by with just having to hit CH and group heal every so often while watching TV or playing Halo or some shit. New zones are hard, they are meant to be hard- Clerics by far have the laziest play style to operate at max efficency, maybe they should just expect to start having to pushing buttons as much as a rogue or warrior and typing some requests to slow the pulls or get a mana feed from a necro if their gear doesn't allow them to keep up.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to the fact that most people, deep down, don't really want to play a Cleric. No one wanted to be a Cleric in D&amp;D, but every party needed one. Same with EQ. But just because you are playing a class that really isn't all that fun doesn't mean other classes should have to give you a play experience on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
Yes, some MPG camps a 10k+ tank can help, but if a cleric goes as far as to REFUSE to play with a sub 10k tank on ANY of the camps, without even testing tank out first- the cleric is the liability not the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cant believe you bash on clerics and say they got an easy job, lol they got the worst job and if someone dies its their fault. <br />
<br />
Unless you have a tag of the top 5 guilds on the server, a cleric of such a guild will be used to a certain standard of gear, suddenly being forced to spam heal and go oom every so often from it blows. Ubers like to group with ubers.<br />
<br />
What cleric fits a 9 k warrior in MPG ? 5k hp maybe and 6k manapool ? You better hold aggro and take medding breaks every 3 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BossBeachBall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's only their fault if someone dies and they don't try. That's the problem, they expect to not have to try in new content as they are used to healing in old content. Healing in BOT = easy, Healing in MPG = slightly harder but not if you pay attention as much as the other classes have to and learn to time your heals for maximum efficency and take into account the timing at which your other group members are operating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">sad to say, but  if someone wants to min/max their exp, then really theres not much that can be done about it.  the shoe could easily be on the other foot with us asking what their mana/ft/focuses are.<br />
<br />
personally, pick ups are like that. someone don't like ur ac hp? screw it, find someone who does.  we are meant to be warriors. leave whining to the robe wearers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But honestly, you guys gotta admit its a clusterfuck.  I mean, you get refused for not having the gear (gear = hps) but you have to go there to improve your gear.  I cant really improve in the bazaar.  Not without completely breaking the bank on some attunable stuff that is way way overpriced atm.  So basically, I should sit and wait like a good warrior until there are no more 10k+ tanks avail and then IF im lucky get a shot?  You have got to be kidding me!  <br />
<br />
Clerics and Chanters friggin suck.  Like I said, spend 65+ levels basically sitting there while everyone else is busting their asses.  An enchanter does what?  Slow a mob on a single pull then sit there and watch tv?  On a multi pull is the only time a chanter actually works unless you are talking about charmed mobs where the chanter actually has to worry a bit.  But with a charmed mob, you hardly need a group.  Clerics....levels after levels casting 1 heal then sitting and reading the book.  How many fights in DL wheb you guys were grinding those levels did the cleric cast more than once?  Then how many times did you taunt and the rogue work his ass off backstabbing.  No comparison.<br />
<br />
But honestly, I know clerics are a necessity but its just a load of crap when someone who majors in slacking ass calls the shots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Man, I seriously can't stress this point enough, because it applies to almost every complaint in EQ.<br />
<br />
You have to build your own group.  I'm not talking about pickup groups every day, i'm talking about you have to find 5 buddies who have the same hobbies you do, the same time off you do, and the same tastes as you do, you need to get them into your games, and you need to build THE group.<br />
<br />
I haven't grouped with anyone, other than my personal friends, in EQ for the past 4 years.  I haven't missed a fucking thing about the general population.  Hell, the majority of us have all zonewide chat off too.  EQ is a game we play with our friends, and that's it.<br />
<br />
And goddamn, it's so much more fun that way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Go to Riftseekers, and farm outside the Queen's room. Then you'll really see what the difference of 1khps. <br />
<br />
At 13khp with an AVERAGE cleric, I was very nervous the first 30 minutes there. I haven't been scared in EQ in years. Yesterday in Riftseekers, I had a puddle under my desk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I see alot of cleric bashing for stupid stuff. Clerics dont have the laziest and easiest job. You want easy? Play a rogue. Clerics have to put up with alot of shit. I'll use my group last night in MPG as a good example. If you are a frequent in serverwide channel ingame and were on last night you woulda seen me bitchin about it. <br />
<br />
Not all clerics can keep up with MPG. Not all warriors can keep up in MPG. Its not the clerics fault if they cant keep a 9k tank up. Its not the tanks fault that a 5k mana pool cleric cant keep a tank up for more than 2 mobs. Last night I had a 4.2k mana pool cleric. Yes 4.2k. We tried him out and respectfully asked his ass to leave because he couldnt handle it. Im not uber. I was buffed to 10.3k in that group with 1850 ac. And i was playing dps and chain furious tank when that cleric was to gimp to heal on the 3rd pull. (Main warrior furioused him down to 50% and i furioused him down to dead). This went on for about an hour before we asked him to leave. Next cleric had a 8k mana pool and max FT. We had no med time and he nuked during fights. <br />
<br />
Someone said clerics can be lazy and preform max efficiency. Thats wrong. Max Efficiency would me MoKing a mob, Healing MT, Nuking, Buffing, making stupid jokes so people dont get bored in group so how can a cleric &quot;play halo&quot; and be max efficient? Warriors can be alot lazier than clerics and still preform near the same job unless you have a bad puller / CC. So stfu about clerics can be lazy. They cant. Cleric + lazy = Cleric running back to rezz. <br />
<br />
If group wipes The only person required to not afk till a rezz comes is the cleric. and possibly a porter / inviser. If group has someone that has to over agro cleric has to deal with it much more seriously than the tank. Peoples buffs fall cleric has to buff warrior gets to stand there and look stupid. Yeah clerics get groups easier because they are &quot;required&quot; for most groups there for more available spots. A pally or SK can tank MPG almost if not better than a warrior (stuns or lifetaps). 3 classes to do 1 job = less available spots for that one spot. 1 class for 1 job. So dont complain that &quot;they get groups so easily.&quot; <br />
<br />
Warriors have always been gear dependant to tank places. Would you throw a 9k tank at something that flurries for 900 with a 500dd proc when theres a 13k tank available? Didnt think so. Its not &quot;being a dick&quot; its convenience. Less heals needed = less down time and possibly more dps = faster exp = more exp = more steady exp. It all makes perfect sence to me. If you dont like it reroll and make a rogue. <br />
<br />
MPG is designed for the non bazaar tanks. WoS is designed for the lesser tanks and is pretty close to the same exp. If you cant handle MPG or RSS dont go into denile. Go to WoS, get a few upgrades, go to GoD get some upgrades then go for the better exp once you can handle it. 10k isnt that hard to get nowadays. There was a thread that someone put together that contained a magelo with 100% 1 group items and it broke 10k fairly easily w/o GoD levels / stat raise aa's. The game is designed for progression. You cant jump to the top in an instant. you cant jump to the middle in an instant. But keep bein stupid and you'll forever be at the bottom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Amen Haass. It's all about making or bringing your own group. If your guild won't support you in going to MPG, maybe it's time to look into getting a different one? <br />
<br />
In any case, it's easy enough to recruit a few people from LFG and take them there if you have the balls for it and are willing to risk having to pay a necro for some summons. The good thing is, when YOU'RE recruiting you can often get toons from uber guilds to come out, and they won't even ask your HP since you're recruiting THEM. Then since your group is uber, you'll stomp everything and they'll never be the wiser until you pick up that piece they were expecting to rot. /snicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you've got a chance to play that way, great.  I agree, there's nothing more fun in EQ than having a &quot;regular group&quot; of the same people that all get along well and work well together.  I had a group like that on Rodcet Nife where I first started and I've never had as much fun playing EQ as I did back then.  When my schedule changed I couldn't play with them anymore and suddenly I was level 50 and didn't know ANYONE.  Let me tell you something, that sucks.  Bigtime.  <br />
<br />
I joined a raid guild for awhile after that, got sick of it, and quit the game for about a year and a half.  Then one of my sadistic real life friends convinced me to server transfer and start playing again.  I've been hooked ever since.  Bastard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did MPG the 2nd night OOW was out at level 65.  Its all about the group. You can maximize survivability by using stonewall on the right mobs.  Most camps involved 6-7 mob cycles, just know what mobs are in each pull cycle.<br />
<br />
RS is another story! Did it on Sat for the first time and it was extremely dicey for myself (11k/1900ac buffed).  It wasnt dicey from me surviving (mobs hit harder but fewer procing mobs IMHO)...more from the fact that if agro ponged for a mili-second the slower dies fast.</div></div><hr />

60 aa for 500 hp = good trade imo<br />
<br />
It's required for warriors in our guild, but we're also a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the things to keep in mind is that on average most people will take the path of least resistance. If they can take a tank with 11k/1900, why would they take a tank with 9.2k/1650?  Warriors are the sellers and it's a buyers market. There are more tanks out there looking for groups than their are clerics or enchanters, in the zones that I go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/LFG on MSG= 13khp/2.4kac/12%shld/ect.. 10kpp per hour</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Teledriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">To start, Cister would love to see the days of getting groups all the time. I am a Cleric on your server. I know &quot;Coggies&quot; and your a well respected group of people. But when I have to go solo the damn PoJ Jail's (YES SOLO) cause I sit 5 hours LFG'ing as a MAIN cleric, where is the justice. I want to see this we get groups all the freaking time.<br />
<br />
If it were not for a few friends, I prolly would still be sitting around twidling my thumbs now after OoW cause I wouldn't be able to get groups anywhere but OoW. I went to BoT once after OoW, 6 people, my group, had run of the whole zone.<br />
<br />
As people said also, it goes both ways. I have only been asked to go to MPG ONCE. Was told get to the other side of the zone on your own and if ya die, oh well. Nice tank there, I refused to go. (Off question, do you think Cleric get inivs? or do you realize we are with the same limitations as warriors with no invis except potions or GVD's) I get refused cause of my mana or FT or just not in the right &quot;guild&quot; like TR, SS, VA ect from Cazic. Never am I asked my HP, or anything of the like, but to me, that is just as important cause I need to be able to with stand something if I heal to early by chance or just get that stupid thing called heal agro. (Do not have my SCS aa's yet, but working them). What is a cleric that may have a 6k mana pool but maybe only have 4k HP buffed? Useless, MHO.<br />
<br />
As far as lazy? Never. Maybe in my 40's and such, but never since GoD or OoW. Not being able to sit sometimes, or having a mount in some zones is my downfall right now.  And thinking all we have to deal with is you as a tank, another story. The well being of 6 players are my job. Puller, Tank, CC, myself,  .... every single person of the group. Play styles of a cleric needed to change as we got to the higher end zones. I browse many class boards as I want to know every class a little so I know the classes I group with. Not often do I post, but I learn alot.<br />
<br />
I get yelled at by a tank cause I don't heal at such a such time, but he dosn't see that I am healing the CC that is mezzing the 2 other mobs that the puller who just was healed also from being bashed by the 3. Being a cleric in the old days is quite differnet than present days.<br />
<br />
I give every person a chance in a group. I ask every tank their hit points, then I know what I need to do, when to heal, ect. to keep the group going. I let people know ahead of time if I see something maybe stickey, but that should be everyones job. Not say INC ** ONE MOB** and just bring 5. There are tanks that refuse to let the some classes do a job they are designed for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">RSS is mean ... but i've seen worse relatively ... like trying to tank vxed/tipt with 1500 buffed ac and 8700 hps.  RSS at 10k+ hps and 1700ac with max defensive at 70 is about like trying to do vxed at just under 9k with 200 less ac at 65.  It's mean, but not together undoable.  You certainly can't waltz in there with a pickup group.<br />
<br />
That said, RSS is utterly fucking amazing.  The last day before i quit we spent the day crawling and xping in there.  We had multiple DIFFERENT type 7/8 70 hp augs drop, as well as a few dupes.  Since i quit my bard buddy got a 17/20 poker and 50ac 135 hp boots with 30 attack on them from xp groupable named.  It's  ... like ... candyland for the hardcore casual  :D .<br />

so im the first to comment on this? ok, here is the biggest problem of all. cis was not denied a group but booted from the group. and that is unacceptable.<br />

yes playing a cleric is very hard work. they MUST keep their eyes on the screen full time. any group member can die because the cleric is trying to light a cigarette when agro switches. <br />
<br />
ive been asked my hitpoints a few times. strangely ive never been asked whether i had my defensive aa. ive never asked a player his hp his ac his aa his FT or anything else when recruiting for a pickup group. i consider it rude. its a pickup group. im inviting a stranger. i treat him with respect and you know what? i give him a chance. and if he is undergeared you know what else? i am pleased to give him opportunity. do i have to pick up a little of his slack? you bet i do! do i prefer hunting with friends? absolutely! i get a better group.but if i give random players tells and then say &quot;sorry you arent uber enough for me&quot; then ive just been guilty of insulting a stranger which my dad would not have approved of. whats the worst that can happen? we wipe? so what!<br />

here .. lets have a little perspective. when i tank for ubers i am the weak link. im honored they let me do it. when i tank for subpars i am the one making up for their weakness and im honored to do it for them. ive tanked (or played caster) in subpar pickup groups where i was THE one who everyone knew made the difference and they fussed over me and i felt great. i got poor exp and they left saying &quot;thanks for great exp!&quot; and i felt good :) and ive tanked for FT15 necros who could out agro me while never going below fom and they had great attitudes and i thanked them for accepting me and i felt good about how i was respected.<br />
<br />
it doesnt always have to be an uber that you invite. if you want an uber ask someone you know. if you ask random people cut them some slack and stop griping about their FT3 and their 9200hp. you who are insisting on uber recruits for your pickup groups are walking a fine line. you are recruiting from a pool (lfgs) which is by nature poorly geared and asking for an uber who might very well feel like he is doing YOU a favor by even joining a pickup group when he could be grouping with his fellow uber friends instead. so you settle for someone halfway between the poorly equipped and the uber because you dont want the former and the latter doesnt want you. and your choices are sparse. and your group is upset with YOU because you are the reason they are standing around waiting instead of getting on with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i identify with the person doing the recruiting in these two situations. i identify because in most groups ive been in for 5 years ive been THE main recruiter for the group. for those of you who let others do the recruiting for you let me let you in on something here. recruiting is a LOT of thankless work. about the only thanks you usually get for it is that people think you are antisocial because you are slow to answer their groupmode tells. fact of the matter is you are in tell hell for their sakes WHILE tanking. and you finally after sending tells to 8 people and ending in 3-4 simultaneous conversations for a 10 minute streak find yourself a tank! woot! another few minutes and these tells will even die down. yay! and then your groupmember says &quot;reject him he's not uber enough&quot;. and you want to strangle that person.</div></div><hr />

The amount of &quot;do you have a cleric and enchanter&quot; &quot;are you a full group&quot; really gets to you after a while. <br />
<br />
As for the matter of hp/ac, i guess we just have to face how gear dependent we are. The pp to get to 6.5k unbuffed 65 bazaar would get you a load of FT imo.<br />
<br />
Just for fun heres Ft 10 in 180k (luclin) cleric<br />

2*ornate brace 60k FT 4<br />
Belt of Great turtle 35k FT 2<br />

But, Tooby, there are other things which matter to a cleric apart from FT.  Why don't you take a quick look at the level 5 focus effects a cleric needs and cost them out for us?  You can limit it to mana preservation, improved healing and spell haste if you like... but I think you'll find that your 180k wouldn't get you very far in gearing up a level 70 cleric.</div></div><hr />

I do not think there are too many bad clerics in mpg.  They get tired of dying just like everyone else.<br />
<br />
As for MPG, I am hearing on my server that 10k hp is the generally accepted amount to begin to tank there.  I tried when I was 65 just as oow came out, and I got tore apart.  I forget excaclty, but think I was buffed to about 8.5k, 1550 ac and had a druid healer in group.  I did succesfully tank 2 or 3 mobs, but had to use defensive on them and poor healer had to med between.  We then got some unexpected and group wiped.  No more mpg for me since. <br />
<br />
I now am level 69, and buff up to about 9.3k hp and have a few more AAs.  I plan on going back to mpg soon, but will do so with a group of guildies.  I view it as an experiment.  I suggest you do the same, get a group of people you know, and see how you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're having problems in vxed/tipt ... you're gonna have problems here, and unlike tipt/vxed, there are no charm pets here to save your groups ass.  It's doable with less hps for sure, but it can get nasty deep in.  If the cleric feels that he cannot reliably heal you then don't get all huffy.  He simply is not strong enough to compensate for your lack ... or like yourself he is slightly undergeared for the content and requires a beefier tank.<br />

At level 70 10.5k and 1700ac (xp group buffed) i was a weak tank in MPG.  After i finished up my OoW defensives i could hold my own, but getting my ass handed to me wasn't an altogether oddity.  Finally you have an expansion where everything is open and there are no hard-cap flag/key filters on zones.

Eh, people said this 2 weeks into PoP too.  Truth of the matter is that you haven't gotten the tradable upgrades you can get, you haven't got the AA's from GoD yet, and you haven't got whatever else you can get in pickup groups that you CAN tank.<br />
<br />
6 months after PoP came out, when everyone had LR5/ID5, and a couple pieces of ornate and some assorted other shit, they were tanking much better.  Plus healers had their new spells, new buffs, new focii.  It will come with time, but you can't expect to walk right in and be cock of the walk right away if you're not at the top already.</div></div><hr />

There is a crazy amount of tradeable, nice loot in this expansion for non-raiders.   See the Deathwalker thread in the bunker for several decent camps that a single non-uber group can do easily.  Add to that WoS/MPG/Noble's mobs.. there is a lot to do. I'm actually very impressed for once with the breadth of things in this expansion, even considering one entire zone seems to be dedicated to epic fights (bloodfields.. and it even has a ton of named mobs).<br />

The biggest thing is securing some friends with common interests if you don't have a big gulid of well geared people to chose groups from.</div></div><hr />

In OoW, thanks to the presence of tradeable, relatively high value drops from places like Wall of Slaughter, the easiest answer is to group up in WoS and grind out the AA's you need, get the tradeable drops, sell them, and make enough money to buy the next stage of gear.<br />

It's not about being a member of a cool club ... it's about having the tools to get the job done.  Your group apparently thought you lacked those tools so they looked elsewhere ... big deal.  It happens a thousand times a day on every server.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you are gimp or lazy or a bad person ... your magelo is very respectable for a non-uber raider.  Don't expect to hit 11k hps in xp groups though ... you're gonna have to shift your focus to gear/augs rather than raw xp, or at least build your own groups with people you know and trust.  <br />
<br />
What can you do for your gear that doesnt require a raids and isnt simply xp grind?<br />

GoD trials (this is a gold-mine)<br />

Haass hit the nail on the head:  it's best to find and build groups of friends that you trust.  You'll get more done in the long run much quicker.  Being a member of a guild is 10 steps in the right direction here because you always have connections with some people online.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ap not sure I'd set the bar that high.  MPG is pretty straight forward with those numbers AND level 70.  The level really helps as does knowing the mobs (cats and lightening being the trouble makers).<br />
<br />
If you have a lesser tank so what (kicking that guy from the group was wrong).  Just start a HOT on them pre-pull...they will be fine (the basic element on how I was able to tank there at 65).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Yea, let's be serious here. MPG is not uber hunting grounds. Just look at how the mobs are spaced out; for the most part you're not gonna be pulling anything close to 20 mobs per spawn cycle. There are maybe one or two places you could? That's even saying you've got some healty DPS.<br />
<br />
PoP zones you could pull a lot more mobs back to camp efficiently and quickly. Soem other OoW zones you can also. Definitely not in MPG, and if you've ever been the puller for the group you've noticed this. <br />
<br />
So it's not like your cleric is going to be non-stop on his or her toes healing. There is time to med between the pulls. Hell, toss in a druid for some spot heals and you'd be even safer, without taking much of a hit to the overall DPS of a group (long as the druid knows how to play.) The same could be said about a Shaman; don't underestimate the power of torpor or quinessence.<br />
<br />
Like it's been said before, Riftseekers is the real challenging zone of this content. For fucks sake, even the MPG trial trash mobs are mostly whimp shit. Destruction and Efficiency were hitting me for 300's max, not including the bosses (who were also pretty easy though.) For the 15 minutes those two trials last, you can definitely make an AA of experience. It's sick sick experience in those trials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If i'm wrong plz correct me.<br />
<br />
I personally see no problems with this, but that's just me.  Sure, it's not the nicest thing to do, but i can understand why they would do it.  MPG sure as hell isnt the hardest place to tank, but it can get ugly really quick.<br />
<br />
As to setting the bar that high ... i didnt Flair.  The clerics i was with set the bar that high as well as the other groupmates.  I wasnt getting the shit kicked out of me every pull, but it was difficult enough that the cleric was using  quick heals 70% of the time thanks to spikes.  LR10 and ID10 did wonders for that though.  By the end it was as mind-numbing as BoT.  Then again, back in the first few days of OoW the only people in MPG were the time guilds and KT flagged folks, so i was the little guppy in the pond (their expectations were higher).<br />
<br />
I've personally told Beastlords no way Jose once they got to a ldon camp because they didn't have their 65% slow (Bst was our primary slower and 50% wouldnt cut it).  The same holds true for enchanters in a tipt/vxed group who lacked TD3 and experience with managing charmed pets.  If the group wants to run at X efficiency, then the people within need to be prepared for it, and the people recruiting for the group need to ask the questions at the start of the search rather than when the person is en route.<br />
<br />
The person to be mad at is the person who recruited the warrior without asking the question right up front.  You can't really blame the cleric who isnt comfortable healing the tank they have incomming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">A lot of people have certain expectations for how much experience they want on average in an xp group or how much tolerance they have for downtime or deaths.  If a group doesn't meet those expectations or if they don't think the group can meet those expectations they leave.  Quite understandable IMO.<br />
<br />
Back when I had trouble getting groups I'd just take whatever I can get.  Now I refuse anything with worse XP than KT and if we haven't made much progress within 1 hour then I make an excuse and leave.  Downtime is not fun for me, repeated CRs is not fun for me, I play the game to have fun.  If I get invited to a group that's netting me only 1 AA per hour and I'm not there for some other reason I'm probably going to bail.  It's not worth my time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In challenging zones (regardless of level), the key group members need to be roughly equivlent.<br />
<br />
<br />
These statements are just wrong in this thread's context.  The poster's point is that clerics, chanters, and really a number of other classes don't have to be nearly as well geared as the tank to get the &quot;uber&quot; groups.  That's been true for years in EQ.  Tanks are extraordinarily gear dependent.  I watched in GoD while a cleric in my guild with inferior gear and far less AA than me got all the vxed/tipt and kod'taz groups he wanted and I simply couldn't  get a pickup group there.  People wanted Time geared tanks to make it easy.<br />
<br />
MPG is the same way.  Could I take there?  Probably.  Pre OoW I tanked Kod'Taz repeatedly and Vxed some with a good cleric.  I got turned down on my way over to MPG at L68 buffing to 9700 hps with only up through PoP buffs and all defensive AAs including the first 3 ranks of the OoW ones.  That wasn't good enough.  Hell, I can even bring along a 2 boxed cleric to help with heals.  So hell yes I could tank there.  But people want that Time+ gear to make it easy.  Does the cleric need Time+ gear?  Nope.  They just need average gear and have to be competent.<br />
<br />
Simple truth is that much of the group's success depends on the tank's gear level and far less on other people's gear level.<br />
<br />
Unless you're 69-70 with the new OoW defensive aa's don't expect pickup groups in MPG unless you buff out to ~10k.<br />
<br />
With some OoW buffage I've been around 10.4k and with full OoW buffs I'd be high 10ks somewhere at my current L69.  Not good enough for what the pickup groups want.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your gear level is, but look at the original posters magelo.  At his level of gear, and without full defensive AA's yet, there are simply going to be some nasty damage spikes if he is tanking MPG.  This is not a knock on his gear, as no one starts with great gear, but simply the truh of the matter.  Can he tank MPG?  Yes.  Will it be efficient?  No.  Look at my Magelo as a contrast.  I am EP geared, not uber, but not bad.  My cleric(who heals as you suggest, as do most clerics in MPG...there are some bad ones, you learn to avoid them) has FT 20 and a nice mana pool.  At times she still needs to ask for a short med break if we have gotten a good fast pace going.<br />
<br />
<br />
An enchanter does what? Slow a mob on a single pull then sit there and watch tv? On a multi pull is the only time a chanter actually works unless you are talking about charmed mobs where the chanter actually has to worry a bit. <br />
<br />
Sounds like you need a new enchanter.  Enchanter nukes may not be real efficient, but DPS is DPS, and the chanter I group with is chaining nukes when not mezzing.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes there is such a thing as RL calling to pay bills and raise kids effectively.<br />
<br />
So basically what I am hearing is that if you are not EP or Time geared, which means you are or have spent large amounts of time in a raiding guild, stay out of the way.  Its not about whether you CAN do it, its about if you can do it while everyone else knits sweaters.  I know I CAN do it  because I did it Saturday and the cleric I was with had to med break maybe twice the whole time.  Ive had many many pickup group clerics comment on how well I play the class as well as how poorly those so far geared above me play.  How so often superior geared tanks rely on their gear rather than their skill.  Not saying anyone here fits that description but I cant count the number of times I have heard that.<br />
<br />
And not to say that there ARENT possible upgrades in the bazaar now but at what cost?  I mean these arent even reasonable prices.  BoC is 350.  Midwinters was 200 the other night.  I dont know about you guys but its not going to happen by grouping in wos getting 2-3pp a kill and scrambling for named mobs vs 15 other groups.<br />
<br />
This isnt a poor me thread.  This isnt a point finger thread at people who spend their lives living in this game.  This is about how much bs it is that someone can bust their ass, acquire decent amounts of skill and levels and yet be denied over someone who was pled up to where they are and fed loot from their old main.  Its all about hps and what people perceive a tank to be.  Well people, you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

If you were to add nothign but 1000hp to your character you'd see a huge difference.  This game is about cumulative upgrades leading up to big changes. 1000 hp may be less than one round ... but the difference is huge in tough spots.<br />

Finishing up OoW defensive aa's is more important than 10,000 hps though imo.  It may not be as noticable in older PoP zones, but in GoD/OoW the difference is as large as no-defensive vs LR5/ID5 in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Oh, please enlighten us with what they should do instead.  Damage is damage, chanter nukes are balanced fine and give them something to do after debuffing if there's no cc'ing or charming to be done.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  The added dps is nice for groups especially if they have serpent sitting with lots of mana to use and provided they're not being lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Derail inc.<br />
<br />
K Mr. Sarcastic, you definitely picked the wrong fight with this one.<br />
<br />
First off let's get what I said crystal clear, to avoid confusion in future posts; I'm criticizing Sony for not knowing what the fuck to do with Enchanters. Not Enchanters themselves for using the pathetic tools that are given to them.<br />
<br />
The animation pets never should have went live. Enchanters have no business with them, and without the sufficient AAs they're inanely useless. Originally, when creating Enchanters, the popular thought was not to give them a pet and give them *gasp* charm instead. However at the time, charm was thought to have too little risk versus reward; read as too risky. So they weakened the charm line, and gave Enchanters pets that could only attack if their master was attacked, couldn't be commanded to back off, and before they changed the pet scripts to NOT break mez, that was all they would do - break mez on shit because the Enchanter had gotten hit while trying to mez to begin with. SCORE what a fucking brain genius idea with that.<br />
<br />
THIS was the original Enchanter Vision *tm:<br />
<br />
The primary focus of the enchanter's art is found in the name of the arcane order to which they belong. Their spells are crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make them fight for their new masters, or to magically enhance the capabilities of the enchanter's allies. They also have some skill in offensive spells, but they will never match those of the wizard. <br />
<br />
Enchanters, like all the magic users, may follow any of a fair number of gods, both good and evil, and can be found among the following races: dark elf, Erudite, gnome, high elf, and human.  <br />
<br />
The original description was a GOOD one. It was what Enchanters SHOULD have been. And look at that last line in the first paragraph: the will never match those of the wizard. That's fucking right, never. If you want somebody for their nukes, go /who all wiz lfg and invite one of them. And hell I don't see anything there about SUMMONING. Enchanters belong in the more subtle aspects of the arcane arts.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the class should have evolved based on that mentality. But no, that proved a little TOO difficult for Sony to fucking mange. Instead, they redefined the Enchanter class.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are the most subtle of spell casters, with little focus on doing damage directly but tremendous impact on the world around them. Enchanters are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers. <br />
<br />
Enchanters specialize on improving the minds of their allies, with unmatched mana regeneration spells and mental enhancements. Haste spells are also the domain of the enchanter, providing incredible boosts in attack speed for members of their group. Enchanters have many powers of illusion as well, allowing them to take the form of many different creatures and races. <br />
<br />
In battle, enchanters are able to bring order to chaotic situations, often saving their group in a fight that would otherwise be lost. Enchanters possess the ability to mesmerize their enemies, temporarily removing them from a battle. Attack slowing spells are also a specialty, dramatically lowering the speed of a monster's attacks for a period of time. In many situations, enchanters can call upon powerful charm spells to subjugate the mind of a monster and command it to do the enchanter's bidding. <br />
<br />
Enchanters are a powerful class, but often rely upon a group to reach their full potential. Experienced enchanters thrive in chaotic situations where they can make the most of their offensive abilities. The enchanter is a good choice for players who enjoy playing in groups and like to take charge of challenging situations.  <br />
<br />
The renewed Enchanter definition nearly completely removed the earlier definition's focus on what Enchanters were supposed to do; &quot;Their spells are crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make them fight for their new masters, or to magically enhance the capabilities of the enchanter's allies.&quot; The old definition nearly focused aruond Charm. <br />
<br />
The new Enchanter definition does mention the lack of offensive skill (as it should) but focuses more on buffing (fucking boring) and crowd control. And let's face it; PoP, LDoN, and GoD killed much of the need for crowd control, OR made mobs so MR it became a death sentence to try.<br />
<br />
What SHOULD have been done:<br />
<br />
1) Balance charm a LONG time ago, by putting a 1% slow component built into charm spells, and disabling a charmed pet from being able to wield pet weapons. This would have prevented charmed mobs from being hasted, which basically accounts for the drastic increase in DPS of a charmed mob).<br />
2) Strengthened the duration of charm, lowered the mana cost of, or made a method for safer recharming, while simultaneously removing the animation line.<br />
3) Never have introduced the PoP type experience zones which had safe spots for camps up the yinyang and roaming mobs capable of single pulls nearly anywhere you went.<br />
4) Never have increased the level of mobs immunity to magic, especially on extremely hard hitting monsters, to where one resisted mez = nearly certain death for Enchanters.<br />
5) Given Enchanters more of a raid role by keeping crowd control a key aspect of raiding.<br />
<br />
Enchanters should not be forced to play wizzy for your band of merry men in order to not be fucking labeled &quot;lazy&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well, your rant is more along the lines of charming being implemented wrong which I don't even really disagree with.  However chanter nukes are fine and even if you wanted chanters to be more charm based there will be people who will prefer nuking over charming or the other way around, just different play styles.  Also by lazy I meant tash'ing/slowing and sitting around with FM, as in not being efficient when they could add some dps by nuking, wow what a concept!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I have a 70 chanter and I would glady give up every single charm spell in my spellbook if they would just remove the recast time on nukes.  I'd like to be the judge of when I can nuke k thnx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Yes I understand your personal comprehension of a lazy Enchanter. It's basically the comprehension of an Enchanter that plays his class as it was originally intended to be played, if said Enchanter was old school. Up until recently, all Enchanter nukes released had a stun compnent - aka insane aggro. They were IMPRACTICAL. It's why SoD is a very good tanking tool; that's an Enchanter nuke on it. Bottom line, an Enchanter isn't lazy for doing his job.<br />
<br />
edit: It's an argument that Enchanters shouldn't be perceived as lazy for doing their class descripted job Moruk, not that current Enchanters with the tools and spells given to them should be FORCED to charm. Obviously Sony is so anti-charm by now, that's what the class is doomed to live as. Which, to Enchanters that originally rolled a long time before what the class has become now, isn't fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Yes, I'm fully aware of the 0.0 sec stun portion on older chanter nukes.  Chanters have had straight dd nukes without a stun portion since Velious though so it's been a while.  I'm not really even taking a shot at enchanters, you seem to be taking it so personally.  Any class who has mana sitting around when they could be adding dps is lazy imo even if their dps isn't that great, it helps.  Here's an example, PoE mob dps output is really low so clerics provided they're ch'ing and have decent gear they should be able to stay FM pretty much.  So a non lazy cleric helps out by adding dps using such things as MoR, nukes and/or yaulp and meleeing.  Using their mana to it's max potential!!  <br />
<br />
Even when chanter nukes had a stun component(pre58) they could still fit in a few nukes.  What?!  Playstyles aren't the same as they were 5 years ago?!  I'll be damned!!  I don't see how you're trying to argue with me for saying a chanter can add more to a group then just tashing/slowing then sitting around(hi there nukes/charm)  I think most are happy they have something to contribute to groups other than that intial debuffing/group buffs if there's no charming or cc'ing to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I'm saying that it isn't fair to label those Enchanters lazy. It isn't fair to them because that's not what chanters do. Aside from the fact you're grossly underestimating the amount of saved mana they might go through on a resist (1 or 2 arcane runes, 1 or 2 or 3 mezzes, etc etc) it doesn't make them lazy, it makes them average. A lazy enchanter would be one that doesn't even mez, or keep root in his spell line up, or ever tash. Nuking shouldn't be required to deem an Enchanter as good, or at least average.<br />
<br />

<br />
An enchanter that does not do all he/she can to aid a group(aka DPS when mana and time allows) is lazy.  This is a black and white thing.  It has zero to do with an enchanters role, their class description, whether at some point in time, some of their spells had a stun, none of that.  An enchanter in MPG(and this thread was about MPG orriginally) is oing to have to do minimal CC, so they by god better be ready to nuke.<br />
<br />
This is not even enchanter specific...any class that sits on their ass FM just because their primary job is not needed at that moment is lazy.  An FM cleric sitting doing nothing is lazy, a druid who snares and sits is lazy, etc, etc.  Don't make this over complicated.  If you are not doing all you can, go find some one elses group to leach exp off of, cuz I got no use for you.</div></div><hr />

So I guess that a Warrior that doesn't bring a vast assortment of weapons (no matter what level of gameplay that Warrior is at), a bag full of utility potions just in case there's no druid/mage to DS or SoW, gate potions, clickie dispell stones, Puppet Strings, a CH potion from Ishva Mal, and spare food for all of his group members, would also be lazy according to your mentality. After all, those are all things that a Warrior could in theory do, to aid a group. It has zero to do with a Warrior's role (except maybe the weapons, but I'm talking about having some seriously fucking diverse selection of weapons, swords to specifically use with furious, in addition to their normal aggro setup, their dps setup, and of course an anklesmasher or silken whip of ensnaring, and whatever other random bullshit that I'm not including) but nontheless they would all aid a group in one way or another.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, if you're not doing EVERYTHING you can, go find somebody else's group to leech exp off of.</div></div><hr />

There is a huge difference between casting a nuke that is most likely in your spellbook and carying some of the stupid shit you mention(tho in fact I do carry all but the puppet strings and CH potion...WTB, 20 slot containers).

Actually, I would use my snare whip to try and snare if the group has no snarer.  Let me try and put this in simple terms for you, since you cannot seem to comprehend.  I do not give 2 shits for what an enchanters role used to be, or what things where like back when.  I do care about what I am doing tonight, and my enchanter sure as hell better use all the tools available to them, just as I do, just as the rest of my group does.  If you do not, you suck.  It is very black and white:  I carry around an ungodly number of clicky and proc items(cloudy potions, lev potions, IVU potions, instaclicks, DS potions, cobalt bracer, ToD, snare whip, gate neck and more)...it is not too much for me to ask that my group memebers have at least most of their spells, and that they use them.  <br />
<br />
The enchanter I group with nukes every time the spell gem pops, the shaman I group with keeps a HoT on me, DOT's and nukes, the mage I group with never lets DS drop, the cleric I group with has saved more than one situation with a smartly times stun.  If you do less, you suck, and can go leach exp off another group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">argue all you want about what an enchanter should or should not be. they are what they are and one thing they are is good nukers. comparing them with a wizard is absurb. but saying an enchanter shouldnt nuke because he isnt a wizard is like saying a secondary warrior on a raid should sit down and shut up instead of meleeing because he isnt a rogue. a good player uses all his tools and not just those that supposedly &quot;define the class&quot;.<br />
<br />
i remember a raid of ours wiping because people &quot;played their classes&quot;. it was a stupid cleric epic raid in chardok and the raid was wiped to greenies. no one needed heals really, the mobs were too weak. no one needed anything. the only thing that was needed was to keep the mobs from fleeing. but nooooooo..... snaring was the domain of druids and rangers who were in very short supply in this particular group. did the clerics root? nope. did wizards root? nope. bards play snare song? nope. enchanters root? nope. what about wizard quad snare? nope. nothing. everyone played their class. the enchanter mezzed. the one druid snared. the ranger i dont know what he did, probably meleed because that was &quot;his class&quot;. the wizard nuked. the bard probably sung haste and slow and ds or who knows what. the wizards nuked. the poor chanter had agro like nobodies business  with all those adds. he was getting precious little help from people who were &quot;playing their class&quot;. i was one of the last ones down tanking about 10+ mobs at once with all the healers dead.<br />
<br />
sometimes 'playing your class' is a bad idea. and enchanters refusing to nuke when they have nothing to do are playing their class too well and are a liability to their group.</div></div><hr />

Chanters as a role were givin the ability to nuke to add dps when mana permits. Therefor its a part of their group role to nuke when they have mana. If they dont they arent adding anything except slowing a mob and buffing. Chanter buffs are great mind you but you can walk up to the next group and ask for chanter buffs that typically last a long time. Chanters = crowd control, slow, tash, cripple, nuke when mana permits. Thats their job.<br />
<br />
Warriors as a role were givin the ability to tank. Warriors arent that great at keeping agro unless they are in a high end raiding guild. Sure we were givin the ability to wield a silken whip of ensnaring but thats not our job. Wielding the whip = cuts down on dps = cuts down on agro = more damage taken to you (has neg ac). This is not the warriors job. Nor should any group rely on a proc for snare its bad enough they rely on procs for the MT to have agro. <br />
<br />
Your right, warriors could walk up into a group with Dshield potions, a Truncheon of doom to slow, a CH potion, a snare weapon for snare, Journeymans walking stick to debuff, the claw off of zlandicar to cripple, gnoll lariats to stun, Resist potions and every thing else you can think of to buff the group. While were at it lets make the warrior 3 box a War cler and shaman that way everyone else can sit there and do nothing. Oh wait why doesnt the war just solo if he's doing all this shit. Warriors arent meant to do all this stuff or they would have givin us innate snare proc discs, slow procs, ect. They gave chanters these spells so they could use them.</div></div><hr />

In one sense you are wrong, I can outta mana my 7k+ ft18 (only 68) chanter in far less than 2 1/2 hrs and he is focused up pretty well. Try tashing everything, mezzing adds (I pull with a ranger and usually get 2 mobs at least part by choice, that and placate sucks), and nuking soon as the gem comes up on the latest nuke (gogo 3k+ crits).<br />
<br />
The offset to that is I dont always sit (I box so I do it always in between fights but not inbetween nukes, etc) and more importantly I get the get outta mana jail free card (gather mana). Only a handful of times (and that is mezzing 2-3 adds consistently) do I run outta mana fast enough to actually need to med my chanter. I also try to debuff the mez target before the mez (with malo from my shammy) but it doesnt always stick (I use malonisia to max the debuff and risk the resist).<br />
<br />
So in short, shut up you chanters, you suck (or you need to equip yourself) if u cant do it all. A 6boxed chanter can do it all why cant you?????<br />

In particular if they are doing other things, like nuking, leaving them at 50mish. Even with focuses, FT, and a decent sized mana pool. Especially with no shaman, when you're tashing, slowing, crippling, mezzing, rooting, THEN factoring in chain arcane runing in case shit goes bad, sorry you're fucking FLAT OUT WRONG, it's a huge mana burn. <br />
<br />
All I said is they aren't fucking lazy if they're not nuking. Apparently it's a hard concept for folks to grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">The obvious fucking exaggeration is no, a Warrior won't be considered lazy if you don't carry around all that shit. It's considered above average, you're not fucking lazy if you're a level 55 non twinked warrior and don't happen to have a ToD, Silken Whip, DS and Gate potions, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Go back and check the titlke of this thread.  Notice the reference to a zone.  We are not talking about level 55, grouping in PoN or whatever.  We are talking level 65, AA's, in one of the higher end exp zones in game.  At that level, you sure as hell better have the tools.<br />
<br />
Same shit for an Enchanter. Oh, and since Dementing Visions, the first non-stun nuke, drops off TORMAX, then yea it's a fucking valid thing to go back to the Velious age. Even today some chanters ain't running around with that in their spellbook. Are they lazy because they don't have it? Then you have Insanity later on, and Maddness of Ibiki from a rune turn in from GoD.<br />
<br />
Who the fuck cares about a Velious era nuke when there are PoP nukes, GoD nukes and OoW nukes that are better?  I do not think it is too much to expect that a chanter in MPG has at least  one of them, if not more.<br />
<br />
Even with focuses, FT, and a decent sized mana pool. Especially with no shaman, when you're tashing, slowing, crippling, mezzing, rooting, THEN factoring in chain arcane runing in case shit goes bad, sorry you're fucking FLAT OUT WRONG, it's a huge mana burn. <br />
<br />
In that case, the enchanter is not sitting with full fucking mana , and what we have been saying does not apply.  No shit, if mana is an issue, then nuking is not a good idea.  But if you are sitting FM and not nuking, you are a shitty enchanter, and leaching exp off your group.</div></div><hr />

Go visit the bazaar. You can now buy elemental + gear.<br />
<br />
I'm not seeing it for tanks.  The closest I've seen to elem+ tank gear in the bazaar is the new charged magnetic bp and legs.  The legs were selling for 450k in the bazaar on rodcet nife yesterday.  Let me just pull that 450k out of my ass...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Support classes like a cleric or chanter should definitely be nuking if they are over 80% or so mana.  A pull that takes more than 80% of a manabar for a cleric or enchanter to deal with never happens in exp groups.  Especially in MPG where single-pulls are completely trivial to get.  Sitting at FM is not optimal for any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">tell the lazy ench to root the mob ?  :p<br />

Rooting isn't a very effective method of dealing with runners in the time of proc augs and WA5.  Having a rog with WA5, 4 damage procs, and maybe poison up pretty much guarantees that no root will last more than about 5 seconds hehe.  Add a couple more melees and it's pretty much a waste of time to root a mob the melees are attacking.</div></div><hr />

If you truly believe this is true I'd rather not have you tanking for me. I've Played enchanters quite a bit and they are no harder to play than a warrior if not easier in most circumstances. The only exception being ( possibly ) running a hasted charm pet in something like vxed. otherwise it's pretty much just cake. Especially at the higher lvl's of the game. <br />
<br />
Pretty off the original Topic, but hitting Hotkey 1.. then Hotkey 2 then Hotkey 3 then waiting 45 seconds and clicking nuke isn't that hard ( remember we're talking MPG here )</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, since you seem dead set on being a dumbass, let me point a couple things out for you:<br />
<br />
1:  we are talking MPG here.  More than 1 mob a pull is rare.  Enchanters are not spending much time or mana keeping mobs mezzed.<br />
<br />
2:  If the enchanter is using most of his mana on debuffing and/or mezzing, then of course he should not be nuking.  It has been stated more than once that we are talking about the enchanter sitting FM not nuking.  That was the one you where defending originally, not the one that is busy doing other stuff.<br />
<br />
3:  Enchanter is no different than any other class...you can play them ok, and get the job done, and anybody can play a chanter that well, or you can exceed what is expected...these players are a bit rarer for any class.  Thankfully, I spend most of my EXP group time with 2 chanters who very much exceed what you and the rest of the gimp chanters provide.  They keep mobs mezzed, they debuff, they nuke, they goof around with illusions, and provide some entertaining conversation.<br />
<br />
4:  You may 'what they go through, at every level of game play', but you surely seem to not know what they are actually capable of.  But hey, go ahead, make excuses for your sucking...it is much easier than actually learning to play your class better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If an enchanter is FM, to cast their level 68 nuke, Psychosis, at full mana cost, is 375 mana.  That is assuming no mana pres, no Spell Casting Mastery.  Now with just Clairvoyance(20 mana per tick) and medding(21 mana per tick), you will see that you will regen the mana from casting that nuke in under one minute.  Now explain to me again why casting a nuke when you reach FM is bad.<br />
<br />
As far as your soling 3 expansion old content...gratz you, I can understand why you are forced to solo, as with your attitude, grouping has to be a rare thing for you.<br />
<br />
Asa far as non nuking enchanters being average...you need to get out and meet more enchanters.  I would consider them far below average.  And I consider anyone who is not going all out to help the group lazy.  So they fall into that catagory as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>boy-</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Hps don't mean much once you hit around the high 9k low-10k mark anyways when doing xp.  As long as you can ch, the amount of hp really doesn't matter since ch maxes around 9.5k or something and in xp ch's usually land for 5-6k on average.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, you keep bringing in the idea that you're missing 2 swings worth of hp, that's totally false.  Your very low ac is the issue, such that you're going to take so much dmg that using ch is a liability.  That's the issue.  Or you may be able to ch, but have to take medbreaks cus they burn too much mana patching (remember pg is a non-horseable zone).  You're already taking 7% more dmg than my normal tank just from aa, then on top of that you're missing about 700ac, and i can barely stay even on mana on him.<br />
<br />
The fact is while you may be able to camp pg well enough for your likeing, it may not be to the ability of someone elses.  There are people who chainpull in pg, without medbreaks and without c3, and when I do xp, that's what i expect as well (otherwise the xp is way better in RCoD).  <br />
<br />
Someone else got it right - you'll have to make your own group.  There's nothing wrong with you getting people of your own caliber to camp pg, and i'm sure you'll enjoy it and get lots of xp/loot out of it.  However, you can't expect anyone to take you into a group just because you think you can tank pg 'good enough'.<br />
<br />
And there's plenty of non-raid gear even outside of pg that could upgrade you.  I see 3 or so WoS/RcoD upgrades that would upgrade you quite nicely, not to mention faction armor which really isn't that bad.  People who call it 'elemental-level' are exaggerating -- however they're still upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
p.s.  I'm sorry but a chanter doesn't do much in pg.  A retarded monkey can pull mobs solo so there's no mezzing, cripple is absolutely negigible in such short fights as pg and a nuke probably saves more cleric mana than cripple does.  That leaves 245 mana/mob to tash/slow it (assuming no stick).  Given i ch multiple times per mob and that costs more mana than it costs you to slow it, you better as hell be nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Exaggeration for effect going over your head?<br />
<br />
Fuckin casting arcane rune twice because you got a resist does not equal an out of mana enchanter, even if he was nuking before the fight.<br />
Na Haas didnt go over my head, just didnt feel like allowing you to use hyperbole and then let the chanter use it as an excuse to get off the hook on this one. Facts not well u fucking suck usually works better.<br />
<br />
I use my chanter harder than 95% of the players out there. It is not uncommon for me to cast tash/mez, 5-6 nukes, and maybe a rune (to replace my old one if I get hit for actual damage) per pull (2 mobs in under a minute in places like hard ldon, RCoD, etc. PG is even easier cause pull rate slower in most grps) yet I dont run low enough on mana over the long term. And that is including solo C6 buffs to 4 casters, haste to my 2 tanks, etc. I gradually wear down over an hour or so and by time GM is back up I am at 20-30% where my buffs are wearing down on time so I rebuff then blow GM to get back to 100%.<br />
<br />
In short, if you are a chanter and you cant nuke (and you are not mezzing the hell outta a boatload of adds) then you either 1) need far better equipment and AAs and dont belong in PG or 2) you suck. No in-betweens here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Funny thing is there is a similar post about crappy tanks in mpg over at the cleric forums on gameglow.<br />
My take on it - if your group is luclin / PoP up tier 3 geared you will need a 10k+ buffed tank to be even able to get reasonable exp. You might actually be better off in WoS or Ruined City unless your group is well rounded. Actually i was tanking for such a group 2 weeks ago and the cleric never went oom (got Chanter/BL/Shaman/Necro/Wiz and me).<br />
If you have elemental + geared folks you might not need that many hp for your tank but you will still need early slows and fast/early heals.<br />
<br />
I simply wont accept a tank with less hp than myself, regardless of class, its just not worth the trouble even if we can do a ZI group.</div></div><hr />

There are a number of places you can get single group upgrades with some ease outside MPG.  The bazaar in your case is a good starting spot.  LDoN is not dead, just slowed, but it is still possible to group there and gain points(hint:  make the group yourself).<br />
<br />
No one here has said you could not successfully tank pretty much any mob in MPG.  You can.  You cannot tank an MPG group efficiently or effectivly tho untill you up your HP's, up your AC, and up your AA's.  Untill you do that, there are a number of awesome zones in OoW you can hunt in.  WoS, Dranik Hollows, Ruined City and the instinces off there pop to mind.  There are some decent things drop in all those areas.</div></div><hr />

You see, the difference here is we can't do MPG, we know we can't do MPG so we do what we can and have fun.  You on the other hand can't do MPG but you think you can.  Then you come here and bitch, whine, rant, rave about not being able to do whatever the fuck you want to do when you want to do it.<br />
<br />
And it's funny how you mantion we have never seen you do what you do and you have never seen what we do then go right in to talking about how you can do shit we could never dream of doing.  Well let me clue you in, you can't do MPG and neither can we there super star, guess you aren't the God you thought.<br />
<br />
And as to you being able to group with anyone and be successful, well, I suppose this thread wouldn't be here if that were true.  We have a hand picked group because we are R/L friends.  We have a hand picked group because we function very well as a team.  We have a hand picked group so we don't have to deal with babies like you on a day to day bases to play a fuckin video game.<br />

I didnt start this to have a pissing match with you bubba but Im not gonna have you stepping on my shoes either.  Ive never had a problem standing up to nor dealing with bullies and that includes you.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I wasn't here with the intention of starting a pissing match with you either Corky but I'm not gonna have you stepping on my shoes either.  I've never had a problem standing up to nor dealing with slackjawed shit flingers and that includes you.</div></div><hr />

The difference is slacknuts is that I HAVE DONE MPG.  Successfully.  Many times now.  At the time of posting I had done it just not that many times to be in a comfort zone.  Which holds even more weight on my initial post about people judging you on your hps only.<br />
<br />
And no, I didnt say anything bad until that poster started insulting after what...like<br />
seven pages of post had gone by?  Again, say your piece and be decent about it and noone gets prickly.  Start throwing the comments and things get more messy. So go back to flopping your burgers bitch and stay out of it.  <br />
<br />
So lets see this is two of the group...I amusingly await the other four lol.</div></div><hr />

You are indeed a petulant child.  You've gone from a whine to name calling cause you didn't get your way.  What next, push me down at recess?</div></div><hr />

Unless you have a tag of the top 5 guilds on the server, a cleric of such a guild will be used to a certain standard of gear, suddenly being forced to spam heal and go oom every so often from it blows. Ubers like to group with ubers.<br />
<br />
What cleric fits a 9 k warrior in MPG ? 5k hp maybe and 6k manapool ? You better hold aggro and take medding breaks every 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
This is exactly the problem you are going to find in a game that forces you to group...at a certain point in time wither it comes in expansions or years...content is going to become so specialized that it will cause more and more zones to become ghost towns and the gap between the &quot;haves and have nots&quot; will scale exponentionally.  Those able to spend endless hours ubering will become more uber and those that cannot make daily groups and 4 hrs a night gaming, will fall behind.  Which is a flawed design moneywise as people will not be able to get quick groups and end up leaving the game.<br />
<br />
This is an issue that the devs at EQ1 don't really care about at all but figure on keeping out of EQ2.  Now at this stage of the game if the competition of up and coming MMORPG's turns out to be worth something, their corporate strategy may change if EQ2 flops or if EQ1 lose a great deal of subscribers to other games.  But if in the latter event EQ1 decides to revamp itself by allowing others to get much better gear without going through Time difficulty events then they are going to have to deal with the uber peeps whining about all they had to do to get there stuff back in the day.  In which case the japs at Sony will give them the middle finger and make a money decision to keep customers paying and making soloing or acquiring gear a much easier task.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Ogun, there are a couple flaws to what you say.<br />
<br />
1:  'Those able to spend endless hours ubering will become more uber and those that cannot make daily groups and 4 hrs a night gaming, will fall behind.'  This is an inevitability.  If you put more time into a game, you get more out of it.  End of story.  This is not a flaw as you suggest, it is in fact proper design.<br />
<br />
2:  ' But if in the latter event EQ1 decides to revamp itself by allowing others to get much better gear without going through Time difficulty events'  This is already the case.  100 hp gear is available in the bazaar.  I wear a 73 AC, 110 hp BP that is droppable(tho I did get it as a drop).  MPG trials have 200 hp gear dropping for single group events.  FT 20 is available easily for casual players now.  This is not waiting on EQ1 to revamp itself if EQ2 dives, but is in fact already happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see why you still haven't figured out basic kindergarten logic.<br />
<br />
I didn't insult you.  I tried to explain facts to you.  You take that as many children do, and assume that I was insulting you personally.  I wasn't.  The fact of the matter is that this is a game, and no one is forced to group with you, talk to you, or even look at you.  Second of all, there is absolutely no reason for Joe Blow cleric to WANT to heal a 6k/1500 tank when he can just heal a 10k/2k tank.  Figure it out.<br />
<br />
You go back and find where I insulted you.  You're gonna see that you're making up all this &quot;Prickly&quot; you're generating, and looking a whole lot like a crying child while you're at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">The difference is slacknuts is that I HAVE DONE MPG. Successfully. Many times now.  <br />
<br />
Just curious what your definition of successful is.<br />
I didnt die ? Noone in my group died ? Only had to zone/evac x times/hour? We had no medbreaks ? We made x AA/hour ?<br />
Try a non optimized group setup with Pally/SK/Berserker/Shaman/Beastlord/cleric without chanter buffs (ZI group due to guild doing raid trials and CoH might have been possible for replacements between) and getting like an AA/hour at 70 (with 80/20 and leadership exp on) and still being able to melee and nuke.<br />
There is a great difference as what folks consider as successful. <br />
<br />
<br />
Btw. as reference to one of Redhennas earlier posts, a chanter can be quite busy in MPG, not near ZI or taskfiend/blind hunter areas, but camps like riftseekers zoneline or north of 6-ways a bit from there, there are a lot of wanderers and respawn seems to be faster too.<br />
Went there once with a guild group with pally/chanter/2 clerics/2 rangers(+ botted wiz) and still the clerics went low mana pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">When it comes to exp groups, hp means absolutely nothing, so by saying 'hp = upgrades' one is deluding oneself pretty bad.<br />
You will never risk one-rounding, or two-rounding.<br />
What totally, entirely and ultimately decides how much your group will/can handle at once, or, how much healing you need, is your AA and AC. Hp plays fourteenth fiddle here.<br />
Nonraiders get shit for AC and as someone pointed out, that's the big gap, it being of much larger import than your AAs. This fact is really really sad.<br />
<br />
The top tanks in the game are now fast approachin 3000ac. Unbuffed. They can frigging tank 5 mobs at once, while your CC people alongside wizards and mages nuke the shit down, and the cleric too, between div-arb and epic-arb and the pally waving. (Btw, pally pulling in MPG = the win)<br />
<br />
There are basically very few pieces of AC gear without good HP on it.<br />
There is a metric fuckton of gear with good HP and intcasterAC.<br />
The former is tank gear, the latter is magelo jerkoff gear.<br />
<br />
Clerics refusing to group with tanks happen all the time, maybe they want faster game, maybe they are scared, maybe they are idiots. All those reasons are valid for them. Respect that.</div></div><hr />
