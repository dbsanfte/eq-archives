We will be raiding him soon and am unable to find any good info on his abilities (Max Hit/Enrage-Rampages?/What does he cast/Proc? etc...) and some kind of a raid strat. We are not elemental geared as we are just now getting into PoP Raid content.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the SK 1.5 epic piece he drops.  As I understand it, he is a required kill for an SK that does not have the 1.0 epic. This Kill is part of the Pre-Quest. Please correct me if I am wrong but I believe I am correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozenorb</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drunder50 is correct.  For the SK 1.5 epic who does not have 1.0.  <br />
<br />
Did him twice with 1 group with 2 SKs, cleric, shaman, enchanter, and wizard; I played the SK, Cleric, and Wizard.  Max hit is for 1600 quad and rampages.  I was lvl 65 (if i recall about 8500 hp/1800 AC buffed and max PoP defensive AAs) at the time  and he hit me for max often enough compared to other mobs that DI fired.    I don't recall the minimum hit anymore but I want to say it was about 400s.  He's slowable but it's mitigated quite a bit. <br />
<br />
We used a charmed pet for DPS along with the Wizard.  The SK who MT'd (me) was chain CHealed, and the other SK was the RT got healed by the shaman.  <br />
<br />
There is no point to raiding him unless you are planning to get a SK their pre-epic piece.  And he doesn't always drop the quest piece either.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps out.</div></div><hr />

Standard tactics really. MT got aggro, the rest assisted. We never got him slowed so there were a few times where I didnt think I was gonna make it but it all worked out in the end and he did drop the SK Epic piece :-)... All in all a fun fight..<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info folks..Appreciate it..</div></div><hr />
