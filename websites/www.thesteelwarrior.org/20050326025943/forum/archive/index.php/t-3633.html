<br />
i was wondering, exactly how hard do named mobs hit in hard adventures?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">full 65 group, the named hit for around 1k while normal mobs hit for just over 900.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, named in hard are just as different as in normal.<br />
The mob for assassination i had on my only hard adventure hit for 1600+ and was a pure melee one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The named also hit more times per round, in addition to hitting harder.<br />
<br />
I like to equate them to the Diaku Overseer in Tactics, minus the rampage effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Normal mobs in hard missions can hit for up to 998. The only difference I've seen for the mini named is that they swing a lot more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks, i assume they are slowable/debuffable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly slowable, they mitigate.<br />
<br />
Nothing too horrible assuming you get them single, I was considering doing this tactic, however, named can and will often times spawn fairly deep in the dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wouldnt try a hard with much less then a elem gruop... my and 3 friends did some named hunting in hards this weekend, 65 Bard, 65 Necro, 65 War, 65 pally, and 65cleric (bot), 65 rogue (bot)...<br />
<br />
we were able to kill normaly stuff and named but could take more then 2 at a time unless we got lucky, they hit very speraticly... one round will be all misses next will be 2 900s and a 150...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feel free to check my magelo, I am pre-VT and pre-elementals, and have not yet completely failed a hard mission (have gone to overtime sometimes though).   With a full group similarly equipped and AA'd to me, we make slow but steady progress in hard missions.  Pulls of 2-3 are hairy but ok.  Pacification with 305 charisma is the only way for us to break busy rooms.  Our best result so far was spawning the boss with 32 minutes left.  If we get a completely linear map, then we are forced to skip any content we can.  It has happened that we reached the boss room and only spawned him while clearing his room, due to having skipped so many of the earlier mobs.  I would never attempt a rescue with this group, but assassinations are much like crawling the Zek wings of Tactics, which is doable with good pre-VT equipment and 100 AA's per person.  The nice thing is that every item that drops in these hard missions is an upgrade for someone in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the items and exp are what I'm curious in for these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh look at my magelo; I'm hardly elemental.  However, I fairly routinely do &quot;hard&quot; difficulty groups, and so far not a single failure has been owed to me.  In fact, I have only died due to extenuating circumstances (cleric dying to add, cleric going ld etc), and i have had no problem at all with agro control.<br />
<br />
Quite honestly, I think people hear the horror stories about the mobs hittin for 1k and never actually go and try it out for themselves, thinking it's a lot worse than it really is.  Just have a good group of people that aren't dumbasses, and see how you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah hard missions are HARD but they aren't impossible.  I think that any warrior that can get to 8K+ hps buffed and has most of the defensive aa's knocked out can do well in hard missions.  Check my magelo, I have won about 2/3 of the hard missions I have gone on when grouped with similar ssra / seru geared folks from my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not in VT here, EP flagged but no loot from there yet, and I do okay tanking hard adventures.  <br />
<br />
Today our cleric went LD and we *nearly* completed a hard assassinate just on shaman healing, bard regen and occasional ranger patch heals.  The loot is really nice, I wear 3 pieces (shoulders, backslot, and ring), looking to replace belt now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The normal mobs range from 988 to 992.  Named seems to be around 1000-1060 range, they don't hit their max often enough to tell.  If you get a healer named type it's actually easier than a normal melee mob, though if it's a cleric it could be a very long fight.<br />
<br />
Named are always level 65.  I do not see any reason why they'd attack more often than anything else unless they have better slow mitigation but you should be used to fighting stuff without slow anyway due to considerable resistances on Hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Named in Hard adventures are only 65? Do you mean loot named or the Assassinate target because in normal adventures the Assassinate target is always yellow to me at 65. I would think Hard would be red but I havn't tried one yet.<br />
<br />
So little time to do adventures with a full raiding schedule and I have been focusing on opening up the hp augs in Ruj. Now since that is done (/cheer 200hp helm and arms!) I can start trying the hard ones to see what all the fuss is about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Normal mobs are 63-65 I think (the odd one cons even), named are 65 as far as I've noticed, and assassinate targets are red to 65.<br />
<br />
All of the assassination targets I've fought were caster classes, and they all hit for about 1400x4.  If there are pure melee assassination targets that would hit x5 (or flurry x7) then I haven't run into them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">loot named are always 65.  Assassination named are red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the caster targets always spend more time casting on me then meleeing me. founght one and got hit maby 6 times rest of the fight it was casting. started letting the caster cast instead of mana draining and fights got much easer.</div></div><hr />
