I have a couple question.<br />
<br />

<br />
How hard his melee and rampage?I've heard not hard but often. right?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

As for his melee, 900max hit or there abouts. He rampages quite often actually...NOTHING like Arch Lich or High Priest, but more like Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quads 900s, 40% slowable, Rampages<br />
<br />
Kogur is right.  He ramps quite a bit, though not like Arch Lich, because you can't Cripple him.  He's totally MR immune.  His melee dps isn't spectacular, but it is enough to occassionally kill a 9100hp tank on a tight 3-4 second rotation.  How does that happen?  Because if the Rage of Ssraeshza strikes when you're tank is mid to low health, chances are he's dead.  <br />
<br />
Now, I have a complete parse of him, but I found an oddity.  Yalp will not pick Emp's damage up because there is an extra space at the end of his name.  The following is what 1) the parse text came out as and 2) what it should look like in order for the parser to pick up.<br />
<br />
1)  Emperor Ssraeshza  hits YOU for 951 points of damage.<br />
2)  Emperor Ssraeszha hits YOU for 951 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Yalp won't recognize Emp with the extra space at the end of his name (1).  I went in and manually took some of those spaces out and it picked it right up.<br />
<br />
Slightly bugged, maybe?  Cursed/Exiled/Creator/etc did *not* have this anomaly when I parsed them.</div></div><hr />

123hp and 14AC is not worth taking up 2 more buff slots over vitue especially against emperor who casts 2 debuffs on the MT.  <br />
<br />
Actually it is worth it, ESPECIALLY on the Emperor. He only casts 1 debuff. The other proc he possesses is a spin/stun that is in fact a BENIFICIAL buff...ie if your buff slots are filled up, it cannot land on you. So why not fill up those buff slots with actual useful spells rather than junk buffs?</div></div><hr />
