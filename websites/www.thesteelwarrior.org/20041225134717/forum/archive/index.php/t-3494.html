<br />
Large races say they are better because slam is better than kick (true). Small races claim superiority because they never need shrinks (also true). Ogres claim superiority due to frontal melee stun immunity. Iksars and trolls claim it due to regen (also Iksar have innate AC). Dwarves claim their somersaults are the shit, and so claim frogs with their backflips. Halflings claim their innate sexiness.<br />
<br />
But in the end, everyone knows the greatest warriors of all time are barbarians :p</div></div><hr />

Just pick what you want to pick, in the end there is always  ALWAYS  a piece of equipment to make up for what you loose. Except for slam, or non-stunnability.. but who cares about that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level 65 kitted out in raid obtained gear race makes very little difference.<br />
<br />
At 55 - 65 XPing in bazaar gear the extra HPs from playing a fatty can make a significant difference.<br />
<br />
From 1-10 the extra melee stats from playing a large race make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Troll and Iksar regen bonus are both nice if you plan on soloing a bit of the way with your warrior, Halfling sneak and hide can make doing some quests much easier, Gnome tinkering gives you access to tinkered armour with fun clickies on it, Large races get slam so you can interupt casters pre 55 (kick can stun after 55).<br />
<br />
Trolls, Iksar and Ogres have an XP penalty, asslings have a bonus.<br />
<br />
Faction issues are pretty irrelevant with PoP.<br />
<br />
Having played a half elf I used to really lament the extra hps I would have gained from stamina as an ogre as I XP'd through my high 50's and through the 60's, but now that my gear makes this irrelevant I wouldnt change to fat and ugly for anything.<br />
<br />
Don't play a dorf tho, they can't worship Rallos and they are ugly so chicks will never cyb0r you.</div></div><hr />

Be Rallos worshiper (like me :) ) and use the Fierce Heraldic cultural armor<br />
<br />
Use Clockwork Watchman (or Clockwork Observer) armor for cool right clicky effects (30% right click spell haste, +30 str, sow speed, invis, summon throwing item).  I use the heck out of my clicky spell haste and the other stuff is nice to have in the bag when I need it.<br />

<br />
Oh first the tinkered armor is real great. Having self haste is mostly better than having a bit more regen cause the mobs die faster, you can hold better aggro ... .<br />
<br />
Second: Youre a real unique one. Barbarians you find all the way. Ogre and troll not so many but enough cause of the stats discussion. Halflings spez. female ones are also rare but no tinkered armor. Rest has no better startstats than gnomes.<br />
<br />
So whats good to be unique? Hey ppl. will remember you better when youre good or bad. So you enter the zone and ppl. think &quot;Hey da cutie gnome tank is there&quot; and groupfinding is a bit easier then.<br />
<br />
I was born in 99 and had some hard way in the beginning ( no tinkered stuff around ) but after Level 30 until Level 65 no problems finding groups all over the world.<br />
<br />
Nothing is better than a female tank 6 foot smaller than the mob.<br />
<br />
Gnome on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does Race mean?<br />
<br />
Well it really depends when you started the game.<br />
<br />
Some Races have better stats, these can be mitigated by equipment.<br />
<br />
Some races have different dieties, these help to create some of the gear that has good stats. RZ and Tribunal are great for warriors, Vesheen not so good.. etc.<br />
<br />
Some races have added benefits, Ogres Stun/slam, Barbs Slam(blind as bats too), Trolls Slam/Regen, etc.<br />
<br />
Some races have faction, um concerns... In the days of PoK/Nexus, this is pretty much a non-issue.<br />
<br />
All of these concerns are valid when forming your warrior, Ultimately what you make is up to you. You must have fun with it.<br />
<br />
When I created my Barb there was no nexus/pok. there was no worthwhile diety armor. I created my barbarian, because he was a 'Good&quot; race with few faction issues. Also He had relatively good starting stats. He was very Blind for may of his starting levels. I would spend 30 minutes at a time sitting still in BB mountains because I could not see the way across the zone to Unrest to get my corpse back. <br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over again, I would still make a Barbarian Tribunal Warrior, but instead of Str/Sta I would spend my points in Wis/Agi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No difference.  Make a Frog warrior, I don't see them much P.<br />
<br />
Lol, that's a good point about when you started.  I started in May of 2000, and picked Human, and Warrior, because that dumb screen in the beginning which tells you how difficult your class would be said it was EASY.  Riiiggghhhtttt........</div></div><hr />

All the good points have been mentioned but once you are 63+ they won't make a difference. If you plan to lvl up quickly (you play every day) I wouldn't worry. If you don't then maybe you want to avoid certain races, Like iksars, they have alot of armor restrictions that can cause problems for a slower lvling person.<br />
<br />
In the end ornate and ele armor is 1 size fits all. AAs can give you regen (woot like it's needed on mobs quading for 2k+) Stun resistance (this is a big deal imo) etc.<br />
<br />
Small is good tho. You need to be small to corner mobs. So you can make a small race now or just get shrunk. Most of the time shrinking won't matter because everyone except mages and rangers get shrunk for raids anyways.</div></div><hr />

My friend has no problem usually and he plays a barbarian warrior.  This is an advantage for tall races in places where you are on uneven terrain and are pulling or tagging.  I can imagine it must suck for short races a lot.  It doesn't suck enough to change your choice of races but it is kind of annoying at times.  <br />
<br />
Also, when you are big, it seems like you run very slow.  Short races get the thrill of running really fast (same speed but seems faster).  When I am shrunk with a bard speed song, it seems like I am running at 300 mph.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not in the way you are meaning though, not in statwise, effectiveness in combat etc.<br />
But it matters a lot socially. As a gnome, I am remembered much better than a barbarian_male_warrior_000276352.<br />
<br />
So, if you are going to be a good warrior and nice person, make a gnome (or other unusual gender/race/class combo) and people remember your great deeds forever. I get tells from people who remember me tanking something for them years ago.<br />
<br />
If you are a lousy warrior or nasty person, make a barbarian or ogre so that people forget your bad reputation fast :p<br />
<br />
-Marshall Sterix Chasoheart<br />
-Gnome Overlord<br />
<br />
P.S. I admit I went long hard way at lower levels. Stamina and strength was a big problem. However, I think twinkage and items available in bazaar nowadays is much better.<br />
Slam was never an issue to me, I used Gnome-invented Ghetto-bashing where I switched shield on to bash and switched secondary weapon back without missing a beat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
STA you say?? Well, would have been nice but I got rather attached to myself because when I finally got around to reading up on what the stats actually did for me I was lvl 25ish. :) I also liked the RP nature of what I had picked as well which of course does diddly squat for actual gameplay and is just for my enjoyment! :) <br />
<br />
Point of all this is play what you like. Make sure you know a bit about how the deity worshiped (or not worshiped) is going to affect you down the line for gear and KoS status. And put those start up points in STA till max. Then STR or DEX. I find STR is easy to max so if it was me I would do STA then DEX. /shrug</div></div><hr />

I am the most beautiful character in my guild.  I have my own harem of boys, that keep the Warrior Fridge stocked with all sorts of tasty treats.  They bring me Hot-n-Spicy Toelings to munch during downtime on raids.<br />
<br />
As a female ogre warrior, I have:<br />
1.  Uniqueness.  There aren't a lot of us, so we tend to be remembered.<br />
<br />
2.  An ample excuse for role-playing.  I like that.  It is a big part of what makes EQ fun for me.<br />
<br />
3.  One of the all-time great hair-dos.  You have to love the little top-knot with the bone ponytail holder.<br />
<br />
4.  A lot of fun playing with my cobalt bracer. <br />
<br />
When I first created Gruda, in March 2000, my friend who was introducing the game to me, strongly advised against creating an ogre.  I stuck with it, because I wanted a character who looked like a badass.  I didn't really understand the whole faction issue, and the ogre xp penalty.  I briefly experimented with a barbarian warrioress, but Gruda was already level 17, and had so much time invested in her, that I couldn't see starting over again.  <br />
<br />
I wish there were still big faction issues to work around for all the races.  It should be harder than a quick click on a PoK book for me to find a banker and a merchant that will deal with me.  It is too easy to be an ogre these days, and with that, I am losing some of my unique flair.</div></div><hr />

So for most mobs, player distance to mob center is less for large race warriors than it is for shorties at identical distance from the mob.  Result: very slight but noticeably better ability to hold aggro due to proximity.<br />

Having said that, yellow eye'd troll warriors &gt;&gt;&gt; all. ;)<br />

True, they're a big race without the benefit of Slam.  True, they can't use any of the cultural armors.<br />

But chicks dig the tail.    :D</div></div><hr />

Race means nothing now. Pick a race that you enjoy playing.  <br />
<br />
imo, completely the opposite, in the highest end game, time atm, race is really the only thing that matters, all you nessasary stats should be max with buffs if not w/o, an oger will never be stuned from the front, iksar have higher ac and regen, troll have regen, short classes dont need shrink, some races (DE) see better then others, halflings sneak/hide...<br />
<br />
on the other hand, leveling up prolly makes a big defferance what race, regen is very nice at lower levels (iksar, troll), iksar cant wear as much stuff as others, deiety matters here but not once you get to like vt/elem/time, and possably even quests.<br />
<br />
to sum up, only class specific alibities matter in the end, but getting to the end some are better then others</div></div><hr />
