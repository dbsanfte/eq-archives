<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On SoE's class boards, Brenlo stated:<br />
Look the Gates content is just too hard. Even warriors need to healers on them to make it work.  That is not the way it was intended.  Let's sit back, take a deep breath and see what this does.  If it does what we hope, it will remove the imbalance present for tanks in Gates AND allow for more variety in groups.  No longer will the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; be necessary to perform well in those zones!<br />
Brenlo,<br />
I believe nearly every Warrior agrees with almost every word in your post. There are two exceptions IMO.<br />
<br />
1. The &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; remark was inaccurate and inapropriate.<br />
<br />
2. Group staffing flexability should not result in versatility trumping focused superiority uniformly and without exception in GoD.<br />
<br />
The so-called, by Knights and their apologists, &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; does not and did not exist in GoD trials. Crowd control/slowing, for example, was handled by Bards, Enchanters, Beastlords, and Shaman. In the sewer trials, Warriors and Knights could tank. In Vxed and Tipt, Warriors and Knights could tank while groups made good use of Pookas and Rangers with Weapon Shield.<br />
<br />
It is I think one thing to conceed that some Gates content was too hard, not the way it was intended, and that it will be adjusted.<br />
<br />
It is an entirely different matter to use the phrase &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;, the destruction of which was used as justification for expansion after expansion of major upgrades and class blurring that culminated in Knight preference in normal experiance groups and Knights being fully capable of MTing all of the content in the game at the end of PoP.<br />
<br />
Secondly, class bluring is the most single destructive direction taken in the game over the last several expansions. Yes, forced 6 person content must be doable by all. Yes, all classes need near equal acceptance in normal experiance groups. But class identity must be maintained in the game and class differences should mean something.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the developers are well aware that trials do not consist of only the boss mob fight. Make that fight equally doable by Knights and Warriors and it's very easy to arrive at Knight preference if their spellbooks make the 2+ hour fight to that boss mob quicker and easier.<br />
<br />
Some classes, particularly Warriors and Clerics, chose to be the best in a narrow focus area of the game. Knights can not tank as well as Warriors in ALL groups, else their spellbooks provide extra value that assures them group preference. Shaman and Druids can not heal as effectively as Clerics in all group content, else their versatility makes them prefered.<br />
<br />
In my view, even group content needs to be scaled in difficulty. With some portion providing groups with strong motivation to get a Warrior to tank and a Cleric to heal. As new content becomes revealed by player progress, the previous few Warrior and Cleric prefered mobs become more doable by others, and some few new Warrior and Cleric prefered mobs become revealed.<br />
<br />
Thus it has been for as long as I can remember 8). <br />
<br />
Phrases like &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; might be soothing to some Knights who want to see Warrior survival advantages relavent only for 3 Warriors in a guild, only on raid day, and only when applied to 2 named raid mobs. However if such a condition is arrived at by &quot;sharing&quot; defining Wariror abilities or by making them not applicable anywhere in the non-raid evironment it would be at the expence of Warriors.<br />
<br />
Please understand that I'm not &quot;attacking&quot; you for using the phrase &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;. I am pointing out that it doesn't apply AND efforts to insure focused classes like Warriors and Clerics have no useful advantages in their area of focus has in the past resulted in Cleric &quot;bots&quot; and /lfg Warriors.<br />

Just like &quot;Warrior + 2 healers&quot; or &quot;95% Death Rate with Knight Tanking&quot;<br />
<br />
One small question BB, are you paranoid that knights put you out of business ?<br />
I myself would LOVE to have my workload reduced.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; it SUCKS. And if that means class blurring then let it be.<br />
<br />
Making specialists while is indeed nice on paper is totally LAME in reality.<br />
<br />
I remember when i was in sebilis and is was OUT OF THE QUESTION of going<br />
deeper than DHall/Necro without :  Cleric/Enchanter/Snarer/Evac.<br />
And you had 20 people LFG at the entrance waiting for a chanter/evac to pop.<br />
<br />
Everyone should be able to do almost everything.<br />
With some people beeing a better than others.<br />
(Slow / Heal / CC / Ghetto CC / Tank etc etc )<br />
<br />
I am sorry, i am sick and tired of beeing harassed for Inkkiz Trials &amp; KT Mini.<br />
I love hard content, because makes me feel usefull &amp; thrills me.<br />
But the &quot;No CLASS01 No Group&quot; is just as lame as sebilis was back then.<br />
<br />
Secondly, class bluring is the most single destructive direction taken in the game over the last several expansions.<br />
<br />
FUCK THAT !<br />
I dont want to be a trial slave !<br />
I didnt want to wait LFG at sebilis zone in for 2h until a CC slows up !<br />
I dont want to be forced to &quot;Sorry no CC / Puller cant do&quot; <br />
<br />
Of course you can always tell me that making pacify work , will kill mnk/sk as pullers.<br />
I'll reply i dont want to have to wait for a fucking mnk/sk to show up to do stuff.<br />
<br />
Ever tried to pull some KT mini in a Raid Entrace Room packed with 5 6 mobs ?<br />
Its doable with luck. 1 Resist and you loose the cleric. (You can cheat having a mage/wiz).<br />
<br />
I Absolutely REFUSE to see  &quot;mnk/sk/bard needed&quot;  1  group content.<br />
And for the same reason, there should be no &quot;War needed&quot; 1 group content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin,<br />
Clerics were just as required as Warirors. Are they not going to be required now? I seriously doubt we are going to see Druids as Main Healers in meaningful trials. No sir, although Knights do have a group role when not MTing, they will be tanking the boss mobs as effectively as Warriors and may have the added extra bonus of spellcasting all the way to that boss mob.<br />
<br />
SoE has said that it will adjust content. It's already been made clear that content can affect roles. Want to deny that?<br />
<br />
Holy Trinity does refer to Cleric, Warrior, and Enchanter. As my initial post indicates, this was not and is not the case in GoD.<br />
<br />
Emilia,<br />
I don't think my &quot;workload&quot; can be reduced. A poll over on Fires of Heaven's board indicates most guilds are in the doldrums now. DX9 miscues, what SoE has admitted to be too difficult content, being confronted with yet another flagging process after completing the one that lead up to PoTime, etc. have all contributed.<br />
<br />
Sure for a month I was kept busy getting people flagged to attend Ikkinz raids. But that month was over two months ago.<br />
<br />
Reduce my workload? This week featured making the top Karana bow, creating a Halfling Ranger twink to use it and getting him to level 24 (so far) solo, a little raiding (yay Bloodlink Chestmail #7 or 8!!!), and checking out FFXI and the WoW beta. Oh I turned on /lfg a few times - I got invitations to BoT, Valor, and LDoN easy.<br />
<br />
Ya, give Knights Defensive or change the content so Knights are prefered in all content outside of raids. Reduce my &quot;workload&quot; just like it was reduced in LDoN - to zero.<br />
<br />
Making three tanks when you only need one looks good on paper, but sucks in reality - especially if in experiance groups one is a simple fighter and two are equal fighters/spellcasters. Thank goodness they don't share our role everywhere - so far.<br />
<br />
BTW, I never did wait on a class to group in Sebilis. True you might want a particular class to do specific content. But you could always choose to do something else.<br />
--------------<br />
Maybe fixing the content will be a positive benefit for Warriors.<br />
<br />
*** It won't however if grouping in GoD doesn't increase very very dramaticly. ***<br />
<br />
Otherwise we will just (at best) be dividing the limited opprotunities to group in GoD among three tank classes - two with spellbooks and confining the Warrior tanking advantages to raid day only, raid bosses only, and guild MT's only.<br />

<br />
There's a reason that Kod/Ikk groups are fairly rare, and that's because of the stringent grouping requirements.   It's such a painful process to get a group together that people simply don't want to go through the effort.<br />
<br />
Stacking the environment in such a way that it forces such a limited selection with limited opportunities just to overcome your social weaknesses and inability to find a group isn't right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should not be able to do just anything with any group. There should be challenging content for 1 group. But it should not be a necessity to do it, ie it should not give flag.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there was only ONE challenging event (ok 3 but they are all the same, really) and that required heavy tank &amp; mass heals.<br />
There should be LDoN style adv of the difficulty of ikkinz trial, but with different kind of trials, some that would require lots of CC, and no boss (stuff like waves of 5 / 6 1k hitters that you can root / snare mez), stuff that would require pulling skill (splitting rooms of 2k hitting trash), stuff that would require very heavy dps and so on, you could probably end up with 5+ different 'holy trinity'.<br />
<br />
Problem is that if you design content that can be done by just every kind of group, it's going to be boringly easy for most group. You need to design different content so that every class would be part of a 'holy trinity' in one of these content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin,<br />
In order to &quot;find&quot; or create GoD groups there must be a willingness to do the content. At the level of doing Ikkinz raids and having farmed PoTime, there is not much of a compelling reason. Some guilds have temporarily taken various GoD zones off from their raid list. Players have left GoD raiding guilds to go to just entering PoTime guilds. Players, and not just Knights, have left the game entirely. Despite the lowering of raid members from 72 to 54, many GoD raiding guilds are suddenly looking for new members after months of no new applicants sought while they were raiding PoTime.<br />
<br />
Players capable of doing Ikkinz raids are flagged for them. Most of these players have their spells. The trial drops are not upgrades for most PoTimed farmed players. The need to complete Ikkinz trials is not pressing. The known (at least by me) tradeskill items are lame.<br />
<br />
Knights lacking the social skills to have a Warrior help them get a flag by MTing brutal red named boss mobs just as Warriors MT'd such mobs for 90% of the equipment they wear is not a justication to marginalize Warriors in all content outside of raids either. The vast majority of the PoN complainers couldn't MT jack at the PoTime level much less beyond it. That sir is the reason the content is being changed - to appease sub-7300HP unbuffed  Knight &quot;MT's&quot; (and I am using the term &quot;MT's&quot; loosely).<br />
<br />
Perhaps as SoE has claimed, the fact that the content is too hard (and the rewards are not impressive IMO), might be having an effect on group opprotunities. <br />
<br />
Unless content changes result in many more players wanting to group in GoD, adding to the numbers of players able to Main Tank or be Main Healer will just divide up a limited number of opprotunities.<br />

Because while Shamans and Druids can be back up healers and actualy contribute to a group and do other things Knights can't be a back up Tank and contribute alot to a group.  It is much easier to get a DPS class to fill the open slot of some of the above slots.</div></div><hr />

The cleric situation is just as wrong. Oddly, though, we're more worried about making sure we have a place than fighting the druid cause. 4 Mandatory roles and 2 members of the bland DPS pissing contest is just as wrong today as it was in Sebilis.</div></div><hr />

Who are you kidding? True, I didn't do hard mobs like camping a Fungi or camping Juggs for spells without a Cleric and a Warrior present, but there IS supposed to be some small amount of content that motivates players to group tightly focused specialists and not always group those classes with versatility.<br />

I'm a little baffled here, perhaps you could clarify something for me Frodlin.  I've gotten the impression you like the current &quot;difficulty&quot; level of GoD and would much prefer that it not be changed one iota.  In fact, you've protested against the concept of &quot;gimping down&quot; the mobs and would much prefer that Knights receive a weak form of defensive.  If we assume for the sake of discussion that they took your route and left everything as is but gave Knights the diluted defensive you've advocated, how would this not make Warriors still a much preferred member of any trial group and not reinforce the &quot;holy trinity&quot;?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not really speaking out in agreement with BB.  But I'm curious how on the one hand content is supposed to be extremely challenging to the point that it requires special abilies be given to hybrids to just cope while not at the same time making the specialists extremely attractive, perhaps even overly attractive, for a group.  It seems kind of contradictory to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its not.  Clerics are perfectly balanced, as are Shamans and Druids.<br />
<br />
Theres a reason people play Warriors and Clerics, and its not to be just one more slightly different flavor of healer or tank.  Its to be the BEST.  Noticably, unarguably, the best.</div></div><hr />

I'm just waiting to see how the changes pan out.  I suppose there's a bunch of stuff that could be done to make it equally challenging for a variety of group setups without the loss of a challenge, and that's what I'm hoping for, as long as there's not an auto &quot;Warrior + 2 Healer requirement&quot; then it'll encourage more people to go without the stars being aligned in a certain fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvak</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When it comes to a Multiplayer game like everquest, class balance is not black and white, its grey.  Clerics are the best at healing, Warriors are the best at taking damage.  The more you mix these things up among the classes the more out of balance the game becomes when you have an environment like everquest.  <br />
<br />
Why you ask?<br />
<br />
When a druid can heal like a cleric, yet solo like a druid, clerics might as well be druids.  Therefore a cleric should be able to kite like a druid, right?  They are two different classes with different strengths/weaknesses - a druid might not get a group as easily as a cleric and might not be able to pass the trials as quickly, yet they can solo much greater then a cleric could - almost like they have a strength of their own.<br />
<br />
Many factors throw weight on why many classes are balanced the way they are.  If you think druids/shm should have heals that are closer to that of a cleric, that is your own opinion, but i would have to disagree - and it seems sony would too.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadow Knights have strengths that Warriors do not.  You may think the strengths of knights are not strong enough to outweigh the benefits of being a Warrior, and if this is your opinion i suggest playing a warrior.</div></div><hr />

That's fine.  It just seemed to me that your orginal purposed solution would have done more to reinforce what you are saying is undiserable.  I agree, setting things up so that a Warrior is the hands downed preferred tank in GoD isn't a very good idea.  So I think we're in agreement in concept.</div></div><hr />

if it were that black and white, things would be alot easier to figure out.<br />
<br />
you have 2 types of gaming going on here, hardcore raiding, and casual gaming.<br />
<br />
while the druid may be able to solo to his hearts content, he cannot solo in a raid environment, so that aspect of his abilities is moot. while i agree, it's part of the character class as a whole, but that part of the class means absolutly nothing in a raid environment.<br />
<br />
balance hits the fan when you try to balance raid abilities of one class vs the grouping abilities of another class. it's like balancing defensive vs a paladin group heal. group heals really don't do much in a raid, but it rocks in a group. defensive doesn't do much in a single group, but it rocks in a raid.<br />
<br />
if i had the answer to this, well this whole section of TSW wouldn't be here.<br />
<br />
and i dunno about the rest of the knights out there, but i am honestly tired of debating it. it's like a blind man arguing with a deaf man. no communication is getting through either way, whats going to happen is going to happen, like it or hate it. sure it'll suck for an expansion or 2, but the balance pendulum swings, if it happens to swing your way, enjoy it while it lasts, if it's not your turn, tough it out, it'll change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid/shaman secondary roles, both have respectful debuffs, medicore or good DPS, and medicoer of good healing.<br />
<br />
Tanks on the other hand, 2ndary roles are a lot weaker, and often covered by other people in the groups anyways, i'm not saying pal/sk and to a lesserdegree warriors arn't *useless* if they arnt doing their primary function (Tank) but rather its a lot less useful or signicent. <br />
<br />
The Average Guild has somewhere between 4-10 warriors on its roster, and 10-18  clerics, in varying states of playtime, clerics are just a lot more common, in a raiding guild enviroment, then warriors<br />
<br />
In their current form they more or less require two healers, so even if a cleric is required for one spot, you still need another one, which a druid, and to a lesser degree a shaman can fill its spot. (or for 2/3 Shaman can function as slower/CC, in addition to two other preists)</div></div><hr />

Firstly, cleric and druid healing really should be closer than it is currently. Secondly, healing stacks (up to a point) whereas tanking doesn't.<br />

<br />
<br />
I would imagine that warriors would indeed still be much preferred. That's beside the point. It now becomes doable (if just barely) with a knight tank. That alleviates some of the group design headaches that Frodlin is talking about. Yes a warrior would be better, but your guild's groups no longer have to sit around waiting on a few warriors, they now have 3 times as many tanks to choose from (well, theoretically).</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have 2 types of gaming going on here, hardcore raiding, and casual gaming.<br />
<br />
while the druid may be able to solo to his hearts content, he cannot solo in a raid environment, so that aspect of his abilities is moot. while i agree, it's part of the character class as a whole, but that part of the class means absolutly nothing in a raid environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at a characters group vs raid vs solo strengths IS grey in the first place.  Being black and white is comparing two classes on the same characteristic, say a druid and a cleric at a raid.<br />
<br />
Do you remember when everquest was even MORE class specific?  Before luclin, knowledge, when a large aspect of wiz/druid was to be able to teleport, and this meant alot more then it does?  When enchanters being the masters of jewel craft was a bigger role then today because some of the better items available were JC'd.  Everquest has taken many turns since the original, and alot of these class strengths have been long forgotten.  Personally, i think that was the best thing the game originally had going for it - the unique strengths of the classes - and the more the classes blend together the less desireable the game becomes.</div></div><hr />

The Paladin niche was undead. The zone with undead mobs and loot (at the time) worth having was LGuk.<br />
<br />
The Paladin's semi-retirement was permanent when Kunark came out. Defensive = Primary Tank. No reasonable amount of gear ever would or should change that. At level 50 there were perhaps three Paladins that I ever heard of MTing in raids as if they were a Warrior on my entire server. They most assuredly did not MT (afaik) any of the initial raid boss mob killings post Kunark. (Mills on E'Ci might be the only exception that I could have known about, I didn't keep up with what happened to the 25 uberest Knights in the game.)<br />
<br />
It never occured to me that Paladins were *cough* supposed to be as good a tank as a Warrior in ALL non-raid content, be capable of MTing the hardest raid content in the game, have a 90% res, higher total HP buffing than a Cleric, and KEI, FT, and focus items. If you had suggested this would ever be the case prior to Kunark, I would have laughed at you. Matter of fact, it's STILL pretty funny.<br />
<br />
My Paladin (now level 53 - it's hard to avoid exp when you're a Paladin, even playing rarely) is camping Voracious Brutes for high quality hides. Even when play style changed and players were no longer willing to wait for Warriors to establish aggro in groups in 85% of PoP and in LDoN, it didn't occur to me to level him to 65, get him flagged, and potentially switch classes. After all, I already played the most effective Tank in the game - a Warrior. A Paladin tank as good as a Warrior in ALL non-raid content, have a 90% res, higher total HP buffing than a Cleric, and KEI, FT, and focus items? Giggle.<br />

Anyways I was mostly pointing out the fact, that saying Original EQ was much better because class lines wernt as blurred, in regards to making a case against Knights getting defensive, is just well, sorta funny, given the fact that the tank class's were much closer then, then they are now, espcially if your talking pre planes, or pre individual class armors from planes w/ LR armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't matter, but what I was trying to point out was class divergence is gud.<br />
<br />
Prior to level 10, almost all classes primarily melee to get exp. Then they diverge until at level 20 there's a big difference between casters and melee. A reasonable agrument can be made that Warriors customarily MT'd prior to Kunark and level 50 because they don't have useful spells that might get interrupted when they get hit.<br />
<br />
However after Kunark and now after level 50, classes diverge quite a bit especially as they start to raid. You are right, the differences I pointed out all occur after Kunark and after level 50.<br />
<br />
Differences are of minimal importance and should be in experiance groups, yet distinguish classes and give them diverging roles in raids. This is a very fine line to walk when dealing with classes and content. Verrant/SoE has blown it at least 3 times.<br />
<br />
In Kunark the tanking and DPS &quot;cost&quot; of having spell books was not sufficiently offset by the benefits of having a spellbook for Knights. The raid add tank role had not really developed.<br />
<br />
Post Kunark, needed spellcasting improvements and a narrowing of the Warrior/Knight survival gap left Warriors on the wrong side of aggro generation when groups were no longer willing to wait for Warriors to establish aggro and the survivability advantages of Warriors turned out to be immaterial in most groups and not to be very great in raids. Knights had a well established add tank role in raids and there were even some raid boss mobs that should be Paladin preferred.<br />
<br />
In GoD, high DI boss mobs in 6 person content plus increasingly useless spellbooks marginalized Knights.<br />
<br />
IMO, in each case the needed repairs were pretty obvious. Understand the roles classes perform in groups and in raids. Design content that allows them to perform those roles and provide them with the tools necessary to excell in those roles when facing properly designed and tuned content.<br />
<br />
Yes, if we were all CleriDruShaWizMonkEncRogaWarriPaliNecros it might simpify things. But that's not how the game was, is, or should be.<br />

Translation - I leveled to 65 without significant self buffs, heals, or a rez. I did this in order to be a Primary Tank. Having enjoyed the convenience of having a spellbook, don't be shocked if there are some one group mobs and MTing duties you can't handle. Clerics don't melee as good as Paladins cast priest spells. Warriors don't heal, buff and res as good as Paladins melee.<br />
<br />
Eating from 2 dishes doesn't entitle you to twice as much.<br />
<br />
I've rolled a Druid, Necro, Enchanter, Paladin, Ranger, Bard and Warrior. I settled on a class that suits me. The &quot;wrong&quot; class is one that you are disatisfied with when it's properly balanced and the content isn't out of whack.<br />
<br />
I chose to be the best Tank/Tank and not a Tank/Priest at the start of Kunark. Even when Paladins were at the top of the heap I didn't concider changing back.<br />
----------<br />
Madrone,<br />
One of the most difficult things about discusions like this is where do you draw the line.<br />
<br />
The Gyphed Prayer Ring is comparable to a Ring of Force and the Resonating Earring of Battle is fairly close to a Pulsing Emerald Hoop. The former items are obtainable in 6 player content and the latter in PoTime Phase 1 by 18 players.<br />
<br />
I believe the Ikkinz trials should be for PoTime or equivalent equipped players because some loot is very near PoTime quality. Others believe they should be for EP equipped or even bazaar/LDoN.<br />
<br />
I believe some few one groupable mobs should when first encountered virtually require a Warrior and a Cleric. Others believe a Knight and Druid should be fine, but not Rangers - after all what we call tanking only appears in Warrior, Paladin, and Shadow Knight Class Descriptions (a fib, it only appears in the Warrior Class Description).<br />
<br />
And there's the problem. Players see where the line should be drawn differently. They surely want themselves included, but not those unworthy others.<br />
--------<br />
I hope SoE will in fact be fair. But I'll bet some will be disapointed wherever SoE draws the line and however SoE chooses to draw it.<br />

<br />
*shrug* i don't know, when a mistake is made and the warrior dies on your way through a trial or anywhere else for that matter, it sure is nice to have a chance of surviving by another tank stepping up.  So I don't mind having a backup tank in the group and a knight can certainly do it.  <br />

Yet, they obviously didn't design or test them with every class in their mind. <br />
<br />
Currently, knights, shaman (and berserkers but who gives a shit about them?) have no business being in the trials, because the trials are not designed to accomodate them. They are simply liabilities to any trial group, but they are still required to complete all 3 trials in order to progress. If they can't tune the trials (I don't think they ever can, and that's why I think 1 group trials are bad idea for pregression), they simply shouldn't have made them preogression requirement for everyone. <br />
<br />
They designed the content by completely ignoring a big part of EQ population. They obviously didn't test the content using these people. Therefore these people have every right to complain about it.<br />

<br />
You know Graal, you harp on this a lot.  So let's put it into perspective, shall we?  Within about three months of PoP being released, Warriors began to gripe about there being a problem.  SoE ignored it.  After about six months, Warriors really began to bitch it up, because they were having very hard times.  SoE continued to ignore it.  After a year, Warriors were in a full blown rabid dog diatribe over the problem.  SoE came out and said that &quot;classes weren't that out of balance&quot;.  After a year and a half, finally SoE came out and agreed that something needed to be done and implimented some changes.<br />
<br />
Now, in this case, within 3 months of GoD being released, Knights are into a full blown rabid dog diatribe about the problem, many of whom don't even play in GoD or shouldn't even expect to be doing the trials, and SoE says yes indeed there is a problem.  And they also say they're going to fix it and that it's unreasonable that Knights appropriately geared can't tank the trial bosses and some named mobs.<br />
<br />
You know, it seems to me that Knights have had their concerns, in this case anyway, addressed in a far more timely fashion than Warriors.  And yet they're still not satisfied.  Why is that exactly?  Because I remember a metric buttload of Knights saying that the Warrior solution to the problem in PoP was having someone root the mobs and that therefore the fact that Warriors weren't getting groups wasn't a problem.  Do you really expect that after all that that all Warriors are going to be more even handed and understanding then Knights showed themselves to be?  In the majority, I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

Paladins are working as intended. GoD content is a bit (not much) too difficult. Most of the PoN posters need Knight Defensive because they are gimps when measured against high level Paladins. Check Magelo's. I've seen numerous sub-7k HP Knights post that they need Defensive - what they actually need is to gear up. I actually saw a sub-4000HP unbuffed level 65 Paladin post on EQLive that Knights need Defensive.<br />
<br />
I'm sympathetic to 10K HP buffed Knights that can't handle the Ikkinz trials- they need content adjusted so they can. But sub 9200HP Knights - they better stick to BoT.<br />

I believe that SoE understands Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that should not be shared. Warriors for example don't get multiple 1k HP heals or an 8K HP heal every 15 minutes - that's another Tank class's defining characteristic.<br />
<br />
If SoE gives Knights a 10-15 sec autoparry ability and adjusts content, that's pretty reasonable. As long as they realize Paladins have DA and SK's got FD as &quot;escape&quot; abilities allowing Knights to shed aggro in ways Warriors can not. Or are such things the extra bonuses Knights always get like 2 years of Knightemization and 20 mana ranged aggro every 6 seconds using spells that can't possible stick?<br />

<br />
Ok. So, let's say he meant something like weaponshield. So they get 30 seconds of glory once an hour. Is that going to fix them? No? So then they give them something longer. <br />
<br />
What is it going to have to be in order for it to actually work? Seriously. <br />
<br />
Anything short of a 3 min disc, is going to be pointless...and they're just going to continue to bitch because it doesn't work. You need 3 min at least in order to do the mobs they're complaining about.<br />
<br />
If it's much less than the same mitigation as defensive, then 3 min or not, it will be worthless...and they'll bitch because it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Now you could change it from mitigation to avoidance. Then they'll have a 3 min disc where they take no damage for a percentage of that 3 min, instead of reduced damage. <br />
<br />
You could also make it an autoparry. Then they'll take no damage at all for 3 min.<br />
<br />
You could make it autoriposte...then they take no damage and do insane dps too.<br />
<br />
So which one of these options sounds like you will still need warriors for anything any more?<br />

You need 3 min at least in order to do the mobs they're complaining about.<br />
<br />
One of the big complaints by Knights is that because of autoparry and autoriposte disciplines you're often better off filling a spot in a group with a Beastlord, Monk, Rogue, or Ranger rather than a Knight if you use a Warrior as the tank.  This is because they can use their discipline at the beginning of the fight, have the Warrior AE taunt the mob off them once the discipline wears off and then have the Warrior pop furious followed by defensive.  Giving Knights a autoparry or autoriposte discipline with a timer similar to those already out there will do away with this preference.  Picking up a Knight in a slot other than tank won't be quite so completely unattractive anymore.<br />
<br />
But then they're also supposed to be adjusting the mobs so that the Knight could indeed tank them if push came to shove anyway.  Which means that even if they don't get an autoparry or autoriposte discipline, they still shouldn't be in horribly bad shape.</div></div><hr />

His exact wording on the correction was:<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not mean that they will get Defensive, but a defense oriented dics as they currently have none and every other class that can melee does. So let's not get confused over my wording here.

I agree, a 3 min dis is needed.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
If it's much less than the same mitigation as defensive, then 3 min or not, it will be worthless...and they'll bitch because it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I disagree with this, a dis that gives 20-25% damage mitigation (40-50% of a warriors dis mitigation) would allow for a great chance to live and paladin heals will increase the survival rate a bit so it not lagging so much behind the warrior success rate. <br />
-----------------------------------<br />
Now you could change it from mitigation to avoidance. Then they'll have a 3 min disc where they take no damage for a percentage of that 3 min, instead of reduced damage. <br />
<br />
They would be in the same place they are now and warriors were before incite, having the weakest link in a fight being the RNG sucks.<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
The dis needs to have a built in check(s) to preserve game balance, 20% mitigation with the paladin getting half of the agro they would normally get would keep the game balance totally with no or little need for extra penalties.<br />
<br />
The way warriors would stack up:<br />
<br />
Warrior advantage:<br />
-	Starts fight of named with 12 seconds of reposting all attacks giving incredible agro rendering ANY and ALL knight starting agro advantages obsolete.<br />
-	30% MORE mitigation! This alone would make warriors the preferred tanks.<br />
-	Significant agro advantage over time from many agro procs, incite and dual weapons.<br />
-	Far better grab agro ability, AoE taunt vs. stuns that may requiring casting and recasting. NO contest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knight advantage:<br />
-	rez / snare and other party favors, nice and MAY be a great help but likely there is someone better equipped to handle those jobs.<br />
-	Better pre-mob engagement agro to permit healing right away (little use where warriors have furious to prevent it causing damage/agro in the process).<br />
-	Healing / tapping that is useful only as a patch heal if at all.<br />
<br />
Current equality:<br />
-	Burst damage with a 2h weapon furious gives warriors damage that is comparable to an SKs HT (though likely behind).<br />
-	Tanking trash up to the named, granted knights have a slight starting agro advantage but incite and current warrior agro weapons make any differences minor.<br />
-	Warriors take 5% less damage from the trash mobs paladins stun mitigate more than that over the course of an expedition thought likely less on stun immune mobs and SKs provide taps that will heal minor damage and return mana in effect mitigating some of the mana used.</div></div><hr />

The frist is that an underequipped compared to the content Warrior DOES and has for years MT'd mobs waaaay beyond what should be expected. In some cases, if you think back, a MT list would be gone though one Warrior right after then next. Just about the time Defensive dropped, they died. So YES, a Warrior somewhat less well equipped than a Paladin should MT better - for three minutes. It should be no contest - it's our role. It's the unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles in action.<br />
<br />
The second misconception is the three minute discipline, what Knights give up, and what they get. A previous poster conspicuously left out buffing, Rooting, and LoH. The list of things Paladins get INSTEAD of tanking is actually quite long and pretty powerful. Powerful enough that many Paladins opposed Clerics doing DPS via melee and oppose Clerics getting any of the melee-like survivability AA abilities.<br />
<br />
Knights are hybrids. Only part tanks. A three minute discipline that augments your ability to tank is a pure class focused Tank specialized class defining ability that should not be shared. Knights didn't sign up for the unmatched ability to survive. They didn't get Defensive, they got DA and FD. They insted got the ability to totally shed aggro - just like the partial casters they are.<br />
<br />
Yes, SoE should adjust they content. The trial boss mobs should be at worst no tougher than Elemental Plane one groupable mini-named. The adds should be at worst no tougher than Sayrn or RZ's adds. That's what Knights add tank.<br />
<br />
Give them a defensive-like ability because they are missing one? Ummmm, they get DA and FD. Get them something like WS? Sure, like another Warrior based primarily melee class, that's appropriate.<br />
<br />
After the content changes, if an EP group containing 2 warriors uses Furious, Defensive, AE Taunt, Furious, Defensive to provide 6 minutes of tanking superior to a group containing a PoTime Paladin, Knights STILL don't have a legitimate complaint. That's pure 100% Tanks in action doing what they can and should be able to do - out tank Knights.<br />
<br />
BTW grats on the faster sit-down regen Warriors. Downtime is now a thing of the past. It's just like having heals/liftaps, KEI, FT, and focus items.<br />

Warriors have to maintain a siginifant advantage in tanking, any ability needs to walk a line between balance,  that one would.<br />

<br />
Your using semantics now, a warrior having 25% MORE mitigation on a mob that hits over 12k per attack round has an UNMATCHED ABILITY TO SURVIVE. How could you think that a paladin taking 9kdamage is anywheres near a warrior taking 6k? Your not making sense BB.<br />

No I did not leave it out it is clearly included under - rez / snare and other party favors, nice and MAY be a great help but likely there is someone better equipped to handle those jobs. Some of those abilities can be powerful note the can though, if you dont got what it takes to tank the mob then you got nothing hence all the other things become party favors, and sure they can heal some to mitigate more damage but with my proposal they would need to fight for agro so they would not be able to stand there chain healing or they would drop agro on the real healers.<br />

An ability that arguments your ability to tank should go to ummmmmmm maybe TANKS. Call me silly but are pallys the only ones that can stun? NO! Are SKs the only ones that can tap? NO! Warriors should not be the only ones with a dis that lets them tank. I dont want to give knights unmatched ability to survive nor did I EVER say that. I only wanted to give them a small part of an ability that will put them mid way between us and the leather and silk wearers.</div></div><hr />

You are apparently operating under the assumption that knights in these scenarios have an aggro advantage over warriors. I can assure you that knights do not at this level of the game. Knights already have problems holding aggro during these fights. I haven't heard of the same problem afflicting warriors at all. In fact, I've heard multiple warriors mention that they had enough aggro to turn off attack before the mob was at 50% health, thereby reducing possible riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Defensive reduces melee damage but does not reduce melee aggro.</div></div><hr />

If my aggro suffers even a little bit while disced I'd know because all the other warriors will die (or I will die before it's my turn from overaggroing).<br />
<br />
Tank Primal Insect and get Aura of Fatigue and watch your attack goes to 0 (well, ~600 is the lowest it can go because that's str + offense I think) and hit for min every hit, and it has absolutely no appreciable effect on tanking whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

  Just a quick reply to this... Knights can use almost every aggro weapon warriors can. Most don't, because they've never needed to. Knights can ALSO get WA5 and aggro augments (ykesha, the equivalant of anger 2). Again, most knights surely don't bother. The fact is that knights should maintain a huge aggro gap over warriors, because they can use 90% of the tools warriors have gotten. If knights are having trouble holding aggro, then they need to do what warriors have had to do for a long, long time: develop other tools for aggro.</div></div><hr />

At the level of the game you're at, that's more or less correct.  This thread, however, is about the end-game(currently Kod`Taz+).  Things change during and post-time.... warrior aggro has the potential for drastic increases, while knight aggro stays almost or exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Every warrior in my guild, excluding the recently-returned retirees, can generate more sustained aggro than I can, and I do have WA5+ykesha+spells.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but saying knights just need to try harder is a bit stupid.</div></div><hr />

Many times, it's not 'not needing' that keeps us from obtaining aggro weapons. Many of us recognize the value. Now, consider how many of you have merit/loot systems that automatically reward or heavily bias enraging blow type weapons to warriors. Consider the knee-jerk reaction in the Bunker thread with the warrior who didn't really need the BoW that he looted. In most guilds, a knight rolling on a Blade of War would get crucified. How many guilds have considered making SEWS and Vanazir warrior only / warrior biased? This stops way more knights than 'Oh, I don't see the point' does.</div></div><hr />

My guild is baised to give BoW to warriors, and SEWS to knights. We feel it's fairest that way.</div></div><hr />

It's SoE's responsibility to make items like aggro weapons available to Knights if they are needed. It is your responsibility and that of your guild to obtain them for those that would benefit from having them.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough there are warrior posts where aug'ing a VDD, SEWS, or other not really an aggro weapon is discussed. Given the even wider assortment of Knight weapons this doesn't seem like a major issue to me.<br />
<br />
The aggro component to many Warrior weilded aggro weapons, augs, and weapons buffing items is stun - a very often resisted stun, a stun that we can generate with procs much less frequently than Knights can with procs and spells.<br />
<br />
A successful taunt even by a Knight puts you on the top of the aggro list btw unless SoE has changed something dramatically. IMO claims that Paladins can't obtain and hold aggro are pretty suspect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheena</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well honestly on PAPER a warrior with WA5, DB/EoE both angerIII auged, matched with how much my paladin friend says he stuns every 30 seconds, the warrior will generate more aggro.  Thats on PAPER though, and because the RNG is so streaky and unreliable it won't always happen, or sometimes the warrior will totally blow the paladin out of the water in aggro.  Paladin aggro is still more reliable and controllable in all situations though in the very high end warriors gain more reliability though still not matching a hybrid, because warriors can never command their aggro to happen.  Thats how it is.  <br />
<br />
Also, with all the knights complaining about not being able to tank, why would you want a BoW or the like?  If you supposedly can't tank (which isn't true), why would you want the chance to steal aggro from a warrior by just swinging your weapon?<br />
<br />
As for still grabbing for defensive or even partial defensive....why is that still going on, it'll never happen they've stated the cold hard fact already I don't know why its still being drug out *shrug*</div></div><hr />

off topic, but does this mean that sinister strikes does in fact add a nice aggro generation bonus by virtue of giving an offhand dmg bonus?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's actually a pretty damn good question. I would *think* so, since I can't see them 1) thinking far enough to modify existing melee hate generation, or 2) caring that much. I don't know how large the DB is for the offhand, but I'm guessing that it's nowhere near as large as the primary hand bonus? I would think it would add some hate, but in the grand scheme of things not a massive amount. That's all assumption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ummm no, I am applying a signifant penality to knights tanking NOT the power puff hinderances that others have. For high DI mobs it would trade a LARGE ammount of your ability to keep agro for a SIGNIFIANT reduction in damage, on lower mobs it would be there fore next to useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not.  I think a weapon that gives 13 or 14 dmg bonus in my primary hand is 5 in my offhand.  I'll double check, but that's close.  Offhand bonus from sinister strikes is weapon delay divided by 3.5.  And you're right, if it does add some aggro it's not going to be a terribly large amount.  Initially though some of us thought maybe it doesn't add any aggro.  A little is better than nothing when you're a tank. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AThousandYoung</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good system I think would be one where Warriors, Paladins and SKs should have equal tanking abilities and equal taunting capabilities.  The taunting should NOT be spell based in general...or if it is spell based, the spells should be specifically designed as taunt spells and have mind control as a theme...maybe a spell that inspires rage for the SK, or a divine command spell for the Paladin.  Stuns/DOTs/Debuffs should not be used to control aggro, especially if the target is immune!  The difference in the classes should come from extra DPS from the Warrior, group buffs/heals from the Paladin, and debuffs from the Shadow Knight.  Tanking could be equallized by factoring in the heals/lifetaps/debuffs of the Paladin and SK.<br />
<br />
Alternatively the different classes could tank different mobs better...Paladin for undead and villains, the SK for heroic figures and targets of assassination quests, and the Warrior for generally badass creatures that require a will and body of steel to stand toe to toe with.<br />

I think the current way the tanks work is bizaare.</div></div><hr />

You were seeing 11k+ buffed knights hitting just under 100%+ failure rates.  I would say thats 'in need of adjustment'<br />

<br />
<br />
You want to talk about intellectual bankruptcy of arguments. That one you just made is a PERFECT example on an intellectually bankrupt argument.<br />
<br />
Every warrior, uber gear or not, had the same problem. Dependency on the RNG.<br />
<br />
And, I suppose, that every knight geared within the level of the select handful of those who did it pre-fixes is able to win even 10% of the time?  Why do knights die in those trials?  Oh, you mean complete dependency on the RNG in terms of spikes, where no matter how well equipped you are, it was possible to get 2rounded between a heal hitting and the next hitting.  And no, not all warriors were &quot;completely dependant&quot; on the RNG. I know a few personally who had no such issues, and got quite a laugh out of people thinking they existed.</div></div><hr />
