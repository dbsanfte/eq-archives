<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to ask before I spend my 4,5,6 aa in general. <br />
<br />
I did not put any points into stamina when I rolled my warrior, base is only 75 sta.  Should I consider Innate Stamina 3 instead of Regen 3 ?  My Sta with gear/stat food is right around 200 now and does not max out with buffs.  I tried looking through all the posts in the sticky but nothing really covered this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got metabo3 before I put any points into stamina. I max out with buffs, but when I duo with my cleric the extra hp is nice when I can't bum buffs from a shaman. It's really up to you how you spend your points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Talena, in you case I'd suggest Metab/3, you mentioned you eat stat food and that there will both maintain a boost to multiple stats longer and save you some plat over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
popss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go metab3. Stamina will come easily from gear, but the savings in good foods/drinks is really very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I went with regen3. Stat food is dirt cheap, and I just swap my stat food bag out when I don't need the boost. Stamina caps with buffs, vs. regen works all the time. regen makes soloing a bit more viable, making it a bit easier to go do all those old quests without dragging somebody along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For what it's worth, in my view no, don't go with STA. <br />
I'm pretty sure that even with your initial STA, your gear will max your STA before you max regen. If you feel like you really need STA in the shorter run, do a couple LDoNs, wait for a STA aug to drop, slap it in some slot.<br />
STA would be behind Metabolism and regen, and both of those are behind Run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Regen 3.<br />
<br />
Listen to me here, and follow my logic.  If you put points into stamina, you're gonna gain about 30-40 hp.  THat's HP that's most likely not going to save your ass.  By contrast, regen 3 will regen those HP in under a minute. Furthermore, if you ever are able to max your stamina with your gear, you're gonna feel pretty silly for wasting those points.  Your regen rate will likely never reach capped status, and it will be useful for the rest of your EQ life. <br />
<br />
You don't look like a raiding warrior where your max HP matters.  You look like a warrior who does some LDoN or casual grouping a couple nites a week, and regen 3 would benefit you FAR more in that environment than a couple extra HP.  If this is the case, and you do some PoJ or LoY on the nites that you play with your friends, you're going to be far happier with an increased regen rate than you will with 30 extra HP.<br />
<br />
Lots of people tout metabolism on this board, but lets be serious here.  Halas meat pies are fuckin 50pp a stack absolute tops, and they last a good 2 weeks.  Do you REALLY want to waste hard earned XP on that?  If you do, that's fine, but I can see far better things to put points into than cheap ass food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Regen 3 will give 18 HP regen a min. That is nothing! Time how long it is between CHs the cleric casts on you, would the 18 HP have made a difference? NO! Go with metabalism. When you're spending plat on stat food, that difference is a decent amount of plat over the long haul. <br />
<br />
If you need a little extra sta go visit the tribute idiot. Metabolism and run3 will help you in almsot all situations, if you have sow it kinda negates run 3. Regen 3, sta(which you'll max much sooner then you think), etc are all just a waste of time.<br />
<br />
The only other logical choices are Cha, if you raid alot and have DI fail on you often or svs. Str, sta, agi, and dex all max easy enough once you are in solid gear and get some shammy lovin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you can make a better case for the bind wound general AA than for Metabolism, in terms of usefulness associated with fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Regen 3 will give 18 HP regen a min.  <br />
<br />
1 tick = 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
60 seconds = 10 ticks<br />
<br />
3hp/tick x 10 ticks = 30hp.<br />
<br />
In addition, HALAS MEAT PIES ARE DIRT CHEAP.  I don't know how you can call 30hp a minute nothing and be concerned about getting an AA to make food that costs pocket change nothing.  You can go clear all the gnolls outside of Paw and get enough fine steel to buy Halas meat pies for a month.  Metabolism is an AA they put in to waste the Vah Shir's AA, and for when you're using Tormentor Stir Fry or better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Now that there is a mighty fine case for Regen/3.  Eating food slower vs having regen and eating the same food does kinda make it a no brainer.  Run/3 &amp; Regen/3 it'll be for me then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heck with shrew even run 3 is not a no brainer anymore. well yea it is but not as needed as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Run3 is still a no-brainer imo, if only because it's always on and doesn't  have a buff icon. And the only time I ever had shrew cast on me, it seemed like I slowed down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shrew is, iirc, 33% while run3 is 30% movement increase.<br />
<br />
The odds of you ever seeing your life saved from regen3 are small to most likely never. However, it can be nice for downtime ifyou solo (as soon as you add any form of healer, regen3 is negligible).  I happen to disagree with the arguement of metab3 being worthless, but let's be honest here, 3aa for anything in general is not worth worrying about. You can grind those out in a day for all of the ones you like. Personally, I got run3, then regen3 and only recently got metab3. However, I am also cheap and never used stat food before I had metab because, unlike some people, I would rather not have to go &quot;farm the gnolls&quot; to fund it every week. Frankly, we all play the game differently and have different priorities (especially in something as minor as the general AAs). <br />
<br />
Pick what seems best for your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Regen adds up though and you have to start somewhere.  I have like 25 regen counting  AA and gear and I have been saved by it when dotted a lot of times.  There are lots of times it is nice just after near wipes where healers are all dead and no one to heal me.  If you do quests, its also nice for soloing millions of greens for faction such as in Great Divide or in Mistmoore.  It will not help you in a fight against a boss mob hitting 2000+ of course but it does help a little bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are examples why even as a troll, I've put some effort into regen stuff.<br />
<br />
There have been many more times when regen severely lessened my being dotted than the few extra hps saved me from getting pasted.<br />
<br />
Although being a purple club survivor is cool too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">do you remember your ealy lvl (below 60 at least) where you were using a fungi tunic ?<br />
below lvl 50 regen is 1standing, and it goes up to 4 at lvl 59, and fungi tunic is 15.<br />
at lvl 65 regen is 10 and max AA regen gives 8 more, so 18 (26 for troll).<br />
this means you are naturally weary an half fungi tunic without any buff slot nor item slot used, and because of your lvl you actually get the same global regen now than before with the Fungi tunic.<br />
and because the worn regen is limited to 35 you can max 53 regen standind, so even if it's unusefull during fight, having Replenishment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3433&amp;source=Live) parmanently, without any stacking issues nor buff slot used, on you is quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Soooo many choices and all I wanted was to start the arheotypes lol.<br />
<br />
Not really considering Metabolism myself, as mentioned above the Halas pies/Grobb liq. meat are dirt cheap (about 60pp/stack) and have only used half a stack over the last week.<br />
<br />
Two that have jumped to the top of my consideration list are Regen3 and First Aid 3.  The reason these make sense to me now is due to a recent LDoN.  We had a bad drop rate on collect, time getting short, the Cleric dead, Druid too stupid to stop nuking and just snare let runners bring friends and with BOTH healers now dead I had 20% health and needed 2 drops in 10 mins.  I used bind wound and BL's 100pt heal to get enough health to pull 2 more and we won.  Just a rare occurance but good examples for these 2 aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Regen and Metabolism are both nearly useless.  Sta is completely useless once you max it with gear.  Those 3 points are just to get you to the good stuff.  Not worth thinking about it too long, get one of them and start on the real AA.  Personally I went regen and I would do it again, but it really doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Lol, the problem here is that most of these are very very marginal, and they tend to get more marginal as you get stronger.<br />
The case for Run 3 is that it works indoors, doesn't take a bluff slot, and you don't have to think about it.<br />
Regen  begins to look pretty marginal as you get more hitpoints, but again it's always on and 30 hps a minute running all the time never completely disappears (as does the benefit of STA).<br />
If you want to think of them in their best light, both of these can make you marginally (and innately) slightly harder to damage. Run 3 can help you avoid getting hit once in a great while; the regen is basically a tiny mitigation factor in your favor whenever you are at &lt;100% health. /shrug.<br />
One of my warriors, who is kind of an experiment, quested jboots before he was 52. Since he hung out a while at 52 to tank Vox &amp; Naggy, he had some AA points building up. Since he had jboot sow, he put his generals in regen and first aid. Also he does tradeskills, so he's farming mass green mobs as fast as possible; an innate ability to replace hitpoints can be handy, cut down time, etc.<br />
In one sense, first aid is stupid because I suspect he'll eventually want to go back and get Run 3 for long indoor crawls when buff slots are at a premium. <br />
But at least in his 50s, having Regen, first aid, the (somewhat irritating) focused will discipline and maxxed bind wound means that he can regen more than 300 hitpoints a minute. Fairly useful in the mid 50s, though progressively marginal as time goes on. Not nearly as useful if you don't farm or never hunt in small groups. A couple of my good friends play a mage and necro respectively, though, and sometimes to relax we hunt together. A capacity to regen hitpoints is handy for me under those admittedly narrow circumstances.<br />
One aspect of first aid that is more helpful than it used to be is the fact that you can bw to 100%, and depending on your level and bw skill, you can bandage for about 50 hitpoints per bandage. No, this is not like winning the lottery, nor will it make you irresitible to wealthy &amp; attractive &amp; intriguingly flexible objects of your desire, but it does have a couple of small utilities:<br />
1. When you do multiple LDoNs with a shaman, and you get buffed up by him at the entrance to the dungeon, lots of times there's a bit of downtime while casters med for a minute or two. In your 50s you can improve the efficiency of your shaman's canning by 2/3rds to 1/3rd, depending on your respective levels.<br />
2. At any point after a tough fight when a med break is called, you can do the same for shaman or necros, or you can touch up anyone's hitpoints who won't have time to get to 100% during the med.<br />
3. In some places, depending on the pull rate, you have about enough time to do one bw between pulls. Again extremely marginal, but for necros and shaman it's free mana.<br />
<br />
How's that for spending too much time thinking about things that don't really matter?</div></div><hr />

No question hands down no brainer run3 and metab3.  I went regen3/run3 and I wish I had chosen metab if nothing else than to prevent having to have as much bag space with food/drink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lol, to thorw into the mix.....CHA?  Since it is, as far as I know, helpfull for DI and most gear does not address it for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would say the best choices for those initial 6 would be.<br />
<br />
Run3 of course, I can't see any reason not to get run3 for 3 aa.<br />
<br />
The other 3 are open for debate. Long Run if you are purely making a raid tank. Cha3 is likely the best choice. If you are a developing character  or plan on doing alot of duo/2boxing etc, than regen is the best choice. I could also argue for met3 or magic resist3. MR will be useful for quite awhile, unless you know you will be grouping with a bard 90% of the time. On zeb, the halas pies are 4plat. So met3 hasn't been a big deal but before i switch to somehting more expensive I might pick it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Boomlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To be honest, metabolism is most useful for casters.  Horses eat an ungodly amount of food, and even if it's relatively cheap to buy basic stat food/drink, it is worth it to slow down how fast mounts eat it.  Warriors, of course, don't need the med bonus from being mounted, so it is much less useful for them.<br />
