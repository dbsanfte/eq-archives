<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cuur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I'm having a hard time trying to decide between these weapons listed below as to which ones to use.  Here are my options:<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010)<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009)<br />
<br />
Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23152)<br />
<br />
OR I can attempt to save for this weapon out of LDON Guk:<br />
<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade<br />
PRIMARY/SECONDARY, 1H Slash, 14/19<br />
AC8 Dex7 Agi7 Hp75 Mana50 SvCold7 SvMagic7 SvPoison7, WT2.0<br />
WAR/RNG/BRD/ROG<br />
type1, type4, type6<br />
1150 points<br />
<br />
Which I could add 2 DMG to and Force of Ykesha thus making it 16/19 with 125DD w/stun and throwing a few more stats/resists/etc. on it as well (augs below).<br />
<br />
Type 4: Slimestone Fragment of Dread, Proc: Force of Ykesha (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4358&amp;source=Live) for 760 points<br />
Type 6: Pristine Emerald of Harm +2 dmg; must be 1h weapon with 16+ dly RANGE PRI SEC all/all for 1150 points<br />
<br />
Now I'm not sure if the Curse-Smelted is lore or not, so it may be possible to get two of them.  Assume that i have max crit proc AA's, Ambidex, and the like as well in case you would factor that in.  I have the top 3 weapons already but I am debating where to go from here.  I thought about going for the armor first, but until I am assured of getting the mobs attention at least most of the time there's not a whole of sense in beefing up more than I am.  What does everyone think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The 2 first you linked is just as good as the last one imho. You can also add procs to thos and it would be alot easier to get that way, rather then having to do 2k points with your current weapons in a gimp shape. Upgrade them quick and be happy until you get some EB weapons, then its time to aug them!</div></div><hr />
