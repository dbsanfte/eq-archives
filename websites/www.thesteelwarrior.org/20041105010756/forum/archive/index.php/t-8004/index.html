<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have 31% worn haste (Soul Screem Belt), and I am considering buying a 36% haste item (Cloack of Flames).  If I do this switch, I will end up replacing both my back and waist items and end up with just about the same stats I have now except the 5% haste increase, and I will loose about 7 AC.  Will I notice a 5% increase in haste?  There are many threads discussing the nature of haste, and give lots of numbers, but  I am wondering if any of you from personal experience did an upgrade like this and actually noticed any apprreciable difference.<br />
<br />
To to do the upgrade I will have to spend all my plat, plus a  some.  I can pull it off with just a little more farming, but I will have to work for it.  <br />
<br />
One additional bit of information, my guild is working towards Vex Thal keys.  Still a ways off ,but I am optimistic that before Fall, I will be there.  I have seen other threads disucssing Vex Thal loot, and there is a good chance that whatever haste item I have will get replaced by VT stuff eventurally.<br />
<br />
Sorry no magelo available yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tribute haste is looking very desirable for freeing up a slot for AC items. I'd stick with the belt for now until you can find another slot to put it in that doesn't take up the back slot. The reason I say this is because there is a damn near soloable quest for a VERY VERY nice back item that you probably wont replace until well into elementals/time. I'm sure you've seen it mentioned before but it bears mentioning here, do the loyalist shield quest in Katta, it worth the upgrade. 50AC 75hp is nothing to sneeze at. Using a haste cloak makes really makes you miss out on some great AC. personaly I'm almost done (waiting on the ashes) witht he quest, and I'm reallt starting to consider losing my belt in favor of some more AC on my belt. I'm quite sure you can fine other slow you should upgrade and get haste in VT.<br />
<br />
Any VT types got any suggestion as to what slots to expect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, and no, you won't notice 5% haste. I believe with chanter haste you are at spell/item haste cap now anyways. (Can anyone verify this for me, I know its close.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use cloak of the black winds from VT as my haste item.   If you want stats it is on magelo.  I used tribute up until I got the cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't go for the 5percent upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">don't do the upgrate !<br />
just because it isn't a upgrade. +5% haste and -7AC and all the plat is far from we can call an upgrade, especially now that you can patch your haste with tribute.<br />
<br />
start on you loyalist quest as mentionned above, it will last you until PoT if you manage to pick up a nice haste belt in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the repsonses.  I sense a bit of agrement on what to do.  I will stick with my current haste belt, and start researching the loyalist quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Without a magelo its hard to give advice, but I would not spend plat...I was in a somewhat similar situation-- I had a RBB for haste--and I think I did notice the lack of that last 5% haste in agro sometimes. <br />
<br />
While it took a lot of points, the best combo upgrade for me turned out to be a Royal Sands sands Helm, and then the 36% aug from BB. Then I got cultural belt (about 4k). A 39 AC helm should last you a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm a big fan of tribute haste. Really simplifies your gear choices down to HP/AC. Once you get to VT you may or may not want to get haste item. Sticking with tribute will allow you the flexibility to pass on haste items and spend your DKP/merit/whatever on some other groovy loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, and no, you won't notice 5% haste. I believe with chanter haste you are at spell/item haste cap now anyways. (Can anyone verify this for me, I know its close.)<br />
<br />
i believe vallons is 68 percent haste. so with a 31 haste belt your hast is 99 percent. it caps at 100 percent. hence the upgrade will improve your total damage by half a percent IF you have vallons or similar buff. obviously you normally will on raids and you will in many exp groups as well. so what can i possibly say about 41 percent haste items?<br />
<br />
now having said that if someone detects an error in my reasoning please point it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Save the money you'd spend on a Cloak of Flames, sell the Soulscream and buy a nice belt (e.g. Amy belt).  With the substantial money you have saved, buy say 30kpp worth of Robes of Tempest or Architect Bejewelled Chestplates and feed them to the tribute master.  That will give you many months' worth of 41% tribute haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Adding another dont do it to the pool.<br />
<br />
With chanter haste (have 65 chanter too) you are effectively capped out. The tribute idea is valid so long as you are not running 3+ hrs a day in which case you can burn through some tribute pretty fast.<br />
<br />
I would wait for a haste drop so long as you have some expectation that you will get a drop. My pally has the cloak and its okay but he was a bazaar twink until I started replacing his stuff with LDoN stuff.<br />
<br />
Gonna do the 36% LDoN haste aug which is another viable alternative depending on your playstyle. It could keep you from replacing your haste (and wasting likely DKP) until very late in PoP (likely Time) assuming you plan to get that far. And with the new aug system you wouldnt worry about what item you put it on necessarily...<br />

do NOT give up AC for 5% haste.</div></div><hr />

You could have sold that CoF and got some better armor I think, looking at your magelo.  Also, haste = agro, especially when your spell haste drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah but rolling on something you aren't planning to use is &quot;rude&quot; at least--as it sounds like a NBG group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yep, Kailyn -- it was an NBG group. I was the highest level tank there by 14 levels. The other folks in the raid actually needed the upgrade and were esctatic to get it. <br />
<br />
About selling the CoF for plat to buy upgrades: <br />
on Stromm, I've found that with the exception of ornate molds, there isn't anything available in the bazaar that one can buy to upgrade most of my slots. There are exceptions, of course, as things like the Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience are JUST starting to make their appearance (at 70k a pop or more!). Building up 70+k for single items or for single molds just boggles my mind. I think I have 3k in the bank right now. LOL!<br />
<br />
So, since I'm in a casual guild, I'll be grinding those LDoN points, questing upgrades where possible (Loyalist Shield!), and hoping that the raiding alliances we've put together with other family guilds continue to mature. At this point, though, most of our allies are still in their low-50's, so it'll be awhile before we get anywhere with significant upgrades, I suspect.<br />
<br />
Thanks for suggestions, though. :-)</div></div><hr />
