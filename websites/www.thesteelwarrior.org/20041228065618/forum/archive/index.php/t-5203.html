Its got 3 slots, type 1, 2, and 3.<br />
<br />
Now I was looking at a listing of the type 3 augs sold on the vendors, and for the most part I kind of think they suck for a warrior.  While Veng and Regen is nice, i always look for the upgrade that directly helps my ability to tank, so there is a 760 aug with +8% Dodge.....<br />
<br />
My question is, has anyone purchased this? Is it worth it? Possibly any info on how much dodge effects avoidance and/or mitigation, and finally any conclusions you may have about which is better.....<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for any help</div></div><hr />

I got the aug for my EF legs and replaced it 2 weeks later :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People keep saying &quot;there was a parse, and it showed the dodge aug wasn't worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That doesn't tell me enough.  Was it &quot;wasn't worth it, it only reduced damage taken by 1%&quot;, or &quot;wasn't worth it, it only reduced damage taken by 0.003%&quot;?  <br />
<br />
If anyone knows where to find a copy of that parse, please post the actual results here.  Or, if someone out there has the +8% dodge aug, if you'd be willing to put in a few hours giving us a definitive parse, I'd sure be grateful.  Easiest way, I think, would be to set yourself up with a fungi and some low greenie beating on you while you're holding your opal-encrusted steins or what have you, and leaving it overnight.  Using a low greenie also makes it matter less when you take off your high-AC LDoN armor, and put on your special emergency backup non-dodge-auged armor.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Anyway.  Real numbers much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's why I suggested equipping opal-encrusted steins.  As far as I know, you can't attack at all (including ripostes) when wielding non-weapon items.<br />
<br />
My original thought had been &quot;turn your back on it&quot;, and then I remembered that warrior PC's only dodge from the front.  Hence the stein suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had my cleric bot jumped by green mummies and skeletons when standing around waiting for me to die inside a dungeon. After some time beating on her, they give up and leave. May be different if you do something to get on the hatelist first though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's already a number of posts that explain this.<br />
<br />
You decide if dodging 1-2% more often is worth it.  Also note that it's possible to dodge 1-2% better, riposte 3% better, AND parry 1-2% better...<br />
<br />
Given the choice between these options or having more HP/AC, most warriors simply add an AC or HP aug.</div></div><hr />

If you are just looking to aug your empty slots. <br />
<br />
It really depends on your play style. some people like to put regen on theirs. like having 2hp/tick regen makes a difference on 8k+ HP. but hey all depends on how you play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valentinian</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious about the poll up top.  Isn't veng 4 +20atk (5/veng level), while AoB is +20atk and +2regen?<br />

If so, why would anyone pick the atk_only option when you could get regen to go with it?</div></div><hr />

We unfortunately had a wipe when we did VT with two groups going for the thalls and we ported back to DPS. I did the unforgivable and went afk before the port and came back and the fucking wolves had killed me. Took them about 3 minutes. I couldnt believe it - even if I was naked I thought I'd last longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dodge +8% probably amounts to adding about another 10-20 HP.  Your mileage may differ since it depends on your total HP but should at least get about 10 HP of usefulness out of that mod.  Note that dodging 1% more of incoming attacks (roughly going from getting hit 50% of the time to 49% of the time) amounts to roughly 200 more HP on a 10K warrior so yeah of course you're not going to dodge that much more.  The additional avoidance has to be minuscule due to the nature of avoidance.  Avoiding 1% more of total incoming attacks is at least 2% more HP (since you only get hit 50% of the time to begin with).  <br />
<br />
I'd probably get a Vengeance in that slot since its effect is most tangible though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks can, but its still unclear if its the exact same dodge rate as from the front.<br />
<br />
Is the 8% increase to the skill number verified? Where is that gotten from? I thought it was add 8% to the % chance to dodge, which is of course a factor of skill, BUT 8% to skill would absorb alot of the benefit versus a pure 8% increase in dodge chance.<br />
<br />
I just want to know if this is definitive and provable, was it parsed or what? Where's the proof?<br />

Thats the lucy listing which I am 99.99% sure is the exact same as in-game. So if you notice it says &quot;Skill Mod: Dodge +8%&quot; which leads me to believe it is +8% to the skill which i believe max'd out at 190 for wars, so it gives +15 to the skill for a final skill of 205.<br />

This is exactly how I thought it worked when I started the thread, just wanted to clear it up for the poster above.<br />

He has royal attendant BP and Helm, and has the dodge +8 on his helm. I have bought arms from EF and thats the first aug thats going on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had 8% dodge on a ldon bracer for a couple months now.  Hell if I know if it does anything.  I don't recall it being that terribly expensive.  I think i'll just pretend it does something and have another drink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can't you put more hit points in the 3rd slot?   I think there's a +30hp aug from Guk that's slot 3.   But overall with an item that has slots 1, 2, and 3, I think you can add a total of either 100 or 110hp with nothing but + to HP augs.  (hmm... not sure on this one.  I believe there's a +30 for slot 3 and I know there's a +40 for slot 2.  The +40 from EC says slot 7 though... so I'm not sure how you'd fill slot 1 with hit points).  <br />
<br />
It's expensive.  The question would be are you going to get enough LDoN points to do it and buy the other things you want and is the hit point aug that you'd put in slot 3 better or worse than +8% to dodge?  Or vengeance 4? Or on a BP, regen V (is that slot 2 or 3?) ?</div></div><hr />
