still boggles me to this day how a warrior cannot understand why you need to taunt everytime the button pops for most effectiveness,ill draw you a picture<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~&gt; Wizard<br />
<br />
both players at equal distance whoever has more aggro is tanking<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~~~~~~&gt; Wizard<br />
War has 3000 aggro, wiz has 7000, war is tanking b/c aggro is affected by range of player to mob<br />
Example 3:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~~~~~~&gt; Wizard<br />
War is Taunting everytime the button pops and is always at Aggro of Wizard+1,and Wizard always is Treated as having his aggro halved, and you have a happy wizard<br />
Example 4:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~~~~~~&gt; Wizard<br />
Dumb Warrior who only hits Taunt when mob changes targets sits at same aggro while wizards get summoned and killed,and then Dumb warrior again becomes the highest on aggro list and hitting taunt does nothing<br />
Warrior 7001<br />
Wizard 7000<br />
Cleric 2800<br />
etc<br />
soon as you let the wizard die you cant taunt,you acually Need the nuke happy aggro whore to tank better b/c he gives you aggro boosts during the fight<br />
<br />
so the &quot;taunting should have no effect&quot; is something soe will screw up,and shouldnt even be in the post, theres nothing wrong with getting 100 aggro for hitting taunt even if your at the top of list (and you really never are, it just looks that way to the ill-knowing)<br />
<br />
 First off, Edone, I don't know who the hell you are, seeing as how I can't remember any of your 6 posts ever being directed at me. Nor can I understand what about my post set your silly ass off.<br />
<br />
 HOWEVER, it's clear that undereducated fucknuts like you running around spreading misinformation to the masses (even if they are Juvenile-bound 14 year old Paladins) is NOT gonna be what helps Warriors out of the mess they're in.<br />
<br />
 But today, I'm gonna be double the king-sized ass that unrestrained ignorance afloat in the gene pool makes me.<br />
<br />
 I'm not gonna post a single comment on ANY of your points. Not one.<br />
<br />
 I'm gonna ask my fellow Warriors who's correct in your four examples and your delusionary (sorry, conclusionary) paragraph.<br />
<br />
 Guys, I'm asking nicely: Can you expound upon the nature of taunt for the Encephalitus-inflicted among us?<br />
<br />
 (Oh yeah, extra credit for flaming me for being a petty jerkass. :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whoever has the most agro is tanking. It's as simple as that. If i have 7001 and a wizard has 7002 and is on the other side of the zone, the mob will be chasing the wizard until I get 7003.<br />
<br />
The only way a wizard can give you an agro boost during a fight is by stealing your agro, and you taunting it back...which is still putting you only 1 point above him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Distance actually affects agro the other way around. <br />
When, for example, a nuke gives 1000 points of h8 fired from melee range, the same nuke fired from 240 range will only give 700 something.. pulling the numbers out of my ass, but hopefully Ebaydone gets the idea =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's fuckin bullshit, and that's why all the fuckin shaman are slowing from half a zone away giving warriors problems and then asking &quot;Why aren't you taunting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Range does not decrease aggro, and I'd like to see you prove it before you say it again.  I've seen shit run all over the goddamned place to get to overzealous casters, there's no way I'm believing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, from my own observations playing both a warrior and wizard, I believe aggro/hate to work like this:<br />
<br />
Nukes casted at any range give the same hate.<br />
<br />
Some mobs are &quot;stubborn.&quot;  They will not charge the highest aggro person unless that person has a significantly higher amount of hate built up over the tank, if that person is out of melee range.  So you could still be tanking the mob, yet not have the most hate.  Some mobs just don't want to switch targets without a lot of provocation.  (especialy time gods)  Sometimes a caster can nuke a mob, and not be its target out of melee range, but the moment you enter its melee range, it'll switch to you.  If you step back out again, he'll go back to the original tank.<br />
<br />
This would explain the &quot;initial aggro&quot; people talk about.  You don't get more hate for aggroing it first, its just the mob doesn't want to switch targets easily.<br />
<br />
Conversely, I've noticed the opposite.  Some mobs are &quot;dumb.&quot;  Sometimes you can nuke a mob, train it over someone who did absoluetely nothing to it, and the mob will attack that person instead of you, simply because he is in melee range and you are not.  Nuking/aggroing the mob more before hand will make the mob continute to chase you instead of attacking the person you pull over.<br />
<br />
This explains &quot;undead&quot; aggro.  Those mobs are just mindless and attack the person closest to them rather than run to the one it hates most.  Undead/animal mobs tend to be dumb.<br />
<br />
There is some question whether if you are tanking, but don't have the most hate, if taunt will copy the hate of the person who does.   This is REALLY hard to tell, but I tend to lean toward no.  Taunt certainly does nothing if you really are the highest on the hate list.  I 100% agree that mashing it in exp groups if you are tanking is stupid.  Even if the mob is &quot;stubborn,&quot; regular ol' exp mobs arn't going to take much more to charge/summon.  However I do press it often while tanking gods, just in case.<br />
<br />
Again, this is just my personal theory to aggro.  Don't take it as fact or anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Range definetly affects aggro.  I have no idea in what way but from playing a wizard, 2 different clerics, an enchanter all from lvl 1 to 54+ and 2 boxing my paladin with healers for eons this has always held true for me.  If the casters stand near the tank they catch aggro much easier than standing away.<br />
<br />
btw. I agree with the original suggestion you posted Partha, though I think if they add direct aggro to taunt that its chance of giving the top of the aggro effect doesn't need to be raised at all.  The direct aggro should just work on success or failure.  That gives you a 50% chance to add X aggro and a 50% chance to go to top of list+X aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dumb Warrior who only hits Taunt when mob changes targets sits at same aggro<br />
<br />
This guy's a tool. Writing stuff like this, seriously. He's saying the warrior just stands there afk and doesn't attack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>qutsemnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">as a rogue (all my defensive AAs)  sometimes ill try to peel off mobs to get em spread out.   And ill start whacking one and get it good and agrod and ill back up and instead of following it will just turn and hit someone near.  Then ill run up and of course it turns right towards me as soon as i get near.  Ill beat up on it some more.  And ill back up and either it just turns and whacks somebody near or it finally starts following me.<br />
<br />
Point?  Theres something about range but its small.   Its definatly there though.<br />
<br />
As for the taunt.  It occurs to me long ago they made rogue evade do a &quot;jolt&quot; if it wasnt going to do anything else.  That is they originally made evade work in a mirror of taunt that you had to be at the top agro.  If you werent tanking then you wouldnt loose agro.   <br />
<br />
It occurs to me there is no reason that taunt should ever do nothing.  It should be like evade where if it was going to do nothing it should do an enraging blow.  Then you can decide whether to hold it or keep tapping.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind whenever thinking about taunt that things like beast pets are x factors.  a beast pet can have huge hate and never tank.  You can (according to warriors) tap taunt all day long around beast pets and stay way ahead of people.</div></div><hr />

yes it does, maybe borrow a friends wizard and test it if you dont believe those that have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I only taunt when I lose aggro, this works perfectly. I noticed that continuous taunting like a ranger pressing his arrow key doesnt do anything, except make you not have taunt up when you lose aggro. Yes it comes up quite quickly again and yes taunt may fail, but I have seen casters die in 2 seconds, so I rather have it up when I lose aggro and have a chance of saving those dudes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes it does, maybe borrow a friends wizard and test it if you dont believe those that have them. <br />
<br />
I don't need a fuckin wizard, I have a goddamned aggro machine at my disposal.<br />
<br />
I've slowed from max spell range before with the shaman, and I've got her ass kicked.  I've also lived thru the ordeal.  I've stood RIGHT UNDER the mob and slowed, and proceeded to get her ass kicked, and I've also proceeded to back away completely unscathed because the shit stays on Haass.<br />
<br />
I do not believe for one fuckin second that it's true.   I usually pull to the group and spin right next to Cagna and proceed to slow from that position.  The mobs ignore her just as much as if she were standing on the other side of the room, and when she does pull aggro because I haven't procced yet or got lucky with the taunt button, it doesn't matter whether she's standing next to me or whether she's halfway across the zone...that mob is kicking her ass and it doesn't give a fuck where she is.  <br />
<br />
Sorry man, no way no how can I agree with that.  Almost 4 years of 2 boxing suggests otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">qutsemnie, that's because melee aggro is less than assist aggro.  that mob's buddy is getting pounded on so he would rather assist than back away from the fight.  I dont know the technical term, its not pull aggro (since i'm guessing you are tagging the add mob, the mob that was not pulled but was in aggro range of the one who was) and its not first to dmg aggro.<br />
<br />
I off tank all the time as a beastlord, 1 slow will always overcome pull/assist aggro where it takes me dropping mob to 90-95% health via melee in order to pull the mob away from the others.  I'd rather pull with spell and not melee so that enc can mez or someone can root it away from group (if its a summoning mob)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind whenever thinking about taunt that things like beast pets are x factors. a beast pet can have huge hate and never tank. You can (according to warriors) tap taunt all day long around beast pets and stay way ahead of people.<br />
<br />
This is very true but usually warriors do not like grouping with me :(  It's a shame cus I miss grouping with warriors.<br />
<br />
my current pet proc is 200 pure hate + 122 DD With stun (similiar to enc DD/stuns) and pet procs roughly 3 to 10 times in a 45 second fight.  because Mob programming, they will always attack a player over a pet if both are in melee range, but the pet has his own place on the mob's aggro list and usually its quite up there at the top or near the top of the list.  Back when I was playing my warrior the only time i didn't have aggro problems was when i was grouping with a beastlord and button mashing after i saw those proc msg's, whether i had aggro or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Vallon Zek comes to my mind as a very good example of stubborn mob.  You can easily walk out of melee range (if you survive) at low HP aggro and he would leave you alone.  That guy just doesn't want to do anything more than standing still and whack whoever's in melee range.  Heck he's too lazy to even use summon most of the time.  I've got aggro and then backed out of melee range, and wait for 1 minute before going back in and he still killed me instantly when I got back into melee range so obviously I was very high on the aggro list, but he still wouldn't chase me.<br />
<br />
It seems to me mob aggro work like this.  They maintain an aggro list that has some value of hate.  Then, all the people in melee range gets a temporary aggro boost for being in melee range (because it's easier to kill someone in melee range) when mobs decides what to do.  So for example if Wizard is 7002 and Warrior is 7001 hate, then the mob decides that although he hates the Wizard slightly more, the Warrior is closer to kill him first.  For *undead* aggro this value is very high.  You can mess a mob up a lot and as long as you're not in melee range it is likely to give up and try someone else.  But for most normal PoP xp mobs, this value is relatively low so they usually end up chasing after the highest aggro person right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">reasons NOT to mash taunt<br />
<br />
if your already at the top and you hit it, you go back to the top of the list +1, that means you can lower your total aggro<br />
<br />
if you taunt mash, it wont be up when you need to aggro +1 over a cleric or damage class<br />
<br />
reasons to taunt only when you dont have aggro<br />
<br />
it will be up when you need it<br />
<br />
you will keep any aggro you build up in the mean time, this matters because there is a recast time on spells and you can build up more than enough aggro to lock it down</div></div><hr />

<br />
A succesful taunt always adds 1 aggro at least even if you are on the top of the list and you go to the top of the list +1 (over your own aggro by 1). I have no earthly idea how this above quote got thought out but it is kinda funny :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Warr aggro 500, Wiz aggro 400.<br />
<br />
Wiz nukes suddenly add 200 hate.<br />
<br />
Taunt mashing warrior is sitting at 501, taunt isnt up, Wiz dies at 600 hate.<br />
<br />
Non-taunt mashing warrior taunts and is at 601 hate, Wiz lives at 600 hate.<br />
<br />
Therefore, mashing taunt can lower total aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I certainly believe that distance has some effect on aggro.  I think any wizard would tell you it does.  Wizards are the class that consistently tries to ride the hairy edge of aggro.  You can see it on raids all the time when a wizard gets summoned.  The mob isn't going to run over and smack the wizard, but when it's summon comes up the wizard gets summoned and beat down.  If the wizard can survive the first round and backs out, the mob will go back to the tank, but if the wizard nukes again right away and the mob's summon isn't up the mob will run over and beat down the wizard good and proper.<br />
<br />
I think it's the same thing as sitting or the &quot;first to aggro&quot; bonus from the taunt thread.  If 2 players are close to each other on the hate list, the mob will hit the closest player.  Of course if the other person gets far enough ahead then the mob will ping-pong.  But in the situation where a wizard gets summoned, I think that means that the wizard was higher than the tank on the hate list or the tank would have gotten summoned.  The difference in range though, was enough to keep the mob from charging over to the wizard, but when his summon comes up it's &quot;c'mere girly man&quot; time.<br />
<br />
If there isn't I have worn my virtual vocal cords raw way too many times yelling at my guild to attack from max melee range.  It sure does seem easier to hold aggro when they do though.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully Wandor will post here and tell me if I'm full of crap, but either way I don't think it would be smart to mash taunt in groups.  On a raid though, where I know the range damage people are trying to push their damage as far as they can, I mash taunt every time it comes up while tanking a boss, under the theory that the range damage people may be passing me on the hate list and a successful taunt might up my aggro a bit.  Pretty hard to prove this, but I do believe that proximity is a factor in aggro, but it's not enough to overcome a large hate differential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you posted is true, but the taunt mashing warrior didn't lose any real hate, he only lost potential hate.  What Gerick is talking about is a commonly arrived at but probably incorrect assumption that when taunt moves you 1 point above the highest person on the hate list that it doesn't include you in the calculation.<br />
<br />
So in the case <br />
<br />
Warrior hate = 1100<br />
Wizard hate = 400<br />
Cleric hate = 225<br />
<br />
Then a successful taunt would move the warrior to 401 hate, and he would actually lose a large amount of hate from taunting successfully.  <br />
<br />
I have heard this theory before, but I don't believe it is true.  There is no evidence to suggest that taunt works this way, and if it did it would be the gayest thing ever.  In fact I think the &quot;4 taunt&quot; phenomenon from my taunt testing pretty much proves this isn't true.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/shrug.  Well, prove it.  I mean in a manner that actually proves it, not relate stories, cuz I have plenty of those too.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're completely wrong, range may indeed play some part in the determination of your aggro level, but I think there's far too many variables to consider and because of that fact, I don't think you're able to tell the exact effect that range does have on mobs.<br />
<br />
All I gotta say is that a few months ago we didn't know that all weapons basically proc at the same rate.  People swear up and down that X procs more than Y and whatever.  I think there's also too many different types of mobs to nail this thing down.  You can't stand underneath undead, period, you'll get aggro.  That doesn't mean that a spell generates less aggro if you're standing away from the mob, that means that it's AI is coded differently.<br />
<br />
You may very well be right, but I'm gonna disagree with you until you find a way to prove it, which I can't see happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">because you will flat out ignore any proof ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I haven't seen Haass ignore actual proof before, I don't think. He's a skeptic by nature which puts the onus of responsibility on anyone that puts forth a dissenting opinion to prove it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">getting actualy proof would require reliable hate on raids.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally, I believe you.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This got me thinking on how to test this...<br />
<br />
Get an SK to cast agro spells a certain number of times on a non summoning mob so that we have a known amount of hate on that mob.<br />
<br />
Have a wizard stand just out of melee range and nuke until the mob moves to attack the wizard - note the number of nukes / amount of damage required to make the mob move.<br />
<br />
Next repeat with the same mob and have the SK build up the same amount of hate and have the wizard nuke from max casting range.  <br />
<br />
Does it take the same number of nukes to make the mob move to the wizard?<br />
<br />
Do the same with a summoning mob, and also with the wizard in melee range - try it at max melee and try it standing as close to the mob as you can get.  Probably best to use a low agro nuke so the margin of error is smaller than with a large nuke.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could do the same test using 2 SKs instead of 2 wizards as the 2 SKs can generate the same numeric amount of hate.<br />
<br />
Anyone want to give this a try ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">dag got what i ment, ty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the problem is everyone just assumes the mob attacks the highest person on the hate list.  I don't believe this to be the case.  From my experience, most mobs will attack a warrior who is in melee range vs. a wizard who is not in melee range, if the warrior is close to the wizard's hate level, but not necessarily more.  However other than that, I believe outside of melee range it would not matter the distance, the mob would charge the wizard with the same nuke from 50 or 200 feet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">because you will flat out ignore any proof ? <br />

I don't ignore proof, I ignore stories -- &quot;D00d, my Willsapper never procced at all, maybe 1 in a million.&quot;  &quot;I know I swing slower when my stamina bar is empty, but if i get an invigorate, I'm right back in the game.&quot;  It's bullshit, we proved it, and yet the stories still exist.<br />

You can most definitely test this with an SK.  I do not have access to a SK with the +Hate spells, so for those of you that do, try it out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Distance definately is a factor in the aggro list, that's pretty obvious if you ever tanked..<br />
<br />
It can also be proved by Root... <br />
when a mob is rooted, he will turn to the closest person, showing that the coding for proximity aggro is already present.. and I dont see why they would of taken it out when mobs arent rooted.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is, people are imagining that the Distance Aggro is calculated seperately from the rest of the aggro...<br />
<br />
So they think that:<br />
<br />
Warrior has 1000 hate  ((+ 400 for being close))<br />
Wizard has  1300hate  ((+ 50 for being far))<br />
<br />
the total hate would make Warriors stay on target,<br />
BUT<br />
if the warrior Taunts, he would go from 1000 to 1301.<br />
So wizard's distance and aggro would allow Warriors to jump in aggro, all while staying on target the whole time..<br />
<br />
As said many times here, it doesnt work this way.<br />
<br />
Aggro is entirely calculated, taking note of all aggro related actions (save DA and bloodaggro), before deciding who is on the mob's target.<br />
So distance will influence the Wizard's hate, ya... but it will also influence wether he's on target or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">the only thing that is not certain is whether the distance affects the amount of agro gained or the amount of overagro required to get agro</div></div><hr />

Who has said &quot;many times here&quot; that it doesn't work that way?  I think this is entirely plausible.  It has been demonstrated pretty clearly that it is possible for someone to be higher on the hate list than the person who has aggro.  Taunt has also been shown to function off of the hate list and not total aggro.  I don't think there's a way to prove it, but it based on what we know about taunt, I think it's entirely possible that in the situation where someone is above you on the hate list but you still have aggro due to proximity, then a successful taunt could indeed raise you on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Does this mean you should mash taunt non-stop?  I don't think so.  This is a pretty specific situation and only applicable with a relatively small hate differential.  An argument could be made that during a raid, where there are multiple people trying to maximize their damage from max spellcasting range, that the chances of this situation helping you are much higher than in an experience group, and I know some people mash taunt during a boss encounter which I don't think is unreasonable.<br />
<br />
At the very least I hit my taunt key anytime I see somebody get summoned, since I think that is a pretty clear indication that they are above me on the hate list.</div></div><hr />

Taunt in its intended form to Regain agro is pretty pointless on these encounters anyways. Usually, already being this close to the raid mob will get the overnuker killed, be it the shortrange AE, be it the AE rampage.. there arent many mobs a caster survives in close proximity today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well with the way programming works, it seems easier to have the aggro entirely calculated before choosing a target.<br />
<br />
Since proximity already is teh deciding factor for who's on Target, when the mob is rooted...<br />
why wouldn't it be a factor in the targetting, when the mob isnt rooted??<br />
<br />
They would have to have done some ridiculous and useless programming work to ignore proximity when the mob is unrooted...<br />
but..<br />
I guess this IS EverQuest... so you never know..</div></div><hr />

This struck a chord with me for some reason and reminded me of the old days.  When I started playing EQ, I had a necro, whom I had level 60 before Velious came out.  I can remember MANY days in Kael farming armor when I would DoT the fuck out of a mob, park my ass on the ground, get summoned and never get hit.  As in, I was still sitting at the mob's feet.  Obviously today with AE and AE rampage that doesn't happen, but what about the core of the issue there?  The tanks in my guild back then were obviously not nearly as enlightened as we are today, and they had shit for aggro ability back then.  The fact remains, I've seen it happen before, people sit down, get summoned and REMAIN sitting at mob's feet.  Doesn't this completely discount the ranged aggro theory?  I've seen it happen far too much to be coincidental with a lucky press of the taunt key.<br />

<br />
Yea, I've seen this happen as well, and I can't explain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Agro is probably fucked up beyond recognition and it just barely works in game with a few tweaks. The patches in which agro was straigth out broken for a few days are uncounted, I wouldn't be surprised if the last time the SOE designers just said &quot;ok it's working now somehow, never touch agro code again&quot;<br />
That would be my only idea why sometimes you remain sitting under the mobs feet. However, I have yet to witness this myself, every time I get summoned I get smacked till I am dead or the tank regained agro. Another problem with duplicating this for me is that I never sit on raids 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">All I gotta say is that a few months ago we didn't know that all weapons basically proc at the same rate. People swear up and down that X procs more than Y and whatever<br />
<br />
Just to nitpick, people thought this because a dev once posted or said it was true at a fanfaire, I forget which.  They stated that each weapon has its own proc value that drives how often it procs.  Don't know if that was changed or just wrong all these years though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, I don't think most people used that as a rationale.  Hell, I even did some of the tests and there are still times I swear my SoD is proccing way more than 2/min, but it's probably because I'm sitting here watching TV, and then I look back on the screen and see something ridiculous like 5 SOD procs in my chat box.  The converse is that sometimes I go entire fights without one.  Stuck RNG I guess.</div></div><hr />

Was working in Kael tonight, and saw the summoning thing happen often.  Actually it was kinda cute ... my g/f would nuke or debuff, get summoned and run out from the giants feet and moments later get summoned back again.  Didn't take a tick's worth of melee or spell damage from the MOBs tho.  Tho we couldn't explain it, she and I chuckled or giggled every time.  (Was weird to be the only 5 people in Kael tho ...).<br />
<br />
Another thing which I'm sure most here have noted (gotta be on the forums, somewhere) ... new-ish to me as I haven't grouped with many enchanters before 60.  Y'know the usual adds, CC &amp; Tash thing; kill then go Taunt.  I taunt, assist, taunt, assist (I got 6 seconds to kill ...) till the MOB is awake, or assist targets me.  Almost always the former, and eventually the MOB snaps out of it with assist still on the enchanter ... and sticks to me like glue from the moment it awakes.  More of that aggro/hate list fuzziness.<br />
<br />
Only exception to that was a dungeon when a chanter threw Horrifying Visage (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2568&amp;source=Live)  on me while I taunted the mezzes .. 2, 3 taunts (at most) and /assist targets me and aggro was mine all the way through.  It shocked the heck outta me the first few times, I thought I was /assisting incorrectly.  The spell message is one of those backward math thingies that hurts my head to read.   But it was fun to have taunt ... well, taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">mezzed mobs will never change their assist Doggabone.<br />

The only exception to this would be a succesful memblur on the mez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Edone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Example 1:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~&gt; Wizard<br />
both players at equal distance whoever has more aggro is tanking<br />
 <br />
noone really contests this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~~~~~~&gt; Wizard<br />
War has 3000 aggro, wiz has 7000, war is tanking b/c aggro is affected by range of player to mob<br />
 <br />
range affects aggro, the example numbers depend on the mob your fighting with how it reacts,but otherwise noone contests this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 3:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~~~~~~&gt; Wizard<br />
War is Taunting everytime the button pops and is always at Aggro of Wizard+1,and Wizard always is Treated as having his aggro halved, and you have a happy wizard<br />
 <br />
aggro numbers are NOT created with each nuke,they are static assigned with a player and modifyed by range<br />
i can prove this by having the wizard nuke at range<br />
have the tank hold aggro with a fist<br />
have both stop attacking<br />
have wizard move in and out of melee(with shadowstep to prevent mob from chasing via walk) and watch the mob change targets to the wizard b/c hes near,and back to war b/c hes not<br />
have war taunt 10-15x,and the wizard can walk back and forth to same mob w/o it turning<br />
tada<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 4:<br />
Warrior &lt;~&gt; Mob &lt;~~~~~~&gt; Wizard<br />
Dumb Warrior who only hits Taunt when mob changes targets sits at same aggro while wizards get summoned and killed,and then Dumb warrior again becomes the highest on aggro list and hitting taunt does nothing<br />
Warrior 7001<br />
Wizard 7000<br />
Cleric 2800<br />
etc<br />
soon as you let the wizard die you cant taunt,you acually Need the nuke happy aggro whore to tank better b/c he gives you aggro boosts during the fight<br />
<br />
given the above point that mobs keep a static number of points of aggro as discribed above, the above point shows why the advanced warrior would want to retain someone else to help him do his job<br />
<br />
i have 500 days on a warrior,am oldest on bertoxx,and 200 days on a wizard,they were bumped at 50/60/65,have alot of experience with all facets and classes of the game and how they interact<br />

Thanks for the clarification ... this is pretty much what I've come to assume after observance, and it's good to be told that I'm not blind :).  I intended to add to the yammer that there is more to hate and aggro than one simple list more than to edify. As far as memblur goes, I think I have only noted one successful memblur so far.<br />
<br />
Actually, that's what surprised me about Horrifying Visage ... that the MOBs were /assisting onto me before they became &quot;active&quot; after mezzing.  (The first few that I noticed, for 12 or 18 seconds, as I taunted a few more times trying to figure out what I was doing wrong ;).)  It's nothing near to a clinical test of it, and I'm not going to trouble myself to do so, but it's something I'm going to continue taking note of, and discussing with the enchanters I group with.<br />

Ta!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">From my experience there seems to be a couple different variables in operation here.<br />
<br />
First is The hate list is just a straight up list of all hate generated from spells and damage done by characters to a mob. <br />
<br />
Next for some mobs there is the Rampage list... this is just the order in which mobs aggro on a person in chronological order.<br />
<br />
Finally there is the aggro list. This is a list of targets that the NPC will actually attack,  either by spells or melee. This list is the one that I believe is HIGHLY affected by range. <br />
<br />
Anyone who says range has no affect on a mobs target is not being observant. Velious mobs are notorious for having a highly range affected aggro. get out of melee range and the mob wont hit or chase you, yet will keep summoning your ass, etc.. stuff like that happens a lot. Saying range doesnt affect aggro is like saying range doesnt affect the chance of spells landing, ask casters about mobs you need to cast on from melee range to land, they do exist. It is not all mobs, but there are many...<br />
<br />
Here is my belief as to the way it works...<br />
<br />
When you do a mob affecting action, you are placed on the hate list. this can be proximity aggro (the least amount of aggro possible), damage aggro, spell aggro. All of these add you to the hate list. The order you are added gives your rampage list number. <br />
<br />
So now we have a large number of people on the hate list. How does the mob choose a target? <br />
<br />
Well it could simply choose the target with the highest hate value and attack, thats the simplest method. So the target with the highest hate, could be: <br />
<br />
a) Out of Melee Range <br />
b) A pet<br />
c) In melee range<br />
<br />
Here is where some AI coding enters the equation, If (a) does the mob summon? and is the summon timer up? if so, I bet that the mob summons the target, else the mob will charge the target If (b) The mob checks to see the total number of targets of the list, It has been shown that pets will tank, only if there are limited PC's available to attack, so if there are more PC's on the hatelist than some number X, the mob ignores the pet, and goes to next target. Finally (c) If in melee range, the mob attacks the target.<br />
<br />
So what if not the simplest method is used? <br />
<br />
What if the aggro list is a modified hate list? Where the aggro value is equal to the current hate value, modified by range? So now the hate list has some additional fields. Range to target, and then a modified hate value. I am under the belief that aggro decays on mobs by range at a somewhat exponential rate. There is some critical distance where the hate value decreases dramatically. So now we have the same situation as above, except instead of using the pure hate numbers, we now have an actual aggro number, this number is the value of hate modified by the distance from the mob and some equation. This now leads as above to the same 3 situations above. So the target with the highest AGGRO, could be: <br />
<br />
a) Out of Melee Range <br />
b) A pet<br />
c) In melee range<br />
<br />
Where the same 3 actions as above can happen. Summon, chase, ignore, attack..<br />
 <br />
This also leads to some Mob AI programming. Does the mob summon? Is there a delay from when a target is on top of aggro list to when the mob summons or chases? Again I know different mobs are definately coded differently. Some mobs will break and run in a split second, others will stand and fight summoning transgressors.  <br />
<br />
Want a good example? General Rapeme in PoF. I have tanked him many a times. Not once has he ever run away from me. And I have continuous battle spam of him hitting me over and over, yet he does summon and kill ranger, wizards, necros all the time. If range had no bearing he would have run them down and attacked, instead, he keeps attacking me, until his summon timer up, summons the poor over aggro schmuck, kill him in a swing or two, then continues laying the smack down on me. Yet there are other mobs that will break off of the tank and run a hundred yards to get that silk panty wearing finger waggler. <br />
<br />
Next there is Undead/Animal aggro, where the mobs will target the nearest target, pretty much regardless of actual hate or aggro. If you are closest to the mob you get hit. Intelligent undead usually dont use this they use above, mostly dumb skeletons etc. (taunt appears useless here)<br />
<br />
Last there is rooted aggro. When a mob is rooted, mob will attack the closest target im melee range, while summoning the highest target on its aggro list. Taunt is useless here...<br />
<br />
Want good proof that aggro decays by range? Go to BoT, go to deep, aggro the mobs at the telepad. then port to courtyard, then back to the foyer. No mobs come running... now slowly move towards the teleport pad.. at some range XXX that mob will 'remember' you and come running. this is the critical range for aggro. Another example, is 'out running aggro' if range has no bearing on aggro, how can this ever happen?<br />
<br />
Depending upon how taunt works, Is it pure hate values or is it aggro values, there can be arguments for and against the wait-and-see method of taunting and the mash-button method of taunting. Some mobs one method may work best, some mobs a different method may work best. Is there any reason to believe that there is only one way of being a warrior that is best?</div></div><hr />
