<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did they really finish one of these ? maybe 2, and have something useful at the end ?  <br />
Please tell me yes, or maybe you should say no, so I know that the world hasn't ended and the 4 horsemen of the apocalyse aren't riding up to my door atm.<br />
<br />
More info appreciated.  I will take a look when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this is what i've gathered so far off the allakhazm message boards, curtisy of jrwildcat<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
should of done this long ago but as i posted under unfinished note...I threw in a few clarifications and bunched it together some <br />
<br />
In east cabilis tell drill master vygan &quot;i am a legionnaire&quot; he will respond &quot; yes you are. I see you are willing to possibly sacrifice yourself for the cause. that is good. take this container and hunt down the messengers. They are the ones that relay battle plans to the different tribes. Their combined message will reveal the master plan. Go now and do not return untill you have them all&quot; <br />
<br />
He gives you a &quot;book of bindings&quot; lore nodrop wt 2 wr 0% cap 4 size tiny. <br />
<br />
in OT sarnark messanger found near warsilk woods and another found to wander between that messanger and the fm zone line following path drops unfinished note ids as top left corner <br />
<br />
in WW found a goblin messanger who dropped an unfinshed note looks same as this one all same but id's as top right corner.  mob roams right up to front of gob fort east entrance then follows path almost to first fork in road then returns. <br />
<br />
sarnark messanger in loio paths from sarnark fort back entrance tower across bridge to FM folowing path. <br />
<br />
one goblin messanger in FM paths right up to entrance of nurga not sure where he goes from there <br />
<br />
take the 4 unfinished notes and combine in book of binding and return the an illagible message (lore nodrop wt 0.1 size tiny) to vygan he responds <br />
<br />
hmm... even if the writing wasn't as smudged as it is, i still would not be able to decipher the hidden message. You must now take this and find some one with the ability to read it. I hear there is such a person on patrol but i cannot recall where.&quot; <br />
<br />
well thanks alot mr vygan that narrowed it way down...oh yeah you gain exp not much but exp <br />
<br />
update 2.0 <br />
<br />
found patroler in field of bone /loc 1162 1801 trooper drix &lt;think he day spawn&gt; <br />
<br />
hail him he says &quot;cant you see i am busy on patrol&quot; <br />
<br />
give him an illegible message he reponds &quot;ah, i see you know my true [calling].&quot; <br />
<br />
what true calling &quot;i am the leading authority on restoring and deciphering messages. I can probably make out the message if you can bring me back some [items] i commonly use.&quot; <br />
<br />
what items &quot;i will need your message,a frost crystal, sarnark war braid, and some silver oxide. bring these items back to me and be quick about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
some wher along line he gives you drix's satchel lore nodrop wt 1 wr 0% cap 4 size medium <br />
<br />
no spell check in version 2.0 so stay with me <br />
<br />
the frost crystal is foraged in DL dont ask me where it dont matter where as long as your in DL you can forage it eventually if theres a ranger or druid hunting there they probably destroying them and would be more then happy to hook you up <br />
<br />
the sarnark war braid comes from a sarnark beserker... in OT if you are a traitor and sleep with the enemy dont fear just run around till you see a beserker with a whip in his hand <br />
<br />
the message well you have it <br />
<br />
the silver oxide umm if you know post it <br />
<br />
ill be straight up with this im on the test server i dont know whats live and what isnt but i got some of my clues to this stuff from live servers and im an sk so get the ball moving warriors =) <br />
<br />
edit here &gt;&gt;&gt;oh and for some motivation think i kinda got ahead of myself but thinking i might of accidently stumbled on another step so once we get this figured out i gots a good idea of where to start next step or maybe step after...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've gotten to this point in the quests as well and am now stuck at the Silver Oxide.  I've tried to ask almost every npc in west and east cabilis about the oxide and havent gotten any responce.  Not sure where to get this item, i would guess that it would drop from a new mob in a zone along the lvl range of the OT and DL as 2 of the other pieces for this part of the quest drop there.  Any help would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from lucy's entry for Silver Oxide (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=48007):<br />
<br />
A silver liquid from the lining of a bloodgill scavenger <br />

<br />
Looks like it may be on the bloodgill's in LoIO?  Down there by Veksar maybe, or in Veksar?  Even still, doesnt look like its live yet =( bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Picked up the Silver Oxide and completed the Drix's Satchel.  Once you give it to him, he gives you a Sealed Message to take to Drill Master Vygan.<br />
<br />
Give the Message to DM Vygan and he says:<br />
  &quot;I see you have returned in one piece.  That is good.  You have shown that you are a true warrior of the Legion indeed!  Thak this, and show that you are more than a legionnaire.  I fear we may need just that [before this issue is over].<br />
<br />
He than gives you the Champion Crown Plans.<br />
<br />
head down to Weaponsmith Grugl and ask him:  &quot;How do I forge my Champion's Mancatcher?&quot;  He responds by: <br />
  &quot;To forge a Champion mancatcher a blacksmith of great skill would need a steel rod, a forge hammer, and a forged Champion mancatcher crown.  That crown is forged with a geozite tool, crown plans, a raw crown, and an opal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The geozite tool is earned from a previous quest and was needed to forge all the other mancatchers/pikes.<br />
The raw crown is actually &quot;a mancatcher crown&quot; that is sold by Grugl himself.<br />
The opal is also store bought.<br />
Combine all 4 items in a forge and you get a Champion's Mancatcher Crown.<br />
<br />
A steel rod and a forge hammer are both sold by Grugl.<br />
Combine these 3 in the forge and you get A Champion's Mancatcher.<br />
<br />
Champion's Mancatcher<br />
Slot: Back Primary<br />
Skill: Piercing<br />

<br />
After i finished the new mancatcher, i returned to DM Vygan and asked him about the &quot;before this issue is over&quot; and he responds:  <br />
  &quot;Do not concern yourself for now.  Rejoice instead and seek out Weaponsmith Grugl to guide you in forging your new weapon.  I must speak to War Baron Eator regarding the welfare of Cabilis now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I havent been able to coax anything else out of WB Eator or out of any of the other Drill Masters as to where to start up on the next mancatcher.<br />
<br />
Champion Rakul Dragoman<br />
<br />
ps:  its on the live servers now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Picked up the Silver Oxide and completed the Drix's Satchel.  <br />
<br />
Any additional info you can give on who dropped the Oxide?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any additional info you can give on who dropped the Oxide?<br />
<br />
sorry bout that, the Oxide is dropped from &quot;A Bloodgill Goblin Scavenger&quot; in the LOIO.  If you stand on the shore of the lake where the iksar is standing, head straight out till ya hit the doom.  Once ya hit the doom, take a left towards the North Pillar, i found one there at the base of that pillar.<br />
<br />
I have also tried to find the key words to start up the next quest but havent had to much luck so far, this is what i've found:<br />
<br />
Once you ask DM Vygan about &quot;before what issue is over&quot; he replies with:  &quot;Do not concern yourself for now.  Rejoice instead and seek out Weaponsmith Grugl to guide you in forging your new weapon.  I must speak to War Baron Eator regarding the welfare of Cabilis now.&quot;  <br />
<br />
If you ask him &quot;Who is War Baron Eater?&quot;  He replies:  &quot;The Baron is the supreme commander of the Legion of Cabilis.  Do not bother him.  He has no time for Broodlings.&quot;  Not sure if this is part of the next quest.<br />
<br />
You can also ask Weaponsmith Grugl about a Warlord's Mancatcher (&quot;I wish to forge a warlord's mancatcher&quot;) and he says:  &quot;To forge a Warlord Mancatcher a blacksmith of great skill would need the Titanium rod, a forge hammer, and a forged Warlord mancatcher crown.  The crown is forged with a geozite tool, crown plans, a raw crown, and a black pearl.&quot;<br />
  Unfortuntly it doesnt any clues to where to get the crown plans.<br />
<br />
I also found that if you ask Drill Master Kyg &quot;what warlord&quot;, she replies with &quot;The Warlord's name?  I believe it was. . .wait a minute!  Why does this concern you?  All you need to know is that the Warlord is very brave and serves this Legion proudly unlike you!  If you wish to prove yourself you'll speak to War Baron Eator regarding his findings and give him this to show your worth.&quot;<br />
  While this does look promising, she doesnt give me anything.  I've tried to say several things to WBE (such as I've come to prove myself, etc.) but to with no luck.  Also I am questioning all these guys with the Champion's Mancatcher equiped in my primary slot.<br />

Champion Rakul Dragoman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">kk, after much searching i found where to pick up the next quest.<br />
<br />
In West Cabilis behind the Tower is a vendor named Klok Scaleroot<br />
<br />
(hail klok)<br />
<br />
Klok Scaleroot says &quot;What's that? Oh, I'm sorry I've been preoccupied with the recent [attacks] as of late.&quot;<br />
<br />
(what attacks?)<br />
<br />
Klok Scaleroot says &quot;You don't know?  I thought everyone was aware now.  It seems as though, there have been [mercenaries] doing horrible things to the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
(what mercenaries?)<br />
<br />
Klok Scaleroot says &quot;They wear the bands of Xyzith's troop.  Unfortunately, War Baron Eator doesn't believe that the situation has gotten this bad.  If only someone was able to find a way to [help] show him how bad the issue is.&quot;<br />
<br />
(i will help)<br />
<br />
Klok Scaleroot says &quot;Will you now?  That is good.  Bring me the bands and we will take it from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
at this point ya have to go to the FoB and kill the new Iksar Mercenaries that are spawning around the WW zone line.  They must have a super high ac or have to be melee resistant.  Bring along a nuker as that is about the only way to do any damage to these guys.  Each time they die, they drop a &quot;Bracer of the Chosen&quot;.  These identify with &quot;A Rank&quot;, &quot;B Rank&quot;, and &quot;C Rank&quot;.  You need to pick up one of each rank and return them to Klok Scaleroot.<br />
<br />
(give the bracers to Klok Scaleroot)<br />
<br />
Klok Scaleroot says &quot;What's this?  I see you have the proof that i have been looking for.  Take this note and speak to Drill Master Kyg.  She is a stubborn one but true to keeping the Legion safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
(recieve Klok Scaleroot's note or something like that)<br />
<br />
run over to DM Kyg and give her the note:<br />
<br />
Drill Master Kyg says &quot;What's this you have?  Hmmm. . .I knew there were issues brewing by not of this magnitude.  The War Baron has seemed preoccupied with [other issues].  These issues may be one in the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
(what other issues?)<br />
<br />
Drill Master Kyg says &quot;It seems as though a [Warlord] recently brought back news of Xyzith's fate.  The War Baron could not understand how Xyzith could turn on his fellow brother so.  The War Baron now seeks to find one that can solve this mystery.&quot;<br />
<br />
(what warlord?)<br />
<br />
Drill Master Kyg says &quot;The Warlord's name?  I believe it was. . .wait a minute! Why does this concern you?  All you need to know is that the Warlord is very brave and serves this Legion proudly unlike you!  If you wish to prove yourself you'll speak to War Baron Eator regarding his findings and give him this  to show your worth.&quot;<br />
<br />
(recieve Kyg's Approval and hand it to WBE)<br />
<br />
War Baron Eator say's &quot;Ah, I see you have gained the approval of another.  I suppose you are the one I should [share our findings] with then.&quot;<br />
<br />
(cant remember what i said exactly here but the key words are highlighted)<br />
<br />
War Baron Eator says &quot;It seems we have no clue as to why Xyzith turned against us.  We need you to find where he traveled and get down to hte bottom of this mystery.  Go speak to Geot.  He was the closest to Xyzith. He may remember where Xyzith searched for the legendary metal.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Warlord Geot is found in the LOIO, ask him who is Xyzith)<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says &quot;Warlord Xyzith was one of the Legion's most honored.  He lead his troops into countless battles and never suffered a loss.  He was sent out on this mission many say because his thirst for war had grown large.  He vowed to bring back a metal so powerful that it would bring fear to those that laid eyes upon it.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Where did Xyzith search for the legendary metal?)<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says &quot;I wish I knew.  I can't understand why he turned on us like that.  I have since seen him in my dreams, or rather nightmares.  He is not right and i will not believe that he is the same Xyzith I once knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
After this Im stuck again.  tried asking Geot a bunch of different stuff and couldnt get anything out of him.  Not sure where to start looking for him, though a guildie suggested that it might be in Chardok (ie he remembered something about a metal needed for the greenmist quests that is found there).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some people out.<br />
<br />
Champion Rakul Dragoman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well after a tip on the champions of cabilis website, i took a group and headed over to nurga to kill a few new mobs that had appeared there.  It turns out that this is the right direction for the next part of the quest.  <br />
<br />
Down in Nurga you will find 4 new mobs:  A Victorious Goblin, A Fearless Goblin,  A Challenging Goblin, and A Rebellious Goblin.   These all seemed like they could spawn anywhere in nurga.  My group (avg lvl 56) had no problems just running through killing every goblin we saw till we ran in to the named guys there.<br />
<br />
You are looking for these 4 items: <br />
<br />
Tattered Bracer (identifies as Xyzith's Bracer)<br />
<br />
Symbol of the Legion (A symbol of loyalty given to Xyzith from War Baron Eator)<br />
<br />
Broken Mancatcher Crown (Part of Xyzith's Mancatcher)<br />
<br />
Rusted Shield (Xyzith's Shield)<br />
<br />
if you return to Geot and hand him the items, he will only repsond when you give him the tattered bracer:<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says &quot;This was the bracer of [Xyzith]. . .I can only fear the worst now.  Take this satchel with you.  It was a gift from Xyzith when I first became a Warlord.  Please find the rest of his remains and bring me the filled satchel again.&quot;<br />
<br />
he then gives you &quot;Geot's Pack&quot;.<br />
<br />
now, Geot's pack can only hold medium items, while the mancatcher crown and shield are both large items.  I have 2 ideas about this part of the quest.  <br />
<br />
1.  The quest is messed up and the bag or items was supossed to be a different size.<br />
<br />
2.  The shield and mancatcher need to be repaired some why and that will change the size.<br />
<br />
I have already petitioned about the different size option and later today i will be looking into the second option.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice job !  I have extensive experience with this quest, which primarily involves, doing the newbie quest over and over everytime there is a rumour they will add more.<br />
Last spring I redid them all, waited about oh... 7 months and decided, to hell with it, it's giant sized, a POS, and they will never finish it.  /destroy.<br />
<br />
I have no problem doing it all again, exept for that damned geozite tool.  Newbie backflashes of looking for goblins in WW annoyed the hell out of me.<br />
<br />
Well, please keep up the good work.  I am eager to find out if this really does finish, and if it might be a back item that is worth it.  I unfortunately have probably eclipsed the usefulness of any item that might result, but it would be a great satisfaction to say I have it DONE !</div></div><hr />

Since this person was trying out a new series of quests and apparently did not know of that board with it's singular post mentioning smithing combine failed and eating the parts, perhaps cutting a bit of slack is in order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy, a dev team member made a reference to the above mentioned forum earlier in this thread.<br />
The point in my post was, that doing a little reseach before attempting a newly implemented quest could save you alot of hazzle. SOE are very good at throwing out half finished quests on the live servers and the Champion's and Warlord's Mancatcher quests are no exception to this rule of thomp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">just updating where i am on the quests and how i got there so others can have an easier time than me.  They have changed the two items that wouldnt fit in to Geot's Pack (the broken mancatcher crown, and the rusted shield).  They are now medium items and when placed in the bag and combined they yield &quot;Xyzith's Belongings&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says, &quot;I see you have found all of his belongings.  If only we could find a way to [communicate] with him again to find out what information he found during his journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
(How do we communicate with Xyzith?)<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says, &quot;That is a good question deserving of an answer.  Go seek out members of brood with necromantic origin and see if any of them know how to [speak to the dead].&quot;<br />
<br />
head over to west cabilis and find Master Rixiz in the Tower of Death.  <br />
(Can you speak to the dead?)<br />
<br />
Master Rixiz says &quot;How dare you ask of such a thing! I am a Master of the Necromantic Arts.  If you wish to have me conjure the spirit you must first seek out a traitor to our cause.  His name is Ixzec.  He can be found roaming with a group of renegades in a jungle not far from here.  Return with his head and some items from the soul you want summoned and i will aid you in your request.&quot;<br />
<br />
head on over to the emeral jungle to find the traitor.  From the steps that lead down from the cliff, if you follow the cliff wall to the north you should see a small camp of three huts.  &quot;An Iksar Traitor&quot; is in one of the tents, kill him and loot his head &quot;Head of a Traitor&quot;.<br />
<br />
Return to Master Rixiz and give him both the Head and the Belongings.<br />
<br />
Master Rixiz says, &quot;Ah, this brings me great joy.  Now I shall have full control over this fool in his death.  As for your request, here is what you asked for. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
As you hand Master Rixiz Xyzith's belongings, you see black smoke begin to arise from the cracks in the floor.  In a bright flash of light, the spirit of Xyzith appears in front of you and attack!<br />
<br />
Warlord Xyzith (an iksar spirit mob) will appear in the same room.  He conned indiff to me so i started trying to talk to him though i couldnt find any key words or phrases.  As i look back while writing this, i should have asked him about the metal or where he traveled (DOH!).  After trying a few times to find anything out, i attacked him and killed him.  He wasnt too hard and i had a 65 cleric guildie sitting near the WW Zone line with a heal and a few nukes to speed up the fight.  When he dies (Warlord Xyzith not the cleric), he drops Xyzith's destroyed belongings.  Turn these back to Master Rixiz and he says:<br />
<br />
Master Rixiz says &quot;You should return back to your brethren and give them the news of what has happened here young one.  To make sure War Baron Eator recognizes the truth i shall give you my seal.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then gives you &quot;Seal of Rixiz&quot;.  Run over to WBE and give him the seal.<br />
<br />
War Baron Eator says &quot;What is this?!  This cannot be true.  What has happened to Xyzith to make him so against those he served so proudly?  I must get to the bottom of this.   I shall however reward you for courage against him.  Take this and replace that which you have defeated!&quot;<br />
<br />
He hands you &quot;Warlord Mancatcher Crown Plans&quot;.  Take these and combine them in a forge with a black pearl, a mancatcher crown, and your geozite tool.  They combine to make a forged warlord mancatcher crown.  Combine the crown, titanium rod, and a forge hammer to get Warlord's Mancatcher.<br />

Im now searching around trying to find where the last quest starts.  If you look at Lucy you will see that a new spell has been added &quot;Rage of Xyzith&quot;.  This is probably the proc on the last weapon.  Just gotta try to find where the quest starts at....<br />

Through normal leveling and trying for the Shrunken Goblin Earing, I am indifferent to the Legion of Cabilis.  Was just curious to know if I should even bother working the rest of the faction up since the second to last quest sent you to the necro guild.<br />

<br />
hmmm, well Im sure that if a non Iksar had the faction they could do the quest.  BUT, so far all the weapons have been Iksar only.  If there is a final weapon that we havent found yet, there is a chance that that the final one would be useable by all warrior races.  The final weapons for shamans, sk's, monks, and bsts have been useable by the other non iksar races.<br />
<br />
I would suggest waiting to see if the final one does allow noniksar other wise it wouldnt be worth doing the quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Still Searching for leads to next quest, even tried giving my Warlord's Mancatcher to War Baron Eator (His last sentance was &quot;take this and remake what was destroyed&quot; or some such). Got it back but no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well the final quest has been solved.  Here is the link the the message board that finished the quest first:<br />
<br />
http://p211.ezboard.com/foldunsolve...tart=21&amp;stop=40 <br />
<br />
First off, Im still not sure how to start the quest and there is a lot of text missing from this write up, ie:  We still dont know why Xyzith left the legion.<br />
<br />
Head down to Droga and camp this loc n884, n517.  Kill Stone Seer Kaigek and loot &quot;A Broken Medal&quot; (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=48027).  run back to the LOIO and had this medal to Warlord Geot.<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says &quot;Where did you find this?! No matter.  This was a present i gave Xyzith when he first left on his final mission.  Hmm, it seems as though there is a stone hidden inside of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warlord Geot says &quot;Warlord Xyzith may have fallen inside of those mines but that still does not explain his recent actions.  Maybe the stone will shed light on this situation.  I knew a shaman that practiced the art of alchemy.  Maybe she can recall what kind of stone this is.  Take this stone and search for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
(recieve &quot;a black stone&quot;)<br />
<br />
Run over to the Timorous Deep and turn in the stone to Izatri, a female iksar near the chess board.  Once you give the stone to her, she says:<br />
<br />
Izatri says &quot;Where did you find this?  Never mind that, it doesn't matter.  I hope you didn't have it for long.  This stone has the power to drain the soul of the owner.  In its pure form it can remove curses from creatures, but the one you have has been used already.  In its [dark form] it does far worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
(what dark form?)<br />
<br />
Izatri says &quot;Well it slowly poisons the owner's mind eventually killing them.  But it doesn't end at that, there's [more].&quot;<br />
<br />
(tell me more)<br />
<br />
Izatri says &quot;Yes. . .I'm afraid it also traps the soul of the owner in the stone.  I cannot perform the ritual any longer but I believe there is another that may be able to.  I'm sorry I don't remember where to find him but you can ask around for him if you can't find him.  His name is Liyx.  Take your stone and find him.  You will need it to summon the spirit to finally put him to rest properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
During the conversation she gives you the stone back.  Head over to the FoB and find Liyx, he's just west of the PoK book.<br />
<br />
(Hail)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.  You have caught me before I started another mission. What can I do for you? Do you need my [aid]?&quot; <br />
<br />
(I need your aid)<br />
<br />
&quot;If that is the case you must know what I specialize in. Bring me the stone, a mirrored gem, and two celestial essences. I will do the rest by helping you set your friend free&quot; <br />
<br />
The mirrored gem can be found off of a new mob in the EJ (forgot his name), and the 2 celestial essences are made through combining any word and celestial solvent in a mixing bowl.  The stone is the one you have from TD.<br />
<br />
Turn in all 4 items and he says:<br />
<br />
Hierophant Liyx says &quot;He is here now.  Send him off to the next plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warlord Xyzith spawns in skellie form just a few steps away from Liyx.  He was indiff and DB to me, a 52 warrior.  Kill him and loot Xyzith's Spirit.<br />
<br />
Hierophant Liyx says, 'Now he is free.  Take his essence which is now pure, and return to your Head Master.  He will know what to do from here.  As for me, I have other errands to tend to.&quot;  As Hierophant Liyx finishes his words, he steps into the shadows and departs again.<br />
<br />
Take the spirit and run over to WBE and hand it in.<br />
<br />
War Baron Eator says &quot;I see you have figured out the issue and ended it as well.  The Legion. . .no. . .I owe you much thanks.  It is regretful that Xyzith did not come back to us safely but we will all be in good hands with you here.  Take these plans for the Pride of the Legion, and protect those as Warlord Xyzith did.  Speak to Weaponsmith Gurgl to learn how to make your weapon of great power.&quot;<br />
<br />
(recieve Pride of the Legion Plans)<br />
<br />
head to Weaponsmith Gurgl<br />
<br />
(How do i forge the Pride of the Legion?)<br />
<br />
Weaponsmith Grugl says &quot;You must be special indeed to have gained the Baron's prize possession, the Pride of the Legion.  To forge Pride of the Legion, a blacksmith of great skill would need a titanium rod, a forge hammer, and an unfinished mancatcher.  The unfinished mancatcher is forged with a geozite tool, a blue diamond, Pride of the Legion Plans, and a Warlord's Mancatcher.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you do the first combine for the unfinished mancatcher you lose the geozite tool, while on the second combine the forging hammer is returned to you.<br />

The item does proc unlike the last weapon, and it is Iksar only.<br />
<br />
So there is the final quest.  For some reason i dont feel the same satisfaction i felt when i finished the iksar cudgel quests.  There are 2 reasons why.<br />
<br />
First reason is cause Im still not sure why Xyzith left the Legion.  Was it the stone that caused him to go crazy?  if it was why or how did it end up in the medal that Geot gave him?  Is Geot a traitor as well?  Maybe some of these questions will be answered if we find the actual begining npc and the text that he gives.<br />
<br />
Second reason is because it is way to easy.  Almost all of these quests could be solo'ed by a lvl 65 warrior.  I could have solo'ed almost all of the parts except for the Nurga and Droga sections.  The final mob was dark blue to me and he died in under a minute.  I had with me a 65 necro and a 65 monk.  I think the necro nuked 2 times while his pet, the monk, and i were attacking, which killed him.  I remember doing the Shaman Cudgel and that was a really hard mission (the last one).  Having to track down 4 different items from 4 different zones, then having to head to Howling Stones and summon a version of Venril Sathir, Kill him and his friends was very hard and most of them couldn't be solo'ed.  The final fight with VS i died 3 times and had to do the quest over again before i finally killed VS and got my final cudgel.  The final mob here i could have solo'ed him.  Just kind takes out the epic feel of the quests when it is so easy i guess.<br />
<br />
Well there is the final quest and my comments about it, pls feel free to send me a tell in game if you need any help or have questions.  Also im pretty sure im the first one on Quellious, (finished up the combines around 10pm est, 6-6-04).  Congrats to everybody who worked on the quests and who has and will finish them.  :D <br />

Seriously, though, congratulaions on solving the quest, a solid progressive one like that is really something to look forwards to throughout. Do we get to see a screenshot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rakul Dragoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yea i think it needs Shissar bane as well.<br />

also check out my magelo to the left to get the link.<br />
<br />
I'll try to post a picture of what it looks like equiped later tonight when im back from work, but it looks pretty much like all the other mancatchers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Quartz428</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">my one problem with the weapon is that it is not as good as the easily attainable SotBS... now i posted over at the SOE boards about possibly raising the dmg on it by 1 point... making the weapon 15dmg/24dly...<br />
<br />
I don't think this would be too powerful (as 24 delay is a pretty slow weapon MH'd) but would out DPS the SotBS and give us iksar warriors a special litle toy <br />
<br />
(on that note too ... why can't all the other races use it???)<br />
<br />
Anyway the link to my post is -------&gt; Here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Warriors&amp;message.id=652)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dunno, but if they didnt change the dmg / dly on epics (14/24), I doubt they would do it on a less difficulty quest, which, someone already stated, almost can be soloed.</div></div><hr />
