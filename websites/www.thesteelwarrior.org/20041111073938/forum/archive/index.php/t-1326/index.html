<br />
My character is a 57 Barb Shaman, and a guldie was forced to stop playing EQ and left me his account with a 60 Barb Warrior.<br />
<br />
I have another PC, and am thinking about duoing the 2 myself. I really don't know much about playing a warrior other than what I've seen him do while we were playing together.<br />
<br />
Can you offer any advice?<br />
<br />
Truthfully I am getting amazing exp with my Shaman in full groups in PoP, maybe I should just continue the Shaman in full groups and put the Warrior on hold for a time.<br />
<br />
I know there is more to playing a warrior than hitting the attack key, are there any guides out there that would give me some basics on Warriors, their Disc's, which AA to aim for, etc.?<br />
<br />
I would love to duo the 2, but don't want to lessen the exp I am getting on the Shaman in PoP to do so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">playing the shaman, you should just keep going at least to level 60. The level difference there makes a huge difference in ability to Slow plus the buffs you can provide.<br />
<br />
Then, if you are serious about playing the warrior, why not get the warrior into a group with &quot;perks&quot;<br />
<br />
A level 60 Warrior with an out of group slower, buffer and dot'r is better than a level 61-62ish warrior without it :) Especially if the Shaman can land the slows.<br />
<br />
Head to PoV and try that out for a little while if you want to get the Warrior to level 65 or grind out some mega AA's.<br />
<br />
I always seemed to get a group with that setup (I had an ench or Druid for more DPS) Over time, if you are doing a great job, they may just let you bring the bot into the group. (remember, as the 6th person, the bot takes no exp away from the others - you just have to play them as well as a 6th person)<br />
<br />
Either way, you are now killing in PoV with the DPS of 7 people instead of 6. You will be blown away by the amount of exp you receive here (Trust me on this one :) )<br />
<br />
That's about it. That would be my suggestion. You will have some tough times LFG'ing at first, but I would love to have a Tanker and a Free shaman in my group in PoV any time :)<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure when Shammys get their Partial Complete heal, but as soon as you do you have the perfect Duo group. You really wont need anyone else to start up a group, more will just add well... more :)<br />
<br />
I believe there are some guides out there but you will catch on quickly on how to obtain aggro from your Shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Natasia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm in a similar situation.  My main is a 61 shaman, and I have recently acquired a 64 warrior.  I'm really looking forward to learning the warrior class, but the problem is she is currently naked.  I'll be able to twink her a little bit, but are there any recommendations on camps I could duo for some gear and/or cash?  I have no intentions of playing her in a group or bringing her along on a raid until I feel more comfortable in a non-shaman role, so I'll have to stick to what a shaman/warrior can take down together.<br />
<br />
Any recommendations and advice you have to share would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
btw...shaman get their gimp CH at lvl58 :)</div></div><hr />
