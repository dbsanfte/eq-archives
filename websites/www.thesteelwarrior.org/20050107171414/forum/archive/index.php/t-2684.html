<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrigan</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on your server's market.  On mine (Luclin) there are plenty of other options than brell/underfoot that are as good if not better overall for the same price or less in some cases.  The only piece of cultural that I haven't really looked into replacing are the 2 bracers I wear.  I've had them for almost 15 levels now and haven't found anything reasonable to justify upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timbot</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most pieces on my server go for around 3k-4k, the bp and greaves 7k. it just seems that compared to fierce heraldic, or helanic tundra, underfoot is bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally the only reason I would ever get Brellium is for the AC that's about all it's good for IMO.  The stats are pretty slim on most of the pieces and on my server it's not cheap so waste of money I think so.  It should hold you over though until 50ish or so I would think so.  I had the boots once 30AC boots isn't to bad :)</div></div><hr />

It's still useful for a warrior if you don' worship Rallos Zek (Like me) due to its high AC, but I already have upgrades in mind for what I really want.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timbot</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">are there any alternatives from underfoot thats around on the same page but a little better for dwarf warriors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact is that Brellium, as well as other non FH cultural, is as good or better than any of the Velious quest armors. On most older servers, prices are also very inexpensive so you can get some pretty good gear for a pretty good price. If you want to upgrade Brellum, you are going generally going to have to get NToV+ armor. If you are looking for tradeable, Ornate is the next step up, with a few single pieces here and there that are marginally better. Off the top of my head, I cant think of any upgrades to Brellium that don't cost quite a bit more than what you could get several pieces of Brellium for, at least on my server. If you are short on funds, the bracers and the legs are the best pieces. I wore those until I upgrade to ornate/crystallized acid bracers.</div></div><hr />

I picked up the boots for the 30AC 5 dex and 30 hps...<br />
The previous Dwarven items were really nice...<br />
i wore the older BP until i picked up a cobalt BP in about the same price as the new Dwarf BP..<br />
i still wear the legs until i can find a replacement.</div></div><hr />
