My question is soon as i get epic i will have the aa's to finish the no riposite aa's from off hand. I have noticed with the 3 levels I have of it now i can safely use 2 in MPG now. I was considering going with epic main hand BoC off hand or maybe ... hammer and basically retiring my wailing staff totally removing aug for the rare days im not mt'ing. <br />
<br />
In xp groups with guild I keep agg fine I cant goof off but I manage. In groups with higher end time guilds I find I am forced to use the BoC / Hammer combo to maintain agg and still struggle a bit at times.<br />
<br />
Currently we are flaged for elementals but not in time and just started raiding the elemental mobs (acually havent had are first mini's raid yet even). Killed RZ twice no BoW. With epic coming for me soon not sure if I even want BoW now.<br />
<br />
Setting at 568 aa's and going up fast im sure i will have max aa's offensive and defensive soon so just curious if my days of 2h are done for now or if BoW is still worth getting. Also i know it was usually common practice to put slow weapon in off hand but would i want epic in off hand with BoC in main? I would think with riposite issues id want slow in main (and better dps) and fast in off hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also currently my thoughts are anger 3 for epic and maybe stun proc. Or two anger 3... I have a vampire aug from MPG that was roting so i looted it 75 dd / heal. I have always been a straight hate / agg whore. I think I have been in one group where i wasnt mt. By far I tank most raids or back up tank. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be great thank. I have tried to research the site as much but kinda after a if you could only have this what would you do that related to me. Also if anyone knows of better weapons available to me at my level of play, i would love the advise. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moss</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'd go BoC/A3 - main and Epic/A3/Yak3 in offhand. Retire the hammer and staff. Oh and selling the extra A3 aug will give you enough points to buy yak3 (760 guk theme). Don't bother with blade of war. At this point say a Bloodfrenzy would be a much better pick up for you to replace the BoC. Otherwise just wait for darkblade.<br />

This probably belongs in the bunker.<br />
