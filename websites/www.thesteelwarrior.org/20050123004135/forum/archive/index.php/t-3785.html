<br />
The guy was an iksar warrior with epics in 2001...<br />
<br />
Not a ton of them running around usually. It showed him carving up Chardok,etc...<br />
<br />
Just wondering what server that guy played on :)<br />
<br />
On Drinal there might have been two epic'd Lizards back in the day.  At most :)<br />
<br />
anyone ever heard of the guy?<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
Iksar Overlord<br />

Not sure who it is, but wouldn't have been that hard.  Most of the warriors in Afterlife on Mithaniel Marr had their epics by the end of that year, and had quite a few high level lizards (read 50's) on our server as well.</div></div><hr />

The reporter was asking the guy questions and he didn't even look up from his screen to answer and he didn't respond for a few seconds, lol.</div></div><hr />
