<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i'm so tired of the paladins! thiers like 80:1 for every other class and u can see it in IF. So i decided to teach these mother paladins a lesson, i asked every lvl paladin from lvls 40-47 to come out i was lvl 46 still hehe and i started to duel them outside IF, the really funny thing is that these pallys ethier sucked really badly or something heres what i did.<br />
<br />
Charge pally and gain 15 rage, hamstring pally and start whackin tried to heal so i changed to def and used shield bash, then he tried again but with immune i bandaged up for about 2 seconds giving me 300hp and ran back and as i was running changed to beserker and intercepted him, stunned for 3 seconds i changed back to defensive and when he was outa stun i disarmed him then he started to run around lol, so i changed to battle stance and used OP if i could and with hamstring on him rend+deepwounds all it took was like 3 more hits and right when he got his weapon back i excuted him, repeated with about 6 pallys and won all the fights. When will pallys learn their awesome at 1v1 PvE but when thier healin powers are gone thier so fucked, especally when MS is on them and if they do heal they only get about 50% of it and while thier immune i will bandage up and since i got my bandages high enough i can heal for some pretty nice Hp 150-600 at a time the higher i get the stupider the pally is hehe!<br />
<br />
I know druids and warlocks can also own pallys only thing a pally can own well is a hunter but then everyone can own a hunter lol and mages ( sometimes) hehe<br />
<br />
well if u haven't seen it or the title im ranting on pallys and how over rated they are, only thing that keeps then alive or up thier is thier healing ablitlys if a warrior could heal which they can with bandages then we would be more than gods we would be Super Gods LOL, pce<br />
<br />
-Warriors Rule Pallys Suck- bring It On U Holy Piece of S***-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You fought some newb paladins = (<br />
<br />
First off they can Bubble themselfs and cast spells.  Say you both are down to about 30-40% health.  They have MS effect on them and you are rdy to bandage.  They bubble themselfs and heal.  With the bubble, it removes the MS effect AND you cannot interrupt them.  When you go to bandage, they hit consecration which is a dot and interrupts YOUR bandaging.  They can basically cast a long big heal in their bubble.<br />
<br />
The get two bubbles and a Lay Hands as a last resort.  Ive only seen lvl 60 warriors with full crit gear and an AR able to beat them easily.  Anything under that the paladin should have the advantage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My pally fights go either 1 of 2 ways<br />
<br />
1) They suck and I pwn them.<br />
<br />
2) They're good, in which case I usually only win if the get sloppy, or I get lucky with crits.  good pallies have only a bit less dps than you do, but effectively about 3-4 times the hp.  You also can't hamsting them, because they can cure/prevent it with a blessing.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you're beating them down, more power to you.</div></div><hr />
