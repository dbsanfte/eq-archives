<br />
In other news, your friendly editor has now tanked both the Itraer Vius and Vindi down to the dust, and he and his guild got the AoW down to 18% on their first try.  Next time, your brave purveyor of all things brief will have CS2/3 and some LR, and that bad boy's going *down*.<br />
<br />
C'mon.  You all remember what it was like back before you were oober.  :-)<br />

Still looks like using a shield does not change AC softcap the way developers said it did.  Darn those parses for spoiling our dream.<br />

Rehash of old news on Taunt, but Brabble gives a good pocket summary of good taunting strategy.<br />

Gunnar makes the *very good* point that looking ahead to upgrades that are likely to be available, and holding on to your DKP until the optimal point, gives the best results.  &quot;The thing is availability and long term planning is &gt; applying a standard ratio to all drops.&quot;<br />
Brael has always gone AC over HP, and likes the results.<br />
Phantron says to use Bulwark of Alendar against procs, not Evasive.<br />
Apolyon says: &quot;GoD + Bard + Psalm of Veeshan + Singing mod + Singing mastery 3 + Amplification = 500MR&quot;, with which he resisted every single one of MM's procs.<br />
Many people feel evasive gives better overall mitigation, but defensive reduces the risk of lethal spikes.<br />
Some mobs, like Aneuks, are designed to require Evasive/make Defensive useless on them.  Know your mobs.<br />

Much good debate on AC vs. HP--go read the original.  Quick summary: once you can't be one-rounded, AC is king.  AC is harder to get than HP; HP goes up steadily with each expansion, but AC doesn't seem to by as much.  Frodlin says that AC helps all the time (by reducing healing load), but HP only helps in the crisis when you very nearly die.<br />
The change from a CHeal-dominated world to a splash-heal dominated world makes HP less important and AC more important.<br />
Kailyn points out this is only true when your HP are far enough above the 7500 CHeal cap that clerics can safely land CHeals for full.<br />
Emilia says AC gives more efficient tanking, HP gives more room for mistakes.<br />
Phantron points out that at the high end, the best items have both high AC and high HP.<br />

<br />
Fitemore: Get AETaunt as soon as possible, and WA1 quite soon.  <br />
Varalla: AETaunt not what it used to be, get defensive AA's first.<br />
Apolyon: all defensives, WA1 or 2, AETaunt<br />
Romul: &quot;be a better tank before trying to be the tank&quot;.  Amen, brother!<br />
Fitemore: WA1 right away, defensive AAs do no good if the mob isn't hitting you.<br />
Romul questions the value of WA1, Fitemore points out it's .6 procs per minute more (with a double-aug'ed dual wield setup).<br />
Apolyon agrees with Fitemore since WA1/2 are so cheap.<br />

Daabu says, of Delegate MA levels 2/3: &quot;It allows you to designate 3 different MAs for their targetting. /assist raid only works on the first MA, though, I believe (I never use /assist raid because the radius is so small I never really get it to work)&quot;<br />

Frogloks look cool, and ogres are boring.  <br />

Yoda wants a warrior AA to increase the effect of heals on warriors, but thinks clerics should get AAs to make DI better.<br />

Rangers like melee-heavy groups because their buffs do more good with more melee types.<br />
