<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some help.  I dont wanna spend money on something I'm going to replace in 5 levels, which is why I'm asking for help.<br />
<br />
I havent upgraded anythign since lvl 52/53.  My armor totally stinks.<br />
<br />
I've been earning some money and am about to blow a wad, I'm trying to avoid wasting my money...<br />
<br />
I'm about to be lvl 60 (very, very close).  My AC is almost 1100.  I'm suffering from a really crappy BP with only 30 ac, a low end set of greaves which only has 20 ac, 10 ac belt, 15 ac bracers, etc.  None of this stuff has good resists or anything.  ONly a couple items are actually worth a darned, like the cobalt arms and helm I wear.  the only piece of armor I have that might be kept at lvl 65 is my thurgadin quest gloves, like 24 ac iirc.<br />
<br />
I'm about to the level where I can go do HoT.  My guild has been doing HoT but I'm not sure how good they are at it, yet.  Was thinking along the lines of&quot; what's the point in upgrading to a 45 AC BP when I can get something similar as a drop/quest.<br />
<br />
Forget my weapons, they are 'okay' i think (frosty/snowchipper).  I'm thinking I should upgrade haste and try to hunt for armor.  I've got a 21percent golden tooth for haste.  Should i blow my 60k on 41 percent haste do you think?  And work toward armor by earning it via drops rather than purchase?<br />
<br />
Or should I say forget haste upgrade and go for a good BP?<br />
<br />
I dont wanna spend money on something I'm going to replace in 5 levels.  thanks for the advice</div></div><hr />

<br />
well you said that twice so i will adress it cause it seems important to you<br />
if i read your post correctly in 5 lvls you wil be 65 so maybe i dont understand what your trying to say but i cant think of anything you can get for 60k that is &quot;end game&quot;<br />
<br />
a magelo would help greatly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont do magelo.  Never can manage to sit down and deal with it.<br />
<br />
thanks for the clarity.  I didnt realize end game equipment was so expensive.<br />
<br />
The last five levels went by pretty quickly.  I leveled 53 to 57 in 4 days, for example, 18 hours a day.  I'll be 65 by the end of august I'd think at the very latest (probably much sooner).<br />
<br />
<br />
Is 41 percent haste considered end game?  I believe I can get a 41 percent haste item for around 70k.  If so I could upgrade that and not worry bout replacing it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How?  I can't think of a single droppable 41% haste item.<br />
<br />
Unless you're on FV of course..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh!  Ok, now I see another thing I'm wrong/confused about.<br />
<br />
36 percent is the highest droppable haste item right?  I think so (cloak of flames) and that's not 'end game' quality right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any haste item 32% or higher is all you really need.  Speed of Vallon is 68% haste, so it should put you at the 100% haste cap with one of those items.  Speed of the Shisshar (enchanter epic) is 66% haste, so a 34% item will put you at the cap.<br />
<br />
31% items - Runed bolster belt<br />
                    Soulscream belt<br />
                    That new mask from ChardokB.. <br />
34% items - spiked seahorse hide belt<br />
36% items - Cloak of flames<br />
                    Cloak of crystalline waters<br />
<br />
Any of those will do just fine for haste.. being at 99% vs. 100% haste with enchanter buffs doesn't make any difference at all.<br />
<br />
The soulscream belt goes for 30k or so on Prexus, and it has reasonably good stats.  Pick up one of those and you'll have 30k left.<br />
<br />
After that, you can either buy Skyshrine HoT armor MQ's with the left over cash, or depending on your toon's race/religion, pick up some of the cultural stuff available to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you filled my void of misunderstanding with an accurate explaination of what i was missing on the haste thing.  Thanks Less.  I'm going to shop for 31%+ haste items.</div></div><hr />
