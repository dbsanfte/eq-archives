<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite is a great tool, but the most effective part of it, especially during long fights, is the DoT portion.<br />
<br />
You only get 400 Hate initially, and 700 from the dot, that's about 2/3rds of it's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I had noticed on raids that my Incite would get overwritten often. At first I asked around my other warriors, thinking they were using Incite as well. No dice.<br />
<br />
Then, a few raids later, I actually turned on all spells, not just group, and tracked down the culprit.<br />
<br />
Dart of Immobility, a 15% BS Mod Dagger that about 4 or 5 of my rogues seem to use, dunno if Pri or Offhand.<br />
<br />
This daggers proc's what seems to by 150Hate Reducer + 55% Snare.<br />
<br />
And overwrites incite, for some reason I can't figure out.<br />
<br />
The procs name is Arachnae Venom.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is logical to assume that the proc from Fellspines Tail will also overwrite it.<br />
<br />
What is not logical is the &quot;why&quot; portion. The part that does not stack is the instant portion of +Hate. Apparently whatever debuff it leaves on the MOB retains this info however, making it a stacking issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, I've bugged and feedbacked it. I'm not familiar with Fellsphines Tail, but it seems logical that any Direct Hate + Long Term effect would also overwrite it.<br />
<br />
I can not imagine that this was intended, either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also had this happen to me last night with the Mith Marr dagger.  Also should be noted that using Incite cancell's out the snare on the dagger's proc as well.  Did a /bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was under the impression that Dart of Immobititly was from Mith Marr... I could very well be wrong, all I really know is a lot of our Rogues have DoI's, and Mith Marr has been very generous in giving us BS Mod daggers. And I'm way to lazy to look it up tonight.<br />
<br />
Either way, this is something that needs /bugged and feedbacked as much as possible. From the exp group warrior to the raid warrior, from people who might find it once in a while to people like me, who rarely get 3 ticks out of Incite cause of all the rogues wielding this thing (Last count I got was 5, could be more, that was 5 out of the 5 who were online), something that destroys about 2/3rds of Incites effectiveness for no real reason needs looked into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using Stonestance on Tallon Zek in plane of time is a bad idea.. one of his AE's has a snare component that overrides it, apparently.<br />
<br />
When Stonestancing on TZ twice it would shut down after a few seconds... defensive worked fine however.<br />
<br />
If anyone else can confirm this let me know pls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall Gurunt means I think. Not monk disc. Just so no confusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Confirmed this is happening with a rogue in my guild last night.  However he says (and some others agreed) that the proc is resisted a lot and boss level mobs resist the proc almost all the time.  Ironically we were on the way to Mith Marr to backflag, and to cap it off, MM dropped two more Darts of Immobility :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh my bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes it is confirmed in Lucy... TZ's snare ae won't stack with it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrinia</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So has anyone heard about a fix for this problem?  I was in a BoT group last night and the rogue had a DoI and my incite wore off everything single fight.  Fights only lasted 30 seconds or so.  But this would be a big issue if taunt fails 4 times in a row and the mob is beating on someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fix no... can confirm it's still happening though. Doing /feedback /bug when I log in each time.</div></div><hr />

Sorry we didn't catch it sooner.<br />

DOH .... have you /bug'ed it yet ?  <br />
<br />
Just wait it will be fixed in under 3 years~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felwin</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will both stacking issues be addressed?  (Stonewall not stacking with the snare from TZ)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of this morning the only thing Incite does not stack with are the other Provoke abilities (according to lucy changes from test)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actully I bugged this last night<br />
<br />
In Vex Thal the curse overwrites stonewall and makes it drop <br />
<br />
Hopefully that will get fixed as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't stack with Bristlebane's AE either:<br />
