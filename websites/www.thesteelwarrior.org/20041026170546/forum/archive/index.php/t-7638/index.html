<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry for the swearing in the title. But is there any way to counter Rapture in a duel? (its unresistable vs PC's) can be chain recasted from long distances, and is a total pain in the rear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are the potions you can buy that put a small dot on yourself for awhile still in game?  If so it would chain break it, effectively making it worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try to get Rabies on you somehow before the fight.<br />
<br />
Warlord's Tenacity would break it too at least for its duration.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there's really no way around it.  Bard's Ancient mez is even worse since it doesn't even cost anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to PoK, buy a crimson potion or something like that, if buffs you HP then DoTs you over time 2 min duration or so.<br />
<br />
use that and the bullshit problems turn into a very funny joke the next time that chanter walks right up to you and starts doing funny emotes :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i never tried myself... but does it still break mez if you out-regen the dot? it does only 2 hp dmg per tick...<br />
<br />
i once dueled an enchanter and just called it quits after 1 hour or more of being mezzed and resisting her lame nukes. would've had to catch her unattentive (was taking place in GFay near spires) and oneround her basically.<br />
<br />
pvp in eq makes my head hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">doesnt have to do with loosing health persay... just the fact you have a damage over time on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ashrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well it must still work, I have a vah kerrath neck and couple of the aa regens and i used the crimson potions (reckless health effect) and i drove this enchanter crazy in the arena.  The effect can't be dispelled either, so they can't strip it off of you.  It won't stop them from landing a mez, but it will keep them from mezlocking you.</div></div><hr />

rapture has a long recast time.  prior to item extension and mesmerization mastery, you could mez about 1.25 targets.  with all of our dmg being magic based, we're as effective as warriors are in duels =p  Now if they'd let us charm and fear again, that'd be the money money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get beat in your little 200pp game in the arena the other night frogger?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're going to apologize for the post before you even submit it, then don't submit it :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AThousandYoung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think Crimson Potions can be out regenned, but it has to do with spell regen being different than worn regen or something.  I think the Crimson Potion counts as negative spell regen and if you have other spells up that regen you so that your spells net you a positive HP gain, then Rapture will stick despite the Crimson Potion.<br />
<br />
That means don't have any regen buffs on, but you can have regen AAs and equipment.  I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taneldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have noticed when useing my right clicky 2hp/mana (Phylactery) regen that my life accually ticks down then ticks back up....which was very odd...but it did not break mez when i mezzed myself. =( so much for that idea</div></div><hr />
