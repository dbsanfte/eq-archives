Unfortunately for you, dozekar isn't up immediately on server reset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I've got to say after delaying the latest patch for an additional week so it could be more throughly tested, either their testing is wildly inadequate (they missed quite a few very obvious bugs) or management is pressuring for very very fast release and not encouraging ever more accurate estimates.<br />
<br />
Fighting 1 mob would have been sufficient to reveal Warriors were getting Coup de Grace on mobs that were too high level. In a week of testing (the reason we were told for the one week delay) this didn't occur? Testers aren't sufficiently familiar with the product to notice? Only black box testing was done?<br />
<br />
Is it possible that some SoE employees haven't gotten the message? EQ is having a few problems - do your job.<br />
<br />
There's a very old software development bromide: We can do it fast, cheap, and right - choose one. C'mon guys, your entire customer base is rooting for you to succeed.<br />
