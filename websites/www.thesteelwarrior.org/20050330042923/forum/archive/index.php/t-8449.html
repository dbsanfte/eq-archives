<br />
We went to PoD last night to make our first attempt on Grummus, we zoned in and moved to castle we were at Gryme in about 30 seconds,  Pulled Gryme and Dead in less than a minute...  <br />
<br />
Here is where it get screwy...  RL loots the key we clear the rest of the trash to open the door to get into the rest of the castle and tries to use it and gets &quot;This door is locked you are not holding the key&quot;<br />
<br />
We tried all of the different ways of opening a door with a key, on his cursor clicking door, not on his cursor clicking door, on cursor typing &quot;U&quot;  all to no avail...<br />
<br />
Anyhow has anyone had any issues with this?  Was kind of a buzzkill when we couldn't get to Aramin and Grummus  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Putting key on cursor and pressing &quot;U&quot; should have worked unless that person remapped the keyboard.  Our GL usually loots keys like that and he is an enchanter so shouldnt need a rogue for it.<br />

<br />
Not that he didn't have the skill but that the door could not be picked.  <br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for the response...  <br />
<br />
Anyone else that has actually opened the door?</div></div><hr />

Grrrr, was a very disappointing night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had the samething happen to a raidleader on a Grummus raid I was on.  He /petitioned and GM said have the key on your cursor, hit 'u' to use item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This door seems to be bugged, the same thing happened my raid on 28 July.<br />
<br />
<br />
From our Raid-Forum:<br />
<br />
I have no idea why I couldnt open the door. I stayed in front of it, I walked back and forth, nothing worked. When not having it on the cursor it says: the door is locked and you are not holding the key. When having it on the cursor and clicking it says: this item cannot be dropped, sold, or traded. Using the 'u' didnt have any effect...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, somehow they managed it to open the door, but it was done without using the key.</div></div><hr />

If you get the &quot;this item cannot be dropped sold or traded&quot; message that means someone or something is standing between you and the door and the game thinks you're trying to trade it to them. Have everyone stand far behind the keyholder, pets included.</div></div><hr />

Aparently the sweet spot is pretty freakin tiny on this door.  And yes, he was using &quot;U&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FYI, you will get this message if your skill is too low or you need a pick lock skill mod item.  For example, the door in Dragon Necropolis will give a rogue this message at max skill (210) but can be picked if they have a Cheirometric Lockpick Device (+3% to lock pick).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waran Bloodburner</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Grummas door has always had a small target to hit with the key to get it to open. With the DX9 changes and the way its effected certain zone portals, I'm sure that its what has happened here too. The small spot to 'U' the key is probably down near the floor or you might need to try it up and down from either side of the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did Grummus this weekend.  Had to do the old Paineel entrance thing...  hold the key on my mouse, and click U while at the door to open.  Worked fine.</div></div><hr />

I've loted the key every time and haven't had any problems opening the door so far.  Try about face height for a wood elf - that must be the sweet-spot. ;)</div></div><hr />

That's good enough punishment =P<br />
<br />
However the best spot to open Grummus' door is basically where it hinges (The West, or &quot;left&quot; side of the door).  I usually just hug the wall, look at the door, and hit &quot;U&quot; that way I'm out of the way for the droves of guildmates who go to run inside.<br />

But wow, I'd be angry as hell if my raid leader didn't know how to operate a door and the raid was called off =P<br />

Jesus fuckin' christ, give us at least a LITTLE credit will ya?  Do you really think we're all so stupid as to not know how to open a damn door?  Or maybe there's just a little bit more going on here than you're aware of, eh?</div></div><hr />

Hey Venthos, <br />
<br />
Why don't you read my post thoroughly before you spout off at the mouth.  Your comments are totally uncalled for.  Why would being in a family guild be a bad thing anyway?<br />
<br />
I would really like to tell you to F*** O**!!!!!!!!  But, I wont at this juncture.  <br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone else who actually had something constructive to add to my question.</div></div><hr />

My guild did Grummus this afternoon (Sunday 10 October), and we had no problem opening the door.<br />
<br />
Person that looted the key had it on curser and pressed the U key to open it.</div></div><hr />

Wow, son, check the attitude at the door.  Just for your own reference, you don't yet have the magelo-epenis to be cocky about your non-family-guild, k?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, this door is dumb. A group of us were doin epic 1.5 shiz for someone's epic  and they needed to go behind the spider area. took us a while to open the stupid door, hehe but we got it open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have had that issue in the past as well. (And no, we are not exactly new to doors....or even that one).<br />
<br />
It was fixed when he left the zone and came back and tried again. Worked just fine after that.<br />
<br />
So kill off the key holder and rez em back in. Should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One additional bit of information that may help.  Be in first person view when you open door.  I have been on a Grummy raid that had door issues, and leader tried everything (about 6 months ago).  I went to Allahs and saw other posts by people having issues, and someone posted there you have to be in first person view (I have no idea if this really has an affect, but it worked for us.) . Therefore to summarize:<br />
<br />
1.  Be in first person view<br />
2.  Have key on cursor<br />
3.  Hit the &quot;U&quot; key<br />
4.  Be next to the door, and have people stand back<br />
<br />
<br />
  I too find the negative posts annoying.  Someone posted a simple request for help,  please do not insult them or assume they are idiots. (But, I guess if they didn't, I would not find the theads so entertaining and never visit this site, lol)</div></div><hr />

Yep pressing &quot;U&quot; or other will NOT work in 3rd person, maybe have been your issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're an idiot.  The type of guild you're in is no measurement of your game knowledge.</div></div><hr />
