<br />
The first room with mobs has 3 slimes. The outer 2 slimes are PHs for Red Mass (slime boots). Hang a right past that room and there is a mosquito in the corridor. He is PH for Diseased which drops mosquito ear. Hang a left from mosquito. This last room has a slime close on the right, and a slime in the far back left. That far back left spawn is green mass PH for the girdle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks much!  We spent a few hours pulling the wrong rooms.  =(  We got a swirling red mass (no boots!) and a diseased mosquito (crappy wand!), so at least it wasn't a waste.  We got the ring off the swirling red mass, nice melee ring, why the heck can't warriors wear?  =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, sometimes the spawns there don't want to give up the goods. You'll be glad to know that the girdle is the green ooze's common drop so at least you shouldn't have to weed through the crap drops with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually there are 2 PHs for the green mass, if you have a good group u can get them both if you arent trying to kill the boot room too. if you go right instead of left to get to the first PH, the last slime room also has a PH. you could probably kill the entire area if you had someone pre pulling but would need to be a super group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corpsed</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget to watch for Yaeth page 73 right side and Tohoran pg 22 which make RGC and Divine intervention.  They are both very valuable and drop in sewer area frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the advice.  Our usual group is 61-62 cleric, enchanter, shaman, warrior, so not great DPS.  We were able to keep two rooms clear easy, but a third was pushing it.  Pushing it is fun sometimes though, but my wife gets kind of pissed when I pull when she's low on mana.  Each of us boxes two of the chars also.  The cleric needs divine intervention, so that is good to know!  Thank you.<br />
<br />
One other question, how frequent are the named spawns there.  I've spent a ton of time in other zones and typically named spawn on average 1 in 5 or so.  Is that about the rate in CT as well?  It's also really good to hear that the girdle is the common drop...  getting rare drops takes forever and it's not a particularly exciting camp.  But a few of our casters would sure like those boots.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was there with a group last week and we kept all of the rooms down there cleared for about 8 or 9 spawn cycles and saw not one named from any of the pool rooms.  I have seen as many as 5-6 named within a couple of hours, but I have seen many more times when none of the named bothered to show at all.  Just have to love the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say in general named here are rarer than in typical exp zones. I farmed the crap out of this place when it opened up and I would say it averaged one named every 4 hours. And that was clearing red, mosquito, and green PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I kept clear the two red slime spots, the mosquito, and the green slime, I tended to see one piece of loot per 2-3 hour session.  Of course, it is seldom the item you want, but it's usually sellable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after just one placeholder I am now the proud owner of a HRG.  Thanks all!<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on the Amygdalan Chain Mask?   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks much!  How does the difficulty of the spawn named compare to sewers?  Sewers are pretty easy for our group (62 war, 61 shm, 61 ench, 61 clr), but I'm not sure how difficult 4c is or if we can pull all the mobs to keep the top tower clear.<br />
<br />
Also, how rare are the boots?  1 in 10 named?  1 in 100?  They go for 200k on Stromm.   :eek:  I might have better luck getting the casters back to CT if it is for the boots first, then we can move to 4c.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't do the sewers much after they added the ring (originally the boots dropped everytime). I'm not positive, but if I remember right it's probably something like 33% chance on the boots. In my experience it is much harder to get him to spawn than it is to get him to drop the boots.<br />
<br />
I haven't done the 4c area since PoP was released so we were all 60 at the time. That being said, it was a good bit harder than the sewers because the mobs had nasty AEs, couldn't be stunned, effectively mezzed, and hit harder. With the 61+ spells, newer equip, and aa, I think it wouldn't be too bad though. I'm sure if you take it slow, you can get up to the top, but it won't be a fast process. I'd wait till you get Pacification though since there are some areas where you have to get multiple without it and it may get hairy with only the 4 of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, fast answers!  This is almost like chat.  Awesome info, thanks.<br />
<br />
I think we'll wait until the enchanter hits 62 for pacification.  I think wake of tranquility goes up to level 60 tho, I will look and see if the mobs are higher than that.  But we will be 62 before too long, so it's np waiting.<br />
<br />
One other question, is it easy to invis there?  What's the best way to invis there?  Are there see invis mobs on the way?<br />
<br />
We got the red slime after about 3 PH's.  I am sure we were lucky...  There was a guy there last night when we were camping the HRG, he was soloing the boots spawn.  We stayed just over 2 hours and he didn't get a red slime, so I am sure we were lucky to get the red to spawn so fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you know the right route through the maze (I can't remember it anymore), you can invis to the bottom of the pyramid area. From there, I am 99% sure there are a lot of see invis mobs so you'll have to fight the rest of the way. If you decide to take it slow to learn the area, there are some named that spawn at the bottom floor of the pyramid. The brown lizards in the corners are PH. And the raptor roamers can spawn named as well. When you first come in and take a left you'll see 3 lizards in the corner. The middle one is the PH for Adept which drops Fleshgrinder and Lizard Bone Earring. It may be worth hanging out there to see if you can hang with the area, and you'll have a chance at some decent loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of making a whole new thread on CT, I figured I'd just ask in this one. What kind of group is necessary to camp the barbed rubicite pauldrons? Interested in picking these up because Torm Wenrar never shows his face on Morden Rasp, and these are better anyway. I'm 58 and can, if necessary, round up a full compliment of 65's to help me out, but would rather not impose upon guildies and take people around my level for exp. Also could the same group hold camp on the boots/earring/girdle?<br />

Forget the name.  As far as I know single group cant hold 4c and sewers since they are too far apart.  Group of 65's could do either camp separately with no problems tho.</div></div><hr />

I've been farming droga lately when not raiding, and CT looks like a step up in the loot department if I can do it. I'm geared as shown in magelo, shammie has luclin/early pop, some velious stuff for the most part.</div></div><hr />

Also if one group is going to 4C, sewer is not really safe apparently... /hide.</div></div><hr />

The problem you'll run into with just a war/shaman is that the complete healing brown lizards will be a serious pain in the keister.  Especially since there are like 7 wanderers that go around the temple...getting a long 1-2 lizard combat with a ch'er gets old fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, took a group in there not really knowing the difficulty to expect. We were a little light on DPS seeing as I invited anyone in my guild who wanted to come(65 cleric  was among them so I knew we wouldn't really be in too much danger not deep in). Anyways, these mobs have tons of hp, so we ended up being able to clear CY before respawns started catching up with us. I think I'm going to head in next time with a preset team of 65 cleric, 65 chanter, myself (61 warr), 65 beast, 64 monk and one random class (perhaps another 65 beast). Just to be clear, when you say 4c, on the allakhazam map located here: http://www.eqatlas.com/ctmap.html it would be the area marked 2, the archon pyramid, right?<br />
