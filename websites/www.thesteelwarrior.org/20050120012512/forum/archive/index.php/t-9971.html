<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately I've been playing with my Greatstaff of the four winds quite a bit in WoS and the likes to cut back on reposte damage, but in all honesty im nowhere near satisfied with the dps of the thing, or the proc (kinda lame imo).<br />
<br />
my question is this, what is the best 2 hander attainable by a warrior at my level of the game? (magelo below) <br />
<br />
I had looked at the egde of envelopment, slightly more dmg/dly and 20ac looks good. <br />
<br />
I'm not interested in a GSoT or anything thats not a substantial upgrade to my GSo4W hp/sta/ac/ratio wise.<br />
<br />
I have seen some nice 2 handers come out of MPG and i have a 8.6k hp 2.2k AC SK friend who has done most of the group trials and would probably bring me along on one for loot if i asked.<br />
<br />
I also dont mind quests or abandoned zones/camps/boring shit.<br />
<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Proc's alot on raids when i'm a DPS tank but doesn't draw nearly any aggro. Normaly hits anywhere from 125-250 Crits from around 250-400ish and with gimp savage onslaught disc last  night I cripped for 853 &amp; 978. not too shabby IMO. I however do not have a GSo4W to compare it to however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doirche</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well technically the Blade of War (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17722) from RZtW is pre-elemental and IMO is still one of the best 2H aggro weapons the game has to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anathema from Inny would make a solid tanking 2hander. Muramite Bladebreaker is another that would work. Would want to put an agro aug in either of them.</div></div><hr />

Frost I'm hurt I bust my balls to get you that Trident in RS and ya don't even use it =p or put it in your magelo. Slacker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Blade of War would definately fit the bill ( granted if you get it on your first run i'd kill you :D ); but overall if you can get your hands on a Edge of Envelopment than that's be the way to go. NO raiding, no blahblah...just either buy or hunt/exp/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see why you are even worried about DPS. That seems to be a big concern for you vice aggro generation.  EoE is a good wep for DPS and would be good to use if you are not tanking. It's not the best for aggro generation. If you are concerned about ripostes, do your AA that Mitigates offhand ripostes (Slippery Attacks I believe) and stick to your one hander setup when you are the MT. I only use my EoE when I am not tanking. I will say, the EoE does a good amount of damage. I get normal crits for up to 500ish.  Pretty impressive actually. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what you guyt suggesting Edge of Envelopment are smoking.<br />
<br />
41/31 &gt; 44/34<br />
75dd proc + Proc mod &gt; 100 dd no proc mod<br />
<br />
EoE has more stats and 20ac, but it will be less dps and less aggro.<br />
<br />
Sarc, the 2hander you presently have is probably the best dps ratio you'll find pre-EP (excluding the BoWar).  If you can get the BoWar then go for it.  I'll assume since you aren't raiding EP's then BoWars are not coming in the near future.   GSoF4 is nice.  EoEnv is nice.  Neither will give you solid aggro.<br />
<br />
For 2hander aggro there's always the GSoT, but there's also a new stun blade which sort of looks like a mini-BoWar out in GoD atm (the name escapes me, but not the 30/32 weapon).  I'd honestly shoot for that weapon.  If you have high level friends willing to pump you through a MPG trial, i'd keep my eye on that pikestaff as well.  The proc on it is only a straight DD, but its better than time ratio would make it one hell of a dps-aggro weapon for your level of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you want more aggro, get WA5 and after you can think of a better weapon. For now you can't express aggro weapon to their full potential so don't bother change your setup.<br />
<br />
EDIT : and don't buy a EoE, get a Muramite bladebreaker, or an Anathema, or BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best one I have seen that is &quot;reasonably&quot; obtainable by what I think your group/guilds capability is would be the Ornate Blade of Revolution from Tiorpat Tornwing in The Ruined City of Dranik.  My guild tried this event but it seemed to be broken at that time although I have known guild members to kill him with one group.  If you can figure out the event you should be able to do this and eventually get the 2 hander.<br />
<br />
This weapon is close to the BoW in ratio and has a DD/Stun proc.  Shouldn't be hard to get peeps to try him, he reportedly drops Runes.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

Not a major upgrade but one none the less and not too many people have one that i've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Norg'tal would be great but Wailing coral staff would be equal to your GSo4W.</div></div><hr />

This is the one I've been looking at, but at 275K on Karana, its not enough of a DPS upgrade over my GSot4W to buy it.<br />
Plus with the higher delay, I kinda worry about losing aggro with it. Bazu bellow and GSot4W with a lot of AA do a pretty good job with aggro, but a higher delay might strain it to the breaking point without a stun/hate aug</div></div><hr />
