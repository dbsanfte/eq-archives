<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Paladin Epic 1.5 has an effect that is used like and has the same outcome as Defensive/Evasive by another means. It provides burst survivability enhancement. With the still in the game 120% healing benefit bug instead of the intended 20%, it's too powerful.<br />
<br />
While Defensive does not appear in the Paladin Top 10 Issues List (they just ask for a narrowing of their &quot;gap&quot; with Warriors), the SK list has:<br />
Due to most boss mobs being tuned for defensive in raids it puts too large a strain on a guilds requirement of Warriors.  Awhile ago Druids were given better heals allowing them to fill in some for Clerics lessening a guilds dependance on that class.  The same thing should be done with Knights giving us a defensive-like disc lessening the necessity for a guild to field 6+ Warriors per raid for the bosses. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
When Knights were having difficulty in GoD, they demanded - Adjust the content or give us Defensive. (They listed a multitude of defensive discs and abilities during this disussion)<br />
<br />
Brenlo announced SoE's Gates (tanking) solution. <br />
Conor is correct, much of what is asked for by Paladins and SKs is specific to warriors and that will not be changing. Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. The fact that warriors can tank the harder content in Gates, while the knight classes cannot, does not mean Pallys and SKs are broken, rather that warriors are better tanks and that the content is too challenging. There is supposed to be a disparity between the tanking abilities of warriors and knights. Paladins and SKs want to be able to tank in the single group encounters, and they are right, they should be able to, but not at the expense of other classes.<br />
<br />
So now a plan is in place to adjust the content so it will still be tough for warriors, while also being achievable for the knight classes. Currently this is our solution. We will not be adding defensive discs or abilities to the knight classes. We will be tuning the content so that it is a challenge for everyone and excludes no one. We want a group to be able to succeed with a warrior, shadow knight or paladin as a tank.  <br />
GoD was adjusted and OoW does not have single group content requiring Defense/Evasive/Furious or Weaponshield. SoE embarked on a policy that was fair to Warriors and fair to Knights.<br />
<br />
1. Content will be designed or adjusted so all three Plate Tank classes can tank all single group content.<br />
 <br />
2. Knights will not be getting defensive discs or abilities.<br />
 <br />
Warriors accepted that single group content would not require Defensive/Evasive despite that fact that this was at our expence<br />
Because we believed that this would eliminate a need to give Knights defensive discs or abilities.<br />
 <br />
Any SoE upgrade of Flame of Redemption beyond the intended 20%, should fall well short of being able to mimic defensive discs or abilities.<br />
<br />
The SK request for defensive discs or abilities for the express purpose of reducing the number of Warriors guilds recruit should be denied outright.<br />
<br />
If SoE does give Knights defensive discs or abilities (and it seems to be headed down that path), then the entire &quot;Gates Solution&quot; is at the expence of Warriors.<br />

<br />
2/3 as good as stonewall<br />
<br />
(If flames lasted 3 minutes and a mob could not kill the paladin between heals, which on an unslowed mob is a maximum of 3 attack rounds + procs and on a slowed mob averages 2 attack rounds + procs)<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this, of course, has been pointed out to you before, in the last place you started going off about the effect being too good, where everyone but uh, 3 people said it isnt as good as that even, and one of your supporters had grouped with a paladin that had it for a good amount of time and had no idea it was even broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flames as it currently is fails the manastone test (will someone without this item be undesired if people with this item are in existance), fails the defensive test (will this item allow an undergeared player to tank content he should not be able to), and is rarely used (i use mine an average of twice a night and am constantly doing RS and mpg group trials + random ikkinz trials for shielding augs)<br />
<br />
<br />
Brenlo's quote &quot;Paladins and SKs want to be able to tank in the single group encounters, and they are right, they should be able to, but not at the expense of other classes.&quot; says it best.  They are not ruling out giving knights a form of def/eva or furious/ws at any point in time.<br />
<br />
SoE was attempting to make knight tanking abilities + spellbook + discs be equivalent to warrior tanking ability + abilities + discs.  They got it mostly correct, but it does need tweaking still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when Flames was at +120% instead of +20% of course it was overpowered because you can do 7k Remedies which obviously make Paladins quite a bit easier to keep up than just about anyone else.<br />
<br />
I certainly don't hear Paladins saying 'yeah I can tank this Flames of Redemption is up'. Being able to heal  20% better is at best as good as taking 13.3% less damage (i.e. healing double is sort of like taking half the damage) except it isn't as good as taking 13.3% less damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brenlo also said, &quot;....much of what is asked for by Paladins and SKs is specific to warriors....&quot; and &quot;not at the expense of other classes&quot;. Some of these things are doing both.<br />
<br />
2/3rds of Stonewall for a minute is pretty powerful actually. Very powerful if you concider that Stonewall or something that can mimic it is &quot;warrior specific&quot; - too close to a Warrior Defining Class Ability that should not be shared.<br />
<br />
When you get right down to brass tacks, you could argue that if it was 3/3rds and lasted 3 minutes that Warirors still have ummmmm errrrrr ahhhhh dual weild to distinguish themselves from a Paladin that forgot to buy any of his spells.<br />
<br />
Single group content has all been tuned or designed so Defensive/Evasive/Furious aren't needed. All Warriors when they are not raiding (and there is a large population of Warriors that don't raid) find themselves being essentially that Paladin who forgot to buy any of his spells.<br />
<br />
I'll point out the answer, but if SoE does it, it will be used against Warriors (I'll explain why after):<br />
<br />
Make Defensive/Evasive/Furious unneeded in the single group environment (they already have) and Warriors should get equivalent value in utility. Not just right-click items or procs - real use anytime utility - like stuns, Root, effective burst DPS and dare I say buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
I don't want to play a hybrid, I especially don't want weak Beserker capabilities like Tendon Slice.<br />
<br />
(how it would be used against Warriors)<br />
Isn't it crystal clear? SK's are already asking to *cough* share our raid boss mob tanking role. Having even crappy utility compared to your superlative spellbook would be used as the final justification for *cough* sharing our raid boss mob tanking role and completing the transformation of the Primary Tank to a class a n00bie would delete and re-roll after 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
EQ should not be tranformed into EQ2. Not unless SoE is determined to depopulate it and send players to WoW or the few not feeling betrayed (amazing word to use when discussing a game, neh? But that's how attached players get to their character and it's Class Description after putting 5 years into it.) to EQ2.<br />

What's so wrong about that? .... if you want to tank a raid boss, make a warrior and try to twink your lousy crappy weapon selection to actually keep that mob on your ass for the entire raid shit thingy kill mob stuff.<br />

If you want to have aggro lock for everything in the goddamn crappy lousy shitblablablablabla game, make a pally or shadowknight.<br />

I don't either.  Flames is still 120% by the way.<br />

<br />
SK's have been hurting for a while.  They are subpar dps, lost a lot of pulling jobs to bards when FM was introduced, offtank worse than warriors do in situations where it matters that someone is offtanking a mob, offtank worse than paladins when you just need a body on it, and annoy the piss out of people when they try to use any group spells other than zef.<br />
<br />
A lot of classes have been hurting.  Slow immunity/resistance and a lack of things to do on a raid besides buff, malos, buff and spot heal that arent shared by other classes hurt shaman.   Enchanters turn into buff bots in far too many situations, good for tash at least.  Rangers just buff and sit in a corner until a ranger item drops or WS is needed, whichever comes first.  Paladin lost a lot when better aggro generation was given to warriors, and with a lack of quality upgrades to our castable heals.  Ect, ect, ect.<br />
<br />
I'd probably be pissed if I were a sk, being expected to keep up with a warrior with 5 stun procs and  Bazu Bellow with their current aggro spells.   In many situations now, it takes LONGER for knights to plow tank mobs than it does warriors, and that was true back to the days of clearing Fennin ring, when we realized that the way we cleared it with warriors was faster than how we cleared it with knights (and we had the 3 best paladin and best sk I have ever seen  doing that).  Our Guild Leader  was offtanking in Uqua with a Yak'd Gradulek + incite,  having knights try to pull aggro off him just to make a point about how stupidly overpowered warrior aggro generation was.  When he used anger dbow + anger eoe + stone proc, it was impossible.<br />
<br />
I wonder what its like with yak'd BBB + anger3'd thunderclap + stone proc. <br />
<br />
I assume SK's want a real raid role, much like all the non warrior/cleric/bard/wizard/rogue/mage classes do.<br />
<br />
<br />
The one thing I dont get is: Why would you use a paladin/sk as a raid tank over warriors even sharing discs anyway?  Warriors are stunned far less (or none), better over time aggro, and obviously have the abilities to get aggro in the first place, or mobs would never get killed.    Replacing that with a class who has to chaincast hate spells, mixing in a group heal or group taps when needed would not make much sense at all.  I tanked CT and Inny in time by going alt f5 ant f6 alt f7 alt f5 alt f6 alt f7 alt f5 alt f6 alt f7 alt f5 alt f6 alt f7 alt f5 alt f6 alt f7 until the mob died, sometimes going altf3 for the hell of it.  We do less damage and take more damage even with the exact same disc, which nobody has asked for.<br />
<br />
I guess I just dont see the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior = EQ1 big bad raid boss tank<br />
Pally/sk = Tank for anything before the big bad raid boss evil mob<br />
<br />
What's so wrong about that?<br />
<br />
The fact that warriors can do the knight role as good as knights while the knight spellbook doesnt come close to making up that difference in terms of tanking OR raid role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">much of defensives power comes from reducing the mobs spike damage, combine it with 1 minute duration and your really really really stretching to call it defensive, its a very nice clicky but seriously do you just go around trying to find things that knights get that piss you off? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welp.You may define your role differantly.Warriors are intended to be the strongest tank.Knights give up some tanking ability for utility.Thats why they are hybrids not pure tanks.Our knights given equal playtime get all the same groups outside of raids.During raids we use them a lot.With our warriors and knights who have attended the majority of raids for the last 6 months there is still overlap in tanking strength.Our strongest knights still out tank our weaker warriors who have been with us that long in all except for disced tanking.<br />
<br />
I prefer to use Knights as MA's on most trash that don't require our heaviest tanks(like top 4 wars).Their aggro on engagement is far superior to a warrior and aid in good placement ,mob control and fast caster dps assist with little worries.My strongest add control tanks are knights.They work hand in hand with warriors and chanters to do a better job by far than could be done without them.I place high value on Good knights and would like more of them.I don't need any more wars really.Knights do many things very well and can contribute well to a raid force in many ways.They just don't tank as well as an equal geared warrior undisced over time on hard mobs.Discs when available make a bigger differance.Overall survivability differance should be obviosly significant.It is when you add in all the discs.Our knights have great raid roles and good value to us.I enjoy having them in groups as well and they have np getting the same groups I do.<br />
<br />
Overall tanking differance includes our discs.This was corrected last year to correct a bad imbalance with Knights having closed the tanking gap too far.Why unfix it and close the gap again?If knights need fixing it can't be in overall mitigation or warriors will need to be readjusted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunnar identified the basic tension.<br />
<br />
The Warrior role is 'unmatched survivability vs. the most brutal mobs' and Defensive/Evasive/Furious is the method used to insure they are unmatched.<br />
<br />
The role of Knights is not to be able to be Warriors vs. the most brutal mobs. To be able to add tank, offtank mobs that aren't brutal, and provide a host of other value to raids. And not having Defensive/Evasive/Furious is the method used to insure they can't be Warriors (with Spellbooks).<br />
<br />
It's that simple. Many Knights disagree with the Tank hierarchy and endevor to see it undone by arguing for the one thing, burst survival enhancement while still being able to tank, that insures it's maintained.<br />
<br />
Defensive/Evasive went into the game in Kunark. If you've logged in and played since then you can hardly claim you didn't know about it and reserve still the right to reject it.<br />

I know you guys aren't sk's or anything ... but care to look at the new straight aggro spell they get?  A SK in full aggro generation mode these days is a wicked thing ... to the point where i can no longer touch it with a 10 foot pole ... and neither could the few friends i had who owned your precious dbow + eoe combos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladin hits his Taunt button and it succeeds - the Paladin is now at the top of the aggro list. At least until the next proc (could take 30 seconds or so). A couple of stuns in that time and he could build a healthy lead.<br />
<br />
But I love those &quot;can't take aggro from a Warrior&quot; stories. Could you come back and tell us the one about not wanting our raid role? Dat one's me favorite 8).<br />

The Most brutal mobs isnt more than a small handful of mobs, or it wouldnt be &quot;most brutal&quot;.  Its fun games of semantics when both sides dont even know what Soe hgas stated, and I dont think SoE knows what they mean either.<br />

<br />
They may have been the best paladin and SK that you've ever seen doing that, but it doesn't look like you've seen too many paladins and SKs at work.  Any paladin or SK that can't take aggro from a warrior sucks, plain and simple.  They have the tools to easily take aggro any time they want, they can cast spells that build aggro any time they want.  All a warrior has is &quot;luck&quot;.  Lucky if tuant succeeds, lucky if they proc.  There is no excuse for a paladin or SK to say it's impossible to get aggro from a warrior.  They can take aggro buy pushing a few spell icons, completely controlable whenever they feel like pushing them, at any point they wish.  &quot;Plus&quot; they have the same tuant skill that warriors &quot;rely&quot; upon.  The incite line is completely worthless without a successful tuant first.<br />
<br />
...&quot;Especially&quot; with the newer spells...<br />
<br />
1800 hate for 60 mana, 1.5 sec cast time, 6 sec recast.  Any SK with this spell that can't take aggro, and keep it from any warrior, no matter what they're wielding, sucks at playing their class, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
I swear, the best SKs and paladins out there were warriors first.  I know many SKs and paladins in-game, I read many of other SKs and paladin's posts on the various boards, and the one thing that holds true for the large majority of all of them, are other classes constantly recognizing things that knights could do that would rediculiously improve their play.  As a warrior, I know exactly what my pally and SK friends need to do to over take my hate when it's needed to do so... but they never even think to do it.  All of my pally and SK friends who were previously warriors, have warrior characters, or an assortment of other classes, know exactly what I know about the pally and SK classes and are &quot;aggro machines&quot; anytime they want/need to be.  Just like if I were to play an SK or a paladin, no one would ever be able to keep aggro away from me.  The knight spell books are WAY POWERFUL, there are just far too many knights out there that don't use them.  Well I know exactly what that spell book can do, and I'd use it.<br />
<br />
I can't count the number of times my groups have had an add that the SK was suppose to take care of, but instead it beats down our cleric.  And here I am saying &quot;dude, if you would have just cast &lt;insert the highest darkness line they have&gt; and one &lt;insert their highest terror line spell&gt;, you could have kited/tanked that mob all over hell and it would have never batted an eyelash at anyone else in the group&quot;.  Only my friends who used to play other classes before playing their knight ever realize this, and make wicked knights that make the other warriors in the guild look like shit.<br />
<br />
It's not a hard concept to understand at all, and I don't understand why more pure paladin and SKs (pure as in having not been a warrior/whatever first) don't understand it.  The ability to pick the exact moment you can lay down a large amount of raw hate, will always beat random chance.  These raw hate spells, be they paladin stuns or SK raw hate spells, aren't mana drainers either.  I mean Christ, 1800 hate for 60 mana on the new SK spell. 1.5sec cast, 6 sec recast.  That's chain castable.  No decently equiped SK will ever run out of mana using this.  Some flowing thought and KEi are standard running setups nowadays.  Throw in druid mana regen and bard song on a raid, and there's no way any warrior should ever out aggro this chain casting SK.  Fights don't last 45 minutes anymore.  The SK is not going to run out of mana.  He's gonna keep hate &quot;easily&quot;.  And he doesn't even have to swing his sword to do it if he didn't feel like it.<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard for pallies and SKs to see this?  Why are most knights I meet completely blind to their own classes capabilities?</div></div><hr />

A warrior with Augmented DBoW and EoE + saryrn stone / vt gloves is putting out 1345.4* hate via procs per tick and with bazu its 1445* per tick + 600 initial.  A paladin in the same situation, chaining  their 3 fastest stuns* is doing  1400 the first tick, 1020 the second, 320 the 3rd, repeating after that.  Add +100* hate and a much better chance of interrupt to the paladins 1st, 7th, 13th, ect ticks if you are adding a dd stun.<br />

* This does not take into account stun aggro being raised  by any significant degree on any mobs.  If it does, it  scales the exact same amount for EoE (1.8ppm) + ykesha (4.23ppm) + bert stone (~2ppm) + anger (both portions at 4.76ppm) and would only not increase for anger3 (under 1ppm) and bazu.<br />
<br />
The ability to pick the exact moment you can lay down a large amount of raw hate, will always beat random chance.<br />
<br />
A paladin stun with no dd is 700 hate at 1.0sec cast 18recast.  A dd version is doing 800 at 2.0cast and 24.0 recast.  The BEST aggro generation for a paladin is a group with damage on them and a high amount of FT  + mana regen buffs to group heal on a constant basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its why knights do very, very poorly on a transition of a named mob.<br />
<br />
...&quot;Especially&quot; with the newer spells...<br />
<br />
For the spells you listed, this only applies to SK's.  <br />
Also, for the record, said incidents were before those spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">now that pal's stuns are on separated timers you can't chain cast them. but you still have your heal spell. Clerics parsed their heal down to 1:2 ratio thus it's a small aggro generation. however you can chain cast your fast cast spells (two around 900 heal below lvl65 and one above 1100 heal at lvl 68) and have close to 1000 hate in one tick.<br />
and before you jump on me, I will repeat what Torrk said : we speak about getting aggro fast in 'Oh shit!' situation (when adds jump on healers/CC), not for MT (thus we don't care of the second tick).<br />
<br />
we, warrior, have only incite for such situations, and it caps at 600 with a refresh of 30s (and AoTaunt if we are close anouth and if it's up and if hate bonus aren't to bad).<br />
in MT situation, a top end warrior in full hate generation can create more than 2000 hate by tick and sustain them a very long time. SK could probably do good hate generation but can't sustain it, and pal runs out of mana even faster in full hate generation, while doing less aggro than SK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior:  all around highest defensive capabilities with an offensive/dps perk.  Other than that ... zero utility.<br />
Shadowknights:  Primarily offensive tank who wields the strongest aggro on command and a very small amount of utility.<br />
Paladins: 95% of the time the most group friendly tank. Group buffs, solid tanking ability, self heals and group heals.  Decently strong aggro ... but here's the kicker ... you wield it on command.<br />
<br />
<br />
SK's finally have their own perk which is stronger aggro than yours.   On the whole your utility and power far exceeds theirs still.  Stop whining. The world does not revolve around you and nobody gives a shit.</div></div><hr />

Any Paladin/SK who is saying they can not take aggro from a warrior even with DBotW/(eoe/jos/insert high aggro offhand here) is full of crap. If i want aggro i will have aggro over a warrior cept for the .1 seconds right after his succesful taunt then it will be right back to me after i hit it with 3+ stuns to rebuild a buffer in the next 10 seconds. As for the stuns being linked thing well that is actually not a big deal for any paladin who should be dealing with warriors with DBoTW's etc. For max aggro setup i use akera GoD ancient and piety and Divine Stun. Recast time on piety is 12 seconds same for chaos and also 12 seconds for akera and 9 seconds on DS. I also aug the weapon im gonna be using the most with Yakesha as its not much of a loss of damage going from 150 dd to 125 dd (actually i find yak landing for full more than the disease dd i had for a while due to the fact magic is the most debuffed resist usually since malo line and tash line both hit it while neither hit disease resists) and it puts out a nice aggro boost so if i proc a few times when not expecting to i dont have to bother to cast as many stuns as normal.<br />
<br />
 I just think most paladins or SK's who have a problem out aggroing the warriors (especially non DBotW geared ones) just dont use the tools they have to do so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup.My aggro is much more competitive now,but,  Barraind thats the biggest load of bs.In clearing trash a good knight can always out aggro me.The only equalizer like it always has been is taunt.On a boss mob that I've been on awhile my hate output is more siginificant.Knights can still pump out more hate tho  and there is no contest early in a fight without taunt unless the knight is slacking hard,dumb ,or the warrior is crazy lucky with procs.<br />
<br />
I and the warriors I assign tank duty to have aggro because the knights let them have it.It's a bloody rare thing to see a trash mob incoming to the raid not get locked down immediately by our pallys when they MA.With a warrior MA it's common to see early debuffs/dps casting result in pong.Theres no contest here.The only reason I use warrior MA's for trash is for practice and survivability if stuff hits really hard.A good knight makes clearing way easier generally.Not to mention locking down mezzable stuff.Wtb more good knights.</div></div><hr />
