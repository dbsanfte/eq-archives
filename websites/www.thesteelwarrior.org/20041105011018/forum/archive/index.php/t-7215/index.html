<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">as the title indicates.<br />
I created an Ogre warrier, Weeper.<br />
My favorite zone is solb.<br />
he just dinged 32 or something &amp; I know i can start beating up Kobolds etc.<br />
<br />
But everytime I zone in to Solb (Nagafens Lair) I end up in dev box, a room with object names, /loc numbers &amp; a bat flying around . <br />
<br />
I have to use a gate potion to get out.<br />
<br />
The first time , i had a guildee nerco summon my corpse, after i let the bat kill me &amp; then a guild pally ress'd me to my corpse.<br />
<br />
I have tried a double shammy shrink, still puts me int a dev box.<br />
I have tried an ant potion, still into a dev box.<br />
<br />
I am royally pissed, no response from gm's to get me out on any occasion.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea's of how i can safley get into Solb. I wanna kill there!!!<br />
<br />
I have created a Dorf warrier &amp; have thim to lvl 16 already, but i really wanted a no stun Ogre warrier, Fugging SOE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try deleting the zone files and repatching them?  If that doesnt work you might try zoning in from Sol a side?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hungri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my ogre has the same issue, its common in all of the old world dungeons that you are forced to the duck position after zoning in. dont think it is a user file issue. this happens to my ogre on multiple computers, one reloaded after it started. for sol b, u have to enter from sol a side and shrink. cazic you have to have a gater succor you once you are in the dungeons dead area, to play in cazic. have heard other ogres on my server with same issue. never got any response back from a GM &lt; suprise &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tickbox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It could be an old model/new model thing. Try using the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Playing a troll i've had a few sticky spots.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin doors used to be a major pain in the butt. A wiggle here, a wiggle there ... used to barely squeeze in.<br />
<br />
Don't remember what fixed it though. They're much easier these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have never had this problem zoning into sol b and I spent MANY levels powering gorlab there pre-kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NhuakofBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Of course there were no issues PRE Kunark....   this is a  DX 9  issue and as stated by one of the GM's on brell,  they know of the  issues and are working on them.   I would suggest  /bug'ing it  any  time you  think of it.   All of the old world dungeopns have these  DX9 issues  yet in certain places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for replies.<br />
I decided to trash the Ogre &amp; start a Dorf warrier.<br />
<br />
I decided that with the state of the game &amp; dx9 currently, we are so SNAFU<br />
and any support response is totally non-existant, that i will stick to what i know<br />
works. <br />
for you lowbies or Youngies:<br />
SNAFU = System Normal All Fugged Up<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/mourns death of Weeper<br />
<br />
luckly I haven't had much issues with getting stuck, first time yesterday loged on and was under world, hit /rewind and I was put up in the sky and fell for 20k and no clue where my corpse was.<br />
<br />
LMM raid stated and they were in HoHB already, so I /petitioned and went to raid nakid.<br />
<br />
Was interesting being on a raid, knowing if I got agro I would die in 2 seconds.  Lucky we won, and I got my flag )).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nokatsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From Chat, there is a Stuck Characters Room. Go to that chat channel and let them know you are stuck and they will move your character to EC/WC zoneline. I did it when hopelessly stuck in a LDoN and the response was fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That happened to me once zoning into Sol A from Sol B.  Never in Sol B, though.  It never happened again, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To bad you got rid of the ogre. Ogre warriors are the best HP warriors in the game. Also the fact you can bash  and not have a shield. Also the fact you cant be stunned from the front is rather nice. I am an Iksar and at times i wish i was an ogre. BUT I am undergeared and yet i am still real close to my ogre counterpart. I am glad that all thees Expanshions came out giving Iksars a better chance at being a tank.  Right now with tribute and a furious bash shield along with my OSOW(ObsidianSimatarofWar) I sit at 6036 unbuffed. <br />
My Magelo became a (I wonder if) have not yet changed it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stratys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my first guess would be to go to your options window and toggle the &quot;auto-duck&quot; feature.  This feature was added very recently, and I could see how this might introduce problems on zoning in -- if the computer senses you need more room, it forces you into a ducked position, and this is probably running afoul of the buggy zone geometry/collision detection code they have in place right now.<br />
<br />
If you have the feature turned &quot;on&quot; (this is the default when the added the feature I believe), turn it off. If you have it &quot;off&quot;, you might try turning it on and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ogre warriors are the best HP warriors in the game<br />
<br />
Cough. Doesn't matter what race, just your stamina and gear. It all evens out at the end. Just get stalwart endurance if you don't like getting stunned :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well , the truth is I retired the ogre, I did not delete him just yet.<br />
my Dorf is now lvl 30 &amp; the Ogre is lvl 32,<br />
Tonight I am going to try the &quot;auto duck&quot; thing.<br />
I have it turned Off atm, I will turn it on &amp; see if I end up in that Dev box.<br />
If I enfd up in the Box, i will just delete him.<br />
<br />
I know it has zero to do with current downloads. Solb is my Favorite zone &amp; have no difficulty with any other race or character. Just the Ogre, so I know I lose all shrink spells when he zones, it must be because he does not auto duck that is causing the problem, I will test this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Who gives a crap about the HP?Its all about the CHA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had this happen to me in that zone a couple of years back...basically after i got ressed into a wall.  I'm thinkin that you are colliding with the zone geometry and getting sent to that safe room...this is probably a &quot;feature&quot; of the collsion geometry patch last month.  I think all you can do is /bug it and not use the main door of Sol B...try the alternate entance (s) from Sol A.</div></div><hr />
