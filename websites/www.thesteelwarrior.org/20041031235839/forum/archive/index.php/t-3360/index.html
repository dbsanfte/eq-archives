I just hit level 46 and I'm starting to think about participating in raids, specifically I'm looking at Naggy and Vox raids as a good starting point.  I understand that in order to do them you need high resists (particularily magic and fire for Naggy).  Can you suggest good, cheap resist gear that I can look for.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Ahh, the days of doing Naggy and Vox.  Vox was a total nightmare for me, think I lost over a level back in the day for a single raid and we didn't even get her.  Damn those pickup raids!!<br />
<br />
Good resist items:<br />
<br />
slot         - item name                 - resists<br />
=========================================<br />
range      - stone of mordid - large races only?, 20fr/cr!!<br />
face        - golden diamond mask - 10 fr/cr<br />
neck       - golden blue diamond pendant - 11fr/cr<br />
shoulder - imbued granite spaulders (can be expensive) - 10fr/cr<br />
ear         - blue diamond electrum earring - 6fr/cr<br />
head      - platinum blue diamond tiara - 8fr/cr<br />
finger     - velium diamond wedding ring - 8fr/cr<br />
wrist      - velium blue diamond bracelet - 9fr/cr<br />
<br />
Those are some items I used back 'in the day'.  They're pretty ghetto these days, with better items to be had.  They're kind of old school, in the sense that you had guild jewelers cranking this stuff out as doing Naggy / Vox was a big deal.  You should be able to pick those up pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
You didn't mention money, so I assumed you're semi-poor as I was back then.  If you have a bigger budget, think about getting items that will last you a lot longer (pay attention to rec/req levels though)<br />
<br />
cazicite jewelry items - much better than above, I'm uncertain on cost though, assume semi-expensive.  All recommended level 51.  Roughly 8 or 10 to fr/cr per item!<br />
ring - valorium rings of galantry - 5fr/cr (req:46 rec:60)<br />
ear - electrified earring of tempests - 12fr/cr (req:46 rec:60)<br />
<br />
You may find at 46 that they're not worth the cost.  I'd definately think about hitting 51/52 before doing a Naggy/Vox raid, you may find it hard to even get into those raids at 46.  The reason being that you're going to get chomped up by the AoEs on those mobs.  I did manage to go at 46, but only because I was a wizard and they couldn't get many wizzies at the time to go along for ports.  I was not really able to cast on Naggy at that level, so it was pretty pointless for me to be there other than transportation.<br />
<br />
Good luck, may the loot be plentiful,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">range - stone of mordid - large races only?, 20fr/cr!! <br />
<br />
It's the Stone or Morid, it's large races + iksar only, -5 stamina, and 30 fr/cr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A couple of the other old standard resist items that should be pretty cheap now: <br />
<br />
Runed Bone Fork - can go in the range slot and gives 10 to MR, CR, FR. <br />
<br />
Skull Shaped Barbute - helmet that gives 10 MR. <br />
<br />
Then there were some specific items you could swap out depending on whether you were doing Naggy or Vox - e.g. Cloak of the Ice Bear was 20 CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slayerofwurms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont forget Crown of Froglok Kings- I think its 12ac 20sv fire and cold.<br />
<br />
Not on fire and cold, but gloves of fungal flesh are 25 sv disease.<br />
<br />
Just go to the baz, and search by fire/cold, and then by each slot.<br />
<br />
Hmm, sword of Skyfire, 10/22, proc, and 15 sv cold, Horn of Hsagra, 15 sv cold.... LSoEE, 10 sv magic?<br />
<br />
I saw another weapon the other day that had a 15 sv magic on it, not very expensive...<br />
<br />
The old Bloodstained Mantle, for 10 svm<br />
<br />
Tattered mantle may have fire resist on it, I dont recall....<br />
<br />
Mage summoned Elemental Blanket, with 20 fire and cold, I think...<br />
<br />
Chetari Bonecrafted shiled, 19ac, back slot, and 10 sv fire?<br />
<br />
Sharpened Mandible spear, 14 sv disease?<br />
<br />
Velium Jacinth rings, 14 sv magic, Shadel Bandit Ring, is 10 to one sv and 5 to another, I forget which....<br />
<br />
Thats all I can think of off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's been awhile since I raided these guys, but here is a list of what I can remember wearing.<br />
<br />
BACK: Cloak of the Ice Bear +20svC<br />
FINGER: Velium/Platinum Diamon Rings +8/7 sv ALL<br />
WRIST: Symbol of Loyalty to Vox +5svC (drops from mobs in King Room.. vox meeting spot, I picked up 2 waiting for raids to start)<br />
LEGS: Icy Greaves +5svC (drops from mobs in King Room.. vox meeting spot, I picked one up waiting for raids to start)<br />
NECK: Pendant of the Warlord +10svALL (from Halloween GM Events 2 years ago.. I guess you don't have access to this unless you got lucky back then)<br />
FACE: Golden Diamond Mask +10svC/F +3svM<br />
RANGE: Runed Bone Fork +10svC/F/M<br />
<br />
If you can, help out on Ragefire kills for Cleric epics, the armor that drops (http://lucy.fnord.net/itemlist.html?searchtext=of+fennin+ro) has great svF on it, and cool clickies to boot.</div></div><hr />
