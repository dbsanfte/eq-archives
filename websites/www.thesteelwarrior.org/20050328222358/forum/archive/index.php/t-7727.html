The descriptions of how he screws with your heal spells sound really rough.  To get an idea what level my guild is at, we do tier 1 planar bosses easily now and have killed Aerin Dar a couple times and the carprin cycle a couple times.  Attempts on some of the other tier 2/3 bosses await finding them up.<br />
<br />
We're had about 30 people in Ferubi last Saturday and the packmaster was up as he often seems to be.  We killed the named across the hall from him, but with a few clerics, not much else for healing, and having read those descriptions, I decided not to attempt the packmaster at that time.<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone have suggestions for where else in GoD we could take a small to mid sized raid besides Ferubi?  I think most of the other targets are for time/elem guilds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even we can easily one group in barindu and riwwi, so just looking around wouldn't be something to do as a raid.  I'll have to look into the scripted event.<br />
<br />
On the packmaster.... hmm... how the heck do you fight this guy?  His AE just looks absolutely awful.  From what I'm reading, the heal reduction is on the target of your heal.  So you want to keep curing your main tank (16 curse counters).  The problem is everyone will have that AE on them and everyone will be taking AE damage plus possibly be getting hit by the adds that spawn during the fight.  Since everyone will be cursed, healing them of the AE will be a huge problem.<br />
<br />
packmaster's curse:<br />
1: Decrease Spell Damage by 20%<br />
2: Decrease HP when cast by 800<br />
3: Reduce Healing Effectiveness to 20%<br />
4: Decrease AC by 180<br />
5: Increase Curse Counter by 16<br />
6: Decrease Hitpoints by 100 per tick<br />
<br />
Goes off every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering if adds are mezzable.  But unless it's a very quick fight, I don't see how we'll keep the raid force alive anyway.  800 pts dmg every 30 seconds plus 100 per tick plus any dmg the adds do and very little way to heal any of it.  <br />
<br />
It's an ugly mob to just take practice shots on because a wipe probably means getting all the nekkid people back to Ferubi for coffin summoning to zone in.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thing is that, the Range on packmaster's curse is 0, so it should not really be an AE... although i have not tried it myself to verify.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alla's lists the range of packmaster's curse as 300'.  Lucy's lists it as 0.  Hmm...<br />
If it's only single target, the fight would probably still be tricky for us, but maybe doable.  I'm usually MT and fully buffed AC is only in the low 1600s.  I get hammered pretty hard in ferubi.  Take off another 180 from that curse and ineffective heals if the cures don't land right away and it could be touch and go.  but maybe doable.</div></div><hr />

Assign one person who has RGC to each healer, and have them cast RGC on their healer immediately after each AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The curse effects the target of the heal, not the healer themselves.  <br />
<br />
If the curse does not effect heal over time spells, then MGB heal over times  could used to mitigate some of the AE dmg.  This is a mute point if the curse is actually single target only.  You just keep the tank cured as well as you can and deal with the other challenges of the encounter.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, If you're having doubts about killing the packmaster, I'd just stay the hell away from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah, bad answer. If ya stay away from every mob you're not sure you can kill, you don't get anywhere. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 3 nameds in Ferubi:  Smith Rondo, Votal, and Packmaster.  Packmaster is, in my opinion, the hardest.  Smith Rondo is the easiest, and he's a pain in the butt to work with (there are 4 mobs that spawn with him, some are messable and some aren't, and killing one causes another to spawn a la Emp Ssra).  Really, I would say Ferubi raids are high-VT or low-EP status -- you're free to prove me wrong, of course, but I would imagine you'd get your asses handed to you in trying it.<br />
<br />
That said, whenever there is a discrepancy between Allakhazam's and any other reputable service (lucy, magelo, TSW library posts, etc) I *always* go with the other source.  Allakhazam's is way too unreliable (for confirmation, see the list of drops some of the PoFire named have...)</div></div><hr />

He destroyed us. The adds were really annoying, and the AE didn't help at all.  We would probably kill him now, but his loot blows and it's not worth trying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that horrible curse that shows as range 300 on alla's on range 0 on lucy's is actually an AE?  <br />
<br />
I couldn't find anything about the adds other than... he has adds.  :p</div></div><hr />

Only done him once and keeping adds mezzed while MT was chain cured until Packmaster dead and then cycling through adds afterwards was how it was done.</div></div><hr />
