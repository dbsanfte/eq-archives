<br />
But now im trying to understand more since the guild im in is building it self up now to start raiding more and im comming back and playing a warrior.<br />
<br />
so far what i have learned from reading through the website is i want high hps/ac/and resist these were all given to be along with the fact that i want to create as much agro as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
my main question is for weapons i want to be able to tell the dps on a weapon and if it would make a good agro weapon with out having to ask every one all the time.<br />
<br />
Could you guys please give me an example on how to tell dps of a weapon what the formule for it.<br />
<br />
Also when ill be looking for upgrade of armor items is there a formule you use to choose a certain item over an item you already have ?<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 2hb/2hs/2hpiercing the dmg should be higher than the delay and the delay should be no less than 29 so you get a better dmg bonus.<br />
<br />
You can also visit Allakhazam's and it ranks the weapons in efficency and comparatability. Just line up 2 weapons and see which has a better rating.<br />
<br />
anger proc &gt; stun + dd proc &gt; dd proc &gt; no proc<br />
<br />
Really agro should be your focus, not DPS, that's what other classes are for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's how I've always compared weapons dps wise.<br />
Note: this is done w/out any parsing and may not be entirely true w/all weapons but it's what I mainly use for 1handers.<br />
All I do is double the the DMG and see how much higher that number is than the DELAY.  So say I'm comparing a SotBS and CHoS I'll do.  12 X 2 = 24 and then 24 - 15 = 5.  Then I'll do 13 X 2 = 26 and then 26-20 = 6 so imho chos will go primary but thats just how I do it and remember I've never parsed so take that as you will.  Hope it helped however, Akamek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A more accurate formula for comparing weapon damage for 1-handers is:<br />
<br />
primary hand actual effective damage rating is<br />
((damage x 2) + damage bonus) / delay<br />
<br />
off-hand actual effective damage rating is<br />
(damage x 2) / delay<br />
<br />
A 13/20 has a primary-hand damage rating at level 65 of<br />
((13 x 2) + 13) / 20 = 39/20 = 1.95<br />
<br />
An 11/18 has a primary-hand damage rating at level 65 of<br />
((11 x 2) + 13) / 18 = 35/18 = 1.94<br />
<br />
So the 13/20 will do more damage in the primary hand than the 11/18.<br />
<br />
In the offhand, the 13/20 does 26/20 or 1.3, while the 11/18 does 1.2.  The 13/20 is still better.<br />
<br />
But now consider a 3/10.<br />
<br />
In the primary hand, the 3/10 does<br />
((3 x 2) + 13) / 10 = 19/10 = 1.9, or nearly as good as a 13/20 or an 11/18<br />
<br />
but in the offhand, it only does<br />
(3 x 2) / 10 = 6/10 = 0.6, or markedly worse than either.<br />
<br />
Specifically, the damage bonus favors low-delay weapons in the primary hand, and the lack of a damage bonus in the offhand makes pure ratio the determining factor.<br />
<br />
The damage rating for 2-handers relative to each other uses the same basic formula of ((damage x 2) + damage bonus) / delay<br />
<br />
However, 2-handers and 1-handers are not even remotely comparable by these formulas, since there is no reliable algorithm presently available for taking into account dual wield success rates, Ambidexterity, Ferocity, Punishing Blade, etc., etc., etc.<br />
<br />
But you can compare two 2-handers quite adequately using these formulas.<br />
<br />
Run the numbers sometime.  You'll be astonished how close a GSoT comes to, for example, a WMBS or a Windblade.  Certainly close enough for the proc to make up the damage differential (and provide much better aggro to boot).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming I understand such things correctly, damage per second (dps) calculations are a bit different from agro calculations. <br />
Gront's post above considers dps.<br />
Here's a thread on agro:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5864<br />
<br />
That thread is based on one that's in the library on agro generation tests, which you should also read. Folks like Wandor &amp; Haass would be able to correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that there are three cases:<br />
<br />
1. Agro from primary hand 1H weapon is based on this formula:<br />
(damage + damage bonus + 1)/delay<br />
The higher this number, the better the agro. This does NOT weight procs or any AAs, etc; in all of these formulas, these other modifiers of agro must be judged separately.<br />
<br />
2. Agro from 1H in offhand position:<br />
This is purely a function of the damage/delay ratio--the higher, the better the agro.<br />
<br />
3. Agro from 2H weapons is based on this formula:<br />
(damage + 2H damage bonus + 1H damage bonus)/delay<br />
<br />
Read the post I link above for another link to a chart that lists damage bonuses for both 1H weapons and 2H weapons (1H and 2H bonuses are different).<br />
To use Gront's sample weapons, but this time analyze them in terms of agro generation rather than damage output, I get this for a level 65 player:<br />
<br />
Primary hand, 13/20 weapon:<br />
(13 + 13 + 1)/20 = 27/20 = 1.35<br />
<br />
Primary hand, 11/18 weapon:<br />
11 + 13 + 1/18 = 25/18 = 1.38<br />
<br />
What this means is that the weapons are pretty close, but in the primary hand the lower delay weapon comes out slightly ahead over time in terms of agro generation in the main hand position.<br />
<br />
In the offhand position, since agro is simply a function of the weapon's ratio,  the 13/20 weapon = 0.65; the 11/18 weapon = 0.61.<br />
<br />
Thus, 13/20 generates more agro than the 11/18 in the offhand position. That suggests that the best agro generation would be to put the 11/18 in mainhand and the 13/20 in the offhand.<br />
<br />
Again, even assuming I'm correct here, procs, AAs and discs can play a big role in the total agro of a weapon set up. If you are raiding, your weapons probably have procs on them, so keep in mind what Payn said about that.<br />
Agro is more critical if you are main tank; dps if you are second tank or for whatever reason don't want the mob on you.</div></div><hr />
