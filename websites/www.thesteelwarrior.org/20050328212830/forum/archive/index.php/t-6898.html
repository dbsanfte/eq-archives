Won basically everytime cept once when the cleric was owned by hasted pooka, I don't exactly consider it a fail since I'm boxing him so he doesn't move around quickly~<br />
<br />
I'd actually gotten to the point where I was wondering how people saw it as hard. On the other hand vxed has become major trivial.<br />
<br />
Then the last patch (week ago). We took a few days off because of burn out, started back up and every time we get to boss and something goes wrong. First time a kyv ran off unsnared and aggro'd the rest of the room, next 3 times charm broke during boss (never happened before). Last night the chanter end up on ramp (this is very bad).<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice any problems or is this just the wheel revolving around after so many wins?</div></div><hr />

My wizard failed 18 times in a row. No joke, I had the absolute worst luck ever doing Tipt. It didn't matter if I went in with a lame pick up group or a stacked with Time+++ guild groups, something went wrong every time.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily think that Tipt is hard - the problem is that there is 0 room for error. Unless you have a necro/pally in the group, 99.99% of the time is the cleric dies, you fail. Keeping 100% focus for 2-3 hours can be a pain.</div></div><hr />

Personally I find that after doing lots of LDoN missions that mobs that respawn in instances zones really bug me.  In tipt the damn mobs shouldn't respawn and vxed would be a lot more fun IMO if you had to just clear out every mob in the zone, instead of clearing respawns for 100 mobs.<br />
<br />
This would also allowed you to recover easier after a wipe, since you could just work your way back to the corpses rather than give up, or try to find a rogue to drag or a necro to summon corpse.  Anyway /rant off</div></div><hr />

Ok, I've never been in an instanced zone that respawns, but the idea is just stupid.  I think a big part of the purpose of an instanced zone is so you lose that fakeness of having mobs just pop up like they do in normal zones.  It adds an element of realism, since mobs don't just pop out of thin air.  Why would they create something cool like instanced zones then f it up with respawns in it?  Sometimes their thinking escapes me.</div></div><hr />

If its taking 2-3 hours to do Tipt the wizzard isn't doing his job.  If you failed 18 times in a row, maybe you should try something you can handle.</div></div><hr />

EVERY ONE.  Well, except the time I didn't use a pooka pet ;)  I don't think the trial as a whole is hard, the boss at the end puts out a good amount of DPS so as long as you can kep the tank up your should be gtg.</div></div><hr />

Should also add that the trial iteself was not meant (imo) to be beaten primarily with a charmed pooka. IMO if you need that pet as a crutch on your trials to beat the last guy, you shouldn't even bother.</div></div><hr />

If done right, respawns shouldn't be an issue in Tipt. If you have to worry about them, you are going to slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're dieing to charm breaks (random breaks throughout the trial i mean, if charm breaks on the boss, it's ok to die hehe), you need to take along a snarer and NEVER let snare fade from the pet.  If the pet is snared, and you're still commonly wiping to cham breaks, then you just need a better enchanter.<br />

Using a pet makes this trial possible with a much more vaired group structure than would normally be required (with less required gear as well).  Unless guilds enjoy taking their top group or two and dragging people through one person at a time, everyone should be damned glad pets make it go a bit easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the ability to charm pets that are this powerful shouldn't exist.  Period.  It's a huge game flaw they introduced in PoP that turned a class already highly desired for other reasons (chanters) into THE dps class for some areas.  It's stupid.  It's unbalanced.  It's amazing Sony has never bothered to fix it.  Get rid of it and adjust content if necessary.<br />
<br />
A shaman friend was doing vxed awhile ago and killed 2 1/2 times as many mobs in an hour when they replaced one group member with a chanter who charmed.  That's retarded.<br />
<br />
And yes, respawns suck in instanced zones.  Another friend was doing the first sewers trial and has his group wipe repeatedly near the front.  Since they were near the front though, they were able to get back to the corpses or drag them and try again.  My group was flawless for 90 minutes and was nearing the back of the zone on our attempt.  Then one pulling mistake wiped us.  Because of repops, that was it for us.  Game over.  With a corpse summoner, we couldn't even start over at the front of the zone.  Maybe an sos rogue could have reached the corpses, but we didn't have one.  That would have meant starting back at the front too and no one was ready to spend 90 more minutes that, if flawless, would get us back where we had been when we made 1 mistake.<br />
<br />
It's far different than fighting a boss mob where you have to be flawless for a few minutes.  One mistake at any point in the 2-3 hours of many of the trials can easily end it.</div></div><hr />

It was the smoothest one to date with no errors. The Heartstryker died with over 2 minutes left on defensive to since we actually tried to use a pet this time and for once it didn't break (kept pet mezzed rooted and slowed while we cleared room then once clear wait for root to break and mez it, when slow faded we pulled the boss)<br />
<br />
However, I did fail this trial about 13 times myself before I first got flagged. The biggest problem my group ever had was the stupid enchanter pet who would always wake up at the wrong time.</div></div><hr />

Probably anyone who can do it effectively in their group will use the charmed pet.  I'm just stating that it's obscenely overpowered and has been for a long time.  PoP had a very sharp increase in mob dps, so how overpowered charm was became very obvious.  They still haven't done near enough to bring it into line.<br />
<br />
Frankly it baffles me that the devs have left it so stupidly overpowered.<br />
<br />
we parsed the pet fully buffed with mage pet kit on regular mobs at 1800dps(yes small sampling). Thats what RZ does to me.<br />
<br />
This is just insane. No character should be able to do that kind of dps ever, no matter what the &quot;risk&quot; they claim there is.  It just shouldn't happen.  So where are other classes' high risk for insane gain abilities?  Hell, give me a long reuse disc with that kind of dps and I'll take a % risk every tick of simply dying on the spot.  &quot;Your heart explodes under the strain... LOADING... please wait...&quot;.  How about 5%?  I bet that's more than the risk of charm breaking each tick when a chanter has dominate 3 and of course the chanter may be able to recharm the mob, especially if it's snared.  Chanters successfully use charmed pets for the bulk of trials sometimes.<br />
<br />
Hey, how about a 1% chance each tick that I explode, killing myself and my entire group?  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a very long experience in Tipt runs, but tho...<br />
Only 3 tipt runs here, all with charmed pets. 2 wins, 1 loss.<br />
Pet on final named was charmed near zone in both wins<br />
And the loss wasn't due to a charm break.<br />
<br />
So I think you would be closer to reality saying often, instead of sometimes.<br />
Cause a perma-snared pet is really not that hard to keep, especially with Dominate3 as you stated.<br />
<br />
Yes i think it is over-powered, and nobody should put out that dps.<br />
A support class putting out that dps is crazy. Chanters are doing the dps of a group of Wizs. <br />
Dont change much for us, except those trials are easier. I think it is for true dps classes that it is the worst, as being there or not dont change group dps by much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charm is overpowered, but Tipt/Vxed is a reasonable compromise because otherwise Enchanters will complain how they can't charm anymore and whatnot.  Originally they were going to have the 'mob gets weaker when it's cut off from power of chaos' but of course people complained about the *risk* (of course no one complains about the risk of having a hasted pooka since those don't get any weaker).  <br />
<br />
It's not something I like to see but I'll live with it since it's pretty much confined to those two zones.  I know you can charm elsewhere but it isn't nearly as overpowered as it is in Tipt/Vxed.  It isn't good for the game but it doesn't break it.  It is a lot like the old Knight situation really.  <br />
<br />
As for repops, if the instance trials do not repop then they'd be pretty trivial to beat.  For the most part they've relatively easy pulls already.  If things don't come back the players got to eventually win... except against Jhiru, maybe (without a certain level of gear you can conceiveably never be able to beat him).<br />
<br />
Oh, and the sewers crematory furnace one would be utterly trivial to beat if there are no repops.  The whole point of that trial was to get back through the repops or get past them through some clever way.</div></div><hr />

I agree, charmed pets aren't going to piggyback you very far, but they sure are nice to get the job done super-fast.  I logged on earlier than the folks I was going to do vxed with for progression, so I solo'd for awhile.  Wasn't very efficient for me, but when the group finally came together, we had to kill like 3 mobs before the ghost spawned $$</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pfft, 1 cleric using sound of might (and sometimes tarnation if the enchanter is slow in recharming) when charm breaks is usually more than enough to control the angry, hasted pet--even without snare (and if something weird happens, bouncing agro between said cleric and the enchanter by sitting after stunning twice is always fun)~  Hasted, unsnared pets=teh win.</div></div><hr />
