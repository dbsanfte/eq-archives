I picked up an Obsidian Greatblade in Sol Ro a few weeks ago, so far it's been able to hold decent aggro, procs quite a bit, and I'm going the Miragul's route to add the Anger 3 proc to it.  I tested it versus BoC in exp groups and the Greatblade holds better aggro.  I'm still not sure if I ought to hold out for EB. <br />
<br />
Guild is RZ-capable but it hasn't dropped a BoW yet.  We aren't in VT.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaer</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW beats everything outside of PoTime IMO for weapondry, only thing that can beat it for agro and dps both consistantly in my experience is a SEWS with a LDoN proc on it. But now that I have a Yak proc on mine, I don't have that problem much anymore either, atleast when it matters. If I need agro, I've got it almost all the time. Obsidian might be ok for later when you want DPS and not agro, but BoW should beat it overall in DPS.<br />
<br />
If your a MT, hold out for the BoW. If you rarely MT, then don't bother trying to get one as it'll almost always go to a MT, unless you just farm the piss outta RZ, then ya never know! Can be tough to come by though, 5 kills and we've gotten 2 so far. Better odds than a BF tho back in the day.<br />
<br />
And VT...pfft. It's a nice challenging zone from all I've heard, and served it's purpose well in the day, but it's not 'required' by any means. Would help to gear the masses up quickly, but not required. Don't think any member of our alliance has been in VT and we've been elemental for like 3-4 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't MT often but I'm put up as SA or TA often enough that I like to have a nice aggro weapon to hand.  I really do feel my HP/AC is lacking though.<br />
<br />
Bleh I just can't decide :)  Talked to a few people who say that a BoW isn't strictly necessary but they were all using BoCs/BF's.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully this Taunting Blow weapon once aug'd with Anger 3 will do the job if I can't pick up a BOW anytime soon :)</div></div><hr />
