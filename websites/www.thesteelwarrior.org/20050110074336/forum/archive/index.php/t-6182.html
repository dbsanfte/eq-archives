<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fafnir</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is a Ssra level guild (pre-Elemental/VT; most other stuff can be killed).  Raid attendees about 25-30 (need more Aussies on Stromm!).  MTs x2 buff to around 8700hps and 1550 AC currently; all defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
The guild steps a fine line between enjoyment and sadness when we raid - failing is disheartening.<br />
<br />
We are looking to try Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan in Ferubi.<br />
<br />
I have done a few searches (Alla, Safehouse, here) on WMV.  Research on WMV appears to give mixed messages.<br />
<br />
Consequently, can anyone confirm or clarify the following:<br />
<br />
1. 4 mobs that spawn on agro (if pre cleared) / agro when he is agroed (if not clear) are the ones who have the AE - if so, can look at ways to mitigate those who get AE damage<br />
<br />
2. the 4 apprentices hit for ??<br />
<br />
3. WMV hits for 900 quad with defensive on?  Some other reports say 3k.  To what degree does AC appear to mitigate her dps?  Minimal?  A lot?<br />
<br />
4. HP estimate of WMV?  AC of WMV nothing special, presumably?<br />
<br />
5. If the agro version of Smith Rondo hits for 3k, we presumably would need to loot WMV and AE TL out of there.  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll try to explain the Weaponmaster encounter.. but Warning: Spoiler follows -<br />
<br />
Triggering Weaponmaster will also spawn 4 Master Apprentices.<br />
<br />
Master Apprentices:<br />
Out of the 4 Master Apprentices, 3 are mezzable, 1 is not (placing of which is unmezzable is random).<br />
<br />
Master Apprentices hit for ~1100 without disc. Because they are Kyv models, they have a very high attack rating (almost never misses)<br />
<br />
Master Apprentices have 4 procs - Endurance drain, Mana drain, AE DD, and a drunken proc.<br />
<br />
If Weaponmaster is still alive, Master Apprentices have a 15 min repop timer.<br />
<br />
Weaponmaster:<br />
Not sure how hard he hits for (I haven't tanked him yet). But he has a very high regen rate. 4 Clerics on 3.0 secs CCH is able to keep 11k tank on Defensive. Do not use Stonewall, as the raid will most likely push him a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
After killing Weaponmaster, Smith Rondo will respawn again. He is not KOS, not exactly. But he WILL mob-assist and kill anyone who attacks or mezzes the Master Apprentices (if they are still up).<br />
Smith hits for 3.4k+ without disc. With Defensive, he hits around 2k, 2k+. Good thing about Smith is he has low HP, good because by now, your Clerics could have around 30 - 50% mana, depending on your DPS when you killed Weaponmaster.<br />
<br />
P.S. To complete the event and get the FLAG, you need to kill Smith Rondo after Weaponmaster, cos only then will the Projection appear. Careful, the Projection only gives out 54 flags. Double-hailing counts as well. Make sure they are upclose to the Projection to hail.</div></div><hr />
