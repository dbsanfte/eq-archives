<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was going to skim the boards of Paladins of Norrath, and guess what? I'm banned! Cha-ching!<br />
<br />
<br />
Drinks on me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rofl Boardmaster's getting a tad intolerant isn't he?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They haven't gotten me yet, but I post under a different user name and rarely post if at all. I also don't say anything to make them mad.<br />
<br />
Did you stir up the pot recently over there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe about 2 weeks ago....I asked why they used stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now that was a bated question !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Am I the only one who doesn't give a crap who got banned from the paladin board?  Being banned from a messageboard usually implies that you're an idiot.  So you're bragging about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, I'm saying that I was the next person to be banned from Gilfalas's crazy reign....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A question like that, which seems it's entire reason is to stir the pot, it's no wonder that you got banned.<br />
<br />
Though, numerous people have been banned from PoN for nothing more than posting their opinions.  Even one I know of was banned for posting their opinions on THIS board, and had not made a single post on PoN.  Gilfalas, the PoN mod, is quickly making PoN into a message board where you can't post an unpopular opinion for fear of being banned.  Not only are they banning people, they are deleting threads that have no reason to be deleted.<br />
<br />
People who stir the pot aren't making things any better.  All it does is make Gil even more sure that they are doing the right thing.  Also, we really don't need to hear each time someone gets banned.  We know that they have already turned PoN into a worthless board with an over zealous mod, more threads about it do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Exactly, Gilfalas is a looney (as many people will tell you), and yes, I understand WHY I was banned. I at first thought it was a reasonable question, but then I was like, hey, I'm going to get banned....oh well, happened already, and it wasn't like I spent a lot of time there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Of course when you make a post on PoN, then follow up with this: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1358 here, it's pretty obvious that you are nothing more than a troll, which is universally a bannable offense. To act like a wronged innocent is nothing more than a cheap lie.<br />
<br />
Actually, there are many other admins besides Gilfalas. I'm not sure why it is that everyone assumes that it's him that has done the banning. It might be, but it's just speculation as far as I can tell. And at least one person that said they had never posted on the PoN board before they got banned was lying. Search is a wonderful thing.<br />
<br />
Most people that have been banned seem to deserve it. I've been very vocal about how the aggro gap between warriors and knights is too big for months now, and while many people there think I have an anti-paladin kick, I haven't been banned, because I try to keep thing respectful and on topic (except when dealing with Goodwind :p). Others may have gotten caught in the crossfire, but it's their board, they can do whatever they want. Somehow I doubt they are much worse off for losing the incredible insight of those that have been banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OMFG you got banned it's so amazing please to be starting a thread about it because it is very very important and by extension you are now a pillar of the warrior community and a shining beacon of honor for all to look up to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You go there, make a useless post designed to bait flame responces and come back to brag. Now you've been outright banned because their admins don't want to have to deal with your immaturity anymore, and you come to brag yet again? For fuck sakes where is this board heading after such a short existance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i better join the club!!!! timee to get banned!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">=/....A lot of people hate me here....<br />
<br />
EDIT: And I wasn't playing the innocent victim here folks, just saying a point. If you don't like it, don't fucking read it. Simple as that. No one needs to hear my 2 cp, and I don't need to hear your 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, you were playing the role of the dumbass.  You instigated a fight on another message board, you started a thread to proudly exclaim to everyone that you did, you've got a smiley face next to the post out there, and your initial post contains the words &quot;Drinks on me.&quot;  You're proud of your accomplishment.  You're proud of being an internet troll and getting banned.  Why shouldn't people treat you this way?<br />
<br />
Seriously dude, stop and think about what you post before you hit the post button.  It keeps threads like this from happening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rinnhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Read this. (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=478.topic) <br />
<br />
I'm sick an tired of not being able to hold aggro over a gimp cleric, but being a jackass isn't going to do much except  get you banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Grimmlokk <br />
OMFG you got banned it's so amazing please to be starting a thread about it because it is very very important and by extension you are now a pillar of the warrior community and a shining beacon of honor for all to look up to.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I just have ot say Grimmlokk your post's make my day, and I do mean it I am not trying to be sarcastic they bring a smile to my face everytime I read them :)</div></div><hr />
