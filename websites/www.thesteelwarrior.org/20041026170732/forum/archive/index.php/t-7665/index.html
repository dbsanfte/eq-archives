<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the last couple of patches, and including last night (after the latest patch), mobs are popping out of thin air, especially on 2nd floor of VT.  It very clearly is z-axis (vertical) aggro.  <br />
<br />
Best concrete example I can give you is fighting a Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra and have a Twin plus all their friends and associates suddenly in your midst.  It happens all through the 2nd floor, consistently.<br />
<br />
The fact that things are still aggroing through interior walls and doors you can pretty much cope with most of the time, but the z-axis aggro here is making this silly, given the pop rate.<br />
<br />
Anyone else encountering this?  We've tried all kinds of work arounds without any real success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have people riding horses or levitating? I remember those being unconditionally banned by my guild do to z-axis aggro. If that's not it, then bug it and post about it on the official boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can't levitate in VT at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they still havent fixed this?!?! we havent raided VT since 2 patches ago (mainly because it was taking like 6 hours to spawn wednsday and not giving us enough time to clear) but id assumed they would be working on z-axis for the amount of bug reporting and feedback all the guilds who raid VT were doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, I guess when you look over and see just your friends torso sticking up out of the ground, the mobs down below are just as curious to see his legs sticking down out of the ceiling.  /boggle Sony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No horses or lev. This was also banned by our guild and we havent had the guts to test out if vt is still bugged or not.<br />
<br />
We were fighting an aten blob once and had 3 mysterious mobs pop on us. The chanters started mezzing them and one depopped. The guild leader somehow got a gm there in like 2 minutes and found that the mob was from near first door and making its way to us. Lol Thankfully he reset the mob and saved us from a zone wide wipe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild experiences this ALL the freaking time as well, and the second floor isn't the only place where this happens.<br />
<br />
Stand on ANY Diabo platform and you will agro the entire room above it + more.  Don't believe me?  Open up the zone in EQZoneViewer and just look where the Diabo rooms lie.  DXX and DXV are directly below a room chock full of about 9 mobs a piece.   If you stand on the Diabo platforms, you get DIABLO and all his minions of Hell reigning down upon you.<br />
<br />
It's fucking bullshit.  Fix this horseshit!<br />
<br />
The grav fluxers (Aten blobs, Mini-Aten) also draw unnecessary agro as well from the grav fluxes.  We have adds every single time we engage these three mobs.</div></div><hr />

  Read that post, and that thread. They're aware of the issue and they're fixing it.</div></div><hr />
