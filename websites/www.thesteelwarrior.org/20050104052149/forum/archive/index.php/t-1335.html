best ac/hp...<br />

Best MA weapons Best SA<br />
<br />
All those are decent combos, each better then other depending on use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I basically have the same collection, with the exception of a furious bash shield (which I still consider to be just a toy).<br />
<br />
BoC + primal for most exp groups, and for tanking the small trash you're clearing prior to named on a raid... UNLESS you have a shaman who's feeding you Ferine or Primal avatar, then just go with BoC + spike driver.<br />
<br />
BoC + spike driver for MTing huge mobs, preferably getting a ferine or primal avatar just before engaging so you kick out your best potential dps and proc rate from the weapons. Once you have enough procs in to secure aggro, swap in primal as you see fit to keep Avatar up.<br />
<br />
If you're not tanking (or acting as the ST or Rampage tank), I find it's nice to wield primal in manihand, cord hilted spike driver in offhand. If you have to take over tanking, it's very quick to swap in the BoC to your primary, and you'll likely have a fresh Avatar up too.</div></div><hr />
