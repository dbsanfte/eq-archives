<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have had some feedback lately from warriors on my server who are convinced that once they got WA5 their procs went DOWN (as compared to WA4). Has anyone else had this experience or do you suppose it's a perception?<br />
<br />
I am in process of saving for WA5 or Sturdiness3. I am a MT for a raid team (who are currently gearing toward MM, Bert, RZ targets) and hold pretty good aggro (with BoC and CHSD both anger augmented) but also play in xp groups daily (with Go4W with Ykesha augment). I am raid buffed to 9.1+. Your recommendation I assume would be Sturdiness3 first??<br />
<br />
Any input is welcomed. Thank you in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed the Definite increase in procs when i got it so it isnt bugged. I got WA4, than Sturdines4 and than i finished my WA5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have noticed a change from = weapon and aug procs to mostly weapon procs. giving the illusion of less procs. since i keep looking for the anger aug message, and don't see it. meanwhile 160dd and 179dd fly across my screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yethuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didnt think WA was worth getting until I got WA5 personally  wa1-4 was irritating to me and wa5 made me glad I got it .. and on the sturdiness thingy I have 2 levels of it and wont buy the rest next level for me is 15aa for another 100hp and just seems like a waste to me until I see if OoW has something better .<br />

<br />
- Weapon augmentations will again proc properly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For the 1000th time.  You can't see a difference in proc rate by watching your chat box.  Hell you can't even parse it in less than 4 hours.  If you suspect something is wrong, do a LONG parse.  Otherwise don't go spreading rumors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">but if it has needed a correction on test server the 20th, it's maybe because it's not acting as intended. So maybe it comes from  the last 19th patch. and if so it's still on live server.<br />
but this is jsut a rumor as &quot;if&quot; isn't reliable :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, way down at the bottom of the post and very vague as to what was (or is) wrong to begin with...anyone find more information about what exactly was fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was not attempting to &quot;spread rumors&quot;. I was trying to ascertain information from people with similar AAs and class as myself. All above answered are duly noted and I thank you for your input.<br />
