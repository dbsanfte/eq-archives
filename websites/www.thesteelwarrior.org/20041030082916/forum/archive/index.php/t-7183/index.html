<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henna deGuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long time lurker, first time poster and I want to thank everyone for all of their wisdom over the years - I have learned much!<br />
<br />
As an unguilded warrior with access to a few teammates and some plat (bank sitting at about 210K on Saryn server right now) where would the Steel Warrior community suggest I focus my time and effort on my equipment?<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1007454<br />
<br />
I know I need to augment my weapons, and I am getting to that, albeit slowly. I currently have about 800 adv. points spread over Tak and Guk. I am not currently Elemental flagged but can begin to work on that with friends.<br />
<br />
Reading many other threads I feel that my HPs are very low and I wonder if that is my lack of AA's, Equipment or choice of a small race (halfling)? My guess would be to work on my rings and maybe grind as much LDoN I can for augments?<br />
<br />
I regularly duo with a 65, elemental flagged druid with 220 AA if that helps with suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">race has little or nothing to do with it.  just concentrate on baby steps as per hps/ac gear upgrades and invest your aa's in hps.  the baby steps add up rather quickly, and you'll be amazed how much you can beef your hps in a relatively short time.<br />
<br />
buy physical enhancement ... it is the best 5 aa you can spend.  adds 2% to hps/avoidance/mitigation at the same time.  once you do some more defensive aa's and make some gear upgrades, you can start farming hard ldon for nodrop gears.  before you do that i highly reccomend 1 or 2 aggro procs though.<br />
<br />
depending on the str of your friends, you may be able to farm GoD and Hard Ldon at present, but i wouldnt put you up to tanking them efficiently just yet.  <br />
<br />
a few nodrop goals to shoot for (relatively easy to get with help):<br />
Stonemite carapace mask<br />
Cape of Broken enchantements (17ac 90hps 36% haste)<br />
Mana-Threaded bone bracelet (buyable)<br />
Bloody Boots of Dark rites (buyable)<br />
Warlords Steel Gauntlets (buyable)<br />
Earing of Sand Tides<br />
Lost Ancient Elven Ring<br />
Trueborn Elite ring<br />
Necklace of the Troglodyte<br />
<br />
all of these come from hard ldon and GoD.  with a bit of help from friends all of these should be relatively easy to get, but may take some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">kinda off topic but I had one little suggestion... I can't tell what your actual AC is at because you haven't updated your skills on your magelo.  Only really important ones to update would be your Defense (that's why your AC is comming up low) offense and your weap skills (so your attk rating is accurate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henna deGuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys, really appreciate the advice. Will have a good look at what I might be able to reach in GoD with friend's help and also those specific items in Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Will also update my Magelo, sorry about that, always focus on the gear in Magelo and forget you need to update everything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You gear is not that bad. Apolyon has some good suggestions, the only one I would skip is the mask, your mask with 20ac 55hp is pretty stout already. If I were you, I would work on AAs more than gear. Once you have LR5/ID5, PE, and a couple levels of Sturd, you should be able to tank LDoN hards with a good group. That will be the first step to getting the good no drop LDoN items. For now, crank the AAs in LDoN so that you can collect LDoN loot to use for tribute. This will allow you to constantly run max AC/HP from tribute which is a nice boost.<br />
<br />
Once you are over 6500hp/1500ac unbuffed, you should be able to tank Tipt/Vxed named for even more loot/augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With 210k to spend i would consider replacing waist with Heavy Rubi Girdle and using tribute haste. Would also consider Boots of the Storm or Bloodied boots of Dark rites. Also, doing Emp key would give ya a 80hp ring for free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might consider replacing the valorium ring with a Steel Ring of Earthen Resilance.  On Ayonae Ro they are down to about 60k in the Bazaar.  Great ring :)<br />
<br />
Also, if you are looking for a 2handed DPS weapon, you might pick up a WMBS.  Works nice for raids where you don't want to draw agro and still turn out some decent DPS.  Hit tactics for AA grinding or pick one up in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I also had the same back/waist combo as you, but decided to switch over to a CoF and Heavy Rubi Girdle.  Sure you lose a bit of hp/ac from the back, but you make up for it more with the Heavy Rubi.<br />
<br />
You might also consider getting a group to kill Veskhiz the Shade in Plane of Nightmare for a pair of Horn Spiked Shoulders... or look to pick up a pair from the bazaar (run around 60k on ARo where I'm at).<br />
<br />
Oh and one comment on your AA... get AE Taunt!  A definate must have.  It may not seem like a big deal to you for regular, everyday EQing, but when the shit hits the fan, nothing like having a guaranteed taunt to save the day with in your bag of tricks!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bring your few team mates to Barindu in GoD and see if the trash can drop you a Rhyolite Earring of Thralldom. It's ac13 100hp, definitely a good upgrade.<br />
<br />
As the other posters have mentioned, I'd also recommend the following:<br />
Neck - Necklace of the Troglodyte or Serpentine Necklace<br />
Ring - Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
Shoulder - Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates<br />
Boots - Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites or Boots of the Storm<br />
<br />
As for AAs, yes, get AETaunt, PE, max out CA / CS, LR5 / ID5, Planar Power etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, go with heavy rubi girdle and cof. If I were you I'd go with another valor ring or if you want to sport more bling =) get a Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience.</div></div><hr />
