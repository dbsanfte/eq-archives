<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure many of you have heard of the Paladin or Monk or whatever tanking various ubers showing Warriors are obselete in the PoP days.  But fear not!  Today I tanked Vrex Barxt Qurat, commonly considered one of the highest melee DPS mobs, with nothing but my fists and Bellow of the Mastruq, proving that not only are weapons unnecessary, even spells are unnecessary!<br />
<br />
Story in more detail:  I was making a corpse so I put a mod rod in my primary slot.  After leaving a mod rod on my corpse, I went to have dinner while waiting for the afk to get back.  After everyone finally gets back and through the trap doors, our guild engaged Barxt.  When Guardian was at about 40% the first two tanks on Barxt got killed, so I AE taunted Barxt and furious (with my mighty fists), and defensive when disc ran out.  Held aggro on Barxt for the rest the fight until the adds pop (probably around 2 minutes).  I was also MAing on the adds until someone told me I didn't have a weapon equipped, and sure enough, I was using my fist.  Never noticed that on Barxt since he hits so fast so I figure not seeing any 'you crush Barxt' message was just due to battle spam.<br />
<br />
Now granted no one else was on Barxt besides me and my powerful fists, but the clerics are healing me for a whole two minutes.  <br />
<br />
Ironicall next time I used a weapon on Barxt and I didn't last nearly as long as I did without a weapon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was probably because you piggybacked all existing agro with your AETaunt, first bellow pushed you ahead more while the top agro person decayed and bellow+prox kept you ahead of the decay rate. Give a pushbike enough of a headstart in a race, and it'll stay ahead of the ferarri until the finish line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only people that were on Barxt was the first 2 tanks and the clerics, and both of the tanks died before I AE Taunt, so shouldn't have any aggro to grab from them.  No one else was even doing damage to Barxt and since he's not slowable that leaves you at most a tash's worth of aggro to work with.  If it's aggroed piggybacked from clerics they should be able to get it back right away.  I thought it's a rather odd thing myself... not exactly going to try to repeat this experiment, but it'd seem like heal creates very little aggro indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Prox aggro &gt; healing aggro. Oh, and were you kicking? MIGHTY FOOT ENGAGED!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">similar thing happened to me a few weeks ago. we were just killing AoW on offday for fun, less people, long fight and i decided to go eat dinner, i put <br />
steel rod of the knight in my hands and go afk.<br />
<br />
<br />
for some reason MT fell around 40 pct and since i was the only other warrior left, clerics started healing me. i came back from afk to a dead AoW, Raid leader's tells yelling at me to use BoW(raid didnt know i was afk). i afk tanked aow without any taunt, any aggro weapon or incite, no Defensive nothing. interesting thing is aow went away from me(i was at the wall) a couple of times and came back after killing whoever aggroed more, one of these times was enrage too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i afk tanked aow without any taunt, any aggro weapon or incite, no Defensive nothing.<br />
<br />
Im confused... If you were afk, how in the world did you Get agro in the first place. With no Taunt/Defensive/Incite, I think you woulda be murdered at that, very confusing indeed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They were already killing AoW, he was attacking.  He put Steel Rod of the Knight into his weapons so he wouldn't pull agro while he was afk to eat.<br />
<br />
While he was afk, the MTs went down and everyone dropped agro enough to make him tank, and they held it on him (as well as the clerics healing).  He didn't die, even without defensive.<br />
<br />
To me it just shows how if you have good healers, and a raid that knows how to hold agro on you, you don't need good agro weapons nor any skill at being a warrior.  You just stand there and take the hits.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hell, warriors should be the panzers of EQ equipped with loud speakers and a big nazi flag, shouting insults and profanity while rolling down the streets of Jerusalem. <br />
<br />
ROFL!<br />
<br />
Who said that, may I ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One of my paladin members lol. I thought it was slick. ;)</div></div><hr />

If a monk or bard brings a mob to a crowd of people and feigns or fades, it will every time go to you, barring abnormal proximity.</div></div><hr />
