<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WTF they can't get GoD right yet and they got more comming out???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This littel bit of news came to quickly from soe. They are worried about afterlife and other uber guilds from leaving. They are worried about WoW, and CoH and maybe EQ2. They released news about this expansion with no hints, no clues, no puzzles to solve. They are scrambling it seems to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one, hate the hints, puzzles, etc.  Just give me the raw facts.  I'm happier that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There have been several upgrades and patches of late that seem to be acts of desparation to bolster the popular opinion.  <br />
<br />
HP regen increase<br />
Hotspot XP bonuses <br />
Mage Pet upgrades<br />
I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting.<br />
<br />
Announcing Epic 2.0's seems fall in the same catagory.<br />
It's clear that SoE is very concerned about account attrition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the problem is that their desperation is leading to decisions that will negatively impact the game of Everquest.  This, in turn, will lead to more account attrition.<br />
<br />
They should realize that it is inevitable that new games will take away some of their playerbase and should plan accordingly.  The best way for them to deal with that, in my opinion, is to fix the current issues people have with Everquest to make what already exists more stable and more enjoyable to play.<br />
<br />
I also think that eventually any game becomes boring, and that people are going to leave it for something new.  More and more content is not going to get the upper tier players that have completed all the content to stay around forever.  Everquest's best chance for longevity is to attract new players, people who haven't experienced the game yet, and the best way to do that is to make the game more user friendly, which they have done.  Making it larger and larger and the max level higher and higher is not going to attract new players, it is going to deter them.</div></div><hr />
