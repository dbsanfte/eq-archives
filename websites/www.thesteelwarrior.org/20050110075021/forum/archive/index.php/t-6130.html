<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valaden</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just tried fighting him, and I can say hes pumping out way to many hits to be *working as intended*.<br />
<br />
Scrolled up after getting beat up and using a 42 delay weapon with maxed haste, he is hitting an average of 10-12 times between 2 of my melee rounds. <br />
<br />
Oh and also, one of our chanters who gated back to PoTranq to avoid dying from TVK got summoned back to VT and killed. First time I hear about a bug like this.<br />
<br />
If we give him another try i'll parse his dps and post the results here.<br />
<br />
Any info/input?</div></div><hr />

He has a lot of melee dps, maybe you just got some unlucky rounds. The summoning thing is a bit odd though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valaden</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doubt he would get lucky round every other time, he appeared to tripple quad every round from what me and other wars seen. I've tanked him about 2 dozen times and no way in hell is he not bugged. Theres no way a luclin-era mob would just one round at 9k+ hp war. And they did last night. 9388 dmg in one around anyone? I added up the numbers.<br />
<br />
Maybe its just on our server but VT bane weapons are bugged also. My great mace of slaughter was hitting for teens on akheva's/4arms. <br />
<br />
I know rocks/goos arent considered greater akhevas so dont try telling me I just hit the wrong mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bane weapons have been bugged since the patch, still not fixed as of Friday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valaden</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TVK got parsed at 1400 dps DEFENSIVE last night.<br />
<br />
Just logged in VT.. apparently all the nameds are gone, yet the warders are still up. Sounds like a GM came in and /killed them all to me.</div></div><hr />
