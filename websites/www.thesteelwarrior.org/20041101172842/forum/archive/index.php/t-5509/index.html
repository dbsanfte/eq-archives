<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started up my 30 ogre war again and i was curious to see if i should go with the previous combo i had which was Copper Hammer of striking / Sword of the bloodsworn.... or switch to a 2 hander.... any suggestions would be awesome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">two handers at your level kinda....blow...just keep the skill-ups there.<br />
<br />
stick with dual wield; much better results</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when should i switch to 2 handers ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jubea of Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when the melee caps dont rais anymore from what was it 46 to 51 or some bs like that? take this time where your cap doesent raise to get all yhe weaponskills you may want to use in the future back up to par and at the cap, its a whole lot more eisy to raise a cap from 200 or whatever it caps off at that level to 245 than to go from 45 to 245.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would switch to 2 hander once you start hitting PoP zones and the damage taken from riposte really matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i see ..... right now im basically just trying to skill up 2 hand slashing so when the time comes i dont completeley blow at it..... im master at 1hs and 1hb already so now its just trying to raise my skill.......i just wish i knew where to fight pre-PoP zones since its been such a long time since ive been someone this level =p but once I can get PoP access i pretty know where ill be the rest of the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">30 prolly dawnshroud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">'i' wouldn't fuss much with the 2Hers as your &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; weapon until you get a weapon like a greatstaff of thunder ( req level of 55 ); or any of the other weapons of that caliber.<br />
<br />
honestly; I wouldn't solely rely on a 2Her until I hit ~65 and got some decent AA's..sure it was nice to offank and stuff with a 2Her but for the major tanking it was all about dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i see , but ive also read some threads in here about getting some nasty riposite dmg in some PoP zones when duel weilding.... i know im still like 11 levels away from being able to get there but i still wanna have my skill atleast decent....oh and i snagged a Great acrylia 2 hander the one with no level recomendation to skill up with....working out pretty well so far</div></div><hr />
