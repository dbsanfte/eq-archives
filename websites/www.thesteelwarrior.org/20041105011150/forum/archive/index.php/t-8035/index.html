<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mashor Dabashor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember seeing somewhere that there was an NPC ( thinking it was Temple of Sol Ro ) who would return your points to you if you mistakenly bought an LDON aug you didn't or couldn't use.  Now I can't remember who the NPC was or where I read this.  I'm hoping to cash in a few augs I don't want anymore after the patch tomorrow if my imagination isn't playing tricks on me over this tidbit of info.  Any help I can get on this is appreciated so thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe they said the augment refunds were being removed, as the price for being allowed to swap augments around.  So I hope you refunded them before the patch.</div></div><hr />

From Test Server Updates (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=2568)<br />

They will remove the old augment refunder and make a new trade screen for the merchants allowing you to sell back, from what I understand anyway.</div></div><hr />
