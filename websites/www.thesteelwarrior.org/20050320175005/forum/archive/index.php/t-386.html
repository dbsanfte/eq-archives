Looking for any info on this mob In akheva. So far I know he is slowable, melee only, hits for mid 500's and has a butt load of hitpoints. What I don't know is......<br />
<br />
His spawn location (couldnt find any maps with him marked)<br />
How to get to his spawn location (fight or invisi?)<br />
Locations of these traps I keep reading about <br />
How to avoid the traps :)<br />
His spawn time<br />
Rareness of the skybreaker<br />
Does he enrage?<br />
Are their potential add's where he is fought<br />
Is he trackable from the zoneline with 170ish skilled ranger?<br />
<br />
Any other info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all for the previous info on Cazic Thule and the fleshgrinder. It was a success. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He spawns straight back &amp; left in akheva.<br />
<br />
The best place to fight him (imo anyways) is in one of the corners of the room straight back from zone in (the big room you make the left in to get to him).<br />
<br />
He flurries &amp; enrages, 3 day spawn (I think) &amp; is killed often by guilds farming luclinte orbs for vt keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually pull him to zone in.  Easy as hell mob, just takes some time to kill.  Make sure you don't let him touch walls near zone in, as he's been known to warp / despawn.  He drops some decent stuff, but not too often.  He really likes to drop the PoS bracer / belt (both have ac, and no other stats).  If you pull him to the hall from zone in, it's a good place to practice for your guild on keeping a mob centered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">traps are basically like invisible mobs that spawn when you walk over them, the traps repop just like a normal mob would.<br />
<br />
If you head straight all the way, you come to &quot;T&quot;, left is vadyn, right is shei/IV.<br />
<br />
normally we pull to the &quot;T&quot;  room in the front left corner. weve pulled to zone in too, just long pull.<br />
<br />
3day spawn, normally killed pretty quick as he is easily trackable and 1 group doable. the loot is  pretty amazing sometimes, especially considering the difficulty. other times you will get straight up junk though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would call the Skybreaker drop frequency and the Caster shield drops rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">droog</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of about 15 kills, I think I saw him drop skybreaker 2 times, so definately not a common drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strikingone</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be prepared to see a few belts rot before a skybreaker, I think we killed him 30 times and had 2 drop, saw about 17 belts atleast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He has a ton of HP so your best bet is to pull him to the zone, otherwise you will have to deal with quite a few adds. At the zone in you only get one. He is slowable, but only by 60+ shaman. The Skybreaker is super rare. My old guild farmed the crap out of this guy when SoL came out and I think we got 2 or 3 in over 30 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoodTheDorf</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems rare, but I got lucky and got it on my 2nd kill of Va'Dyn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skybreaker is nice, but if anything, you should be killin him for his amulet.  13/19 with a DD is a great weapon, but id be going after the ammy if i were you.  100hp in neck slot is hard to come by if your not in ssra+ places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild took him down with about 12-15 lvl 55+ and a lvl 63 tank.  We had a puller tag the mobs as we went along and cleared the zone until we reached the large corner area Gallerus mentioned.  Our puller continued down the hallway to where he's located pulling the mobs to us until everything was cleared, then Va'Dyn himself.  Other mobs will repop before he's killed, so control the push and keep him close to the corner and away from the walls and fallen pillars.  He took about 10-15 minutes to kill.  He wiped us the first try when the enchanter hit him with an early slow that resisted and got aggro and was killed.  Make sure he's pulled with something low aggro so the MT can regain aggro quickly and you should be ok.  Once the slows land and a CH chain starts in rythmn you'll be fine, just watch the enrages and control his location.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I have never seen him drop skybreaker and i killed him a bunch.<br />
We are now post Va'Dyn level and not actively tracking him anymore and when a group last week killed him for the orb he dropped 2 skybreakers (they were trying to get lucid shards).<br />
From all the kills i think we had like 2 100hp necks 2 skybreakers now, lots of boots, no shield or toetwister that i could remember.<br />
And thats about 15 kills total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally have killed him once.<br />
<br />
We pulled him to the &quot;T&quot; room facing where he comes from had  amonk just pull him had 1 add (on purpose) MT was a 65 Warrior and  a 65 Pally soloed add took about 20 seconds on kill he got pushed alot and nobody died or even came close we had 2 cleric on CH was easy dropped Necklace and Shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hits 525 max, flurry, no rampage, enrages, 200k + hp.  With bard 50% slow, Va Dyn was swinging at 3.5 second delay.<br />
<br />
With a 65 war, rogue, druid, wizard, and bard, it took us about 13 minutes to kill him.  Nothing too difficult, just your typical Luclin high hp/ac mob.</div></div><hr />
