<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We just broke into time, and I'm currently working on charting my gear upgrade path.<br />
<br />
What items from Time are &quot;irreplaceable&quot; for a tank?  aka, talisman of vah kerrath, items w. call of the sky, shadow hive bracer from VT?  Only the time version?<br />
<br />
Items that will last well beyond time and never get rid of?<br />
<br />
My weapons will be the first thing i upgrade ( a DBoTW is probably something i will never see)--so I plan on going w. an ED and a eoe as my weapons till deep in GoD.  I'm not much of a 2 hand tank--dont' wanna burn DKP on em when I like the feel of dual weild.  Any other great aggro combos from time would help as well, but that's prolly what i'm gonna shoot for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pogi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pauldrons of Devestation, Platinum Cloak of War, Visor of the Berserker, Band of Primordial Energy all from RZTW Necklace of Eternal Visions from Innoruuk.  Quarm loot Silver Hoop of Speed, Prismatic Ring of Resistance, and Earthen bracer of Fortitude.  Prolly the best items from time imo.  A few aguments would make these items last into Omens of War expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well stuff that lasts forever would be clickies so RZ ring or Quarm ring to choose from.  Maybe Symbol of the Planemasters but the item itself probably won't be as big of an upgrade compared to other things your looking at bp/greaves/darkblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Facemask of Frenzy &gt; RZ mask</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First off, definitely shoot for a DBoTW.  An ED is pretty much worthless, EoE is something worth picking up, and even a Vanazir is a nice weapon if you really dont think you have a shot at a DBoTW ( but really that is what you should shoot for ).<br />
<br />
As far as items that still are beyond replacing in GoD so far, id say Darkblade of the Warlord, Edge of Eternity ( or JOS from ikkinz 2),  Symbol of the Planemasters ( if you dont have aten gloves ), Quarm Ring, Quarm Bracer, Veil of the Inferno, Cord of Temporal Weavings, and a Raex Chestplate.  <br />
<br />
Everything else you can get equivalent items when you get to GoD, IE like quarm ear and Qvic petting zoo event ear, etc.  That doesnt mean you should pass up a Quarm ear or whatever should one fall into your lap, but if you are specifically shooting for items you wont have to replace in GoD, id shoot for the ones mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye, DBoTW are dictated to top raiding tanks (as they should be)  I really doubt we'll see 5 or 6 of them in our tour of time....ya never know, but i'm not holding my breath.<br />
<br />
What is the rarity on Inferno Veil and Cord of Temporal Weavings, and etc.  Aka,  will we see 6 inferno veils so hold off or will we see a million EoE's so hold off?  or if you see a cord of temporal weavings, JUMP on it b/c you'll only see one or two?<br />
<br />
also what is rarity of Vanazir, EDestoyer, and pauldrons?  Facemask I'd really like but will prolly XP for the free version available from KT trash...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Veil of the Inferno has been reasonably common for us, but its really an all/all item (no one doesn't like more HP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you can't realistically get Quarm belt, get a P4 haste earring - Earring of Corporeal Essense or whatever. If you have even a slight chance of Quarm belt, save for one. You'll thank me later<br />
<br />
Pick up a decent belt in PoTime if you can't get Quarm<br />
<br />
If there's two things GoD lacks, it's belts and haste options. <br />
<br />
For you specifically, you don't want to be wearing a 140hp bracer in Qvic because you're shackled to it for haste and can't upgrade to Vadd's - bracers will probably be the first to rot since they're the easiest to reach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't limit yourself to haste items though, most tanks in my guild (myself included) use Tribute haste in place of item haste. Since you can flip it on and off now, it's rather cost efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bert DS Click Belt (if you don't have Tunare)<br />
RZ AC Click Ring or Veil of Inferno HP Click (doesn't stack with Ring)<br />
Sarym Proc Click Range<br />
maybe CT DS Click Cloak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You'll take an ac hit by choosing them over Pauldrons of Devastation, but the Shroud of Survival from Inny is another option for haste (46% haste too). It was pretty rare for us though, only getting one during our entire stint in Time.<br />
<br />
Id also suggest looking into the Veil of the Inferno, Symbol of the Planemasters, Girdle of Intense Durability, Silver Hoop of Speed, Band of Prismatic Focus, Necklace of Eternal Visions (nice neck and pretty common for us), and a Prismatic Ring of Resistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You'll take an ac hit by choosing them over Pauldrons of Devastation, but the Shroud of Survival from Inny is another option for haste (46% haste too). It was pretty rare for us though, only getting one during our entire stint in Time.<br />
<br />
Nooo... BAD idea to take Shroud of Survival is he's looking for something to last him a long long time. The decisions he makes on haste today will come back to haunt him in GoD.<br />
<br />
Shoulders especially have lots of options in GoD. From Kod and beyond you have:<br />
Fleshbound Shroud of Aggression (Kod single group)<br />
Deathwrap of Rites (Ikkinz raid2)<br />
Shale Shoulderpads (Ikkinz raid2)<br />
Stone Worked Pauldrons (Ikkinz raid4)<br />
Weighty Spined Shoulderguard (Uqua)<br />
<br />
Most notably of all, in addition to the above, shoulders are the only known slot to get a parry mod, other than a shield in Ferubi<br />
Imp Parry 1: Shoulderpads of Calamity, Rampart of Fallen Heroes<br />
Imp Parry 2: Whispering Amice <br />
Imp Parry 3: Forlorn Mantle of Shadows <br />
<br />
Keep your shoulders for parry mods and your back for dodge mods, unless upper GoD is many months in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Must haves (from a long term utility standpoint) i would say the following:<br />
<br />
Veil of the inferno<br />
Prismatic ring of resistance<br />
Symbol of the planesmasters<br />
RZ pouch(pvp only)<br />
Girdle of intense durability although this is upgraded in latter god.<br />
<br />
Ct cape is fairly useless as it does not stack with call of the rathe.<br />
<br />
These items alone stack with virtually everything and give you 15 ds 180 hps 45 ac 15 sv all and aggro.  And thats just based off of the clicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Deathwrap of Rites is a back item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">These 4 items for SURE:<br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord<br />
Veil of the inferno<br />
Prismatic ring of resistance<br />
Symbol of the planesmasters<br />
<br />
<br />
Some others that will last you a long time are:<br />
<br />
Earring of Corporeal Essence<br />
Girdle of Intense Durability<br />
Necklace of Eternal Visions &lt;-- shielding<br />
Cord of Temporal Weavings<br />
Silver Hoop of Speed<br />
Stone of Flowing Time<br />
Shroud of Eternity &lt;-- shielding<br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO this should be your short list for what you want to save for in Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Basically what Lanolar said ;0 Just like my magelo profile.<br />
<br />
Worst case, you bag the item.<br />
<br />
-Raex BP be a good one too, if you are just starting plane of time.<br />
-Skip legs, go for Joint legs.<br />
-EOE isnt a must, can get jagged onyx staff.<br />
<br />
MUSTS:<br />
- Bertox mask + quarm or uqua cloak click<br />
- Saryn belt click/ Saryn range click<br />
<br />
Quarm loot:<br />
-quarm earring, quarm cloak, bracer you can skip, cause vadd is free, but take all the quarm loot!!! Quarm range is nice but not a must, quarm ring is a must. SKip quarm neck for sure<br />
<br />
Loot that will last a while:<br />
TT earring<br />
Rallos shouldars/cloak<br />
Inny or Bertox neck<br />
Darkblade, then again Fleshbiter is around the corner<br />
<br />
Ring wise, quarm ring + free ikkin trial glyph prayer one is good enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necklace of Eternal Visions Of Innoruk. This is a must have imo<br />
<br />
Face off Arbitor of the Elements. (Facemask of Frenzy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dalthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">quarm bracer &gt; vadd bracer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Globe of Mystical Protection &gt; Quarm range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Should you miss out on the Silver Hoop of Speed, you'll have another shot at it in QVic with the Prism of Dark Hues.<br />
<br />
Demorgoth's advice about shoulders is worth concidering. Probably the best you can do is Cord of Temporal Weavings and live with a Mantle of Deadly Precission until you can get one of the parry shoulders he mentions.<br />
<br />
I went another route - Girdle of Intense Durability and the Weighty Spined Shoulderguard. Pretty nice indeed IMO, but not as &quot;Tankish&quot; when MTing truly heavy hitters.<br />
<br />
Finally, in a simular vein, it's somewhat surprising how many high level Tanks use Boots of Dispair - improved Taunt is gud. It kind of highlights a principle worth remembering at all times - you're a Tank, not a damage source. Resist the urge to loot anything that doesn't advance you as much as possible as a Tank and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i imagine the reason someone said vadd bracer &gt; quarm bracer is because they rot  fairly soon after you get qvic access, unless you're sharing msha spawns or some such<br />
<br />
the click on quarm ear isn't really all that nice, but the combat effects + stats are very nice, qvic ear doesn't have the combat effects<br />
<br />
i'd say saryrn belt &gt; quarm belt, and i'd also say there's no reason to worry too much about a haste item since tribute is ez<br />
<br />
edit: get lodestar instead of time ranges too, cbq so gimp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Prism of Dark Hues &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Silver Hoop of Speed because PoDH is clickable from bag, not the SHoS...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the click isn't useful at all for raids<br />
5% extra haste for xp groups that don't have bards in them is nice, i guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well,<br />
<br />
I picked up the Symbol of the Planesmasters and have about 20 dkp left to spend (avg spend value so far is between  20 and 80).<br />
<br />
Now the question is VDD (where i can get 2 weapon upgrade slots for the price of 1 (plus i read that the aggro lock is pretty tight) and use the points saved on VDD to go gear?<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Burn the points on dual weild weapons and let the gear suffer a bit.<br />
<br />
Basically<br />
<br />
Is the aggro on VDD (with A3 + planemaster proc) good enough in 90% of tanking situations to be non noticeable compared to current dual weild set up (boc + pet proccer A2'd and planemaster proc)?<br />
<br />
I don't want to lose ANY type of hard aggro lock or instant aggro lock by NOT going dual weild but I also want a punishing two hander that can both lock/hold aggro, AND dps.  The VDD seems like the perfect weapon for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The VDD is fine for tanking with all the way through txevu. Is there better? Sure, but it will serve you well and allow you to spend more on armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kamiccolo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">15 combat effects on quarm earring makes it the better choice for us imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bractos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Vanazirs is a nice enough tanking weapon with anger 3,  and you can remove the anger and have a nice non aggroing DPS weapon once you get a couple 1 handers.   Even if you are 5th in line you should see a darkblade in a few months if you kill rallos once a week,  they drop about 1 in 3  kills for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Even if you are 5th in line you should see a darkblade in a few months if you kill rallos once a week,  they drop about 1 in 3  kills for us.<br />
<br />
Heh I think others will argue that.  Varies a lot it seems.  1 out of 6 kills sounds reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>jobned</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">in my opinion go for shielding <br />
<br />
quarm cloak // platinum cloak of war.<br />
earthen bracer of fortitude (quarm bracer)<br />
greaves of furious might // jointed scale greaves<br />
necklace of eternal visions. <br />
raex bp.<br />
<br />
if you get theese you have shielding 15 allready before leaving potime. Stacks nicely with stuff as vadd helm and will make it much eayser to get to qvic )<br />
<br />
secondly darkblade realy rules. If you raid regularily every day probably some of the warriors you think are ahead of you for darkblade will drop down the list and you will move up. This is VERY worth going for.</div></div><hr />
