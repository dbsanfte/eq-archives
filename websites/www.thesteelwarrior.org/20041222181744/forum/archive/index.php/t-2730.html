DWing 2handers or being able to equip a Shields with that Raging Bash thingy (sorry bad memory) at first look it might seems extreem but its realy not all that bad. yes its alot more ac but only a hundred or so hp, it would fix the agro issue.</div></div><hr />

Our PoT upgrade is a 2H that can be used in 1H :)<br />
<br />
Plus i dont really think the wars with big 2H have agro issues.<br />
<br />
Just add aggregate agro on taunt :  8-16 x (lvl) / 10<br />
Thats  52 to  104 agro every 6 seconds at 65.<br />
The equivalent of 520-1040  / 2 =  770 ago per min...<br />
Almost 1 EB proc per min.<br />
 <br />
We cant have more hp/mitigation (will break tanking)<br />
We cant have more DPS (we're more than OK compared to melees)<br />
<br />
What can be done to fix us ? Some more agro<br />
<br />
2H+Shield might give more agro, but will break tanking  &amp; dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh once you get a BoW 1 handers are pretty much dead anyway.  We won't get dual 2 handers because that's just flat out stupid.  If we don't do enough damage then either fix the weapons or fix the damage bonus.  It's not rocket science.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course I would be DWing GSoTs, but yea, that would rule, and seriously, why the fuck not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate the idea personally. I'd like to cling to some vestige of reality -- 2hders are for, well, 2 hands. If you want to hand out new weapons or give warriors extra bonuses or whatever, fine, but dual weilding 2hders -- no thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're 2 handed becuase they're big and mean.<br />
<br />
After years of training and honing your weapon skills, donning more battle scars than stars in the sky, surpassing even the coveted title of Warlord, and facing things worse than death toe-to-toe and laughing about it afterwards, it sure as hell makes sense to me to be able to use 2 at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knikanek</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've thought about this as well, the only thing I ever considered reasonable would being able to equip a shield on the offhand with a 2hand weapon.  In days of past, there were shields that were weilded by being attached to the forearm allow both hands to be free.  This allowed them to have the protection of the shield for deflect blows, of course, they could parry too.  In EQ, I could see say having a GSoT, and that sheild on your arm, you could bash with the shield same as we do now, plus have that added AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only were there shields that attached to the forearm (bucklers), but there were also suits of armor that had a shield attached to the breastplate (Primarily used by heavy cavalry, but, hey, we have horses. ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carrais</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye i think that we should be able to use a Shield and a 2H weap or well just make it where you can only use 1 2H weap at a time in them. i think something needs to be done. /shrug but it wont i bet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think hand and a half wepons would be better. like real bastard swords still useable as a 1hander, but a little extra handle for swingin 2handed.<br />
<br />
the obivius question is what db would you use the 1h or 2h db?<br />
if its 1h the the real benifit of 2h  kinda goes out the window.<br />
<br />
iirc at some point we get a 1h with 2h like dam/del stats forget from where though prolly time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinj</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as I would love to duel 2handers I know it will never happen..specially with EQ2 on the horizon. Besides seeing a bunch of tanks running around with four arms would be a little odd, not bad on the surrealism though.<br />
<br />
/cynical on<br />
<br />
 Nothing is going to change drastically ever again. When the EQ2 goes live this game will just be left to rot till all the servers break down the lack of a player base will be unprofitable enough to continue.<br />
<br />
/cynical off<br />
<br />
A sheild and a 2handers seems a bit more reasonable, maybe a bit overpowered? Why not just make the AC a bonus instead of a stat? Could even base the bonus on the AC already established on said weapon and use the same formula that calculates the damage bonus.  Of course I dont really know much of anything at all so I could be completely wrong here.<br />
<br />
eh.  /c=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solution could be to make it an AA... Treat a 2h-er as a Bastard Sword, yes it could be used w/2hs but if you're big enough strong enough and bad enough you'd swing it with one hand as well.  Limit off hand to either shield (prefered) or a single hander.  BoW/BF or BoW/AoE would be 'interesting'</div></div><hr />
