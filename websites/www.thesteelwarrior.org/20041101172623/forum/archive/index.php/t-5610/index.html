Looking through my logs, this happened a number of times while I had aggro.  A Stonefist Clasnman would rampage, and nobody else would get hit, just me.  Also, I picked this selection because I had just successfully taunted, and it gives you a little more proof that this is not just a normal rampage round.<br />
<br />
edit: Yes, I have other people's hits on, so, if someone was to be hit by rampage, it would be there.</div></div><hr />

If it were a true rampage, you would see someone else get hit.  Do you even know what rampage is? :)  Anyway, after I finnish my homework, I'll look for the opposite.  A flurry in which other people are hit, as well as me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ok since I am not geting through to you unless you are boxing a couple ppl and parsing them all what you are stating here are not facts but rumors.<br />
<br />
Its like saying that you see noticable DPS increase after you get flurry just because you start noticing it proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">casai, if you have a mob quadding 2500 or more, believe me,  you WILL see if the rampage is true or not because ppl will die without any kinds of heals.</div></div><hr />

So you trust other knowledgeable members of your class boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Casai, I don't understand why you're not getting the point.  The clip from my log clearly shows that nobody was hit at all during the rampage, besides me, and that the mob had 6 attacks in one round.  Ask yourself this question,  what ability would strike a single target for an increased number of hits then normally possible?<br />
<br />
Ok here's what a true rampage looks like, you can easily tell the difference.  Biwin was tanking, and I was rampage tanking:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">as you said mob hits 2500 + procs 1 rampage can make someone dead pretty easy in 1 round or get you to low hp agro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No one has any solid evidence of any &quot;fake rampage&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Are you kidding me? Have you even seen my two log clips?<br />
<br />
Casai, do you know what rampage is, do you know what flurry is? If you look at my first log clip, you will notice that it is a flurry, when in fact the message says RAMPAGE. This is dubbed a &quot;fake&quot; rampage, since only one target is hit.  In my second log clip, you can see that I am hit after the message says RAMPAGE. This is an actual rampage, since I was not the primary target of the mob, but I was taking damage anyway.<br />
<br />
If for some reason, you can't see my posts, or if you can, and you just can't understand what the logs are saying, then trust us. Personally, I raid every day, and I have experienced a lot of mobs that have switched Rampage/Flurry messages, and I'm sure many others can say the same.  This is a fact, it's not a rumor.   I have shown you log clips, and if you really want, I can dig up more of the same, since I'm not entirely sure what you want to see from a &quot;parse&quot; of fake rampage.<br />
<br />
Let me also say this, when we say a mob has a &quot;fake rampage&quot;, we don't mean all mobs have this.  It's just a few mobs in the elemental planes, and some before them, Lord Mithaniel Mar being one example.  If you ever do Lord Mithaniel Mar, be the one to pull him, so it's ensured that you're on the top of his rampage list.  Then stand there, in awe, as you take 0 damage every time he Rampages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fake Rampage cannot be shown any further than what Niafix has shown since damage NOT taken cannot be parsed.    <br />
<br />
Fake rampage is a phenomina that exists on a number of mobs in PoP, from LMM to Deadly Earth Armadillos to Mystical Arbitor to Peregrin, and many more.  Fake flurry messages ALSO exist, where Flurry is the message you get, but Rampge is the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, I saw some Fake Flurries this weekend, I think it was in Plane of Air.  It said &quot;XXX executes a FLURRY of attacks on Crizpin!&quot; but the bonus hits were always on me instead, i.e. the mob was rampaging.  Very misleading message for healers to see, let me tell you.<br />
<br />
Any string of 6+ hits on the same target in a round is a flurry.  Anyone who is capable of counting red lines in their text window can see that MM &amp; most elemental mobs rampage when the message says flurry, and flurry when the message says rampage.</div></div><hr />

Both of my log clips were from raids, not exp mobs. I'm not sure if what I said means anything to you though, because I'm unsure of what point you were trying to make.</div></div><hr />

See how he has misses on in his window?  <br />
<br />
That gives you proof, because he has misses on.<br />

So in all those fake rampage parses, it would SHOW as misses to other people, instead of just no damage.</div></div><hr />

How much more proof do you need?  Just go fight the damn mob and find out yourself.  Set up rampage tanks when they aren't needed and you'll be taking away spot healers on your main tank</div></div><hr />

Anyone with Elemental access will tell you that fake rampage is very real. I xp in Earth all the time. Just about every trash mob there &quot;rampages&quot;, and when I'm tanking, no one in my group ever ever gets hit by it except for me. Every once in a great while I group there with someone else tanking. This generally makes me the puller, as the trees and mudmen there like to snare and root the tank. Pullers are always the first on the rampage list, yet, when I pull, I never get hit by rampage. Why? It's fake.<br />
<br />
You've got your proof in the parses. You've got every Elemental flagged person here telling you you're wrong. Who's talking out of their ass, again?</div></div><hr />

Youre high if you think mm was rampaing 8 months ago.<br />
<br />
I havent fought him in a while &amp; most likely wont again, but I bet he isnt rampaging now.  More likely the mt got rooted, raid pushed mm away from mt &amp; he started one rounding people so everyone thought they were getting rampaged.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know youre gonna tell me xegonys rampage message is real too.</div></div><hr />

MM was rampaging 8 months ago I dont think anything was done to him  MM has always 'rampaged', but up until a couple of days ago the attack that triggered when you saw the rampage message was a flurry. How hard is that to understand?</div></div><hr />

I cant quote on elemental mobs I never been since I quit in August, but MM was definatley rampagin when we were doing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Thulikore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I haven't fought MM at any point recently, but his rampage certainly wasn't hitting anyone other than the tank throughout the many times that I've fought him. If they've fixed that recently, then it's about time.<br />
<br />
And this is nothing like a situation where someone says, &quot;Gee, my ABC certainly seems to proc a lot more for me than my XYZ.&quot; This is a situation where anyone present can cleary observe what's going on without the need to parse anything.<br />
<br />
And if raids are somehow too complicated for you, then simply take a couple of your friends into PoE and pull a mob. Pull 5 mobs, 50 mobs, or 500 mobs if you want to. The only person who will be losing health during rampage is the person who has agro. You don't need a parse to see this, just a pair of eyes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">You can't be that stupid.<br />
<br />
There are (were, mighta been fixed) many mobs which, when they displayed the RAMPAGE message would actually execute a flurry, and when they displayed the FLURRY message, they would actually execute a rampage.  MM was one of these mobs.  I used to think, like someone else stated, that MM's problem was that he usually got pinned up on that lip around his room, so it was a Z-axis problem, but I no longer believe that.<br />
<br />
I saw it a lot in PoEarth, to the point where folks would joke about 'being on Flurry' in raid chat, which, if Flurry was behaving properly for the particular mob, would be impossible to 'be on' Flurry.  But in too many times to count, a mob would Flurry and hit someone other than the MT, in addition to hitting the MT.  Wow, that sounds like it's really a Rampage.  BUT OMG IT SAID FLURRY SO IT MUST BE A FLURRY OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG.<br />
<br />
That, of course, is assuming you actually know what Flurry and Rampage do.  You're claiming to not have played for 6 months and not fought in the elemental planes, yet seem to have absolute 'proof' that he actually rampages, when nearly everyone else here is claiming his message was reversed.<br />
<br />
Just a credibility check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">So you do agree MM rampaging now?<br />
But then everyone before I stood up and said that he was rampaging was claiming otherwise. So yes I am not going with majority. Just because everyone seem to claim something doesnt make it so. I saw what I saw. Maybe it was Z axis prob for a lot of guilds, I dont know. Maybe that was what got fixed but the way we were doing it, MM was rampaging.<br />
<br />
I cant say anything about ele mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">on all our MM kills from 10/03/03 and up to 18/12/03, MM rampages have been fakes. haven't killed him since. there was no Z-axis issue... since we've pinned him against the wall, and cornered him</div></div><hr />

It's that simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Killed him just after the DX9 patch.<br />
<br />
  <br />
Get the &quot;Lord Mithaniel Marr goes on a RAMPAGE!&quot; message, yet the tank takes flurry damage and nobody else gets hit.  <br />
<br />
We couldn't get him pushed on top of the pillar in the corner like we normally do, so it definately wasn't a z-axis bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
We pull with a bard, and if MM rampaged, we'd have a dead bard fairly early in the fight.  So, much to our dismay, the bard lives through MM.</div></div><hr />

However on the 7th I think it was he did not want to be cornered, so folks were taking Riposte damage instead.<br />
<br />
Made for a much more interesting fight at least  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Riposte damage.  Had a BL die like four times and she swore she saw the Rampage message when she got hit/splatted.   Since he wasn't turned until late it probably was Riposte and since the Rampage message was going off it was interpreted that way.</div></div><hr />
