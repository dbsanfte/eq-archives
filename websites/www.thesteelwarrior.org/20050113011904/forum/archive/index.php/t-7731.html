hehe<br />
<br />
Bein blunt, if knights got even a scaled down version of defensive, will be the day i quit mah warrior all together since SOE will have proven they they are speaking thru there asses and will have lost what little respect they have gained back in the last month.<br />
<br />
It is time SOE stood by there statements, they screw us on this, and god help em caus the fallout from this will make the mass exodus due to god screwups look like a walk in the flippin park.<br />

I would say I would quit EQ.  But I already quit over the nerf of defensive.</div></div><hr />

  You quit over one discipline being nerfed on like &lt; 3 mobs in all of EQ? What kind of lame ass reason is that? &quot;Wahhhhhh... My discipline doesn't work on a few mobs, I'm going to quit and pout in the corner.&quot; Shit gets nerfed. It happens. What a silly way of dealing with it.</div></div><hr />

*shrug* Some people value principle over practicality, I tend to agree. However, first it's 3,  then 4, then 8, so on, so forth, we can clearly see where this logic leads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know that there are mobs defensive never worked on in the first place, unless you think dropping a mob's damage from 1300-1400 to 1300-1350 is actually mitigation?  Although I swear by evasive, it isn't as reliable as defensive nonetheless (it is quite possible to get hit 4 out of 4 times on evasive, whereas it is not possible to get hit 4 out of 4 times for high #s on defensive assuming a normal DB/DI ratio).  There used to be quite a few mobs where Evasive doesn't work either (most Kyv named) because they effectively don't miss even after you disc evasive.  This isn't some kind of evil new secret thing that's out there.  Some encounters are just designed differently.  The only valid compliant I see is how using defensive/evasive actually can cause you to wipe with the change to Jhiru/DD as opposed to just doing nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until the problems are defined, it's unlikely an optimal solution will be found.<br />
<br />
There's not much point in having three tank classes if they all tank alike.<br />
<br />
There is also not much point in having three classes if one or two of them have severe problems getting groups or finding roles in raids or being useful to their firends and guildmates.<br />
<br />
A good many pretty rational players who happen to have SKs as mains feel that they have problems. They want some sort of fix, but in the large majority of cases they are not calling for nerfing other classes nor do they want to break the game by getting some uber ability. When Slein calls for a modified form of defensive, I don't need to agree with him, but I do think it's in my best interest to listen to him carefully. He doesn't strike me as a person who makes up problems, so he's trying to address issues that are real to him. If I disagree that a modified form of defensive is a good idea, that does not mean his problems are trivial or that they don't need to be solved by some other means.<br />
<br />
SOE has said knights will not get defensive. They've said it a number of times. Of various possible future outcomes, this one seems to be among the least likely. I don't see how imagining how bad it would be for warriors if knights had defensive will lead to much constructive thought on these issues.</div></div><hr />

The reason why this happens is because every tard thats ever rolled a sk, even the retired ones, feels that their opinion is somehow valid just because they play the class, hence degrading any resolution we try to come up with into a whos e-penis opinion is more valid and important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I quit because there have been issues with balance ever since GoD was released, and 4 months later all they could think to do is nerf the other class.  I don't have much faith they will unnerf it.  I don't have much faith they will not continue the trend.<br />
<br />
I would not care if they changed the DB to 1000 and DI to 5 to nerf defensive, but to create a new way to nerf it with a new ability is wrong, in my humble opinion.  It shows how out of touch they really are now.<br />
<br />
I will come back if they have a change of heart or if they sufficiently boost warriors in OOW such that without defensive, we have enough of an advantage to offset the missing utility.  Do I believe they will do either?  No, not really.</div></div><hr />

This happens on every board tho.  The way I know that there's problems in EQ is when everyone (or at least the vast majority, there's always gonna be some numbnuts who think everything is fine) agrees on the same problems.  That's how I know druids are fine...look at that board, it's a cesspool of retards who all have different problems.  The only thing they have in common is that they all don't know what they're doing.</div></div><hr />

I created a Warrior as my main based on how Verant designed, and described their role...QUOTE from eqlive.station description of Warriors:<br />
&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I enjoy working with our fellow tanks; Having an SK or Pally in an XP group so we can tank 2 or more at a time, or in a raid offtanking adds/minis and even stepping in as a last resort to MA to save the raid after the Warriors get chewed up. But I would not be happy with them mitigating damage as well, or even close to the abilkity of the Warrior class.<br />

&quot;Paladin: A Paladin is a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of life. She shares some Clerical powers and fights nearly as well as a Warrior, and also possesses the innate ability to heal simply by Laying on Hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shadow Knight: The antithesis of a Paladin, a Shadow Knight derives power from the evil gods he serves. He's part Warrior, part Necromancer and has the innate ability to damage flesh with his Harm Touch.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's like many are only looking at this as boss mobs. What about the other mobs where most other classes with exception of a warrior or cleric can solo up in to the elementals? Is that any more fair considering we rolled a class where we knew that was not going to be a good option? As far as how i would take it? My play time has been reflecting my attitude about the whole thing. Pretty much between the need to zerg so that you don't waste a 6hour raid that was identicale to the last 6hour raid you did and the class balance issues where uniqueness seems like it will be watered down even further, i am playing a lot less already. Water down the uniqeness even more would probably just help me to hand off my account a little faster. RL is part of that also but really it's become a little monotonous to me lately and frustrating.</div></div><hr />

in eq world, a warrior with a full spellbook of either a cleric or a necro would be more than uber, more than serverwide wellknown, it would be a hero !<br />

Shikarii WAS a super hero..or a subpar hero. or something.<br />
<br />
IN all actuality I kinda miss the EQ; well; not really the game itself but the comfort of not having to level-treadmill anymore....but OoW will take care of that.<br />
<br />
but if Knights got Defensive..I'd come back to EQ to see it with my own 2 eyes because it'd just be too funny to pass up.</div></div><hr />

I really dont give a shit about knights as long as warrior remains equaly desirable in group and raid setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bemyen</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to go on record here as a Paladin that wants nothing to do with having defensive.  I have said all along that the problems with knight tanking is Content not Class balance.  I think in single group content a Knight with the same level of gear required by the rest of the group should be able to tank.  On raid content the same rules do not apply.<br />
<br />
The current end game raid content I think has done an excellent job of providing utility for Knights and Warriors both.  There are currently mobs that require a warrior to off tank.  I think this is good.  It is about time that multi warriors had more utility on raids beyond waiting for the MT to die or doing average dps.  As a paladin my raid role has changed to a degree.  But I dont feel that I have any less contribution because of it.  There is still stuff that Knights need to off tank (Mainly because there are so many you need armored bodies on them).  But for paladins we get more value from healing, curing and working with the crowd control people then ever.<br />
<br />
I think a Knight defensive is just plain lazy.  Well designed content should allow Both Warriors and Knights to be desired in both single group and raid content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't even have to look at your Magelo to know you were a high level Knight.<br />
<br />
With the exception of small handfull of  high/mid level Knights that dearly want to be as much like Warrior as possible (predating GoD by months if not their whole career) most of the Knight Defensive crowd are players at 6k-7k HP's unbuffed that can't tank as well as they would like because they are not equipped for it.<br />
<br />
I don't think SoE should transform Knights into just a raid utility class, BUT it does give those who are not greared for handling any tanking assignments someting useful to do in raids - much more of a role than an undergeared Warrior.<br />
<br />
In the meantime 10500k-12K HP and 2k AC Knights can and do tank mobs.<br />

High HP/AC Knights do tank and the ones I’m associated with do it well, but the few that do not have the HP' or do not for the most part tank well are the ones that had cried for the change. I can think of one or two off hand that play their classes like a suffocating flounder, and they were screaming for mitigation changes. <br />
I have the pleasure of playing with a few leet knights. Defensive really is an insult to a GOOD knight if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but why should anyone be surprised? probably every class has had their class-defining spells nerfed in such stealth ways as this. consider the enchanter who can only charm one mob type in an entire zone. consider the unsnarable mobs that single handedly prevent casters from surviving without a tank. its a particulary severe nerf to druids and wizards who simply cannot solo zones with unsnarable mobs no matter how powerful they are and no matter how deep blue the mobs. clerics and paladins have had their pacifies severely nerfed with level restrictions applied to these spells. and i could go on.<br />
<br />
the problem is that sony does not know how to design challenging content so they cripple the players instead and say &quot;look at this challenge&quot; when in fact its only a challenge because they broke us.<br />
<br />
so the nerfing of defensive that might come? its already come (see my opening statement) and if its already come then why not make it worse.</div></div><hr />

This is nothing new.  Maybe it's not like say, 1300-1400 or 850-910 where you might as well not need AC either, but it's nothing new.  It's just a different kind of flavor so you don't always hit defensive and get an out of jail card.  There's still plenty of encounters where defensive is pretty much guaranteed safety (and if it's not your raid probably won't beat that mob anyway).</div></div><hr />
