Warmaster's Legguards with its 2% dodge stat<br />
Boots of avoidance with 2% dodge<br />
Stockade pauldrons with +15 defense<br />
Lots of good stuff with +defense and lot more armor or stats, e.g.<br />
Adamantium BP<br />
BP from scholo that has +25 defense!<br />
Helm of awareness with 2% dodge<br />
<br />
and so on...<br />
<br />
So anyone wana tell me why everyone's after valor? I checked the set's bonus, it was so so. Besides with added defense skill and dodge parry bonuses you become a better tank than with full valor.</div></div><hr />

I mean, a lot of priests or mages will see a patchwork warrior and think, &quot;god, what a gimp,&quot; whereas that same warrior in full Valor will draw ooohs and aaahs. plus people are whores to fashion (which is ironic to me because I think Valor could look better).</div></div><hr />

Dont aim for full valor, its not great gear, if you coem across a piece you would use maybe grab it other wise, dont.  I got valor BP at 55, used from 58-early 60 then upgraded thats the only piece i have ever used.</div></div><hr />

The warrior class sets aren't very tank oriented so far, kind of disappointing really when you get to the higher up sets. Yay for tons of hp and no ability to avoid damage!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't go so far as to say that,  AC from the valor gear will still mitigate damage and high hp is a good defense for magic based attacks</div></div><hr />

Not only that , 4 peices cut 5 secodns from intercept.  The +stm on the pvp gear dwarf valor big time and str/agi are comparable.<br />
<br />
edit: ok, I was wrong, the pvp gear gives slightly better stm, and slightly lower str/agi.  However, vlor does not give +crit on legs and chest like the pvp gear does.</div></div><hr />
