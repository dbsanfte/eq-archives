<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed time 2 weeks ago with 30 avoidance, and again last week with 0 avoidance, but havent posted the info on here since there wasnt much interest.  Basically the hit% of mobs was 3% higher consistantly without 30 avoid when compared to with 30 avoidance.  Every mob, regardless of evasive, defensive, no disc was right around 3% hit % difference.  So taking a shot in the dark, i would stay 10 avoidance would lower the mobs hit rate by 1% on average.  So if a mob landed 100% of hits, with avoid 10 he would now land 99%.  If he landed 1% of hits, he would now land rougly 0%.</div></div><hr />

Just curious because Avoidance items tend to have decent AC with the effect that naturally add's more AC.</div></div><hr />

You can actually see the raw numbers if u do something funky to your magelo.<br />
<br />
So While AC40 and AC30 +10 Avoidance may (or may not) give the same shown AC.<br />
The effect will surely be different. Since the Avoidance part of the AC cant be raised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I would assume he would have used the same &quot;AC&quot; value on the items (like AC40 item with no avoidance swapped with AC40 item with 30 avoidance.)<br />
<br />
Also, AGI adds a small amount of Avoidance, and 6 AGI is approx 1 Avoidance (60 AGI = 10 Avoidance.)  Agi above 200 and again above 255 requires more than 6 AGI (I don't recall the exact number) to gain Avoidance AC.</div></div><hr />

The hit % of the mob will be identical over timewith 0 ac and with 4000 ac as far as i understand.  My agi was maxed both ways, the only diff in ac was roughly 100.<br />
<br />
Edit avoidance 10 grants you 11 ac bonus on the item in addition to the 1.6 multiplier on the stated ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gear with AC on it, will not modify your avoidance.<br />
Gear with AGI on it may contribute to avoidance if you are not current 305 AGI.<br />
8 AGI = 1 Avoidance = 1 bonus AC when displayed in a char Inventory window.<br />
Avoidance 10 should equal 10 AC in addition, but I could buy a 1 point rounding error.<br />
<br />
In short, I agree with your comments, and I am sorry if what I said before was unclear.<br />
<br />
You did answer my question tho, even tho I asked the question improperly.  Your AGI remained the same with the change in gear.  Where I asked about the AC changing (and pointed to AC30 + 10 avoid = AC40) I was trying to insure the swapped gear did not produce any avoidance AC due to AGI changes.  MAX AGI with and without the Avoidance gear will do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question avoidance raises with me is, is it a whorthwhile enough effect to be worth sacrificing AC/HP on items to load up on avoidance?<br />
<br />
Right now I can think of 4 items a warrior could get with +10 avoidance each~  VZ globe, mindrider neck, ring from ikkinz 4, and rz cloak.  While the cloak is a no brainer because of it's AC, the globe and neck are a bit lacking in the AC areas (25 ac on globe, 30 on neck i believe), and the ring is fairly low on hp (185 I think), while high on AC (32).<br />
<br />
Is the mindrider neck a more valuable item then say, necklace of eternal visions?  Is losing the 15 ac worth the 10 avoidance, or does the mitigation still outweigh misses?  Same with VZ range in comparison to say, stone of flowing time?  What do you guys think about the value of stacking avoidance items even with the sacrifice of some AC?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with comparing avoidance and shielding, is that it will obviously vary from mob to mob.  Let me do some simple math for an example.  The numbers are just made up because i have actually never parsed quarm, but he is very simple since his db is an even 1k.  Slowed quarm has a delay of 51 or 5.1 seconds i believe, just assume 1 round every 5 seconds.  So 12 rounds per minute, 4 swings per round, not counting bash/kick/rampage.  48 swings a minute and an average of 10 minutes to kill him.  I belive our best time is just under 8 mins.  So now you have 480 total expected swings during a 10 minute quarm fight.  I have shielding 14 and avoidance 30.  Shielding 14 will cut every HIT by 140 damage, and avoidance 30 will cut his hit% by 3%.  Assume quarm has a hit rate of 45% over the 10 minute span and his average hit is say 1900(these are numbers i made up, i dont have a recent log in front of me).  Assuming 480 swings during the fight duration, 45% or 216 will land with avoidance 0, 42% will land with avoidance 30.  3% of his 480 swings equates to 14.4 hits, round down and multiply by 1900 which is his average hit.  This gives you an estimated damage avoided through avoidance of 26,600, or 44.33 dps(also remember quarms dps is only about 500 to begin with).  <br />
     Now lets calculate shielding.  216 times 140, which is the value each hit will be cut by with shielding 14 will give you a pure shielding value of 30240 or 50.40 dps.  However you have to take into consideration 3% of those hits will not land because of your avoidance.  480 times .42(your hit% post avoid30) gives you 202 hits at 140 per hit or 28280 (47.13 dps).<br />
     As you can see the higher your avoidance, the less the value of shielding becomes as a mob simply misses more.  Now lets equate 10 avoidance to 1 shielding.  <br />
Avoidance 30    Shielding 14<br />
44.33 dps             47.13<br />
<br />
Avoidance 10     Shielding 1<br />
14.78 dps            3.37 (based on 30 avoidance, scaled to 10 it is 3.52)<br />
<br />
So on quarm 10 avoidance is equal to 4.20 shielding independant of armor class.<br />
<br />
One warning is that shielding dps is NOT linear based on increasing avoidance, as higher avoidance will cut your shielding dps since the mob will now hit for a certain % less based on the avoidance value.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps to clarify how you can calculate the breakeven on mobs using their db values, hit%, and average hit values.</div></div><hr />

In summary, avoidance gives a natural AC bonus equal to the amount of avoidance on the item.  In addition, each +10 avoidance decreases a mob's  &quot;to hit rate&quot; by 1%. ?<br />

<br />
I am not sure, but I suspect the ac gained by the 'avoidance' part of an ITEM, while it raises the 'displayed' number does not raise the mitigation.<br />
<br />
A 'good' analogy is ATK.  Increasing a weaponskill, increases both the ATK number and the hit %.  Increasing ATK directly instead with an ATK buff or by raising strength, will not increase hit % but only distribution of hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All AC coming from gear, spells, etc is mitigation AC.  Mitigation lowers the damage on each hit closer to min damagae (DB.)<br />
<br />
Avoidance AC ONLY lowers the chance to hit of the mob.  So 10 avoidance is about 1 percent lower chance to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But Avoidance is a portion of your displayed AC.  I think what he was asking is, if you put on a 50ac cloak, and a 40ac 10avoidance cloak, will the ac displayed be the same?<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure the answer is &quot;no&quot;, because Mitigation AC has an innate boost to your displayed AC (put on a 10ac item and see your displayed AC increase more than 10), but avoidance is pure and unmodified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  I believe the order is 1.6 times displayed AC on item = bonus to AC stat.</div></div><hr />

Crystal clear now, thanks for confirming it for me.<br />

I just picked up the VZ range and the equation works out perfectly.</div></div><hr />
