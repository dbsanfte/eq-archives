CHSD doesn't have any thus far, nor do my Kizraks pieces (arms and helm).<br />
<br />
It seems that they've just added endurance wherever there was mana on items.  I hope this is just a kind of test... because doing so doesn't exactly address the problem.  We need END on items we actually use, we don't need to start competing for hybrid items. :/<br />

That's how I see it, anyway.<br />

None of the obvious warrior items that you would think would get Endurance added early (presuming this is the first stage of a series of updates) - Ornate armor, HoRZ, BoW, Puresteel Mantle. None on any of my VT gear - Ring of the Crimson Bull surely deserves some!? The only item I could have got endurance from I replaced last week, my Stonewood Bow.<br />
<br />
In my opinion anything that is warrior only should have Endurance added roughly equal to the HP on the item and anything that is warrior useable and has mana should have Endurance added equal to the mana.<br />
<br />
Note: I'm only looking at Lucy entries. My items could have endurance if more updates are due to that database. I never looked at my stats on items today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah, I agree with what the above said about just using a script to add it.  And it is far from complete, at that.  My Mask of Fourishing Fungus, which would fall under the category of the others, didn't have any END added to it.<br />

<br />
I use incite all the time. On some bosses I use Incite, one of the defensives (depending on the boss) and an offensive disco (usually Fell Strike) if time permits, and I never run out of END. I'm in Ornate and Ssra gear, so its not that uber. Unless we get some new abilities, why do we need this?</div></div><hr />

By using all your discs frequently.  In BoT this won't happen, in GoD/Hard LDoN it often does.</div></div><hr />

Try Fellstriking a mob, clicking after 20secs, Inciting, pop Furious, then Defensive . . . . I'm betting you either won't have END left for Defensive or your defensive lasts for 30secs maximum.  My defensive drops after about 18secs and I'm getting an extra 200END from a coupla GoD drops I wear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats the chain of discs I was planning on using on the 6th trial boss with a ranger to WS tank for the first 20ses.  I probably won't be able to pull that off unless they implement the END on existing gear before I make it to the Tipt trial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also us lower level tanks have END issues. I have to say I do in LDoN almost every time. If you are using your discs effectively you will burn it. I had one LDoN the other night where we had two named plus on each pull having to use it due to having a SK, Dru, Wizzy in the group. The SK and Dru are pretty much trained not to pull aggro but the silly robe wearer gets whacked and I have had to use Incite on the same mob 2 times during a fight. My STA, STR, and DEX are no where near 305 or even 255 unless buffed by a 65 shammy to the max. <br />
<br />
I am very much looking forward to these additions.<br />
<br />
I got one of the best compliments the other night and that was from an Enchanter who I have been LDoNing with for quite a bit she announced to the group that I was the BEST mez breaker she has ever grouped with. When I break mez she never gets hit even with two or three mezes and a slow on the mob before I pull it when we get multiples. It made me feel good knowing with these discs we are doing much better again. Just my thoughts and experiances.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing it's needed for abilities we have yet to see (like, whatever the heck they'll get out of the dregs of that failed absurdity called the opening system). Maybe it's just me being overly logical, or reading too much into it, but it seems that they're shooting for having an END/Ability system that is as robust as the spell system, or nearly so. If that is the case, I'd expect to see a lot more combat abilities make their way down the pike soon.<br />
<br />
Oh, and with regards to Ornate armor getting END, I am at this moment dubious of it because if they'd simply made a script to give +END to items with +mana, then the SK, Bard, or Paladin Ornate armor would show +END, but none of it does on Lucy just yet. Maybe later? It does seems like a major oversight if they don't. :\</div></div><hr />

The gains are meant to roughly match hybrid's gains from mana, so the +mana on items was certainly a guideline.  We went over all of the items manually to make sure we caught cases like Kizrak's, though, as well as other planar sets or pure melee-tuned items which deserved +endurance to match the +mana on equivalents for hybrids.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I'm running into mobs that drain a lot of endurance, like the stun AEs from Arch Lich in Ssra.  About 3 minutes into the fight my endurance is at zero, I can't put defensive up again or incite.  This means I have to spend several minutes before the fight inciting the hell out of him, to build up a nice aggro lead.</div></div><hr />

At the risk of derailing the subject of the thread - with the seeming cancellation of melee balancing part 2 - was there really any point to adding the extra endurance to items ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. As stated above it is fully possible to run out of END if you use your discs in challenging envs<br />
<br />
2. That certain encounters are designed to drain END<br />
<br />
3. Per today's patch message SoE stated that they would be adding new disc/skills that utlize END.  whether this actually happens is another area of debate.</div></div><hr />

From what I can see they took every warrior usable item with +mana on it and added an equal ammount of endurance, with a few exceptions being the myrmidon/warlords/bladesman quested armor and ornate/elemental. <br />
<br />
To me this seems like the stupid thing to do, instead of taking every warrior usable item they see requiring +end(ie bloodfrenzy/BoC) and adding endurance along the same ratio as hp:mana items.<br />
<br />
Im sure they have some kind of system to base themselves on to decide how much mana they put on items?<br />
<br />
100hp, if its a melee only item, mana = 0. If its an hybrid item mana = 50-85. If its a caster item mana=100-125. We've all seen these. <br />
Now why couldnt they just do the same for endurance? <br />
<br />
Casters/hybrids watch after your +mana items cus we're coming! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
*Edit* I really hope they're not done adding endurance to items, because BF has none while BBoE has 50. They're both war only, have no mana and are from roughly the same encounter(exiled/cursed). I hope its not just a sick joke.</div></div><hr />

This may also mean they have more work to do and this is the first batch of changes (why BoC didn't see any)?</div></div><hr />

Had some items with Endurance on them. However, my warrior only items like Heavy Rubicite Girdle, Myrmidon, Kizraks BP,  had no Endurance. None of my Velious or Luclin gear had End. <br />
Seems as though most items that have mana and can be used by the Hybrids that I have have endurance. Hopefully this is the first round of endurance ads.</div></div><hr />

in adding endurance ignore me.<br />
<br />
To those who are STILL unhappy, because they missed a few items, relax they said they would fix it, and im sure they will.<br />
<br />
Cant we just see something good for one time without someone whining?<br />
<br />
At this point no matter what they do SOME warrior finds a reason to be unhappy.<br />
<br />
They missed alot of things I think they should have put + END on,<br />
but lets face it, they added +END to approx 90 %  of everything in the game.... give them some credit, that was one hell of a task. It's not that hard to fix and they will get around to the rest.  <br />
<br />
We would have been waiting for months more for them to completely 100 % find every dam item in the game and make them all perfect before they patch it.  <br />
<br />
So lets TRY to wear happy faces for the time being eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defencive still took my to the same endurance %. Using incite with full endurance takes me down to 94%. The night before it was 96%. So it doses not seem I have more. Any one else notice this? And yes I was full raid buffs, 305 to all stats. Have had 500 end from god items and about 600 more from yesterdays patch.<br />
<br />
Hope this is covered in the reapatch today...</div></div><hr />

You were using 4%? Utterly amazing.<br />
<br />
I got around 1500+ endurance yesterday and incite is using 5% for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes i only had 500 endurance from GoD items befor yesterdays patch and was using nearly 4% each time i used incite with full raid buffs.<br />
Now i have total 1000+ end from items, and use 6-7% per incite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
500 endurance is not going to halve the cost of incite, pre patch. I smell a rat.</div></div><hr />

I was able to use furious, defensive, fellstrike in a row, along with generously slamming the incite key and i didn't run out of endurance, if I recall correctly I even had most of a bubble of END available.  Before if i didn't watch my usage of incite I could burn all of my bar easily before defensive was gone.  I made about 1800 END from items yesterday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at your gear, I am suprised Incite didnt cost you nearer to 8-9% for the patch. I'd have to agree, based on your equipment, that it would now cost you 6-7%. But if you really think anyone is going to believe incite took 4% of your bar (meaning you had a 6250end pool) before the patch, you are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
incite = 250 end<br />
4% @ 250 end<br />
<br />
250 / 4 = 62.5 * 100 = 6250 end<br />
<br />
Sorry, but the average Time Warrior had 2800-3000 end before the patch not including Gates Gear. Sit down</div></div><hr />

These are the exact numbers I found last night when I messed with incite in my new END pool.</div></div><hr />

Now, with more endurance from items, incite takes 6-7%?? Common sense would imply that if something costs X%, and you get more endurance, the ability would now cost less, percentage-wise. You are mistaken. As ODB put it, sit down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">was wondering, did they &quot;replace&quot; our existing ENDUR pool with the +ENDUR on our items or was the +ENDUR on our gear added to the existing ENDUR pool?.  Just curious..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was an addition too what we get from stat pool.  <br />
<br />
on 3/9 you had X pool<br />
on 3/11 you had X+Y pool.  Y = +END items added<br />
<br />
Sorry, but the average Time Warrior had 2800-3000 end before the patch not including Gates Gear. <br />
<br />
No possible way.  On 3/11 my pool is 3950 and I only gained +725 endurance from the &quot;patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think your incorrect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no he is correct. cause i remember doing the math to see how much of an Endurance pool i had and came up with 3125, and that was with all melee stats maxed.<br />
<br />
it would seem that having X amount of raw END on an item in actuality gives you Y amount of END towards your pool, similar to the way raw HP on an item gives you more towards your HP amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i had and came up with 3125 <br />
<br />
Ok, well that is more then 2800-3000.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that full maxed stats with no +end items at all is more than 3125 and less than 3200.  And that is still more then what he had stated was an average which I said was not correct number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, so we can agree that prepatch END pool was 3100-3200ish</div></div><hr />

I guess I was mad at the fact that having more end on my gear didn’t make an obvious effect.</div></div><hr />
