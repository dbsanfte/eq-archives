<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmm, relatively new weapon that I imagine not too many higher level warriors have had a need to play with... but how is it stacking up?<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to find any info on how much stun the proc is, or if it works on mobs past level 55. Can anyone testify for or against this weapon, aggro wise?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a zero second stun. Like Ykesha proc, without the DD. It's an aggro proc, pure and simple. And it works pretty good from what I hear.<br />
<br />
DPS-wise, 13/21 is pretty good. Sure the copper hammer is better. But the sandstone-hilt sword is cheaper on my server (NOTE TO HAAS: This is only for people who don't want to CAMP the hammer! heh).</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I wonder, as Lucy says it's a 2 second stun. I've seen this discrepancy before, where it lists a 0 second stun for the Sturdy Wrapped Bow but it's proc actually lasts for 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
I spose I'll just have to shell out the dough and see...<br />
<br />
Any more thoughts? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would go with a sword of the bloodsworn, usually 10k-ish in baz, easy to camp, better ratio imo and better stats/hps, with a 75dd+stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While we're on the subject.. have any tests been done approximating the aggro from a Planar Stun or Force Shock type proc?<br />

I have the RSHS and I love the agro I get from it. The proc is a 2 sec stun as I have seen it stop the combat animation for a few sec and 30DD.  If you do a search on the boards here there is a past thread that states the stun effect procs works on the golems in POV which are at least level 62 so I am guessing it goes all the way up to 65. The only think I have found that resists the stun portion are the fabled mobs. But I think they are immune to stun anyway. (The effect is like that of the old stun when it goes off, the big red circle around the mob in case you care.) I am only 51 but so far the weapon has done great for me to hold agro.  Frankly it looks cool too if you ask me.  Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played around with one when I found it up in the bazaar mismarked price wise, proc is a 30dd + stun, seemed to proc fairly often but seeing as I have a SotB and a CHoS I didn't feel the need to keep it.</div></div><hr />
