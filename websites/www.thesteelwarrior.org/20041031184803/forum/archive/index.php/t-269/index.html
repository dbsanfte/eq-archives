<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Based on what SoE said about Legend getting new stuff 1st , that is 1 month before other servers  for revamps, and 3 to 4 months for new zones<br />
so hate will be here in like 2 weeks cos it is a revamp , and veksar will be here in a looooong time , as it is a new zone only in test server right now and still not on SH ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any of our Test Warriors been to Veksar yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For those of us who can't access most of the EQ game sites from work(damned firewalls), what's Veksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Underwater city in LoIO. You can still see where it was origionally designed to be. It was one of EQ's nice fuckups.. from what I read from an old Dev, they made the zone and itemised everything. Then, just before release they realised it was an underwater zone! :eek: <br />
<br />
So, in order to meet Kunark release, they scrapped it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Venox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am not on a test server nor is EQ working for me right now (it freezes every 10 seconds or so cause my old vid card crapped out so I put in my non-supported by EQ vid card) but I heard that it was NOT underwater and that it was really laid out well. I for one would like to seek all the info on this new zone as I have viewed it with www.eqzoneviewer.com (I think that is the link) and it looks like a HUGE version of Seb/Guk. So its basically just like old world dungeons (Sol A/B, UGUK/LGUK) so it should be awesome =).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds great. Something else I've always wanted to see is a dungeon who's entrance is in one of the deserts of Ro or Oasis of Marr, that is laid out like an ancient egyptian pyramid and full of traps and mummies/wraiths/ghouls/ghosts and stuff.  And hoards of treasure of course. :)  I'd like to see some content like that added to the old world.<br />
