<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No. I have twinked some alts with some ornate stuff. The alts were 55+ and only one had any flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok so then all i need to do is buy the mold, get the mark and the rest of the stuff and i'll have the gaunlets?<br />
<br />
No flag needed?<br />
<br />
Is there a skill check when the combine is done and where is the forge that I would have to use for the combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why are tanks buying ornate guants? SS-quest gloves are superior.  Is it a question of HoT being out of reach?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, even with Myrm gaunts, I guess it's situational if you solo a bit, since the haste is better than the Eyepatch of Plunder....and a whole lot less fuckin annoying.</div></div><hr />

Just give the dwarf in PoT in the building next to the bank 500pp.  He will give you Warrior Emblem and a Forge.  Just put Emblem, Mold, Tanaan Hammer, and 2 Sheets in there and combine and bam you get your gloves :)</div></div><hr />

30% haste, lasts 1 hour +, readily available in the bazaar, no MQ needed.  Everyone should have a pair. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cause I dont want to camp SF for 40+ hours to get the eyepatch.  Buy/Group for the mold and the rest is cake.</div></div><hr />

(yes, I see why folks might want it for the haste.  Since I hunt in places where a slower is a prereq, I get a pocket speeder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Umm, most of my exp in Tier 1 (up til 63) was done with RL friends.  I was usually the slower of the group (ToD) and the extra 30% haste would have been very helpful as I generally had no haste other than cloak (34%).  Besides, I find myself wearing the Ornate for the AC improvement over Myrmidom's.  10 AC or 33 (ND3) HPS is the question you have to ask yourself.  Since I very rarely have a Cheal hit me when I have less than 33 HPS left, which is the best piece of gear for me?  The odds of this timing occuring with Tier 2/3 mobs is pretty small.<br />
<br />
Self buffed and with Virtue, 33 HPS is less than 0.5% of my HPS.  You cant even see a 33 pt hit on the bar.  Plus I have the additional benefit of being 64% self hasted pretty much all the time for situations of slower dieing or spell haste wearing off until it is refreshed now (haven't tried Tier 3 without slower yet).  Maybe someday I will die because of the 33 HP's but I have to wonder if maybe someone else will die because the mob did 33 Hp's more to them because their AC was lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Knikanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd like to have the gloves for the haste, I two box with a cleric and haven't gotten a ToD yet (no pp to buy any of this stuff, so I just gotta camp).  The self hasting would be nice for when I'm not grouped with a haster!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">one of the best items you can get for the money.<br />
no matter if exp grinding without slower, farming greens, duells or what ever. Lets say upgrading from 90hp SS gaunts to 125hp gloves of warding is a &quot;nice&quot; upgrade but ornate gaunts are so handy, just because they are so unique (oh well add THO belt and eyepatch, eyepatch haste lasts only 10mins thou).<br />
You still can bag them for the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Buuhmann sux.<br />
<br />
btw, ornate gloves are good clickie haste, not equip upgrade, clickie clickie clickie! $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As Dima says, warriors don't buy these gauntlets to *wear* them, they buy them to *click* them. :)</div></div><hr />
