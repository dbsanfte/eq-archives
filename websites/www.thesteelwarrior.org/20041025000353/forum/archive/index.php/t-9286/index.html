I am currently at the warrior backlog part which is Veksar. I was wanting to go <br />
ahead and get the Dragorn piece while I could.<br />

Anyone able to loot it being to the Veksar stage but not completing it yet?<br />

I am not 100% positive but I heard that lots of people couldnt loot Dragorn Eye out of order. What I can tell to you is: Galuk Drek is for sure the bottleneck of epic, even in low populated servers like Maelin (wich I am from) people camp it all day. actually more than 1 guild, I camped him for 55 hours and know the pain it is. Right after I killed Galuk I checked Dragorn and it was up, I couldnt kill that day, the next day I went there and Dragorn was still up, again I didnt have enough people to help (bring 2 groups to be safe), 2 days after Galuk I went to WoS and Dragorn was up, then I killed him, so from my experience I can tell that Dragorn isnt hard to spaw, worry bout Galuk, once u get Galuk u can finsih your epic piece in 1 day.<br />

You could only loot it like the first week of Omens, when I got mine.</div></div><hr />
