<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been trying to boost my MR as much as possible with an eye towards tanking the carprin cycle mobs with the nasty lifetaps at -200 MR adjust.  I know with bard resists I will be way over the 500 cap.<br />
<br />
Does anyone out there have any solid data on how the cap works?  I read this thread (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=17218) on the cleric boards.  They have conflicting theories:<br />
<br />
Theory 1) resist adjusts are applied before the cap, so there is value in having &gt; 500 resists.<br />
<br />
Theory 2) The cap is a solid cap and any evidence to the contrary is luck<br />
<br />
Theory 3) I never resist any AEs.  /cry<br />

Thanks for your responses.</div></div><hr />

Since mobs cant proc on a miss, simply use /disc evasive. I dont recall resisting their LT before, but i recall seeing a big difference when i switched from defensive to evasive tanking them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
those lifetaps on carpin and bertoxx cycle can easily be resisted at 500MR.<br />
<br />
bards are your friend.<br />
<br />
that being said, beyond the CoD cycle the value of resists begin to diminsh somewhat with many elemental mobs getting resist adjustments on thier AE's.</div></div><hr />

I don't ever remember the lifetaps being a big problem when we progressed through Crypt of Decay, except for maybe the first two times we tried. Just suck it up and take it like a man!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time resists over 500 &quot;matter&quot; are when you have a debuff spell on you.<br />
<br />
Resists of 800 capped at 500, with a boss mob who casts some AE with a neg 400 adjustment, will hit you every time as you have an effect resist level of 100 (500-400).<br />
<br />
Resists of 800 capped at 500 where a mob first casts an AE that is -400 to all resists will leave you at 400 resists (800-400).<br />
<br />
Real world examples:<br />
<br />
You have 600 resist capped at 500.  Some Wizzie mob tries to lure of ro you (-300 resist adjust). You will resist the spell as if you had 200 resist (500-300).<br />
<br />
You have 600 resist capped at 500.  Some NPC casts malosinia on you and it lands somehow.  Your resists are now 600 - 70 = 530, or capped at 500 still.<br />
<br />
Spells that debuff (duration) a resist are helped by resists over 500.  Spells that have innate resist adjustments are not helped by resists over 500.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS God thats a confusing explanation, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a follow up question, are there any mobs that proc or AE a mad debuff?<br />
<br />
To ask it another way, is there any point for being over 500?</div></div><hr />
