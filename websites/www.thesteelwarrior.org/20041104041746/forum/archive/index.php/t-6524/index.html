<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>axxeman01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How can you tell if this event is ready to go?  Everything I've read points to the following 2 mobs being up:<br />
<br />
Decorin Berik and Decorin Lieutenant<br />
<br />
If these 2 are up, does that mean the event can be done?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tricsun-Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rallos Zek also has to be up.  Rallos Zek, not Rallos Zek the Warlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>axxeman01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Confusing, can these be tracked, or do you need a rogue to check?  Everything I read said you kill those two triggers, kill VZ and TZ, then the fake Rallos spawns, get him to 60%, gate out, return for the real deal holyfield...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure if RZ would be on track, I would assume he would even though he's not targetable, but anyone can check him. Just go to the tunnel towards the pit as soon as you get to the pit look straight up and you will see a ledge, that's where fake RZ will be. You will need to move to the side in order to see him on the ledge but he's clearly visable twirling his fiery axe around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The two named Decorins that start the script are always up (respawn time is the same as every other mob in the zone), the main thing you need to look for is Rallos Zek. <br />
<br />
He can be tracked, or you can look for yourself to see if he is up with invis, just run to the edge of the pit and look up, you will see a little balcony, and if RZ is up, he will be standing there.</div></div><hr />
