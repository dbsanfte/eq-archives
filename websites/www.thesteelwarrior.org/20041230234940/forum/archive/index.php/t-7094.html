<br />
I am having all sorts of problems keeping aggro with the current set of weapons I use. Now, I tried using my windblade for a while that have been gathering dust for a long time, and lo and behold I kept aggro like 100 times better. The thing is that I dont understand this.. I have always been under the asumption that 2 fast weapons was better... Well I know there are a lot of people who know stuff like this, with dps and math which gives me a headache..<br />
<br />
(I know I should put aggro augments in the weapons, just haven't got around to it yet.)<br />
<br />
My magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=732226) <br />
<br />
Thankfull for any tips regarding this issue.. Also I am wondering how to use taunt, now I bash it constantly, but since it is from what I heard only a function to put me on the top of the aggro list, should I use it any other way?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
With no AA's, and normal procing weapons, you will get 3 procs a minute duel wielding, 2 procs when using 2hander.  Add Augments and AA's and that number difference gets alot more noticable.<br />
<br />
I have always liked 2handed MAing (even before it was popular because of riposte).  Think agro, without looking at procs is better at start of fight, since your first few hits are bigger hits.<br />
<br />
I didn't look at the library, but might be something there that gives parses showing agro for 2handers vrs 1handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things:<br />
<br />
1.  Agro - I think the problem is, those weapons in your magelo are not good agro weapons.  The cheapest option is Greatstaff of Thunder (also a 2 hander like the Windblade, but much better agro) - at about 100 plat.  The cheapest dual wield option is the Droga weapons - Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn - combined these run about 12 to 15k.  (the prices I listed are on Emarr)  I had good luck with both of these combinations - and both easily beat a windblade when it comes to agro.  I haven't used the weapons in your magelo, but from everything I've read, they suck for agro.  By the way, you can sell the weapons you have now, buy both of these combos, and have plenty of plat left for armor upgrades  ;) .<br />
<br />
2.  Taunt button - don't mash!!  :p   Only use taunt if you lose/don't  have agro.  The reason is, you want it available immediately if/when you lose agro.  What I do is hit taunt when the mob gets to camp (puts me on top of the hate list if it's successful), then immediately hit Incite (adds 400 hate, which now puts me 401 hate above the next person on the list.)<br />
<br />
3.  Other agro advice<br />
 - get anger augments - at least for your primary weapon.  For me, I know I'll be upgrading soon so I only bought anger 2 for my primary, but it's made a huge difference.  I'll go for anger 3 in your primary once you have a weapon you think you'll keep for a long time.  By the way, if your group doesn't mind the knockback from the Ykesha augment, it's a better choice than anger 2 since it's the same hate and has a DD component (I mentioned it to my group and, well...the reaction wasn't pretty  :rolleyes: .)<br />
 - have multiple sets of weapons - I have a 2 hander and dual wield setup.  In some cases I seem to get better agro with one than the other.  Also, I primarily dual wield now, but if we're pushing things I'll switch to a 2 hander to save on ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nimdraal</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that the copper hammer of striking and the blodsworn are better due to that they have stun effects in them. The problem is that my weapons look so damn cool! ;) It is like driving a jaguar, instead of a opel, even though the opel might be faster...  What I was most curious to was why the 2h slashing was better. Looks like I will follow the 2h slashing, and follow some sort of dps line in that choice of weapon. And put the aggro augment into that instead. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice on aggro, will follow it and maybe it will save me from  catching some sort of warrior carpal tunnel syndrome ;)</div></div><hr />

Your weapons may look cool but if you want aggro you need to sell them both. If you like 2handed weapons, buy a Greatstaff of Thunder and put an Anger augment on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is not the answer I wanted to hear!  :o <br />
<br />
What about some sort of aggro producing weapon on my windblade? *smiles hopefully* I noticed those anger augments are restricted to 1h weapons only.. that basically sux... But an Ykesha on the windblade might be something for me. <br />
<br />
I know I am a bit silly that want to look cool and at the same time be a good warrior. I mainly play with my girlfriend, raid on very very rare occations, normaly it is just me and her that play togeather in non PoP zones. So I don't need the raid tank focus, I just want a decent aggro and to look cool! Hehehe<br />
<br />
Basically I need more dps also then to be able to take damage..<br />
<br />
You are giving me something to think about though, and I am thankfull for all comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Faster weapons only meant agro a couple of expansions ago.  Procs mean agro now.  Looking cool or doing damage is really low on my list of things to look for when looking for a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might want to play a Paladin or SK if you will pick your gear with regards to looking cool instead of functionality.  Warriors have very little choice when it comes to weapons.  If you want to be a good warrior you will get the weapons with the best and most aggro producing procs that you can.  If you want to hold the cool looking sword and still hold aggro, you will need stuns or snares or fear for that.<br />
<br />
People are giving you very good advice, I would suggest you take it.  Selling those pieces of crap you are wielding and buying/camping the Droga set would net you some nice PP to upgrade your gear with.  Keep the Windblade for when you are not tanking, which I assume it will get a lot of use.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you will be looking very cool standing there saying <br />
<br />
/g gee sorry you all died, I was admiring my weapons and how cool they look while the mob killed you all.  Don't worry, weapons this cool should hold aggro so I will /bug it and it should be fixed.<br />

 Best bet is either work LDoN for your anger augs, or save up and buy a BoC, or join a guild doing AoW+ for upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nim, for the style of playing that you do, augementing your Windblade with Anger 3 would probably be a good idea.<br />
<br />
If you do that, keep in mind a few things:<br />
<br />
1) You will need another dps weapon for when you are not tanking (I.E. War Marshalls Bladed Staff)<br />
<br />
2) The Windblade with Anger 3 will not be enough aggro with *most* level 65 groups.<br />
<br />
3) If you desire to raid more, you will need a much better aggro set-up.<br />
<br />
If you are duoing with a healer, the Windblade with Anger 3 should do fine. And keep in mind that most of the responses you see on this thread are from warriors who are looking to achieve maximum aggro. Play the way that fits your style, not anyone elses.<br />
<br />
P.S. I don't know about your server but I seriously doubt your two weapons could be traded for a BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is nothing wrong with having good looking weapon(s) and valuing high DPS.  But you also need a functional aggro weapon in your bag, such as a GSOT, for when you're in a situation that calls for it (i.e. just about any group).<br />
<br />
I agree with your assessment that aggro doesn't matter much in a warrior-healer duo (I'm assuming your GF is some kind of healing class).  It's pretty safe for them to sit back and watch you kill the mob, even if they COULD outaggro you by doing more.<br />
<br />
This will not fly once you expand beyond the duo, however, and you should not try to make it work.  As soon as you add a third person (who is almost guaranteed to outdamage you), your role switches from damage dealer to damage sponge.  Accept that, break out the GSOT or CHOS, and let the third person do their best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always want max aggro and would never spend anger 3 points on a weapon without an aggro proc myself.However,my guilds present SA has always used auged dps weapons for tanking.He likes dualwielding,is concerned with appearance and ratios and was late/unlucky for a BF drop.The other obvious alternatives haven't appealed to him so he's kinda gone his own way.I think he's presently using a double edged stormblade in main and a (cry) SPOD offhand both auged with anger 3.<br />
<br />
Now keeping in mind hes got wa-5,ambi and other offensive dps aa's it actually works pretty well for him.He doesn't seem to have any prolems with aggro in groups( my aggro is noticably stronger tho) and has tanked ep raid mobs without difficulty.Occasionally, he ganks aggro from me with that setup when I'm tanking...usually tho when my hate has been mitigated in some fashion.He got toasted by Reparm the other day when I got stunned and knocked back early in the fight.Other people were wielding BF's and BOC's in close Prox and he was the only one to get smucked.<br />
<br />
Sooo, personally I think a raid tank shouldn't scrimp on hate.Aggro is above hp and ac considerations within reason on my list.I'd plan out your upgrades to eventually wield eb weapons or possibly a sews with a3 augs pre time.However,that's just IMHO.You can probably have a lotta fun going off the beaten path and auging unusal setups with a3 supported eventually with WA-5.If you're not going to ma for a raiding guild you can probably do fine without the traditional weapons.Although, It makes me cringe to think of spending a3 points on a non aggro proc weapon at this point hehe.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, you are not actually in that bad of a situation. First things first -<br />
<br />
You are a warrior, sell your Windblade and 1hers - those are ranger weapons.<br />
<br />
Take your fat bank account to the bazaar and buy -<br />
<br />
1. GSoT - 2h agro weapon<br />
2. WMBS - no  tank DPS weapon<br />
3. CHoS - 1h agro<br />
4. SotB - 1h agro<br />
<br />
Now you are pretty much covered for weapons and you should still have a truck load of cash left over to buy gear upgrades. While you are at it, go ahead and sell your haste belt. Then you are all set to buy -<br />
<br />
1. Cloak of Flames - similar stats as your cloak, but more net stats with better belt<br />
2. Heavy Rubicite Girdle - huge increase in HP/AC over current belt/cloak<br />
3. Any bracer - cultural, ornate, mana-threaded<br />
<br />
If you shop for the deals, you may even have enough cash to pick up another earring. Doing this will get you far superior agro, more HP, and more AC and probably a little coin left in the bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nim,<br />
<br />
I have several different weapons and reasons to use them in my backpack.<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking and Hooked So'shar for aggro... Greatstaff of Thunder for dps and it's stun effect, Fabled Executioners Axe for pure dps, and a Sword of the Crypt Keeper augmented to have a double lifetap.<br />
<br />
There are times when I am in a group and I am not the MA so I don't want aggro.  I match my 2 handers to the occasion for that.  When I am the MA I find the dual weild is a better option.<br />
<br />
I agree with the idea that augmenting a weapon that has no natural procs is ineffective.  I have used the Windblade and War Marshall's Bladed Staff... and I found the overall dps of the Greatstaff of Thunder was compareable, plus you get the added value of the stun the GSoT offers.<br />
<br />
I am not a uber warrior with tons of plat in a powerful guild.  These weapons I use are relatively easy to acquire and with the right use of the Taunt button and Incite I have little trouble holding a MA position in a group.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
