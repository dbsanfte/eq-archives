<br />
Saw a bunch of new type 7/all slot augs dropping in GoD, in particular a 15ac one (yay me) and a 25 hp/mana/endurance one.  Also had a high dmg/dly 1hs drop with a 175DD + stun to level *2000* (typo??) proc- grats to the rogue that's gonna die each time it procs. ;)  Any other nifty bits seen yet?<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. forgot the zone name, sorry- was the twisty water concourse one past the ruins w/ the watery looking dome. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at the proc it doesn't have a level limit on the stun, most stuns say Stun (1.00/65) or something, with the 2nd number being the level limit.  (not that Lucy always shows the full picture..)<br />
<br />
edit: oh the zone must have been Ferubi? Pathways with water on both sides everywhere?</div></div><hr />

The resist adjust is nice but the copper hammer that people bitch about the knockback on is Push Back: 1.  Kinda sounds like this thing is gonna blow the mob halfway across the zone.</div></div><hr />

This has a pushback of 16. And yes, it does knock the mob halfway across the zone :). A pushback of 15 cannot be that much different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The in-game link for the weapon said level limit *2000*; I right clicked it while on the corpse, it wasn't doctored.  So get set for end game level 2000 mobs (veeshan? ;) ) or it's a typo... and yah, the zone was ferubi.<br />
<br />
Didn't notice the knockback 15 bit, I'm gonna have to have a few words w/ our rogue that got it...<br />

knockback 15...wow...anyone with a BFG know the knockback number BTW? no access to Lucy at work :(</div></div><hr />

Think of the AA exp though!  I bet you would get 10 points just for killing one mob.  Anybody know a good place to solo level 2000's with a fungi tunic?<br />

BFG is the same as stronghorn's horn BTW.</div></div><hr />

<br />

It's looked like a BFG ( for you old school FPS gamers ) when equipped :D</div></div><hr />

Knockback is a fun thing to use to piss of rogues and it doesn't knock them half way to heaven, but enough for them to summon you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BFG knockback is 16, sword is 15... but the bfg has a knock UP component of 2 as well, which is why it send stuff flying so much better.  You'd get the same effect from the sword if the mob were facing downhill for instance, but on a flat surface it wouldn't go nearly as far.<br />
<br />
And yes, it was definitely fat-kid-after-icecream-truck while the rog was using it that night... we'd been blaming casters for pingpong actually. ;)<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. the augs I saw dropped from lower leveled &quot;named&quot; spawns- one groupable stuff.  Definitely made me reconsider buying any more LDON augs, the GoD ones are much easier to get and in most cases better than what's available from the ldon npcs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Head to Innotule Swamp....<br />
Head for &quot;The Hand&quot;...it should show up on the map, it used to have an troll SK spell vendor back when trolls owned the swamp (shaman made potion of the swamp will gate u right intop of the hand)<br />
<br />
On the hand theres a guktan called &quot;something The Fist&quot;<br />
Now stand infront of him and make sure that there are no trees in viewing distance behind you....line back up into a gap between trees<br />
<br />
Now hail him.... :D <br />
<br />
Now see how far u can fly....Best i've done it right to the back wall just few feet away from the South Ro Zone</div></div><hr />
