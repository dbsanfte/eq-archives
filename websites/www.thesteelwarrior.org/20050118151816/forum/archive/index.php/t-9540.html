<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been checking around, and recently have been trying to get a better haste item than the soulscream, and it seems that my two best choices (at least until I'm in the EP's, maybe kind of soonish) would either be the taelosian runed girdle or the cape of broken enchantments. Was just wondering when you say an 8k tank is needed for hard ldon or sewers (believe purifying plant is the hardest and on par with hard ldon) is that buffed or unbuffed? I recently just broke the 7k buffed mark, and as soon as I get AA's and 65 I'll be very close to 8k buffed. Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, 7.2k is about where I can buff out to. Question though spas, what level are you? Since level plays a huge part in mitigation/mobs being able to hit you, I am curious. I'm planning on hitting 65, getting at least CA/CS/ND 3 (already got CA2/CS1/ND1) and then physical enhancement. Might try it earlier if I can get a group of guildies I'm comfortable with. Thanks for the replies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spaztic</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 65.  Not going upto 70 till I max defensive AA.<br />
<br />
Note that I play with a set group and we have a bard/cleric/enchanter/shaman/druid so the healing power is pretty insane but our dps is a bit low.<br />
<br />
The cleric uses ch in all those areas mentioned and  the druid will nuke and spot heal if there is a damage spike that ch won't catch in time.  Also note with shammy, this stuff is slowed 75%.  <br />
<br />
Another note is that with druid, we try stuff thats a bit to tough, but with insta evac we normally never have any long CR.<br />
<br />
My point is this, reading these posts and seeing some of the recommendations are somtimes disheartning.  Go try it out, its not been as bad as I thought it would be.  Good players are the key.  I really thought hard mode ldons would just wipe the floor with me, but that wasn't the case. <br />
<br />
One more tip: Run tribute. Run the ac and hp tribute level 6 when doing this stuff.</div></div><hr />

If you have a group of friends that you hunt with all the time you get better at doing things with each other, so you can drop into the less than 8k mark for hards and such.  <br />
<br />
Really it boils down to how comfortable your healer is keeping you alive.  If you make a pickup cleric work their tail off you are gonna catch some flak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, get a crew and go try a hard ldon if you want. They're a lot more fun when you're undergeared than they are when you just smoke them. Level 65 and your archetype aa's and they should be easy enough to be efficient, at least. If you've got a ringer group they might be easy for you now, I dunno.<br />
<br />
CR's are easy in ldon / sewers so I say find a group who likes to live on the edge and try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will just add that in my experience the sewers were a bit harder than hard LDoNs.  We were obliterating hard LDoNs pretty casually when GoD came out, and at that point with a well-balanced group of experienced friends we didn't always win in sewers, there were a few challenging bits.</div></div><hr />
