I'm a barbarian and was shrunk twice before we engaged. We pulled Doom to the zone in area in UP, I engaged, backed into a corner, was ok for maybe 30 seconds, then started getting &quot;you cant see your target&quot;.  Is this just something that's unique to Doomshade, or is cornering in general still fubar for large races?  And if there are mobs that, in general cornering doesnt work with, does anyone have a list of them somewhere so I'll know when to corner and when to walk a wall or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which does jackshit for our cornering ability. Ogres can't corner for shit, we REQUIRE an illusion to do so. Barbarians might be the same way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shabba</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not a warrior but it is my understanding that size is not the only factor when cornering mobs.  The shape or geometry of a character also has a lot to do with your ability to keep a mob cornered and not get any &quot;Can not see you target&quot; messages.  Like the others have said getting illusion hafling or gnome seems to be the 'tried and true' method to cornering.  Just my observations :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh I can corner tank just fine as an ogre shrunk 3x with maybe a few exceptions but I haven't run into any problems, along with the 2 other ogre wars in my guild.  Don't know about in regards to maybe VT but everything I've tanked in PoP/ssra that is corner tanked has been no problem 3x shrunk.  And yes, being shrunk 3x would matter with how zone/mob geometry works.  Only mobs we'd get illusions for really is AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it's both size and width of the char.  As a triple shrunken ogre I can corner tank just fine when I drag the mob to the corner and don't leave the corner for any reason.  If the mob is already in the corner due to push or someone else corner tanking, there's no chance for me to 'take over' and corner tank at that point due to width.  If someone illusions me to a gnome, halfling, or shrunken skelly, I can step in and take over the corner.  Some possible explanation is that maybe as a shrunken ogre I take enough space in the corner, that the mob is never pushed beyond me and I can just look up and tank meanwhile blocking the mob from truely being exactly in the corner.</div></div><hr />

I like the straight down angle.</div></div><hr />

It bugged me to no end trying to MT in VT being a barbarian warrior. Barbarians cannot be shrunk 3 times, and I didn't even know ogres could be. I did the wood elf illusion helm quest to become a smaller race so I could properly corner mobs.<br />
<br />
And I do not believe it makes a difference what the corner looks like you're trying to corner the mob in, I can corner the mob anywhere in WE form, and I can't do it at all in barb form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not a &quot;Yes you can&quot; or a &quot;No you cant' question.<br />
<br />
As an ogre, i used to be able to corner every mob in the game just being dble shrink, but it is not possible anymore.<br />
<br />
Depending on the mob and the corner, I tank being dble shrink, triple shrink, illu gnome, and illu dark elf (wood elf works as well, but i prefer dark elf skin :p )with or without shrink.<br />
<br />
If you want to be sure you will corner it, take a gnome illu and you will be ok.<br />
If you dont want to be that ugly (/grin evil :D ), you will have to test different things to know how you can and how you cant corner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were some changes made to shrink a few patches back and the VT run we did after that was the single time I have ever had issues cornering.  Prior to this patch 1 shrink was enough as a halfelf, now I require two.  Barbs used to double shrink, now they have to tripple shrink.<br />
<br />
Since that raid there hasnt been a single mob I couldnt corner with the correct amount of shrinks.  I box a chanter with project illusion and have a cobalt bracer so Ive used quite a few diff combos (for fun and because I like illusions, not because I had trouble as a difference race).<br />
<br />
Shrink 3x and you should be fine Barbies.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer ... Ive never tried to corner tank AoW, so if there is something peculiar about this particular mob as some ppl seem to be saying I wouldn't know =p</div></div><hr />

I think the triple shrink was an attempt to correct their geometric screw up. However, it didn't work. As an Ogre, I cannot corner mobs without an illusion...triple shrink makes me SMALLER than a gnome, yet I still can't corner mobs like a gnome.</div></div><hr />
