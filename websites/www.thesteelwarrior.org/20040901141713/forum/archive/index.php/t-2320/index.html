<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spent......mmmm about 6k.</div></div><hr />

Not the best of kits, but you can click on &quot;masks&quot; in my sig to see my beast's profile.  I put a bit more emphasis on wisdom as I prefer to pet tank when my sister's shaman (my regular partner) is not around.  <br />
<br />
As for the cobalt bracer, you'd probably have better luck camping the dang thing.  Most people I know with them do not want to part with them.  Me?  I like using it to annoy the hell out of my groups.  :D</div></div><hr />

My Troll Twinklord, who I still need to get a few items for :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Had the same issue recently and got a bit bored of playing my war, so I created a Gnome Mage.<br />
<br />
He rocks, and yes he's twinked. All you need to do is keep pet alive and bang out some nice big nukes.<br />
<br />
Great fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Make a bard.<br />
Solo from 26 to 65 (beastlords have a hard time soloing in PoP unless they are in high end guilds), a bit slower before that.<br />
I know that i have a ton of fun with my 58 troubadour.<br />
Big plus is that bards are also wanted in groups at about all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I made the mistake of making a DE necro as my alt.  I went from a class that is almost 100% dependant on groups to one that can be 100% independant of groups.  Needless to say I got really bored with the necro and people are too dumb around lvl 50 to realize a necro's utility in groups, even at that level.  I have just given up on alts now and play my warrior or just dont play, maybe I will start playing my necro again someday, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a bunch of alts, but the only one I ever play anymore is my shammy.  He is a hella lot of fun to play.  It kinda sucks until you get up into your 30s and get your first pet spell, but from there on out its extremely cool.  I find I can solo reasonably well if I want to, at least up into the 40s where he is now, and if I want to group I NEVER wait more than 5 minutes to get one.  It also amazed me to find that it didn't hardly cost much to twink him a little either.  Alot of the shammy gear is just about dirt cheap nowadays.  For those of us who crave a bit of action, instead of just stand/cast/sit/repeat (which I assume most of us do, or we wouldn't be warriors) a shammy is a good choice, keeps you on your toes sometimes when you have to play slower/haster/healer and everything else in one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are sought after more for group other than almost any other class, period.  After playing a warrior up 50 levels it was damn nice to have an enchanter.  Outside of groups, once you are mid-levels you can also charm solo pretty effectively if you like.  And when you are in higher level groups or raid an enchanter is a blast because in those &quot;oh shit&quot; situations a good enchanter will make or break or the group/raid.  So Powah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll jump on the Beastlord train too. Got mine up to 28 or so now, pretty fun but not too interested in the lower levels so mostly PLing til 50 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My favorite alt is my shaman.  He's level 40, very group friendly, and very powerful solo as well.  I haven't played any alts in a long time mind you, but the shaman is my favorite.  Followed close second by my 31 sk...it's like playing a warrior without all the problems. :)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">=( Now money is a problem... I finnaly got my cobalt bracer after about a year and a half of search(no one goes to sebilis on tholuxe anymore) for 25k, so i'm in debt 15k with a friend. Though i have a zlandicar heart(same day i got cobalt bracer i got a open raid/group) but theres a moral problem =/ Sell it for normal/overpriced, sell it to a friend at the offered price(15k under the normal price), or give it to him..he wants for his wife and i'm a guilty feelin' person =(<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input though, i tried a enchanter before and i don't think a pure spellcaster is it for me, sounds fun and all but i'd fuck up and fall asleep or something... most likely gonna be a beastlord once i get my $$ problems solved</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Necros are good :)<br />
<br />
Also if you have any close friends, reroll some alts together. I recently made a Halfling Cleric called Heelyournees Rezyourankles whom I play with my friend (62pal) who is a Vah Shir Beastlord called Imessedmy Litterbox.</div></div><hr />
