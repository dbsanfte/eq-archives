<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just asking because a dev friend of mine said that monk parse was bullshit and avoidance does in fact stack, i have both atm but havent gotten a time to test em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The thing is that avoidance probably work something like accuracy, which mean that even with a 10 hours parse on accuracy it's possible to have some statistical errors that greatly skew the results.<br />
<br />
If it's remotly like accuracy, it would mean that 99% of all parse already done are not good since they can't account for such a small difference.  I'm not sure how it easy it would be to macro some 10 hours parse for avoidance on some rooted mob somewhere, I'm certain it would'nt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Equip a rusty weapon.  Drag an Exterminator to a corner, pin him in the corner, get on a mount, set gamepad to auto-slap/bash/kick to keep him in the corner.  Leave autoattack on.  Come back in ten hours.<br />
<br />
Whethere or not Avoidance has any real impact can be demonstrated on mobs that are lower than 60.  If you want it on higher mobs, then you'll need something more complicated.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i wonder if i could set it up on a guild rogue with max attack in arena..would be fairly consistant to run a few different parses with the rogue attacking me.  Could even do from front and behind ect to see if it makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Avoidance will up your AC value.  If you want to test... get a 25 ac item, remove it, put it back on.  You will gain something like 1.6x the AC listed on the item.  This was something they put in way back in beta, mostly a hack.  <br />
<br />
But anyhow, then take of your avoidance item with 25ac and put it back on.  You will gain more than 1.6x AC on that item, because it adds some avoidance AC.  We have tested this in guild with people who have multiple avoidance items.<br />
<br />
They do stack.<br />
<br />
Edit: The caster AC ratio is like 1.1x btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i get 12 ac from avoidance 10, exactly the same from vz range and rz back, but that still doesnt show me a difference in avoidance 10 and 20 =p, guess i will just have to parse it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grongl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any update on this?  Would be very interested in knowing if they stack and how significant these mods are for wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have 3 parses each on tt and saryrn with avoid 20..ill probably tank with just avoid 10 the next few times and post it.  seems both hit rate is close to 42.5% during a 4 min fight and evasive disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All Time melee mods stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some tests i did last week...<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Allegedly  avoidance didn't stack, which i found weird, so i decided to do my own test. <br />
<br />
Basically i spent several nights with 5 or 6 Pickclaw Foeslicers hitting me in a corner, with my back to them ; I then only considered their regular attack (HIT, not BASH or KICK). I did 3 sets of tests, one with 0 avoidance, 1 with 25 avoidance, and 1 with 55 avoidance. <br />
Here are the results: <br />
<br />
AVOIDANCE 0 - 1633 AC STATS <br />
hits: 22407 - misses: 94732 - damage: 158154 <br />
connecting blows ratio: 19.12 % - error radius: 0.292 % <br />
18.83 % &lt; cbr &lt; 19.42 % with 95% certainty <br />
average dmg / connecting blow: 7.058 <br />
<br />
AVOIDANCE 25 - 1630 AC STATS <br />
hits: 26034 - misses: 115644 - damage: 185934 <br />
connecting blows ratio: 18.37 % - error radius: 0.265 % <br />
18.10 % &lt; cbr &lt; 18.64 % with 95% certainty <br />
average dmg / connecting blow: 7.141 <br />
<br />
AVOIDANCE 55 - 1635 ACSTATS <br />
hits: 10962 - misses: 51128 - damage: 81479 <br />
connecting blows ratio: 17.65 % - error radius: 0.401 % <br />
17.25 % &lt; cbr &lt; 18.05 % with 95% certainty <br />
average dmg / connecting blow: 7.432 <br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
Avoidance stacks with about 97% certainty <br />
<br />
Method criticism: <br />
- not sure of goblin levels, 3 level range and multiple goblins involved <br />
- not sure avoidance works for greenie mobs the same way as for challenging mobs <br />
- i didn't compensate for the visible AC increase from avoidance ... which results in the average hit getting higher with increasing avoidance (total AC being about the same)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">green mobs are best to parse for the sole purpose of proving they stack because their weak melee will be more affected by avoidance ac ect.</div></div><hr />
