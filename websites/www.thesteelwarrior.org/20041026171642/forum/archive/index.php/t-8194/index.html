<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's been quite awhile since this has been discussed and in the meantime GoD has come out with mobs having in some cases better resists and are higher in level. Besides, now that I (and many others) have been able to move some augs and gotten a few dropped augs, I'm getting to the point where I can do it &quot;right&quot;.<br />
<br />
Assuming - Raex BP, Symbol of the Planesmaster, WA5, etc. and either a Cranial Brudgeoner or VDD for DPS weapons. which augs would you use on which weapon and why?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stick with the Gold Stand IMO - Anger 3,<br />
<br />
Anger 3 on DBoTWL - Espcially if you ever plan on going &quot;Turtle Mode&quot; (Shield)<br />
<br />
Since you have DPS weapons, A3 on Offhand, when you really need the extra aggro, you'll have it, when was the last time you really needed the extra DPS from a proc, while tanking (which as from about - would often be resisted in GoD anyways)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A3 more than ever. I know that you still get agro from resisted procs, but no one has ever proved that you get the same amount of agro from resisted procs. You can never go wrong with A3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol holyshit, ive never seen my procs resisted that bad before...I mean i have a anger resisted once and awhile..and symbol now and then..but thats just freakin crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Qvic archers are pretty much resist anything that has a stun part on it, and it's also clearly case by case, because Static Blow is resisted about 80% which would mean Anger should never get resisted (Static Blow MR -100, Anger MR -400).  <br />
<br />
Though honestly there needs to be more mobs like that that resist stuns because stun is so overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">resistet stun proc &gt; resistet anger proc in terms of agro though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">resistet stun proc &gt; resistet anger proc in terms of agro though<br />
<br />
i would wager that they are equal. (if the stun is 100/0.0)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How are you sure that resisted procs even generate aggro? Who came up with this theory? Has a developer ever confirmed? Just a few questions..I always felt like the EOE was always a much weaker aggro weapon until they changed the stun to 68.  I would use BOC/hategiver for taunt over my potime weapons until SOE changed the Stun lvls and I attained a DBOTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's pretty easy to tell resisted procs generate aggro, yak augs are resisted by everything yet they are very noticeable aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Would be nice to know what the exact % of aggro generated from resist is..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BF never gets resisted! bwahaha<br />
<br />
i'm gonna go cry in my corner now :\</div></div><hr />
