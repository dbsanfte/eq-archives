<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
Maybe now that King room won't be perma camped buy stupid Mages twinking their stupid warrior twink alts.<br />
<br />
Good droppable/attainable weapons for non-guilded Warriors are hard to come by and always seeing the King camp taken by solo 65 mages and bards from Elemental level guilds gets really depressing.</div></div><hr />

They'll just camp them to sell  <br />
<br />
<br />
True :(<br />
<br />
And given how totally borked my server's economy is since ive come back god knows what they will sell for.  <br />
<br />
Before i left a year ago:  <br />
<br />
Truncheon of Doom was 3-4k<br />
Winblade was 18-20k<br />
WMBS was 20-22k<br />
GSOT was 18-20k<br />
<br />
I come back:<br />
TOD is 40k?  WTF?<br />
Winblade is 60-80k? WTF?<br />
WMBS is 10-12k? WTF?<br />
GSOT is 100-500pp? WTF?<br />
<br />
Ok this should have probably gone in the Outhouse :(</div></div><hr />

40k is crazy for the ToD, must be because people don't camp Seb anymore.  If I was on Prod and they really sell for 40k I'd think about 2-boxing that camp just for plat hehe.  <br />
<br />
I don't know why anyone in their right mind would pay that much for a windblade when they can get a WMBS for 10k.<br />
<br />
GSoT is so cheap because it is like a once an hour drop at probably the most popular exp camp in BoT now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been looking or a Windblade for a while just for /disc furious purposes (dathor hammer is a bit beyond my means) and the 80k price tag I've been seeing on them baffles me too.  WMBS is just as good DPS and waaaay cheaper.  If it's any consolation, the economy on Inoruuk is totally fubar too.  I constantly see people trying to sell stuff for double what it should actually be worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As much as I tell people that WMBS is better (mainly because it's not hellishly expensive), they still see that 50dmg and go &quot;ooh, that does more damage than anything else!&quot;  Nevermind it's friggin slow.<br />
<br />
Guess crit envy is still alive and well.  Oh well, keeps the WMBS cheap for those who prefer to actually be better, I guess.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Greklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been away from the game awhile too and just happened to go to the bazaar and check out how much a ToD was.  I had always wanted one before my break but never could find one at a decent price (was about 10k then and I thought that was bad).  So yesterday I do a search for the ToD and up pops one for 89K!  This is on Mith Marr.  Stupid!  Guess I should have bought it long ago.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
As for the CHoS, I'm glad it's been changed too.  I'm not the best with economics but it would seem that the prices on these would drop some now instead of getting even higher than they already are.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, at least my troll smithed ykeshas might actually have a better market now that the CHoS and SotB are level restricted now.<br />
<br />
Edit: just checked my SotB and at level 49 it still procs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Weighted Axe from Kunark is a great /disc furious weapon. probably get one for 25 plat in the bazaar, or just kill a few giants in Dreadlands/FM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;crit envy is still alive and well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crit envy is the single most driving force in why the 2handed weapon market has been able to keep going all these years.<br />
<br />
People like to hit the big home runs.<br />
<br />
And that shades the opinion against things like fast, low damage bonus 2handers (like the monk favorite, Fiery Staff of Zha, or it's rare, tradable first cousin Ironbound Quarterstaff) ... and made people think Dual Wielding was dead and buried.<br />
<br />
Though high riposte rates were the big crit's partner in crime in the conspiracy to murder Dual Wielding.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sylethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, the SoTB still procs. <br />
<br />
What has me more irritated is the implementation of the rec. damage nerf. Intellectually I realize that I have no leg to stand on with a complaint, as it was an error that even allowed such weapons to hit for full damage anyway - but I'm ticked anyway.<br />
<br />
Such items have been in the game for how long now??? The duration with which they were &quot;bugged&quot; and the lack of address from SOE gave tacit acceptance to their existence as status quo/full damage weapons. Such a redress, done silently and without mention from SOE is a slap in the face to the playing populace. <br />
<br />
I get bored sometimes - wanna break from &quot;working at EQ&quot; and have random moments of gratuitous violence and mayhem that are fun and mindless, where no one gets hurt if I mad-train the whole unrest zone (empty that it is when I let loose)... hence throwing twinkie filling on a little melee alt and watching the madness that follows. That enjoyment has been removed by this &quot;nerf&quot;, or &quot;fix&quot;, if you will. <br />
<br />
There is no game balance issue that is addressed by this &quot;fix&quot;, no abuse or mad plat exploit is corrected. At most these items made the 1-50 grind fun and fairly painless. The 50-65 grind was unaffected... The &quot;real work&quot; in the current game environment was singularly un-impacted the way things were. <br />
<br />
All this fix does is remove one significant aspect of playability from the person who can't two-box and level with a bot as pl bizatch.<br />
<br />
Way to go there SOE... after 5 years as a loyal paying customer, 5 years of waiting for &quot;balance&quot;... of dodging (or getting hit by) nerf bats and programming bugs... of broken content and unfinished development... I can say that no single action on the part of VI/SOE has more significantly annoyed me than this unstated, unannounced ninja. <br />
<br />
<br />
/rude @ SOE<br />
<br />
that's just one person's whine :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
How? Just twink your toon in non-rec level gear with non-rec level weapons.<br />
<br />
Call it ... Plan B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">if you think that CHoS didnt need to be nerfed then , puff, puff, pass sir.<br />
<br />
Everyone know's, or should know by now. You dont make twink warrior /melee. You twink a caster, This is caster quest after all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i sort of knew it was coming ever since the nerf of the venomous axe proc a couple years ago. i always knew if i bought a weapon with a mean proc at level 1 it would probably get nerfed the day after i bought it.<br />
<br />
its fun to twink with a high proc'ing weapon but thats not justification for such a weapon to exist. if it were then why stop there? why not make a weapon that procs 500 until you reach 50 and then it doesnt proc anymore at all? we would call it the &quot;make 1-50 fun&quot; weapon and its brother would be the fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
/tangent ... i replaced my fungi at about 55 with an architects bejeweled bp (about 6000pp) ... so for me it i guess id say twinking was its main use.<br />
<br />
but i agree with their decision to nerf the CHoS. leveling up newbies is far too easy as it is without things like this.<br />
<br />
/tangent ... yes i prefer a war marshal bladed staff too.<br />
<br />
/tangent ... weighted axe is a good poor man's dathor. tantors tusk is probably better.<br />
<br />
/tangent ... somewhere out there is a guy who twinked his alt with a dathors and got him to level 20 with a 2hb skill of 20 :) ... and a damage cap all the way :)<br />
<br />
/tangent .... somewhere out there is a newbie who was given a free weighted axe and is using it ... again with a damage cap :)</div></div><hr />

If you're able to get to 65 in two weeks, it isn't because of a force shock proc from 1-50.<br />
<br />
BTW, blackened acrylia blade is a pretty decent 1hs twink weapon now. <br />
