<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi warriors, Im planning on getting some AAs to boost my DPS (done most of the defensive AAs). Im finishing Ferocity and Im wondering which would give me the most benefit considering I DW, Ambidex or Tactical Mastery? <br />
I read that TM gives a nice DPS boost, how is it compared to Ambidex? Any opinions are welcome from your experience and thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TM is a nice boost and will help you for both DW and 2h weapons, so if you ever use 2h weapons at all (maybe when you're not tanking) then TM is the way to go cause it will help both.<br />
<br />
I gained about 7% more attacks with TM3.  I don't recall what that translated to for DPS but it was a noticeable DPS boost.  Ambidex is nice too but I made sure I had both ferocity and TM before I did either ambidex or punishing blade.</div></div><hr />

TM does not help you if you are hitting the mob from behind and not tanking.  It's only useful while attacking in the front of mobs.  If you dont tank alot i'd say get ambi first.  If you do tank alot though TM is a very nice aa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tank most of the time, so I prolly TM is the best choice.</div></div><hr />

For some reason in PoP, they decided to give all the mobs defensive ability steriods.  I'm not sure if it's as pronounced in LDoN or not.</div></div><hr />
