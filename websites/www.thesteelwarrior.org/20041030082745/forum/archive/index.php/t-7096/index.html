<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello guys, quick question.  1st of all let me start off by saying I am on FV server, so you guys will not be surprise with the type of gear i talk about being droppable.  Now to my topic, my guild farms boc really easy, and I have a sceptor of destruction.  back in october of last year when i first started to play eq, I was always told in this forum that boc+sod = best aggro, but hard to get because they are expensive.   Well i can get them quite easy right now, but there seem to other aggro weapons now adays that seem to outshine that combo, excluding the darwarlord +eadge of eternity from time.  The weapons come in mind are hategiver, bloodfrenzy, blasphemous sword of exile.  I had boc for a while sold it for plat and now and will not have trouble getting another one, my guild has like 2-3 in the bank.  I am not main tank in my guild, i current wield chos +gbos with 100dd/125dd yak augs.  I have 700k of plat in the bank from selling boc and helmet rallos zek, I am thinking baout persueing 2-3 pices of elemental gear.  My guild maintank think i should get a bloodied berserker blade, he said the rune proc save him e alot of life, and he anger 3 auged it.  i am not sure if that is a great choise, but wonder if that is a viable option for dps.  I would buy a gsof for dps, but i really hate how i attack with it.  I kind of into the 2 hand over head slash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya I have to say you kind of all over the place with this post and not very clear what you are looking for. If you want best agro NON-Time weapons would probably be Bloodfrenzy and either Hategiver or Blade of Carage I would think is best. Or Bloodfrenzy and blasphemous sword of exile would be good too. The proc on Hategiver and BoC is better but the BSoE procs faster so I think it comes out to the same but someone who has the BSoE would have to confirm that. But pre-time as far as I know Bloodfrenzy is the best 1H agro weapon in the game procing 700 hate with an increased proc rate.<br />
<br />
BUT if you want to go 2Hed I would say the BoW is the best snap agro 2Her. The BBB you mentioned is good but the Rune proc is not as good a proc as Enraging Blow. But the one good thing about Rune proc is it is a AOE agro increaser. The rune agro works kind of like healing agro in that it agros all mobs in the close area so if you have more one mob in camp when rune procs it will increase your agro on all mobs close enough but it is not a big increase. I have heard people say it is about a 1 to 1 ratio of rune to hate agro. puts it hate at 200+ which is not as good as the 700 from the BOW but Rune is kind of like a small heal. So it kind of depends on what it is exactly you are looking for? great agro? DW vs 2Her? those kind of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how much do BoWars cost on FV ... and for that matter VDD and SEWS as well.  if i were you i would shoot for one of those 3.  you shouldnt need anything other than those + anger 3 for aggro, and the dps would make it well worth your while.</div></div><hr />

yeah i am kinda of all over the place, I agree.  let me rephrase, I currently have a great blade of storm +copper hammer striking with yek augs.  I almost never see a bloodfrenzy in bazaar nor blade of war, so I recently sold my blade of carnage to save up for elemental gear.  Well since there are like 5-6 tanks who have more AAs and raid experience than me, I would like to know (A) will my current setup hold main tank aggro in regular grind group all the way even in elemental? (B) is it worth it for me to try to upgrade to bloodfrenzy+boc.  the reason i am askign this question is because i have put in around 1300 adventure pts in  my current weapon set up, adventure pts go for 7k per 100 on my server, so i have already invested 90k plat worth on aug plus 55k on the 2 weapons.  I know when i get aggro upgrade i will upgrade augs again to anger 3. (C) Is SOD a good aggro weapon? BOC + SOD better than BOC + GBOS?<br />
<br />
As far as my magelo, yeah I need to do that, I kinda started it, but never went through with it.  To describe my setup, I have a flame gilded cloak for 41% haste, 2 ornate bracer, ornate glove, ornate chest, helanice greave, helanic boot, 2 blood metal earring, 2 valorium gallantry rings, heavy rubicite, amulet of mummy wrapping, pitted vambrace, stonemite face mask, stonewood compound bow, nothing for shoulder/head<br />
<br />
My guild is going to eb in sol ro by end of this month,  we easily farm helmet of rallos zek/boc for warriors<br />
<br />
<br />
I recently sold my helmet rallos zek + boc +bow of rallos zek for 725K hoping to land 2-3 raex pieces on FV.<br />
<br />
This is what i wanted to say in a nut sell, the main topic is ofcourse about aggro, but I also added some issues about my gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if a BoW were for sale .. how much would it cost?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
someone on FV server website was selling it for like 1400k in march.  <br />
Someone also told me a few days ago that blood frenzy can sell for 900k, hategiver 700k, he was the one selling the hategiver, so I am not sure if this is the truth.</div></div><hr />
