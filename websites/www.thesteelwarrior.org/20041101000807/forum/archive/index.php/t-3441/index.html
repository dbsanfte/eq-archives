<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now i have a BoC in mainhand. Soon it will be a BoC with anger 3 in main hand. And it's gonna stay that way. Now...I've gotta decide on the best offhand. So far it's:<br />
Prismatic battlehammer with ykesha proc augment<br />
Split blade of destruction with ykesha proc augment<br />
Red epic with ykesha proc augment<br />
One of the LDoN weapons with ykesha proc augment<br />
<br />
Right now I don't plan on getting a weapon from a raid unless it's bloodfrenzy or BoW, so...i gotta choose. Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also, there have been rumors of a second proc lowering the proc rate of the first proc - for example putting a ykesha into an EB weapon would make it proc twice a fight rather then 4 times, the other 2 would be ykesha. Did that get cleared up? Were there any tests done, or does anyone speak from expirience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jonnas Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the procrates are independent.  I'd go with the splitblade with ykesha augment, although i'd put the ykesha proc on the BoC and the hate on SBoD, cause stun+dd would give more than +300hate IMO, dunno tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SBoD w/ Ykesha proc would probly be your best choice out of the choices you listed, plus the look factor from the sword ;) <br />

The proc rate doesnt change, they are 2 independant procs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">curse smelted longblade yak aug +2 damage aug and  20 hp/mana aug should be fun.<br />
<br />
16/19 yak proc ac8 dex 7 agi 7 hp 95 mana 90 cold/fire/poison 7<br />
<br />
only need like 3960 points 1150 from tak rest from guk. <br />
<br />
kinda insane realy to get all them points for a wepon. i'm gonna guess someone will at some point just to say they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i guess i still have a thing for the red epic so wont a 400 hate proc plus a yak augment be better aggro wise than a split blade with justa yak augment? i know dps wise the latter is preferable, but i would ahev thought a couple of red blade procs would outweigh any dps aggro  advantage that you would get from split blade.<br />
<br />
and if i was just in it for the looks - lightsaber beats split blade any day imo. even without the effects theres something elegant ablout that slim blade that the more visually obvious split blade just cant beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe the lightsaber would pull ahead.. anyone Aug'ed their Red epic yet? maybe someone can share their exp on it, would like to know myself ;)<br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CHoS/SotBS would be better offhand aggro than the ones mentioned imo, cause 2 procs is always better than one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Away with your droga hammers and swords. I don't want to be like 20000 other warriors, using the same damn weapon. I'll most likely me working my arse off for a LDoN weapon  - not only people won't recognize it as easily, high DPS is always nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought you already had a Copper Hammer Gir?<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I'd suggest splitblade + ykesha.<br />
<br />
But the primal + ykesha isn't too bad an idea either. Maybe save up for a smaller ykesha proc for the primal that way you can do the swap that peeps like to do with primal and still have a chance for an aggro proc while you're waiting for avatar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The club from Mir might be an option (mad researcher).  15/20 cost:1150 with a type 1, 4 and 6...<br />
<br />
&lt;modified&gt; = 17/20w/yak proc might be better dps off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, i have access to the club right now. Must've done at least 6 adventures there yesterday. Thinking about getting it...Or might get the sword. <br />
Yeah, i did have the hammer for a while, i had no choice :(. Got rid of it when i got my BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone know what that hammer looks like?  The 15/20 one from Miragul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Prismatic Hammer + ykesha proc and never ever have to think about swapping weapons for avatar again ?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's why i was thinking about that. I don't like swapping stuff! :)<br />
Also...i'd like to ask what Radalas asked, anyone know what the 2 LDoN weapons look like? Can't resist having a high DPS weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Splitblade+yak or LNoD with all the augs, no question.</div></div><hr />
