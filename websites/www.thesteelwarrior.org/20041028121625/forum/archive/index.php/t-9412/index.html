The &quot;need&quot; for the the three from level 6+<br />
Zoning ((<br />
Lag .. omfg LAG is immense<br />
Awful mapping<br />
<br />
I'm trying to find something good to post... o wait, I know, the water looks good<br />
<br />
I have been in EQ2 beta for 5 weeks now.  The game isn't ready for Nov 15th release. <br />
<br />
HO's don't work !!!!<br />
Spells system is flawed, Aprentice I and II and II are essentially the same, there is no upgrade<br />
Trade skilling is retarded.  It literally takes 2 minutes to make anything and you have to click these gawd stupid icons when you feel &quot;different&quot; doing them.  For example, you start doing a trade skill, an icon pops up saying &quot;you feel distracted&quot; you have to click the correct icon or you can DIE doing trades.... even the most basic sub ingridient.<br />
Finding your shard is beyond retarded.  -1 to all stats for 3 days for each shard.<br />
Group exp debt anytime some one dies<br />
Locked encouters<br />
Group mobs, 5 mobs coming on a pull, they are pre targetted, there is no splitting<br />
<br />
I play with my hubby and a guild mate from CT on Beta1.  We have to group to progress.  Finding a quest in one of the 8 city zones is STUPID, running around to each person dozens of times checking if they have a new quest is RETARDED... o wait, your done with the quest, now try to find that person... yeah there on the third floor of a non marked building.  RETARDED !!!!<br />
<br />
Did I mention LAG??? Antonixa is unplayable. <br />
<br />
They have griffins? hu, thought WoW started that.<br />
<br />
Gah, glad its free.<br />
<br />
Want more info, i'm all ears.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, warriors, yeah kick is a fooking spell cast and it can be interuptable.  Though I admit having 3 different taunt spells at level 10 is nice :P<br />
<br />
Fae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am not going to get into the known items that make the game's very core suspect, we know about them...posts have been made about them.  We know that Locked Encounters are not as fun as we had hoped.  Lag is killing the game.  A lack of spells for the classes are going to kill the game.  Pet pathing is laughable...heck getting your pet to do anything is laughable.  The quests I like, others have posted that they do not like them..but if you do the quests you can usually knock a good portion of the level you are in out.  There is no community.  When you are in a fight in a group you are all waiting for the mighty HO...and so communication is kept to a minimum.  <br />
 <br />
For the first time I see clearly that sometimes less is truly less.  I have fewer spells...everywhere I go..I see lightening...The priest line is a mess as if you get a cleric it seems you are getting a healer without all the cool bells and whistles.   Mobs just stand...easy to find and respawn real fast...unless there is a reason for them to be standing in the middle of the commons I just do not see why this is the way it is.  I mean is there some wierd happening going on?  Mobs should be moving from point a to point b to point c.  It all seems so artificial.  I mean this is EQ2 and yet mobs are now less intelligent than they are in a 6 year old game?<br />
 <br />
Lets start with the good.<br />
 <br />
1. Locations...EQ2 is amazingly easy to look at.<br />
2. Tradeskills are interesting..I do not understand how you can die..but ok.<br />
3. I like the quests...they do a good job of getting you leveled and make you feel important.<br />
4. Voice Overs<br />
5. No KSing<br />
 <br />
BAD<br />
 <br />
1. Avatars...what is with the hair?<br />
2. Locked Encounters...sure there are no chances of KSing..and no helping people either?  Do you really think that this little idea was even a good one at any time?  It takes out the chance to make a new friend.<br />
3. Combat is a fast and furious affair in which a bunch of people group and say 4 or 5 words the whole time they are grouped.  Button pushing is the devil...Bards know this and now so do we all  <br />
4. Community....none..some people detested the ability to /ooc some hated /shout..but you know what?  I know that we miss it...the chatter...some of it that managed to make us chuckle...oh sure some of it was stupid.  We can still do that..except we are all now button pushing mad persons waiting for HO.<br />
5. Freeport Maps<br />
6. Lack of Spells<br />
7. Pet Pathing<br />
8. Mob Pathing<br />
9. Lag<br />
10. Archetype system...seemed nice until we all realised that A. We knew what we wanted to be. and B. Was just another Cookie cutter Class structure that makes you wait to become what you actually want.<br />
11. We have 2 Cities/states that are in a Coldwar with each other...1 Good 1 Bad...and we have no PvP?  <br />
12. Solo gameplay....went from being viable to being punishable by death<br />
13. No buffing.  Ok Power Leveling was not that much of a Devil's Deal that we had to take out Buffing...it is this lack that leads to.......<br />
14. Groups are COOKIE CUTTER....<br />
15. Voice Overs...I didnt see nothing right..I got it...for the hundreth time you told me.<br />
16. Combat in EQ2...is not as interesting as EQ1...sure it is faster..but where is the tactics?<br />
17.Qeynos is a more fully realised Idea than Freeport...In Qeynos the races have areas that harken back to their old lives...in Freeport all anyone has are slums...I do not see DEs nor Do I see Erudites living in slums....they would have changed their surroundins.<br />
18. Mobs seem to be standing around waiting for us to gank them.</div></div><hr />

I had a vision of running my newly leveled warrior into PoK - with no one there to care. EQ1 is massive, sure there are flaws and we can whine about class balance, casual vs raider balance, itemization, bugs, developers, customer service and all, but at the end of the day I enjoy playing it and the only threat to that is a massive exodus of players and development resourses into competing eq2. <br />
<br />
Im not hard core, think i have 42 days played including trader mode, but thats still a bit of an investment, and Id much rather see Eq develop, than having to restart fresh at a new game (and then another and another).<br />
<br />
Yepp, i hope it dies quick and painfully...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry to burst yer bubble, Tooby, but even if EQ2 doesn't hit everyones' g-spot, WoW is going to put a serious dent in EQ. They're both coming out around the same time, so you're going to get that mass exodus when they hit the market. Even if everyone comes back to EQ, there will be a few months there where EQ will be much emptier.</div></div><hr />

Its not really a poor performance, lookin good</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic Opportunities, much like what they had planned for melee in eq1 but scrapped. They are used by all classes and can be linked together with other groupmembers, but I don't know what the outcome is when you do link em.<br />
<br />
Group exp debt anytime some one dies<br />
<br />
From a tanks standpoint, is this bad? People will be more careful. It will weed out hazardous players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EQ2 should never have left the design stage.  There are numerous problems with the core design that makes me think they still have not decided what direction they want the game to go in.  Subclasses are supposed to be substantively the same yet they are not, they are not interchangable class balance is worse than eq1.  EQ2 is just plain boring, they forgot that its a game, grinding is worse than anything i've ever seen, etc, etc.  WoW has its share of problems as does EQ1 but both are better than EQ2 by many orders of magnitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is currently a 10 pg post on sub-classes.  Smedley finally replied early this morning:<br />

We will continue to add more and more diversity to the sub-classes as we've done in the past few months.. we're still not done! A lot of the cooler parts of the game reveal how truly unique the sub-classes actually are. Remember, items are also a big part of the way EverQuest made each character unique.. and yet you will always have the people that say &quot;you have to have X item on your Tank to deal the most damage&quot;... well one of our goals with EQ II was actually to broaden things by quite a bit. We've made design decisions that mean a much more diverse game opens up as your character rises in level. That's exactly what we've intended from the start. The character development system is really designed to make sure we keep things balanced all the way through character progression... and because EQ II has been designed as a long term game, we've also been able to plan that content over a very long arc (there is a reason we went with Good vs. Evil you know!) that includes adding higher level content and very cool new skills and abilities in a way that doesn't unbalance things.<br />

On one hand, I am truly impressed Smedley went onto the boards and made that post, on the other hand I am pretty sure he or someone else had to sooner or later. Some things he said that makes me wonder though:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;we're still not done!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then why release the game to retail? Sure there is a &quot;race&quot; going on but everquest2 is concidered by many (me included) to equal quality, the best you can get actually, imo. This is however something that can never be changed I think, since the marketing of the game is way more important, getting the thousands of players choosing between the 2 games is a higher priority compared to people being happy when they level up to 30-35 and start getting bored, maybe there is a plan to have some, lesser or greater, changes made before this happens? Who knows, we sure dont.<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, if all subclasses are the like in 99% of the game up to level 50, then this means litterly nothing. However if somethings are to be added, then thats a whole new discussion, as it is now, the above doesnt make sense.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;The character development system is really designed to make sure we keep things balanced all the way through character progression&quot;<br />
<br />
Both good and bad imo, its alot easier to level, but the game becomes more boring as you dont notice any difference, there hasto be important changes to gameplay etc, when getting higher in level, except the names on the mobs and the names of the spells, I think this is the most utterly important issue right now, people get bored since the &quot;game-essence&quot; doesnt change, just the graphics and the environment...<br />
<br />
&quot;that includes adding higher level content and very cool new skills and abilities in a way that doesn't unbalance things.&quot;<br />
<br />
If this means future updates great, aslong as it comes fast as a majority of players seem to get bored at low/mid levels! If it means addon-packs costing money to grant you acces to things making the game worthwhile it scares me considering the future of the game..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All of this information is quite disheartening, I was under the impression that this would consume less time than EQ1 just because of the fact of the smaller raids, groups, guilds etc...... which I transferred into smaller downtime and waiting, but it doesn't seem that way from the discussion on these boards and others.<br />
<br />
I don't see this being a very successful game if they still have this many bugs and other problems to fix, especially with a release to the game in less than a month.  I'll probably hold off a few weeks/months to buy it from release to see what the initial reaction to it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The link to the one off of the one you gave was the most informative i think.  I am considering cancelling my preorder at GameStop (but i might be able to get the jboots when i log in -- i registered my preorder) and waiting until i hear more about the final version before i decide to spend $50 (plus getting an all access pass so i can still play EQ) to play it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Many people have already made up their mind, they will buy eq2 or wow or neither or both regardless of what anyone says.  I have seen people who detest some great features of both games just because their minds were already made up.  I have seen people gloss over the negatives to both games because their minds were made up already.  <br />
<br />
With all that said, I am a beta tester of WoW and EQ2.  I will be buying wow the second it comes out.  If eq2 was released and on the same day eq1 was re-released as a new purchase with new servers with original release content (pre-kunark) with NO bug fixes or enhancements whatsoever...I would buy the eq1 re-release before eq2.  One last thing to consider, my best gaming machine is a p4 2.8 with a gig of ddr ram and geforce 5600 agp 256meg and eq2's performance (and graphics due to settings being turned down) is worse on that machine than city of heroes or wow runs on my p4 1.9 with a geforce 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the core problem behind Sony.  They are so worried about WoW that they are pushing this thru at lightspeed.  What they end up is what you got after Sony took over EQ1, lots of grinding crap and no content.  It took Blizzard a long time to get WoW right, they kept pushing their release back.  They usually produce a nice polished gem as far as their game releases are concerned, and I expect no less with WoW on release.<br />
<br />
EQ2 however will be a pretty game with zero content.  It'll require everyone to upgrade their machine inorder to even try to play it, lag will be horrible, and there will be NOTHING to do but lvl.  WoW runs well on a lot slower machines!<br />
<br />
If EQ2 doesn't &quot;develop&quot; their game, they wouldve lost their EQ2 fans AND EQ1 after everyone leaves EQ1 for EQ2.  They cant expect to keep people around if they play garabage (well some people like the grind)   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally hoping to get in on open beta of both games at some point.  I'm about 99.9% sure I'll be playing WoW though, kinda wanna get away from Sony and see what the rest of the world has to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>hungri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">as far as graphics go, there are a lot of people playing on a wide variety of specs, some people have problems with a computer that cost them 4k from alien ware. some people are getting by fine on computers that dont meet the minimum specs required and had to fake there beta pole with there buddies computer. <br />
<br />
when you start playing you start at a default setting, you can go into the display option area which is huge, it has something like 30 options with multiple sliders for min max on these options, if you dont know Dick about video or are unwilling to intelligently experiment with settings, then it doesnt really matter what computer your using, its likely to suck. <br />
<br />
you can tell most people arent setting this up correctly. the link to the write up where the guy talked about a pc's armor suddenly appearing as he got closer. well gee, theres an option and a slider in the display,  how far away do you want the pcs armor to be veiwable ? one foot ? one mile ? somewhere in between  ? set slider to your desired point.  thats so people with low end machines can forgo drawing some of the intense armor graphics of 20 people a mile away that happen to be in the direction you are facing.  you can completely hose yourself up if you select the wrong things or select a drop down prefabbed selection your machine cant support. or you can work the options as you play and learn what you give a rats ass about or not.<br />
<br />
a second quick note.<br />
<br />
i started EQ in beta and quit when omens came out.<br />
i played wow beta<br />
i am now playing the eq2 beta.<br />
i think there are some problems with eq2. <br />
i think most of the info posted since NDA was lifted is pretty jaded and inaccurate.<br />
i think eq2 at its core is nice. i think they need another 3 months of beta, theres still alot of content that hasnt been put in to be tested. <br />
there are somethings that i think suck about it, but those things are currently being patched / reviewed / worked on.<br />
<br />
the only thing that ive seen that may be a nut breaker is the server lag in certain places. its nothing to do with video. in the main trouble zone. which is going to be the HUB for every tom dick and harry for the first month of play, the lag swings back and forth from 1 to 2 seconds (playable) to literally 8 minutes. ( get up go get a drink come back, spell still in middle of casting.) this makes it really painful to play, as i said this is a HUB zone you have to play in it. they have been beating on the problem for a while and its gotten better, but if they dont fix it all the way then the game is gonna suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since character individualization in EverQuest II has been a hot topic following the lifting of the NDA, we thought it would be a good idea to share our plan for the all-new features that are going live in the next few weeks to give a greater sense of uniqueness to players. We’ll be releasing more details each day, beginning with the character traits list tomorrow afternoon.<br />
<br />
First, let’s talk about what’s changing from its current state.<br />
<br />
We’re releasing the final class spells and arts lists. These move away from the standard archetype spells and arts we’ve been using for balance testing and give players access to their class-specific spell selections. The spells and arts you’ll see in the next few updates include new effects, class-specific strengths and flavor, and final names.<br />
<br />
These spell changes are taking place across the board and will greatly refine class differences from what they are today. We’ve completed the balancing necessary to give a solid role to each class and now we’re excited to release the new spell and art lists.<br />
<br />
To illustrate how these changes work, we'll use the Mage -&gt; Sorcerer -&gt; Wizard progression as an example.<br />
<br />
Unlike how it was in the previous spell lists, once you turn level 10 you stop being just a mage. As you choose your path and complete your quest, from that point forward you are a sorcerer. There are no new mage spells after level 10. Each class will be branch off into entirely class-specific spells. <br />
<br />
Once you turn level 20 and choose the path of a wizard, you are no longer a sorcerer. As before, there are no new sorcerer spells after level 20. You will be gaining wizard subclass spells from there forward. <br />
<br />
In other words, there is no longer any such thing as a &quot;level 44 mage spell,&quot; because a high-level wizard should never think of himself or herself as a level 44 mage in EverQuest II. <br />
<br />
You will still be able to do a number of the same things to keep being useful in your key roles, but with unique and interesting differences that are suitable to each of the classes and subclasses that branch out from the common base.<br />
<br />
For example, all priests will continue to receive instant heals, but other heal types will be restricted based on class. Only shamans will get wards, only druids will get regens, and only clerics will get reactive heals. <br />
<br />
Classes will also receive a greater assortment of unique spells and arts. These are additional abilities that will likely be purchased off vendors. For example, illusionists will be able to cast racial illusions.<br />
<br />
Full spell and art lists for each class will be released in the next few days.<br />
<br />
Next, we’d like to outline some brand new features going live in the coming days and weeks. These systems add a tremendous amount of customization to each character and should help you create the unique persona you'll want to play in EverQuest II. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Feature - Training Specialized Abilities<br />
<br />
As you develop your character, you’ll be able to specialize in major aspects of your profession. About every ten levels, you can choose to focus on one of your core abilities and receive advanced training to improve it. <br />
For example, a priest could train and receive either a stronger heal, a more potent buff, or a higher-damage nuke. This ability would be of much greater potency than the typical granted spell and may be upgraded even more through adventuring. <br />
Each profession gets similar choices that play to their strengths – fighters may choose between offensive and defensive enhancements, or mages may focus on improving a damage spell, a pet, or a stun spell as appropriate to their profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Feature - Character Traits<br />
<br />
Character traits allow you to choose an aspect of your character and improve upon it. Traits are independent of your character’s race or profession, and all characters have access to the full list. <br />
By the time they’ve reached level 50, every character will gain access to seven traits that help tailor their character to their preferred play style. <br />
For example, a given character might choose to become Clever, thereby increasing their intelligence. Another character might choose to become Nimble, thereby increasing their base agility. <br />
Traits can improve your character in a variety of areas, such as increasing your statistics, giving more health or power, improving your health or power regeneration speed, and making your more resistant to magic, disease, or different types of melee damage. <br />
Traits are generally permanent effects that continuously improve your character during play. Once you’ve selected a trait, you’ll enjoy its benefits permanently.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Feature - Racial Traditions<br />
<br />
As players learn the background and lore of their chosen race, they begin to unlock certain bonuses. This starts with race-specific titles and leads to a choice of racial abilities. <br />
By the time they’ve reached level 50, every character will gain access to four racial traditions to help tailor their character to their preferred play style and distinguish themselves from other members of their race. <br />
For instance, an iksar could choose from enhanced health regeneration, increased power regeneration, or increased armor class. A ratonga may learn to forage for food or improve his ability to dodge blows. Erudites may learn to summon a magical wisp, guard themselves with a magic-resistant shield, or improve their alchemist crafting abilities. <br />
Racial traditions take many forms, but are generally activated abilities that can be used on demand to greatly improve your character for a short period of time. <br />
Some traditions give bonuses similar to traits, but with much more powerful effects. <br />
Full racial tradition lists will be released for every race in the next few days.<br />
New Feature - Enemy Mastery<br />
<br />
During your adventuring career, you’ll be able to learn about the creatures and monsters you’re fighting and use that knowledge to your advantage. <br />
Every few levels, players may choose from a selection of enemies and undertake a quest to learn how to exploit their weaknesses. The successful completion of this quest results in an enhanced attack against that type of enemy. <br />
By the time they’ve reached level 50, every character will gain access to six enemy masteries to help tailor their character to their preferred play style.<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
These new kinds of choices allow for greater individualization without creating major imbalances between subclasses. One dwarf templar can have different stats and abilities than another dwarf templar while retaining the core abilities that they need to be successful in their key roles. Approximately every two levels players will receive an additional choice that allows another degree of individualization.<br />
<br />
We plan to have the first round of these features showing up in next week's scheduled update (week of 10/25/04) with additional features arriving the week after. We look forward to hearing what you think of these upcoming changes.<br />
