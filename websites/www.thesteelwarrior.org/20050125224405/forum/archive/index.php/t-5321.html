<br />
and i have around 30-60k to spend (pending the sale of an item) and was wondering what i should upgrade to.  i'm an agnostic vah shir warrior ( i know its a horrible combo for player crafted armor), so cultural stuff is out.<br />
<br />
at the moment i'm thinking ornate arms, as my arm slot is one of my weakest at the moment.  i'll soon be getting my benevolence bracer to replace the moktor as well.<br />
<br />
where should i upgrade and what would you suggest?<br />
<br />
(btw perfectly happy with GSoT after having CHoS and SotBS combo prior)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might be time for a BP upgrade too.  Architect's Bejeweled Chestplate is 54AC, 60hp, 5Sta, and other minor stats.  Recommended level is 60, but you're not far behind so that won't hurt you much.  Should be well within your budget.<br />
<br />
For legs, you might try to find a good price on some Kylong Shinguards (35ac 4sta 45hp) or Greaves of the Orcish Master (38ac 40hp).  <br />
<br />
A good neck item is the Amulet of Mummy Wrappings - 12ac 45hp and several stats.<br />
<br />
Should give you a few upgrade options there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how important is the ac upgrade from moktor to the shinguards ..?  i've heard the 1ac = 3hp rule, but does that come into play really that much??<br />
<br />
in everyday xp grind is higher ac or higher hp better?  for example i have my fire mephit sleeves and moktor arms .. moktor arms have more ac, but i get 105 extra hps with the other.   its kinda the same way with architects bp vs the bp i have now.  the architects has a good bit more ac, but the fire forged has more hps total plus some other stats like dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I want the best of both worlds, or at least the largest balance I can find.  High HP but low AC will get you pounded hard (lots of max hits) in PoP.  Low HP but high AC is going to keep your cleric lom from inefficent CHeals.   <br />
<br />
So I try to look for items with mid-high AC and a nice chunck of pure hp.  However, I usually either group with a shaman or have a bot shaman to buff me, so my STA is usually maxed.  Therefore, +HP &gt; +STA for me.  <br />
<br />
To me, it just seemed your AC was a little behind and could use some attention.  <br />
<br />
For example, on the legs, say you went with the shinguards.  You give up 6STA, gain 30 pure HP and 14 pure AC.  The total hp will be close to a wash but you'll pick up an adjusted 20AC approximately. Remember, pure AC is not 1-1 with your displayed AC.<br />
<br />
For the BP, you lose 7 stamina, but pick up 20 pure HP and again, 14 pure AC.  You'll lose a total of 20hp adjusted, and gain 20AC adjusted in return. <br />
<br />
For the necklace, you'll pick up 5AC unadjusted, even out on HP, but pick up 3STA, so you're about 8AC and 15hp ahead (adjusted).<br />
<br />
Just those 3 upgrades would be about a -5HP, +48AC return.  I didn't list other stats (STR/AGI/DEX) and you'll probably drop a minimal amount on those.  Another good part is you've switched STA hp's for pure HP's, giving you more headroom for STA buffs to help out.<br />
<br />
But personally, I don't usually do all that math, or any AC=HP rule. I take a look at where I'm hurting, then try to find the biggest overall boost in important stats I can find, then fit it in my budget.</div></div><hr />
