<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in PoSky today (always a fun time  ;) ) and on the first island we had some asshat cast an AE, and it pulled up a Djinn from the quest area under the island.  Was only one and was attacking us, so no big deal right and we kill it.  Well, got a message saying my faction with Inhabitants of Sky got worse, and then everything agro'd.  The rest of the fairies, the rest of the Djinn below - owned by Island #1 =(  Anyway, this one kill made like 90% of our raid KoS in Sky now.  Port up, and BAM, you agro all the mobs underneath and they wax you asap.  Rez corpse, and SMACK, you agro the mobs underneath, rinse and repeat.  So the CR was pretty rough, but we eventually got em.  Just wondering if anyone had heard of or had problems with this faction.  It is not listed on Alla's or anything, but we are for sure KoS there now.  Can log out, port up, and get whacked - that one kill took us from indifferent to threateningly.   :mad: <br />
<br />
At least it is a good excuse for never going to PoSky again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aurelio Silverdawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to the club. This happend to our guild too. 50% are now kos there and some members are not able to complete their epic anymore or help others. The server GM don't care at all. They won't reset your faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn, that really sucks.  I often thought about killing one of them for the hell of it, glad I didn't!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the Tribunal server my guild did a simular action and we now have like 1/2 our raid force KoS up there.<br />
They tried to get the GM's to reset the faction but never heard back from the GM's after petition after petition.<br />
<br />
you would think they would be on beta neutral...<br />

You can always try rezzing them up just to summon their body up to a higher level, say island 3 then rez them again there to try and be far enough away from island one to live. But i do not know what this faction would do to the other islands where you are not suspose to be KoS on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whenever we would rez or port someone in, they would be attacked and dead before they even finished zoning, so getting someone there for a corpse summoning target would not work.  We eventually has a non-kos person map the caves below, and then drag our corpses to a tiny spot near the egde of the island that was far enough away from any mobs above or below to have time to finish zoning, loot corpse, and jump off before being attacked and killed.  It took several tests (extra deaths) to find a good rez spot, but we were happy to get our gear back and not have to wait a week to loot them in Shadowrest.  Anyway, the &quot;Inhabitants of Sky&quot; faction is not even listed on Alla's, and their doesn't seem to be a way to increase it either.  A GM on our server later responded to petitions to say that it was working properly (imagine that).</div></div><hr />
