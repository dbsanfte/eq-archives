Right now on a failed taunt nothing happens, which is a huge part of warriors current problems.  My idea is this, Instead of on a failed taunt of nothing happening, move the warrior that is taunting to the top of the hate list MINUS some number so they would be second on the hate list.  This would give the warrior a good chance to get aggro back a couple seconds later on a failed taunt instead of the 6 seconds it takes taunt to refresh (or more if taunt fails again).  If SoE were to implement this along with something like a mitigation upgrade for warriors would in my  opinion allow warriors to be a competitive tank for xp groups again without getting rid of the knights desirability.</div></div><hr />
