<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On some mobs it is better to avoid a hit completely instead of mitigating a small percentage of the hit.  If a mob can one round you or has a nasty proc, avoiding a hit is better than mitigating part of it.  With the insane amount of damage POP mobs do, it is becoming more accepted parsing wise and mathematically to avoid rather than mitigate.  Check out the uber mob tanking sticky in the library for further explanation.  I personally have no experience with either AA though, so just going by what I have read and seen here and my experiences with evasive vs defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you rather have a chance to get get hit for less than 600 damage?<br />
<br />
Or about an equal chance to not get hit at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, the notion of an *avoided hit* is superior to a *mitigated hit* is COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED.  The ratio is not one-to-one.  This seems to have been dreamt up by people that didnt know any better.<br />
<br />
Sscaley did a *HUGE* parse strongly suggesting that ID1-5 is substantially equivalent to LR1-5 in terms of melee damage received.  <br />
<br />
This is NOT to say, however, that ID1-5 is equal to LR5 for all classes in all situations, as there are other factors to include (procs received, DPS via DS, etc.).  That is a tricky debate and it changes from class to class.<br />
<br />
In regards to CA3 and CS3, the logic is strongly similar to ID5 and LR5.  That being, they are very similar in terms of melee damage received.  My understanding, however, is that CA3/CS3 is &gt; ID5/LR5 in terms of melee damage received, especially when considering PE.<br />
<br />
I would probably go CA/CS, CA/CS (get the one you didnt do first), PE, LR/ID, LR/ID (get the one you didnt get first).  In terms of which to get first, like CA/LR vs CS/ID, flip a coin.  You'll get substantitally the same benefit out of each.  Most people prefer, rightly or wrongly, to go the CA/LR route first.<br />

<br />
I hate losing this great information, and then wondering about it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is that CS3, CA3, LR5 and ID5 all reduce by 10%.<br />
<br />
CS and CA do this for 12AAs each and ID and LR do this for 15AAs.  CS and CA also receive an additional benefit from PE which LR and ID don't.<br />
<br />
Personally Im finishing off CS atm and will then do LR then ID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage Mitigation VS Avoidence (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2742.topic) <br />
<br />
I believe this is the link to Sscaley's parse.  Page 2 of this thread has all the information(tho sadly the graphs no longer show) that Sscaley gave, showing 'going from ID0 to ID5... 5.2% decrease in damage taken'  and 'Going from LR1 to LR5 will increase your avoidance by 3%, from 32% misses to 35% misses. Miss+Hit at LR1 is 85.6% of the swings, while Miss+Hit at LR5 is 85.8% of swings. 32% of 85.6% is 37.4% of damage avoided while 35% of 85.8% is 40.8% of damage avoided - or about a 4%-point increase in damage avoided.'  (No easy way to shorten that second one up and have it still make sense)<br />
<br />
He concluded:  'From this little test, I would hypothesise that ID and LR are about the same efficiency in reducing total damage taken - however, LR will make you get hit less which can affect any innate proc related additional damage/stuns.'<br />
<br />
I strongly recomend following the link above, and reading all of Sccaley's post, it is well worth the time.  Oh, and one more quote from that thread, this one from Tugurok:  'Please copy the charts and results into the stickied Ubermob tanking thread, so in 6 months we aren't having the same discussion again.'  The date on that post quote is 6-9-03, or 6 months, 1 day ago.  I found that amusing.</div></div><hr />
