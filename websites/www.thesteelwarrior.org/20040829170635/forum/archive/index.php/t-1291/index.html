<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Search on Alla's if you have memebrship.  The quests are laid out well there.  <br />
<br />
For the most part.. BoT.. Two medallions off any of the three mini giants, one head, one bone, one beard, on sash (each comes from one of the three normal giants).  Turn the head into Askr, get a bag, combine the bone, sash, beard and turn in.  Get a bag, add the two medallions, combnine and turn in.  Zone into BoT from PoS in the frog area.<br />
<br />
For HoH, get a Agony Mephit heart from PoN, a crystal brain from PoV wastelands, and block of Prellium from PoI.  Smith those with a water flask and hammer.  Turn them in to some suite of armor in PoV and get a box.  Go to PoJ and kill Wraiths until three different named wraiths spawn, they actually drop to the ground.  Turn in the box and get it back and a orb.  Once you have three new orbs put them in the box and combine, take it back to PoV suite guy and done.<br />
<br />
HoH is group flag, BoT is single flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just level to 62.  With the exp and flag changes, thre's not really any reason not to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it is totaly pointless to get hoh quest flag since it does not progress you in pop story and you still need AerinDar flag for elementals eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They would increase Charm stats though?<br />
<br />
Thanks Fae. I don't have membership to Alla's, could someone copy&amp;paste the quest info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jordail Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Starts in Plane of Storms, by talking to Askr the Lost. <br />
<br />
You need to get a &quot;Storm Giant Head&quot; from any of the base giants in the zone. They drop this fairly commonly. <br />
<br />
Hand in the head to Askr, and when he asks if it was you who tore the head from it's previous owner, say &quot;it was me&quot;. You'll need to tell Askr to continue a few times. He'll then give you a four-slot container (Askr's Bag of Verity) which he'd like you to fill with one item from each giant tribe. <br />
<br />
The Ocean Giants drop a Storm Volaas Beard. <br />
The Desert Giants drop a Storm Taarid Bone. <br />
The Forest Giants drop a Storm Satuur Sash. <br />
<br />
Take these three items and combine them in the bag to make &quot;Askr's Sealed Bag of Verity.&quot; <br />
<br />
Askr will then tell you about the Bastion of Thunder. Ask him &quot;What Bastion of Thunder?&quot; and he'll give you another container (Askr's Sealed Bag of Verity again). <br />
<br />
You'll now need two Esoteric Medallions from different giant camps. The named giants in the Ocean, Desert and Forest camps drop these. They're all named the same, but identify as west, south and north. <br />
<br />
Take your two medallions and combine then in the container Esoteric Meld. Hand this in to Askr for the character flag to enter Bastion of Thunder. <br />
<br />
You must now enter the Bastion of Thunder from the Plane of Storms (it's in the center area, with the Tempest Toads, and the tornado). Just put invisibility up and click on the small shrine in the middle. Once you do this, you'll be able to use the zoneline in Tranquility. <br />
<br />
Reward(s): <br />
Access to Bastion of Thunder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jordail Tanker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HoH Key Quest<br />
You say, 'Hail, Grenic Drere' <br />
<br />
Grenic Drere says 'Mortals, this far into the planes? Something that I never thought that I would see. Regardless that does not help my [situation] any does it?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What situation?' <br />
<br />
Grenic Drere says 'Not that it is your business, but this is where I call home. I have lost track of the years that I have spent here. This valley is my home, for I was exiled from [Mithaniel's Temple]. It is not a story that I am proud of and do not wish to share with you. So be one with you.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Where is Mithaniel's Temple?' <br />
<br />
Grenic Drere says 'Only a mortal would be as thick headed to know not when to take their leave. He and his legions call his temple The Halls of Honor. Paladins that have served him well on Norrath have the opportunity to ascend into his ranks. They are in training to make sure that they are always prepared to defend what they believe is the right and honorable thing to do. Mithaniel is an extremely proud being, and will accept any challenge that you may have to offer him. If you are willing to challenge him, I may have some [information] you will find useful.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What information?' <br />
<br />
Grenic Drere says 'There are other methods to enter the Halls of Honor than those that are readily apparent, and as a former soldier of Marr I can offer you access into the Halls; however as with all such arrangements there must be something [paid] for something earned.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Paid?' <br />
<br />
Grenic Drere says 'I was not the only member of my squad that was sent into exile, my brothers in arms, were the impetus for our exile. I was but a mere pawn. They now reside in the Plane of Justice as bodiless shades. Their punishment was too lax for their actions; I want their eternal souls to be mine. Find a smith who will teach you to create a box of souls, weaken the shades, then capture their souls and return all three to me.' <br />
<br />
Journey to the Plane of Knowledge and speak with Borik Darkanvil. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Borik Darkanvil' <br />
<br />
Borik Darkanvil says 'Greetings, Borik Darkanvil, at your service. I was once a planar traveler like you. Those days are behind me, now I am content to earn my keep as a blacksmith, and to experiment with some of the [special recipes] that I have picked up in these outer planes.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What special recipes?' <br />
<br />
Borik Darkanvil says 'Well a little bit of this and a little bit of that. If there is anything you need assistance in making come see me. I may be able to help.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Do you know how to make the Box of Souls?' <br />
<br />
Borik Darkanvil says 'Borik Darkanvil's eyes grow narrow. 'So looking to capture some souls are you? It's none of my business I suppose so don't answer. I'm pretty sure that I don't want to know. I paid heavily for the formula for the Box of Souls, but its not a price I would pass on to anyone else. There isn't much to it, but it does take the hands of a skilled smith and the magic of Tanaan's forges to event attempt it. First you will need a block of [Perilium].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What is Perilium?' <br />
<br />
Borik Darkanvil says 'Perilium was once used to make clockwork machines, there are now stronger metals so it has become harder and harder to find Perilium, much less a block that is large enough to be of any use. Then you will need to find the brain of a crystal spider, this is where the actual soul will be held. Of course the box will need a supernatural power source, the souls are held into place by the horror of their own dreams, the heart of an agony mephit will give the device that power. Forge these with a smithing hammer and a vial of sacred water and you will have your box. Of course if you have not the skill, I can [forge them for you].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Will you forge them for me?' <br />
<br />
Borik Darkanvil says 'If you return all three items to me I will do the work for you for, a mere three thousand platinum. I will not guarantee my success, but I can guarantee if you do not have the skill, you will fail.' <br />
<br />
If your Blacksmithing skill is high enough (trivial &lt;= 139), you can attempt this yourself by placing an agony mephit heart, a crystal spider brain, a solid block of perilium, a water flask, and a smithy hammer in a Tanaan forge. Alternately, you can give just the heart, brain, and perilium to Borik along with 3,000 platinum. Be aware that either way the combine can fail. <br />
<br />
Once you have the Box of Souls, journey to the Plane of Justice. Kill tormented wraiths until one of three &quot;exiled XXX of Marr&quot; spawns. Hand the Box to each of the three exiled souls of warriors there (they can be targeted but not attacked). Each hands you back the box and a unique soul sphere. <br />
<br />
Journey back to the Plane of Valor, and give the three spheres and the box to Grenic Drere. <br />
<br />
Grenic Drere says 'Hmm, this is minor vindication, but vindication nonetheless. I will never again fight with my old compatriots, but now I know the punishment of those responsible for my exile is fitting for their crime. We did have an agreement, and while stripped of my rank I still have my honor. This ring is what all Soldiers of Marr wear to enter the Halls of Honor, it serves no use for me any longer, it is yours now.' <br />
<br />
He gives you his ring, which gives you alternate access to the Halls of Honor. <br />
<br />
Reward(s): <br />
Ring of Marr</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't it cost about 3k to just get your own Smithing skill to 139?</div></div><hr />
