<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately my Internet (DSL) has been sluggish. Generally it goes faster than I do, so there's no problems. Whenever I sit down for a nice bit of messageboarding, I open up 2 IEs and go to 2 diff sites, once there I hit the &quot;View New Posts&quot; button on the forums and start opening lots and lots of new windows for each thread that interests me. By the time I've picked all I want from one site, the taskbar is full and then I go to the other board and open up alot more. Previously, there has been no problem with this - by the time I've opened up new windows for everything I want to read, the first few have loaded and I start working my way through them, from first-opened to last-opened until I finish, at which point I move on to the next board after hitting the &quot;Mark All As Read&quot; button. I hit alot of message boards, using all types of software (Snitz, EZBoard, vBulletin, etc.)<br />
<br />
However, lately the windows take a very long time to load, to the point where I can practically get up and do something else before they've loaded (like dialup ARGH!). Once they finally do load, it seems like all of the pages from one site finish at the same time, whereas before it would seem load them in the order that I opened them.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I tried the Repair feature for networking and it says that it failed &quot;Purging the DNS Resolver cache.&quot;<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any new hardware/software installed around the same time as you noticed this issue?<br />
<br />
How much Ram you got installed and what's your CPU?<br />
<br />
How olds the computer and how long since you last reinstalled the OS?<br />
<br />
Does the system sluggishness seem only to affect your internet connect or does the system seem slower in general?<br />
<br />
Who's your DSL provider?<br />
<br />
How computer literate are you, e.g. are you comfortable rooting through the Registry and pulling shit out or formating and reinstalling the OS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Win XP on a 1.5GHz P4 with 512mb RAM. Its a little over 2 years old (xmas gift in 2001).<br />
<br />
No new hardware. New software.. possibly Morpheus.<br />
<br />
The sluggishness doesn't effect anything but Internet speed.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly computer literate. I've run regedit a few times but I was overwhelemed with all the HKEYs and stuff, but if told what to do, I could figure it out. I ran it trying to do some stuff to tweak startup and to make my comp run faster, I read a bunch of warnings about how regedit is for people who really really know what they're doing, so I used msconfig and TweakXP instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Morpheus is the devil. Have you checked to see if it's set to load on start-up? It will run in the background allowing people to download your music from you thus leaching your bandwidth. The best way to check it out is to goto Start/Run/msconfig/Startup. It should be listed there. If it is uncheck it. You can also check under services which also load on startup.<br />
<br />
You can also check out http://www.dslreports.com to see what they recommend under the tools section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if it has just been the past few days more then likely its the mydoom virus. it took over like huge enormus amounts of machines to take out snopes. it has pretty much killed bandwith everywere.<br />
<br />
alot of companys are also limiting per user bandwith so fast connection users don't leach it from dial up users. saves them money by getting more people on the same bandwith instead of paying for more.<br />
<br />
number 2 is prolly what your getting. in the past each window would get its own connection to the sight now your being forced to use the same connection for each window. makeing them all load at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firth, hardly anything is checked to run on startup. I'm not on my home comp right now so I can't tell exactly what is, but Morpheus doesn't run on startup.<br />
<br />
Mokor, how do I scan for mydoom? I seem to remember McAfee having a free scan utility on their website but I couldn't find it when I looked. That sucks about how my provider (Comcast) could be stiffing me on bandwidth, is there any way to get around that? Is it permanent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could test Mokor's theory by running a test here (http://www.dslreports.com/stest)  then do your normal routine of opening many windows, then run the test again. If it shows less, then shut all the windows and run it again.<br />
<br />
You can run an online virus scan for free here (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/)  to see if you have anything. I like the online scans since some viruses block files on your hard drive so they won't be detected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get the ipconfig /flushdns command to work, I had to reenable the DNS Client in the Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Admin Tools -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Services and Applications -&gt; Services -&gt; DNS Client which had somehow gotten disabed. Once I turned it back on and flushed the dns using that command (I tried before re-enabling the DNS Client and it didn't work) everything worked fine. I also downloaded Mozilla at the direction of another person on a different forum.<br />
<br />
A quick question about Mozilla.. How do I get the 3rd button scroll on my mouse to work? It works when I roll it, but when I push it down, the fast scroll icon doesn't come up and I can't speed to the top or bottom of the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats! <br />
Dunno about Mozilla though.</div></div><hr />
