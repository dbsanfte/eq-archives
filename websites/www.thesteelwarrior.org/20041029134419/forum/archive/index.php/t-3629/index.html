<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey again guys. I just want a positive outlook on the things my guild can start attempting to kill/farm like Vindi.<br />
<br />
We Have about 181 members in total, 13 of wich are 65, and 34 of wich are 60+ the rest are all 46+ or should be close ot it. We are capable of taking down PoS minis, doing the PoN maze., and recently taking down the Terror Matriarch in PoN. Now i'm curious, with this in mind what do you think we could take down as a guild and maybe some help from friends? Vindi by anychance? Rumblecrush/Doomshade? I'm looking mainly for mobs to kill in order to strenghten the guild with equip(IE: Vindi BP) <br />
<br />
So any ideas? Don't  say things like Vindi will own you, don't even try rumblecrush etc etc. I just want to know what we can try to atempt and learn from our mistakes on. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you could take out vindi with that kinda man power, my guild came close /chuckle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With just the 60+ you can farm Halls of Testing quite easily. Thats the place to go for lots of upgrades for everyone. Other suggestions would be Vindi/statue, Doomshade, Rumblecrush, the big stone guy in Ahkeva (forget his name atm)...basically any velious mob, and most of the luclin mini boss's you should be able to kill with practice.<br />
<br />
The most important thing is going to be getting some AA's and farming HoT for quick cheap gear upgrades for you and any other 65 warrior, then just practice on Vindi till you have a CH chain that holds up. After that it's just a matter of farming mobs for gear to be able to move up the difficulty scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ur looking at close to 50 60+ peeps. Id chase all those who are in the 60s to work their way up to lvl 65, then start doing their aa's.<br />
<br />
if you can manage to field 40-50 65 peeps, then i think you have a huge range of options.<br />
<br />
obviousy many of them will be suffering for AA's, but most of all the old world pre-pop/SoL stuff should be doable. <br />
<br />
start with vindi first, hes the main hurdle you should clear and the benchmark by which you can gauge ur ability v other mobs. if you can nail vindi easy - and theres no reason you shouldnt with those numbers, then get him so he goes down to you real easy i.e everyone knows the strat etc. then you can work up to the other kael guys like statue and tormax.<br />
<br />
I would definitely recommend you do HoT. Once youve cleared it out a few times, most of your 60s should be looking ok for armour, HoT resists are nice too. Also, 30 lvl 65s should be able to manage most of the BoT towers, so id farm those on a regular basis too for the ornate drops, GSo4W for dps for your melees, etc etc.<br />
<br />
once ur starting to look reasonably equipped, then the natural progression would be to move onto NToV. you could probably skip HoT andmove into NToV but theres a lot of lessons which u can learn in HoT which will help for NToV and wont be so punishing on mistakes.<br />
<br />
At the same time, dont forget all your SoL options - rumble, doom, grieg, Itraer etc. they are all doable. just a matter of mastering basic raid strat e.g. prox aggro, rampage tanking, CH chains, AE spells etc.<br />
<br />
You also have a few PoP options - grummus &amp; PoI dragon should be doable with those numbers, although u may  have a slightly harder time on mobs like MB &amp; AD, but even then, theres no harm trying because even if you fail, you will learn a lot.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you have some direction in ur guild, set raiding plans , some proper form of loot distribution and that everyone is after the same goals i.e. raid days take priority, exp on own time and lvls &gt; AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can probably try xanamech, he's practually always up, and the prototypes inside the factory have some really nice items for priest classes. IV in AR isnt too hard as long as you have at least 2 RGC casters, shei, who's also in AR, is at bit harder with the adds but still rather easy once you get the hang of it. tunare is rather easy once you get the positioning down, and has some really good loot. not alot of guilds kills her due to the time it takes to clear the zone, but for a younger guild, you can probably get some armor and alot of gems and cash items for the guild bank. RC and DS you shouldnt be too hard if you can do vindi. rhags in ssra you'll probably want to kill when ever you can.<br />
there are alot of lesser known mobs that are ok for younger guilds. it sounds kinda stupid, but trakanon can be fun, and he has a few useful items. those elemental dudes in UP are often over looked for drops, as well as some of the other lesser known names in there. that chardok add on zone has some good items, as well as korocust. the dragon in veksar is a nice sourse for easy upgrades, if you can get him to spawn. and the ring war in GD for the 10th coldian ring has some good items that you get every time as long as all the coldian heros survive.<br />
if you can do BoT towers the mobs i listed shouldnt be much of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You've got 47 60+, so take your crew and start at one end of velious and rape the whole continent until you're done with ToV.<br />
<br />
You should be able to do damned near anything except higher end PoP with those numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't be afraid to try stuff, if nothing else you'll learn. Keep in mind with velious especially that for a couplr years people did just fine there with nobody over level 60, no virtue,no BSS, no Fo7 etc, so you have an advantage over the pioneers in those respects. I'm not saying these fights are easy, you still need good tactics but you do have more tools than the first people to do them had so once you learn the fights they will come easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Two Things you should get down.<br />
<br />
1) A succesful switch from one of your warriors to another without getting anyone killed once defensive drops.<br />
<br />
2) Clerics that can count to 4 and push the Complete Heal button in order.<br />
<br />
Once you can do those two things, you can kill a ton of mobs.<br />
<br />
Including:<br />
<br />
Vindicator (Kael)<br />
King Tormax (Kael)<br />
Statue of Rallos Zek (Kael)<br />
Avatar of War (might have to count to 3 or 2 hehe) (Kael)<br />
Doomshade (Umbral Plains)<br />
Servitor of Luclin (Grieg's End)<br />
Rumblecrush (Umbral Plains)<br />
The Va'Dyn (Akheva Ruins)<br />
Dain Frostreaver (Thurg)<br />
Velketor the Sorcerer (Velks)<br />
<br />
and a ton of stuff you can also kill but will require figuring out how to stay alive in AE's....<br />
<br />
Klandicar (Western Wastes)<br />
Zlandicar (Dragon Necropolis)<br />
Lenindaria the Keeper (ToV)<br />
Eashen of the Sky (NToV)<br />
Ikatiar the Venomous(NToV)<br />
Lord Yelinak (Skyshrine)<br />
Aaryonar and beyond (and all of NToV)<br />
Rhag 1 and Rhag 2 (Ssra Temple)<br />
The Itraer Vius (Akheva Ruins)<br />
Xanamech Nefirthten (Plane of Innovation - triggered)<br />
<br />
Some things that make fights EASY !!!!<br />
<br />
Two level 65 warriors with max defensive AA's<br />
A level 65 Shaman with Cloud of Grummus<br />
A level 65 Bard for resists<br />
Lots of Clerics with good mana regen...<br />
A ton of DPS. (Rangers with AM 3, level 65 rogues and wizzies)<br />
<br />
with 47 people 60+ if you have two really strong tanks, and 4-5 clerics, you can kill anything listed there. One of the hardest will be the avatar of War and you can definitely kill him with 5 clerics, 2 8k hit point tanks and 41 strong DPS members...<br />
<br />
Like everyone says, give it a try. The best possible thing you can do is start placing your little 'moles' everywhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have trackers in all the important areas looking for mobs.<br />
<br />
I.E. a ranger in Akheva ruins, a spotter in Umbral plains, a non-kos dude in Zlandicar's lair (he starts out indiff) A druid or ranger in Temple of Veeshan to check on named, a level one rallos zek ogre in Kael looking for mobs, a CoV faction guy sitting at Klandicar's spawn point.<br />
<br />
Making sure that people have assigned alts to each of these positions and are checking them frequently on second comp is a real key to success.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we have a TOTAL of 34 60+ that means 65's included. We have 2 solid tanks i think not including myself. Mainly, we Have more druids than clerics in the CH chain so that might make a difference. I myself don't have many AA's yet seeing as i took a break i have about 9AA wich i'm working my hardest to get up.<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks alot guys for your info, i'm looking up all these mobs and considering them.<br />
<br />
Last question can anyone link me any site with guides on Rampage Tanking, avoiding AE's, good Ch chains etc etc like the things you were talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with the above.  You should certainly move from planar to Skyshrine armor which will bump resists, hp and ac.  While in HoT farm not only the armors but the Dozekar symbol/tear quests (these items, in my mind, are as good as some of the stuff in ntov/vt) ... 38 ac bracer with 100hp and 40 percent haste, etc.<br />
<br />
Practice on Vindi.  Once you can kill him fairly easily you should also be able to smack Dozekar in ToV to finish the above quests and be able to farm Guardian of the Seal in the Hole (easy to get to by DA dropping down for his 15ac 85 hp ears and FT2 caster gloves + the new quests).<br />
<br />
Once you are this point, before akheva and ssra I would get to know and work on the Burrower Cycle in The Deep and buff up your caster/healer ft - ft5 chests, ft3 range, ft2 rings etc.  This is a great start to developing your own strats for rings involving wave type encounters.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With 34 people you can do quite a lot.  Without knowing the make-up, its hard to give limitations.  To answer your specific question, I'd say that with that many, a 65 tank with 5khp, and handful of clerics/healers you can certainly do Vindi. <br />
<br />
The best possible mobs, in descending order of difficulty:<br />
<br />
BOT - Einride<br />
POI - Xanamech and Junk Beast<br />
Kael - Vindi<br />
Icewell - Dain<br />
ST Dragon - I'm thinking the one in Dragon Necropolis<br />
PON - Vhaksiz the Shade<br />
TOV - HOT dragons<br />
Umbral - Rumblecrush, Doomshade, Tawro, Radir, Zelnithak<br />
Akheva - Va'Dynn (and maybe IV, but that's trickier on healing)<br />
WW - the BoB quest if SS allied (or robe or range depending on class)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah your guild seems to have the numbers to do alot of stuff but will need to focus on learning how to raid mostly. vindi is a gaetway mob in that hes a good test on your guild versus high melee dps mobs. once you can kill vindi Doomshade, Rumblecrush, Vhaksiz, Vady'nn ect are all within your grasp since they are straight melee. once you can get these relatively high melee dps mobs down no problem and can keep a tank up against a flurrying DS and a rampaging RC then you start on AE mobs.<br />
<br />
 ae mobs to practice on have all been mentioned above like klandicar, zlandiar, bot towers, wtov and first brood dragons (which is redundant as i already listed 2).</div></div><hr />
