<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it's a twink then yes, yes you will. It's all about the Fierce Heraldic/ Helanic Tundra armor.  It's cheap, it's effective and only available if you worship Rallos zek/The Tribunal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you're level 20, I'd personally remake if this was a twink. Thats just me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, untill you can get ornate</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have regretted race/diety choice.<br />
<br />
With sufficient resources and binding in PoK AFAIK (please correct me if I'm wrong) most of the downside of choosing DE, Ogre, and Troll are gone.<br />
<br />
I believe it's possible to get the necessary faction to do the Coldain Ring quests for example, something that would have been unthinkable if the quests were in Kaladim.<br />
<br />
Difficulty in cornering mobs can be overcome with illusions and shrink.<br />
<br />
Frontal stun immunity and superior class/diety armor are pretty big advantages especially for casual players and twinks that may not advance to the point where they become less significant.<br />
<br />
Special items that you may tradeskill also make some race/diety combinations more fun to play.<br />
<br />
At level 20, I really would look into this and get some feedback. With sufficient equipment you can easily make level 20 again. At level 65, as a Dwarf agnostic, I am very aware thaat there is nothing I can tradeskill in game that is unique and worthwhile. Most of my tradeskill effort is made by my level 56 Halfling Druid (Karana) - perhaps not the best choice for a tradeskiller, but infinately better than a Dwarf agnostic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the Luclin and PoP expansions, faction from deity is pretty much a moot point.  The PoK books are ALL in out the way, safe locations.  Faction really doesn't matter unless you are questing. (things like Velious Armor, 8th coldain ring, Loyalist's Shield, etc.) <br />
<br />
If you aren't foreseeing yourself getting to the point where you could get your upgrades from raiding, go ahead and change to an RZ or Tribunal worshipper.  Those 2 suits of armor (Ogre RZ and Ogre CT armors are darned nice, too) are an excellent investment and will last you to 65 and beyond.  <br />
<br />
However, there is something to be said for NOT being a cookie cutter warrior twink.  Every other warrior twink I run into seems to be an RZ ogre or Tribunal Barb.  BLEH!  How boring!  Whatever happened to wanting to be unique?   I've played a Tunare worshipping Wood Elf for nearly 4 years, I haven't regretted it one bit.  I looked for other options instead of whining over deity armors.  Bah, I'm rambling.  Play what you like, it's your $13/month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Everyone can, except obviously races that can't be warriors, and Dwarves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dont forget the vah shir with the woven shim colar(got it last night, 41% haste woot!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll only regret it if you start whining about it around here and we gotta lay the smack down on ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Of all the races that can be warriors Dwarves, Vah Shir and Frogs are the only ones that can not follow RZ iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I play an agnostic dwarf warrior. Time/Elemental flagged with epic. Diety depends on what you want to do. As far as making/using cultural armor, it's good stuff, but there are plenty of options out there.  And there is no easiest path. Just go out, play, and deal with the challenges you get.<br />
<br />
Make good friends, and things like diety become fairly trivial to deal with. As far as faction goes, it's just something else to work on when you need it to meet a goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have spent a fortune on gear because I chose agnostic, and I could have had the same level of ac/hps and spent much much less on cultural, which would have left me with lots of extra plat to spend on other slots.  However, looking back, I enjoyed having a nice mix of different gear and I think I would have been bored outfitting most slots with cultural.  Even now cultural would be an upgrade for me in some slots though.<br />
<br />
If you chose to go agnostic just realize that you are going to have inferior gear to what you would have had if you had chosen a deity, at least until you can get ornate and/or LDoN armors and even then until you are completely outfitted in ornate/LDoN cultural will be superior to what you are wearing in some slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehehe I am an agnostic Dark Elf warrior too. To be honest, I regretted it quite a bit to be agnostic when cultural came out, but now, I can aim to ornate or LDoN stuff so... And I have to recognize that at the Kunark / Velious times, being agnostic was very comfortable, I was able to go to many places where an Inny or RZ DE follower couldnt. All in all, I dont regret it that much to be agnostic, considering I have choosed to be agnostic from a roleplay perspective, rather than from the point of view of efficiency (don't trust to the gods, they're just looking to enslave your mind !). I wanted to be unique, and even if I am not the greatest tank out there HP / AC wise, I think I attained that goal - DEs have just badass-killer look, and it always makes me laugh when n00bs think I am some dual-wielding SK or cleric. Not so far ago I became some kind of super-star at the Guk Fabled camps, everyone was remembering me cause I was pulling like a god (not so many people know those old world dungeons now), led the raids, knew what we were able to take out and what not and was most of the time the only high enough level tank in the place  :cool: <br />
<br />
In a few words - if you are looking for efficiency (to have the highest possible HP / AC / Degree of Uglyness / Stupidity  ;)  ), just roll a Ogre / Troll RZ war and that's it. If you want to be something more &quot;original&quot;... well, a cool alternative would be a Wood Elf RZ warrior (woodie warriors are not that common, plus from a RP perspective, it could be great to see a RZ worshipping Woodie  :rolleyes: ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I too am agnostic. I was annoyed that I couldn't use the fierce heraldic cultural stuff, but I got over it. My guess is you will too, but then again, I didn't really feel like rerolling and playing the same 50 levels over again for a few HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If plat isn't an issue, I'd stay agnostic.  If plat is an issue, I'd start over with RZ.  <br />
<br />
Cultural armor is 1/5th the price (or less) of comparable agnostic gear.  Or, to put it in direct plat terms...expect to pay about 100k to decently equip an RZ warrior, but about 500k to get the same ac/stats/hp for an agnostic warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agnostic is win :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KunabKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It really depends on how far you plan on taking this toon. <br />
<br />
I play a Vah Shir Warrior, which is agnostic and earlier on I was in the same boat as Dragan--annoyed that I couldn't get nice upgrades for not a whole lot of plat. <br />
<br />
Not having cultural armor sucks, but if you're going to really twink this toon and grab him levels (55+) you can most likely not worry about the armor although it's something nice to be able to fall back on while you upgrade.<br />
<br />
Since you're only level 20, I'd reroll and give him RZ diety so you can give him some decent gear right off and be able to tank pretty damn well until you get other upgrades.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />
