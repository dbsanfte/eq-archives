<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit, I think I'm writing this post calmly and collectively as sort of a desperate attempt to prevent me from fully blowing a gasket and going off on a furious diatribe of profanities.   First an analysis, and then a commentary.<br />
<br />
First, let me give the initial disclaimer so that we dont' go off on tangents.   This analysis deals SPECIFICALLY with the part of the game known as &quot;The Planes of Power&quot;, and as such, with the exception of portal stones in PoKnowledge, is limited to the &quot;high level&quot; of the game.   One cannot zone into those planes without being level 46, and realistically, most issues will cover from approximately level 53-65, and will focus the MOST on levels 61-65.    If you have a desire to discuss non-PoP, or general warrior things, then please do so on your own thread.<br />
<br />
The State of Warriors in PoP:<br />
<br />
It can be said that warriors focus on three areas.   Melee damage output, Melee Damage absorption, and The generation and sustenance of an opponent's attention (aggro).   <br />
<br />
Melee Damage Output:<br />
<br />
Planes of Power has been *somewhat* kind to warriors in this regard.   By not having the ridiculous AC on opponents, melee damage seems to be meaningful when compared to the previous expansion.    <br />
<br />
The 50's:  Damage output is fairly good, and many new weapons are available at relatively decent pricing from the Bazaar.   With a minimal investment, warriors seem to be doing just fine in the DPS department.<br />
<br />
There is indeed a drawback to this, and it's the matter called &quot;mudflation&quot;.    What mudflation is, is the increasing power of weaponry to &quot;the masses&quot; which obsoletes previous choices and gear.    The reason that &quot;mudflation&quot; has become particularly problematic in the Planes of Power is because the influx of weaponry seems to follow a fascinating trend, which is that there are very few droppable pieces of gear in the early planes which a member of a group hunting there would put on.   All &quot;worthy&quot; gear seems to come from areas which are 2 tiers higher than where people are hunting for experience.   This cheapens the experience of hunting, from one of multiple rewards, in both experience and equippable items, to one of the acquisition of experience points only. <br />
<br />
This problem is significant, one of the most problematic areas in PoP in my view.   Let me say it in a different way.    <br />
<br />
I hunted in Sebilis, and in Howling Stones when I was getting to 60.    There was itemization, and experience.   You had the &quot;double reward&quot;.    The thing was, there were items in those zones which you were WILLING to put on.   PoP loot has been *extremely* problematic in this regard.   Generally speaking, items which you have acquired have been found in Tier 3 zones, and by the time you were fighting there, the items that dropped (and quite rarely at that), we in essence auotmatically &quot;bazaar trinkets&quot; to you.   They are almost NEVER equipped by those hunting there.    They make their way to the Bazaar, where people who WOULD make good use of them grab them.   These people are in generally in the mid 50's, and they immediately benefit from those items.   On the other hand, what it THEN does is places a standard on their next upgrade.    They know at this point that in order to even DUPLICATE what they have, they'll have to level throughout the planes into Tier 3 and still won't be rewarded, because they already HAVE the reward from that plane.   It then turns the experience of Everquest into nothing more than advancing the little blue bar and yellow bar of experience.    <br />
<br />
60-65 DPS:   It's good, perhaps the biggest problem being the gap in gear, and lack of upgrades available without raiding.  Two things happen in this level range.  Your level vs. mob level goes up, and you gain 2 damage bonus increases (one at 61 I think and one at 64).   Again, DPS overall is quite acceptable though with the exception of weapon availability.<br />
<br />
A word on the lack of upgrades without raiding:    This is very important to a warrior in particular because it is universally accepted that warriors are the most equipment dependent class in EQ.   Raiding should *always* grant the biggest payoff, but the alternative to raiding shouldn't be *no* payoff, but a smaller one.<br />
<br />
65+AA DPS:   Warriors are *not* hurting at all in this area.   We do substantial damage, and aside from some itemization things and the viability of dual wield (which does need to be looked at and fixed), we do very well, particularly raiding warriors.   Most warriors are quite happy with their damage output.   <br />
<br />
In relation to other classes from a Damage Output perspective:<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. Rogue:   We seem to be ok<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. monk:  Monks are a little weak at the moment in relation to warriors, and should have some sort of DPS output improvement.<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. Ranger:   Seems to be Ok and acceptable<br />
<br />
Warrior Vs. Knight:   Knights are slightly too high in relation to warriors, there needs to be a more clear difference between the two.  Also, the itemization favoritism toward knights is simply wrong to the point of humorous.<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. Beastlord:  Seems reasonable<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. Caster:   Seems reasonable<br />
<br />
Damage Absorption:<br />
<br />
The biggest problem area here is warriors' damage absorption in relation to other classes.   They're not *enough* better to compensate for their clear weakenesses.   This area cannot really be undererstimated.<br />
<br />
The reason that warriors were so far ahead of the other &quot;tanks&quot; in Kunark and early velious was two reasons.   <br />
<br />
1. The cost of Complete heal was higher than the cost of ancillary heals.<br />
<br />
2. Mana was finite and med times were a reality for groups.<br />
<br />
With cleric mana being not an issue with the advent of KEI+ and FT, the argument of tanking efficiency is out the window.  The only reason for tanking efficiency to be a big deal is to conserve a finite amount of mana, but mana isn't really that finite any more.   Because of this, durability differences being not very large pale in comparison to other benefits such as aggro control, ancillary abilities (such as infusing your paty members with mana for even LESS downtime).    <br />
<br />
On the whole, warriors should have a distinctly larger melee damage absorption advantage over others than they currently do.   The point of difference should be noticeable, not a little.<br />
<br />
The Itemization Aspect:<br />
<br />
Warrior only armor pieces offer BARELY greater protection than their Knight Counterparts, while the knight counterparts gain HUGE pluses in terms of manapools, which is the source of their power.   This is... as simply put as I can say... totally unfair to warriors, and needs to be addressed.   If I'm two dimensional, and my competitive counterpart is 3-dimensional, if the sum of my two dimensions is far behind the sum of his three, then he has an unfair advantage over me and this is wrong.   Also, if the ancillary pieces available to my competitor in every slot are identical to those available to me, then the only difference is in the class only armors, where my &quot;advantage&quot; is swallowed up and overshadowed by his &quot;advantages&quot;... there NEEDS to be a greater defensive spread between warriors and all others.<br />
<br />
Taunt:<br />
<br />
Simply put, this is the most screwed up area of EQ.   Warriors are a relic of the past because they cannot reliably and AT WILL get and maintain aggro, while their competitive counterparts CAN with no cost other than a little mana, which in a world of KEI, is again, infinite.<br />
<br />
Notice please, I am not saying that it's broken because warriors and their groups have to work at aggro, but because they do AND their competitive counterparts DONT.   <br />
<br />
Balance it, fix it, it MUST be done, it's screwed up beyond measure.   All other areas of being a warrior are meaningless if the warrior is perceived as not being able to perform this basic task while others are.   Either bring the competitiors down to our level, or bring us up to theirs, I dont' really care.  i suppose I'd prefer the others were brought down, as it wouldn't make the game even more boring.  Whatever it takes FIX IT.    <br />
<br />
The mitigation advantage is VAPORIZED due to the aggro imbalance, because a warrior has to tank unslowed mobs for longer periods of time, and because with the cost of ancillary heals (Sup Remedy, Sup Elixir, and Sup Light) are either the SAME or GREATER mana cost than complete heal, making a warrior a LESS efficient tank, not only from a safety perspective, but also for a mana cost per hour perspective.<br />
<br />
Commentary:<br />
<br />
Nothing has been communicated other than when put on the spot in Fan Faires some vague reference to a &quot;need&quot; to work on long-standing issues comes up to fill the masses with hope only to be unfulfilled, over and over and over again.    <br />
<br />
To me, it's become a matter of character.   If you state the intention to fix something and say that it's broken, and it doesn't happen, then you are a liar, and a deceiver.   There is no other way to put a nice face on it, you have no values, and are not trustworthy.    Sony Online Entertainment is beginning to fit this description.   Certainly they've been guilty at many times of different types of stupidity, mostly in the area of overpromising and underdelivering, but none in such a large way of how they've strung warriors along, stating time and time again that the warrior issues brought to their attention were real and valid issues which needed attention, yet not doing thing one about them.<br />
<br />
Dear SOE, warriors ARE still a class in Everquest, and need to be treated like one.   You communicate on ranger boards, and FOR GODS SAKE you post messages FOR MONKS on the DRUID boards because you won't post on the monk boards due to not wanting to support a Player Auctions funded board.... you DONT post a DAMN thing on warrior boards.. we're the @*(&amp;*(@^&amp;  forgotten stepchild of EQ, we hear vague references from fan faires and keep hope alive.  The hope is fading, I for one have just about stopped believing that you give a rat's ass about warriors' ONGOING issues, when you publicly state something as patently absurd as that you are going to balance melee DPS.... warriors for the most part don't WANT to have DPS screwed with, we want to be viable again, in our ONE job.. tanking.    <br />
<br />
Warrior issues:<br />
<br />
1. BALANCE AGGRO.... FIX IT, IT&quot;S LONG PAST OVERDUE <br />
<br />
2. Make the warrior &quot;defensive advantage&quot; mean something</div></div><hr />

An item like the Cord Hilted Spike Driver should be much easier to obtain for an average warrior. Same for Obsidian Greatblade, I don't think many warriors that have access to Sol Ro Tower would consider it an upgrade, the dam/delay ratio is just too low and not enough hps on it. <br />
The difference between warriors that have an enraging blow weapon and the ones that don't is simply way too big. Making taunting blow weapons easier to obtain would ease this problem a lot.<br />

ATM we're the only class that all but requires raidgear to perform it's job in the high end exp game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not really realistic for us to be the best tanks and the best at holding agro. While I too wish it were the case, the role of the knights has been clearly shown, they're supposed to be better at holding agro; a lot better. I do agree however that to make up for our weakness at grabbing agro quickly (not really a major issue with dual EB or a BoW) we should be granted some sort of increased defensive mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall I agree on most of the points.<br />
<br />
Currently i only have issues with aggro in one situation. Exp group that cast on pull or shortly after it. <br />
<br />
normally its ok if its a shammy and me. he malo's then slows. after that slow i taunt and it comes right back to me. <br />
<br />
add druid/enchanter/wiz into the mix and im barly keeping aggro untill my epic procs.<br />
<br />
How about tuning the epic to proc at a higher rate (2hs procs at 2x the rate of the 1hs /boggle)<br />
<br />
with 265 dex i should not have to wait 3 min to proc on some mobs.<br />
<br />
That would do 2 things. give better +hate access to warriors that are not in a guild that are aow ready.<br />
<br />
help us close the gap between us and pally/sk's and warriors.<br />
<br />
Personally I dont think that warriors dont hold taunt well enough. But that pallys and sk's hold it too well. If you have 100% reliable taunt it would be the same as having a +hate procing weapon that proced on each swing... overpowered and trivializing the game<br />
<br />
I could be wrong though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not really realistic for us to be the best tanks and the best at holding agro. <br />
<br />
I fail to see where anyone said we should be the best at both.  What I see is that it should be balanced.  As in, they may taunt better, but we should be better at tanking enough that there is a reason to choose a warrior.  Or maybe up our taunting and leave tanking the same... what ever way they do it, just make sure it's balanced, instead of us getting the shaft as it is right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said it pretty well, Frodlin :).<br />
<br />
I would like to add that the equation of tanks balance was always : <br />
- Warrior : one dimensionnal defensive tank, and NO utility outside of tanking.<br />
- Paladin : tank almost as good as a warrior, with a lot of defensive support ability (AE heals, patch heals, unique buffs, Lay hand, root...)<br />
- Shadowknight : tank almost as good as a warrior, with a lot of offensive support ability (Dots, HT, snare, hate generation, group attack buf, lifetaps...)<br />
<br />
Actually, the only thing I think we have is our &quot;3 minutes of tanking glory&quot; disciplines... 2 days ago, I saw a sk tanking xp mobs glued to him, he NEVER lost aggro. Yesterday, a cleric I know very well admited that he prefer knights to warriors for tanking, and he never ask pickup warriors to join his group.<br />
<br />
Every patch I hope to see something about warriors and aggro in the message... SOE announced an &quot;ehanced taunt&quot; at fan faire, melee rebalancing may 14... yet there is nothing, even on test server, showing a move in our direction.<br />
<br />
Edit :<br />
It's not really realistic for us to be the best tanks and the best at holding agro.<br />
<br />
I dont know what is your definition of &quot;best tank&quot;, but for any other class that dont want to take a hit, the best one is the one that is the best at holding aggro. Healing mana is trivial with the mana regen party everquest is now (KEI, Spiritual, FT, PoG/Po9...), but healing every time only 1 character instead of 2 is something you have only with a knight tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam3</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First agree Frodin :)<br />
As others said, if they don t want to increase taunt, make more Taunting blow weapon for people who are not in ubber guild, or give epic a boost (should be 14 20 and more proc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I dont think that warriors dont hold taunt well enough.

<br />
That's what Paladins do with their level 9(cease) and level 15(desist) stun spells currently. Is it not trivializing on that level as we speak? <br />
<br />
If SoE were to make spells that had no chance of sticking (ie. a level 9 spell on a level 62 mob) not get aggro, it would force the Paladins to use the higher level spells and more mana to get the result they have today. This atleast would be somewhat balanced.<br />
<br />
They know there is a problem, and haven't figured out the answer. They don't want to mudflate the game with their solution so it is taking a little time. A word from them once in a while would be nice though. I couldn't believe that the only thing mentioned lately was the melee output, which encompasses all melee including knights. Not one word about the taunt issue which has been discussed in every class forum for months on end.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Absor did stop by to spam us wih the Stromm server coming online, but didn't comment on the 10 threads in the same forum about this issue. <br />

Hmmm</div></div><hr />

Those are the best places for your anger and concern. Judging from the months upon months of posting on boards about these same concepts and seeing no results, the only possible alternatives is spamming all 3 sources with e-mails, over and over. Thats the only way to get a fix. Link all the warrior threads posted here so they get a general sence of what is going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very good post, Frodlin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what the big problem that people aren't seeing is this.  You're right in some regards.   Aggro has historically been a strong point among knights, and a fairly weak point among warriors.   This was made up for though historically, with a rather large spread in tankability between knights and warriors, as well as a rather large DPS spread between the two.   Complete heal used to be a fairly expensive spell when mana pools were much smaller than they are now, and mana regen wasn't nearly what it is today.   Finally, the dire need for a mob to be focused on a single tank wasn't as crucial as it is today because of environmental reasons (i.e. encounter design).   It didnt' used to be that when one party member got hit, that it would cost the same mana as complete heal (supernal remedy and elixir), or in some cases MORE (Supernal Light), and oom was a reality as well.   <br />
<br />
The difference in tankability is no longer wide.  As a matter of fact, the difference in tankability is SO small that there's many cases when a Paladin has more HP/AC yadda yadda than a warrior because of equipment.   What this means is that there's no real inherent &quot;class&quot; advantage, but merely a &quot;class advantage when at equal levels of equipment&quot;.   In other words &quot;A warrior&quot; isn't inherently better at tanking than &quot;a paladin&quot;, but disclaimers must be placed on it.  &quot;A warrior in equivalent level gear is somewhat better at absorbing damage than a paladin as long as he or she can get and hold aggro&quot;.   <br />
<br />
The act of the matter is that many of my guild's paladins are significantly better at taking damage than many warriors on my server.   There's no inherent &quot;class benefit&quot;.   There's the HP/Sta calculation and the avoidance skill level difference.  The avoidance skill level difference has been shown to mean thata warrior gets hit approximately 1.5% less often than a knight.   That's one and a half hits difference out of 100.<br />
<br />
What that does NOT compensate for is a multitude of ways to prevent melee damage from occuring (stuns) nor heals, multiple &quot;get out of jail free cards&quot; (DA/LoH), nor heals, group heals which fit PERFECTLY with Divine Arbitration, and so on and so forth, or Infusing your party with mana multiple times per fight, FD, and so on and so forth along with PERFECT aggro control.   <br />
<br />
What I'm getting at is that in &quot;the tradeoff&quot; we're getting ripped off.   What we have in terms of &quot;advantage&quot; (a hp/sta calculation and 1.5 less hits out of 100) does NOT compensate with what either knight class has, and to be utterly crippled in &quot;at will&quot; aggro generation makes it even worse.<br />
<br />
No, I dont' think anyone's arguing for warriors being &quot;the best&quot; at both tanking and controlling aggro, I think what we want is parity.  We want to have a &quot;total package&quot; which is equal to the &quot;total package&quot; that our competitive counterparts bring.</div></div><hr />

Raid functionality is only a small part of game functionality.  And more and more Warrior raid functionality is shrinking.  But feel free to cling to your insistance that the ship isn't sinking, the iceberg did no real damage, and the band should continue to play.  The rest of us are looking for the life boats.</div></div><hr />

Can I ask you a few questions?   I'm really curious.<br />
<br />
1. You say that warriors in your guild tank every mob, trash and bosses.   <br />
<br />
-Can you tell me why this is?   In other words, on what basis do your raid or guild leaders make this decision?  <br />
<br />
<br />
-Do you think that it's the best choice?  <br />
<br />
<br />
-If so, please explain why.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  You claim (and affirm in a subsequent post) that you feel that my original post takes &quot;only the extreme into account&quot;.  <br />
<br />
-Can you point out specifically where this occurs?    <br />
<br />
-Can you tell me the last time you were in an experience group comprised of 2/3 of people not flagged for the planes of Earth, Water, Air, or Fire?<br />
<br />
- Can you tell me that, based on your experiences (Flagged early in PoP for Elemental planes) you honestly feel that you know what 'average&quot; is, by which to compare &quot;extreme&quot; to?   <br />
<br />
- Can you define 'extreme' as you used it?<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, probably gonna get flamed for this one, but hey, its on my mind.  balance? i keep hearing all of us warriors talking about how all we want is balance when it comes to tanking mobs and gaining/holding aggro.  WTF?  why should we want balance?  we should be the ultimate in gaining and holding aggro, and then taking the resulting beating, that is our JOB!!!  i don't want balance, i want to be able to do those things well with a certain amount of certainty.  will a druid ever heal as well as a cleric?  NO.  will a mage ever deal as much DD with a single spell as a wizzy?  NO.  why?  because it is a cleric's job to heal, and as such he holds an ADVANTAGE!!!  it is a wizzy's job to nuke, and as such they are dealt a decided advantage!!!  it is my job to tank, i should hold a decided advantage over the other classes.  i have given up enough in this god damn game not to be good at the only thing i'm supposed to be good at.  i see this problem all the time, with our caster classes there is always a clear cut advantage to one of  them as far as the ability they excel at.  this is no different, but when it gets to us its all fucked up.  <br />
<br />
i'm not trying to say a pally or SK should not have the ability to tank, of course with the absence of a warrior they should be able to, but when grouped with a warrior the warrior should hold the decided advantage.  i'm not asking for balance, i'm asking for a clearly defined and definite advantage at the ONE and ONLY thing we are SUPPOSED to do well.  what is so hard about giving warriors a decided advantage in gaining and maintaining aggro?  so what, instead of healing the pally who is holding aggro, you heal the warrior who is.  <br />
<br />
so anyway, i'm sure there are lots of factors involved in that which i'm not pointing out, and i'm sure its never quite that simple, and i'm sure plenty of people who will reply with those reasons, but for christs sake, i thought the point of the seperate classes was to be able to divide up what each one was good at doing.  it would seem that when each of us chose our classes way back we knew what we were getting into, i chose a warrior because i THOUGHT i was going to be able to tank, the pally next to me i'm certain had it in his brain that he was giving up some tanking ability for his spells, and the cleric chose a cleric so he could heal.  i don't really see another class rivaling a cleric for healing ability, so why the hell should another class rival me for tanking ability!!!<br />
<br />
maybe in my well ordered brain i thought that each class had a role to play, and that sony would somehow allow each class to fulfill their roll, but i guess that i was wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I see it we are the only &quot;parent&quot; class that is inferior to its &quot;children&quot; classes in terms of its primary job (and in our case the ONLY job).  Clerics being the &quot;parent&quot; priest class are w/o question the masters of healing.  Why shouldn't we be the master of something?  Oh yeah I forgot we are the masters of spamming &quot;/ooc Warrior LFG&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I group regulary with a level 60 Paladin friend and I can say w/o a doubt that I am inferior to her in every way that matters for a tank class. Sure I may have a few more HP but anyone that says that is an advantage is full of crap.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I agree with everyting the original poster has said.  Too bad everyone at Sony/VI is too stupid to be able to comprehend something so well thought out and written.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree some with Khazzuz.<br />
<br />
There is a reason some classes are pure melee/caster and others are hybrids. Pure classes should always have the advantage over hybrids, hybrids split their specialization/abilities into a multitude of areas and as such should not be the best at anything except a very small ninch in the game. <br />
<br />
example 1)<br />
Rangers: They deal massive ranged damage, that is their job. They now have to contend with agro, and they reallyu have low defense so for them agro is a concern and they need to be aware of it.<br />
<br />
example 2) <br />
Bards: The have the unique ability to cast on the fly for no mana multiple spells to buff parties. They can tank, well they were plate at least. they dual wield so they do dps. but no one uses them as a dps or tank class. they are group buffers/raid buffers. that is their ability.<br />
<br />
example 3)<br />
Beastlords: They have a pet, pet does good dps. they also do good dps. They have weak mitigation. The can buff, but not as well as a shaman, they can slow, but not as well as a shaman, they are ok to replace a shaman as a second choice, but a shaman will always be chosen first because of better buffs and slows. Their Beastcrack was added to give them a good raid usage, it does not replace KEI etc. <br />
<br />
Do we notice a trend? These are hybrids, they have utility roles, not meant to be able to replace another class completely.<br />
<br />
Then there are the knights.<br />
What is their ninch? I do not think SOE/Verant really knows. The classic knight was a warrior who went solo and did good deeds. Defeated undead and evil. This Paladins can do very well... heloo 5k crit against undead. with self heals and such they solo undead all day long. The SK's are the antithesis of this they use undead, and they can solo...<br />
<br />
What happened in EQ? They can solo, they can tank, they can cast spells, they hold aggro best. <br />
<br />
what is their limitation?<br />
<br />
low mana pool? their spells are cheap and with regens that is no consideration.<br />
<br />
low hp's? They have arguable almost as good as warriors. sure we get more hp per stamina, but stamina max at 305 so thats what 200 hps? Their equipment is for the most pasrt identical to warriors save 5-10 hps and most items are dual usable.<br />
<br />
low dps? hmmmm, how many warrior weapons have the ratio of knight weapons?  Very few if any. So they dont get to dual wield, with their weapons do they really need to? With the upgrade to bash they can bash for 100+ easilly.<br />
<br />
low AC? Well their armor is almost identical to warrior, AND they get shields.. Paladins are not hurting for AC.<br />
<br />
high aggro? Well, if this was supposed to be a downfall, it is not. It is by far a benefit. Pre-PoP and somewhat pre Luclin this may have been a consideration, Post PoP - it has changed the way things are done in EQ.<br />
<br />
Knights need their part to play I do not want to deny them that. They have needed buffs BSS for Pallys, the Aggro spell for SK's to make them wanted raid wise. they have spells to help, they can solo, and in a pinch they should be able to MT. What is wrong is that they have all this AND they can MT in any XP group better than all but the best equipped elemental warriors on server. And even then that is debateable.<br />
<br />
What do I think should be a difference to fix this?<br />
<br />
There are several easy wasy that this can be done.<br />
<br />
1.) HP's there is no good explanation why warriors went from being the undisputed king of hps to barely better than the next.  Warriors should get a premium on HP's on every item and spell. a simple 15% or 20% bonus would be sufficient. some may say this is too much, but back pre-POP when warriors had 6-7k hp and knight had 4-5k we had a 20% advantage, now it is almost negligeable.<br />
<br />
2.) AC mitigation. Give us a consistent amount of noticeable mitigation. If a mob hits another plate class, say Paladin for 2000 it should only hit us for 1600. A  Leather or silk should be hit for 2400 or so. the concept that all armor classes take same max damage is to me silly.<br />
<br />
3.) Disciplines. Does anyon but me see that all these use the same timer as silly? Look at the warrior, what is his class defining ability? Defensive. sure we do other stuff, but that is what people want us for. to tank that mob that hits for 3000 with defensive. How many other disciplines are ever used? They should just check records I  would say that defensive/evasive is used about 95% of the time, the rest, especially the hour long reset just are not worth it enough. Someone once said to make disciplines like spells give them gems and a refresh. this is such a good idea, i do not see why it hasnt been done. Easy to implement, all the tools already there, refresh times, mem times, etc<br />
<br />
4.) Taunt... back to taunt. what could we do to fix this. Well first of, does it seem strange that every other single skill that you have has a message saying if you fail/succeed? hide/sneak/fishing/trades/disarm/beg etc... every single one except taunt. WTF, who forgot this? We all know taunt is not 100% lets at least get told when we fail. Or does SOE?VErant really not want us to see how much it fails. Then we would have proof that what we have been saying all along is correct. Also, a little range on the ability would be nice. Having to kiss someone to taunt them is a little silly.<br />
<br />
5.) Procs... Now I am not one without, I have BoC, Epic, and  JSoFF. But needing to rely on a proc puts us at such a disadvantage over other classes. Look at the Pally bracer, free mana stun, intant aggro cast 6.0 refresh instant. I do not feel that giving us right-click aggro weapons would be too much to do. Look at EB it has a range of 200! would be nice to use that.  Give it a refresh time to cast say 30.0, give it a short casting time. With 0 channelling the wind blows and we get interupted. This would give us a somewhat reliable taunt effect usable at range. <br />
More of these aggro weapons should be available, realistically only post 55 do they really make a difference, but every tank should have access to some of these, not just rich/uber guild people. <br />
<br />
Well, I guess thats enough of a rant for this morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this seems like a pitifully simple to accomplish idea here, but what about this: For the warrior class only, you either always, or perhaps as low as 95% of the time, proc on the first swing that lands. Make it an AA you have to buy if you are all that concerned with &quot;balance&quot; but I don't personally see it as being unbalancing. <br />
<br />
This way the dual eb having set will be completely ahead of the knights off the bat and it still gives those who don't have a reliable agro producing proc something to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Don't change anything else about the proc rate. Just make the first swing go off.<br />
<br />
Now before I make this next comment, be aware that I'm one of those with the apparently minority opinion that warriors do far too little damage. When I, at lvl 65, with fairly decent weaponry and armor (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80830) can still get beat by green giants in Kael without using a disc or being buffed, there's a problem. The disparity between the damage of the classes really irks me. Nowhere in the little brochure that teld me that warriors were the masters of battle did it say &quot;if you mean being a great meatshield but you hit like a girl otherwise). I want to hit for more damage, both with a bow and melee. The &quot;burst&quot; damage of casters is no longer a burst but steady for all the reasons mentioned earlier and the melee classes, including knights, have so many other things that add to their class that they have almost no minuses. I want to not only take tremendous damage, but I want to deal it as well, else there is no scaleability on raids beyond the need for a couple of MT's.<br />
<br />
In any case, although it seems it's just a personal gripe that has little to do with balance, I think there should be a change to Ambidextry. To my mind, being ambidextrous means that you are equally proficient with either hand. Considering it's high cost, I think they should add to it. I think that if you have amibidextry, you should no longer have an &quot;off-hand.&quot; Both hands should be treated as primary, with the same damage bonuses and in fact, once you have purchased the aa, you should be able to put a primary only weapon in either hand.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents. Go ahead and flame at will if it's your desire.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />

From the fan faires, to the last &quot;tanking review&quot; it's becoming more clear to me that it's just all lip service.<br />

I've never seen a game where a class is so totally neglected, and a large community of players so ignored. We have some damn good people here, with alot of great ideas and suggestions.<br />

I have no EB type item (other than the hate proc on the epic), and I cannot hold aggro very well.  This is a reality for me and has been from lvl 20 to 60.  I now play in tier one/two and three on a frequent basis.  All this to say i'm not a newb to the warrior class.<br />
<br />
I truely think the solution to the problem is found in the facts that no one ever disputes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are the class most dependant on gear&quot;<br />
<br />
The solution to the problem is not to introduce more gear or bells and whistles... The solution is to make more of the defining skills intate to the class.<br />
<br />
Let me go back for a moment...... <br />
<br />
When I was a lowbie, you had to get a PGT to be any good.  But I was lvl 10 and the PGT was a rare drop off a mob in a high pass where I would get owned should I go so I got one at lvl 20 when I could kill it in a group.  Next came the BBC... I got one of those at about 25 and proceeded to High Keep.  Groups did not want me cause I could not hold aggro or kill quick enough without an Exe Axe.. so my trial continued.<br />
<br />
Off I went to lower guk by lvl 40, I got one.  But once again, I was told I was no good in a group unless I had a wurmslayer.  Off to fight some mini dragons... finally got one of those at 50 ... to once again find out I just did not make the grade because it was too slow.  Back to guk for a yak, and kill the general for a ornate sword.... but I still sucked according to others. <br />
<br />
At 60 I got my epic, but since I don't have EB, I remain a relic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of importance are mainly HP/AC and the taunt skill.  These are in fact the &quot;spells&quot; of the warrior.  The problem lies simply that unless you have gear beyond you capablity ... you don't make the grade.<br />
<br />
The taunt button should be weighed heavier than it is now.  EB items would likely have to be tamed down to not create a class inbalance.  A lvl 10 warrior should not equip a wurmslayer for the same reason a lvl 10 cleric does not have complete heal.<br />
<br />
I like other changes outlined here (i.e. discs as gems on indepentant timers), but I really think these changes would simply make playing a warrior for fun.  The crux of the problem with the class is defining gear is available to few and to make the cut, one must equip themself beyond their own means.<br />
<br />
65 cleric LFG.. don't have CH or rez.  How ridiculous would that be.<br />
<br />
I would go on here.. but its pointless... you cannot fix it for self, and those who can are not listening.  If you are listening.. <br />
<br />
Consider making equipment for the level that is attainable by the level and works properly for that level.  For all of you who would flame me for saying you should not beable to twink yourself to be effective.. blah on that, you cannot twink supernal remedy onto a 50 cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yroc, you have expressed exactly what has bugged me the most about EQ for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I can count on one hand with 3 fingers missing the number of items/weapons I have looted on my own since I was level 20. Yet I see level 51 Druids soloing for armor that is better than their Skyshrine armor.   <br />
<br />
A clerics main job is to heal which is dependent on one stat..MANA.  With enough mana (some of which they get inately) they can heal until the cows come home.  <br />
<br />
Our main and only job is to tank which is dependent on one thing...AGGRO, yet with all the gear in the world its still a RANDOM thing and we have NO inate way to aggro.  Taunt is not an inate ability, its nothing more than a call to the Random Number Generator that if successfull give us aggro for a few brief moments.  How often does a Cleric fizzle on casting Cheal compared to how often I fail at Taunt?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sinply put, we don't have aggression problems. We use warriors because we don't have to use a hybrid class, chain casting a spell, to keep the mob in place. I have the raid open up full burn on most high end (elemental) bosses/minis when they reach 60 percent life. I have not seen one of these mobs leave me ONCE in over 4 months (not counting the warlord in PoEB, he's what I call a bitch mob). To say that you need a hybrid to successful hold aggression on any raid type mobs, trash or boss, is extreme.<br />
<br />
Do I think it's the best choice to use a warrior to tank the trash and boss mobs? Of course it is, a warrior is the only class that has a long term /dis that can save his ass if things get rough. Our warriors outdistance our hybrids in the areas of hps and ac. My question to you is; why would I use a hybrid to tank these mobs when we have warriors (who have better stats) tank them just fine?<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;-Can you point out specifically where this occurs? <br />
-Can you tell me the last time you were in an experience group comprised of 2/3 of people not flagged for the planes of Earth, Water, Air, or Fire?<br />

- Can you define 'extreme' as you used it?&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Average joe? We are talking about PoP correct? This expansion was not made for the casual player. If you, as an casual player, think you can skip all the gearing steps of the early expansions and jump right into PoP you have another thing coming. This isn't a problem with our class, it's a problem with people not understanding that this game has certain points that need to be reached before moving on. If you pass those points then you will pay the price, which is you will not have the proper gear.<br />
<br />
I find your views on taunt to be very extreme. I have no problems with my little taunt button working a good percent of the time. Combine that with my dedication leading to great gear and I have no issues at all. Does this mean that I don't know the harsh struggles of a casual player? A casual player has things easier atm then ever. You have all of the big tier guilds tied up in PoP, there is NO reason a mid to low tier guild is not attempting the mobs that will lead to the gear needed to be successful in PoP, in raiding and grouping. Should gear be super important to  a warrior in the views of holding aggression and tanking well? Hell yes it should. I will put a firm no to any petition that ask for taunt to turn into some miracle button that forces a mob to stay on a warrior, no matter the gear, the whole time. That would throw the whole concept of gear improving your character down the drain.<br />
<br />
I've seen a few people post that gear is more important for warriors then anyone else, that is not true. For a hybrid to be able to tank effectively in PoP vs a warrior they need damn good gear, a cleric to be able to keep up with a good exp group they need FT and mana, a rogue can't do his job effectively if he is stuck with crap weapons and no attack boost items, rangers are in the same boat as rogues but they need bows to their jobs effectively, wizards aren't going to be much use for a group if they have bad FT and a low mana pool...ect. Everyone is in the same boat as warriors. Sure a hybrid can hold aggression on some random exp mob in PoP just fine, but who in the hell wants to heal some undergeared hybrid who is tanking a little better then a naked ranger? No one does. Same goes for an undergeared warrior, no one wants you to join their group.<br />
<br />
On a last note, a major problem happening in todays gaming world is people are no longer grouping out of their guilds. So some of you are having troubles finding groups not because of your class, but because people are staying within their little cliques.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between having to and it being a better choice.   No one said you HAD to, any more than I'm saying you HAVE to use a warrior on any mobs.  You choose to use a warrior, others don't, others choose Knights.<br />
<br />
Remember when you did the RZ script?   Who tanked Tallon?  A Warrior?  I need to see this in action because quite frankly I don't believe that it's reasonable.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not &quot;extreme&quot; to say that theyr'e used... that's what I said, don't come up with my arguments for me, I didnt' say that they HAD to be used, but I DO say that they're safer to use and lead to dead mobs faster, because it's true.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Because mobs die faster, and because if clerics dont' have their heads up their butts, they can heal a knight without any problem.  Just as you say you dont' have any aggression problems with warriors, the inverse is also true, for most mobs, there's no healing problem.  Unless of course, your knights are neglected in terms of gear, then it could be a problem.  I would argue that except for 6 mobs, there's no benefit to using either that can't be overcome.   <br />

Now you and I both know that I'm not a 'casual player', but I'm not going to take an elitist approach to class balance issues simply because someone is.   This game, and PoP as well, isn't specifically designed for raiding guilds.   The end game is, but if it were, then the first 2/3 of the expansion would be sitting empty.   It's designed for players that are high level, that much is for sure, but not necessarily raiders only.  I'm perfectly satisfied with my gear, and it's significantly better than &quot;the average joe&quot; who's exping in BoT/Valor/Storms, but to turn to them and say &quot;Your class won't work unless you get to the point I'm at&quot; is really being nothing but an elitist.   Finally, which &quot;high end raid zones&quot; enable knight aggro capabilities?  I'll clue you in... Shadowhaven is where Cease and Desist can be found at, North Freeport, Erudin, Qeynos, Rivervale, AkAnon, Felwithe, and PoK are where Stun and Holy Might are found.   <br />

You have all of the big tier guilds tied up in PoP, there is NO reason a mid to low tier guild is not attempting the mobs that will lead to the gear needed to be successful in PoP, in raiding and grouping. Should gear be super important to a warrior in the views of holding aggression and tanking well? Hell yes it should. I will put a firm no to any petition that ask for taunt to turn into some miracle button that forces a mob to stay on a warrior, no matter the gear, the whole time. That would throw the whole concept of gear improving your character down the drain.<br />
<br />
So, in your view then, aggro is something a warrior should have to raid for that way you dont' feel like you've spent your time in vain?   You raid for aggro only?   Is that your principal goal when raiding?<br />
<br />
I've seen a few people post that gear is more important for warriors then anyone else, that is not true. For a hybrid to be able to tank effectively in PoP vs a warrior they need damn good gear, a cleric to be able to keep up with a good exp group they need FT and mana, a rogue can't do his job effectively if he is stuck with crap weapons and no attack boost items, rangers are in the same boat as rogues but they need bows to their jobs effectively, wizards aren't going to be much use for a group if they have bad FT and a low mana pool...ect. Everyone is in the same boat as warriors. Sure a hybrid can hold aggression on some random exp mob in PoP just fine, but who in the hell wants to heal some undergeared hybrid who is tanking a little better then a naked ranger? No one does. Same goes for an undergeared warrior, no one wants you to join their group.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a last note, a major problem happening in todays gaming world is people are no longer grouping out of their guilds. So some of you are having troubles finding groups not because of your class, but because people are staying within their little cliques.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will agree with you to some degree on the gear issue, although I'd still say that the warrior is still more reliant on his gear than anyone else.   I dont' think that anyone is arguing that other classes don't acheive improved performance via their gear, but seriously, a warrior without certain levels of gear is incapable of performing his most basic tasks.  Clearly the warrior is the only class in EQ that requires a raid level drop to function in an experience group with any efficiency.   I think that on the other hand, people underestimate other classes' reliance on gear though, and agree with you on this.<br />
<br />
The clique thing is an interesting dynamic, and I think you're probably right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To address some of the other things here in this thread..<br />
<br />
Because mobs die faster, and because if clerics dont' have their heads up their butts, they can heal a knight without any problem. <br />
<br />
First of all, you saying they die faster means nothing, that's great evidence but if I say they die slower, that doesn't mean it's true just because I said it.<br />
<br />
Then, you appear to say that since clerics get these other heals, that they can just as easily heal a hybrid over us so why do you want us around.<br />
<br />
Fact is, a hybrid can stand in and tank in exp groups, and in some select situations (yard trash) in raid situations.   But it is always more efficient to use a warrior because of our hp/ac advantages and of course our disciplines.<br />
<br />
It's like druids, they can heal in an exp group and on raids, but are they more efficient and as good at it as clerics?  No, one is a lot more efficient at it than the other and it's the same way here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot speak for other classes, but I will say that Paladin's are as dependent on gear (with one exception) as warrior's.  A Paladin needs gear for three things - mana, ac, and hitpoints.  All three are vital since we cannot maintain aggro without casting spells, we cannot take the beating once we get aggro without the hitpoints, and we need the ac to take less of a beating.  The one instance where warrior's gear is more important is weapons.  Paladins are primarily concerned with damage abosrption - weapons are nice but not required for this.  Warrior's rely on weapons for aggro so do need a better selection then paladins.<br />
<br />
Paladin aggro is &quot;slightly&quot; out of whack.  I am a firm believer that higher level mobs should ignore lower level aggro stun spells - force player to use their best.  This would have a two-fold affect - the higher level stuns use more mana draining the pool faster and would limit the number of stuns that could be used at any one time.  On the flip side, warrior's do need an improvement in aggro generation ability - but not a huge improvement if logical spell aggro was instituted.  Warrior's should also have a clear hp/ac adavantage.  The problem with both is determining where to set the difference so that none of the three tank classes outclasses the others in overall gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Hi Frod,<br />
<br />
I know your guild is having problems with the RZ script.  And frankly, I'm a little surprised you guys are still stuck at TZ after all your attempts.<br />
<br />
But basing warrior aggro problems on one mob isn't really representative of most encounters in the game.   If warriors in your guild can't hold aggro on TZ, it's not because warrior taunt is broken, but rather your tactics are off.   No amount of taunting, from any class, will overcome low HP aggro when someone fucks up on TZ.<br />
<br />
When you finally get to the high end of PoP (and we're not talking Bastion of Thunder,  Frod), you'll change your tune on the necessity of warriors tanking.</div></div><hr />

Actually, we used 2 warriors midway down the hall with everyone else who could hold a bow firing one at the end of the hall and everyone who could nuke doing that as well. <br />

<br />
I'd agree with that to some extent, although since *many* guilds use Paladins to MT the TZ part of the script due to aggro control (particularly on a mob that has 5 different procs, which do differnt things to your melee output, i.e. slow etc), you can't tell me that it's not significantly easier to do it with someone with &quot;lock down&quot; aggro control that doesn't rely on melee.    It's like... remember green flurries?  Sure warriors can successfully tank them, but they suck balls at it, becuase they get slowed.   Any mob that procs a slow is considerably easier to tank using someone who can survive who doesn't rely on melee.</div></div><hr />

It obviously takes some discipline on the other rest of the raid but consider what passes for aggro management these days (which is nothing), that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Second there are ways to deal with the AE itself to limits its effects.<br />
<br />
Consider the recent HP hike on half of the elemental planes, even with our alleged 'inferior' aggro I've seen plenty of casters go OOM from nuking without ever getting aggroed so I don't see why you think aggro matters so much if all your nukers can nuke until OOM anyway.  Warriors are perhaps ill-equipped to initial high aggro (tash/slow/the first heal/etc) but that has always been the case and people managed fine with the assumption that the first slower/tash/heal etc are supposed to die.  <br />
<br />
The fact that you can have someone slowed 50% and aggro debuffed 60% and still hold aggro should tell you that some classes have too much aggro, not the classes that can't hold aggro under these conditions do not have enough.  Usually, it make sense to fix what's wrong, not break what's working correctly so you can feel better about your class.</div></div><hr />

The problem is the initial argo gain, and untill PoP it was relatively meaningless in xp groups where most of the warriors in eq (and the area where it has the most impact) have to deal with this shit daily. Not to say it was never a problem, but things are magnified 10 fold in tier2-3 pop.<br />
<br />
Lost argo on engagement for the luclin era xp group meant the caster took a few whacks for 100-250 and people just joked when the taunt check was made and things returned to hunky dorey. Lost argo on engagement for the PoP xp group means said caster routinely takes double 5-700+'s and people go wtf taunt you useless bastard as the average warrior hits his taunt key, kick key and prays for an argo proc fast. If not then they have to blow aet(if they have it) and shield(if they're within the stupid 5foot range and not in a /disc already), and sorry but that is not how the game should function in an xp setting at all.<br />
<br />
I consider myself lucky to have a pretty much permanent xp group, where my 4-5 others know how to deal with any taunt problems. Sometimes there's a death, sometimes it's close, but you know what? If I had decided 3+ years ago to pick sk or pal instead of warrior that would almost never happen. This is what the joe average warrior puts up with, gets pissed off over and sometimes ultimately quits over. Would you be happy knowing that many times you are a detriment to any group instead of a boon? I think not.</div></div><hr />

Of course, it is easier for a group to blame the warrior than deciding they did something wrong since the group outnumbers the warrior, but that doens't mean the group is right.<br />
<br />
The only person who should get aggroed is the slower, and there are ways to deal with that even with fairly modest equipment.  Shamans can mostly take care of themselves so it's mostly enchanters that's having the problems.  Why don't a group yell at the enchanter that did not cast boggle after a Tash so that he can land his slow safely?  After all the Enchanter is usually the one with extra mana, and his mana isn't used very much during safe situations.  No instead people cry about that Supernal Remedy you had to use on the enchanter, and the Arcane Rune the enchanter had to cast again, when the Enchanter could've taken care of himself with just boggle for much less mana overall.  But since warriors are plentiful and enchanters are few, you don't want to yell at your enchanters sucking since you can't replace him, so you say it's the warrior's fault and even if the enchanter didn't die, people allegedly cared about the extra mana wasted on Arcane Rune &amp; Supernal Remedy.<br />
<br />
I guess it's easy to say just get better groups from the top but I know it's not that easy, but I do not feel breaking the game to make up for bad groups is the way to go.  There should be a reward to playing well.  Currently a warrior will suck in a bad group, and I think that's fair.  The problem is that a Knight can function fine with a bad group.  That, I think, is wrong.  A bad group should still suck no matter who's doing the tanking.</div></div><hr />

I think this part here sums up why knights need to be nerfed.  Improving warriors would only create more powerful tanks, and the game doesn't need that.  It needs to be balanced from the top down, and if warriors have issues, it should be addressed with the other classes in relation to warriors.<br />

And you say you don't have aggro problems?  If the mob doesn't require defensive, use a knight, and go full burn shortly after mob is in camp.<br />
<br />
As for exp groups, people are saying if your group is smart, there's no problems.  Well no shit.  The problem is, they can use us, watch themselves, hold back so mobs live longer, and try hard to let him keep taunt.  Or they can take a knight, do full dps immediately, and gain exp faster.  And though the warrior may have more hps and higher ac, often he requires more heals than the knight because mobs last longer.  People are going to choose knights for easier exp.  Does it mean we can't be used?  No, it just means we're at the bottom of the list.  Should we get an aggro boost or should knights get nerfed to bring us into balance, thats for sony to decide.<br />

This expansion was not made for the casual player. If you, as an casual player, think you can skip all the gearing steps of the early expansions and jump right into PoP you have another thing coming. This isn't a problem with our class, it's a problem with people not understanding that this game has certain points that need to be reached before moving on. If you pass those points then you will pay the price, which is you will not have the proper gear.<br />
<br />
This expansion was made for the HIGH LEVEL player. today, I can go to PoN, PoD, PoJ, PoI, PoV, PoS, PoNb, BoT, Tactics (and soon CoD and HoH). I got flagged helped by friends and my guild. Which is a guild full of casual players. I am level 63.<br />
So you say every warrior who Ding 61+ need, in order to use his ability in xp groups in PoV like knights of the same guild, who have fought the same mobs, those warriors need to guildremove so they can get EB gear + Ornate/Elemental level armor ? I don't think so. every class should be able to do his job at his level. level 65 Clerics (another specialised class) can do their job fine at every state of the game, not just High End. Just like paladins, Shadowknights, Wizards, mages, necros, enchanters, shamans, druids... <br />
Because we rely on high level gear raid gear to do something any other tank class do with only spells : What the other people expect from a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The raid/group is just being delusional.  It's easy to empty your mana bar even if you start unloading at 60%.  With the elevated HP on most of the elemental mobs there is no problem for even uber casters to go OOM.  As long as your nuker's mana runs out before the mob dies, it doesn't matter if it happened when the mob is 99% or 1%.  He still did as much damage as he could have.  Damage now or damage later is the exact thing as long as the caster didn't die, and the mob didn't die before you run out of mana.<br />
<br />
The same applies to xp groups, perhaps even more so.  First, most 'casual' groups aren't uber enough to not lose mana while nuking.  You can trivially nuke a mob that's about to flee/die and that nuke is still every bit as effective as when the mob is 100% (assuming that your nuke doesn't overkill the mob significantly).  For the sake of argument, we'll say that a casual wizard generates 100 mana per tick.  Now that's obviously a ridiculously high amount of mana but that allows me to ignore stuff like specialization and whatnot (clearly this mana regen overestimates his mana a lot more than underestimate by ignoring other factors).  Strike of Solusek uses 640 mana (since this guy is casual, we assume no mana preservation, though even if he does, the 100 mana/tick more than covers that).  That means the wizard can cast a SoS every 36 seconds and not lose mana.  Now if you assume the average Valor mob has 20K HP and dies in one minute.  The wizard can get 2 SoSes in and not lose mana (roughly).  While some people believe that the only way to do DPS is cast it at 100% and 90% and then maybe another one at 80% (or casting it as fast as possible), it's just as good to cast it during say 50%, and then at 15%.  This might still be too much aggro but certainly a lot easier to work with than 100% &amp; 90%, and the last nuke is very safe on mobs that flee (15% of 20K = 3K so no overkill unless crit).<br />
<br />
Now let's assume our casual wizard isn't content to cast 2 nukes per battle because it doesn't feel like he's doing as much damage as he should.  So instead he's got a Paladin to tank and he's going to cast 3 nukes per minute.  3 SoS cost 1920 mana and our wizard generates 1000 mana per minute.  Let's assume our casual wizard has 5000 mana (yeah right), he will be out of mana in roughly 6 minutes into the XP group.  Even if we assume the puller is slacking and the pulls take 30 seconds to arrive (so he meds that time, at the same rate since he's got a horse), it will take 18 minutes before the wizard is OOM.  So, if your XP group lasts considerably longer than 18 minutes, this wizard doing all-out DPS would basically do the same damage no matter who's tanking (it is assumed that the wizard can lose mana at a steady rate with warrior tanking, though not as fast as a Knight).  <br />
<br />
The only thing aggro buys you extra DPS is probably dots, but in good groups, even the doters nuke instead of dot because mobs die too fast for dots to be effective.</div></div><hr />

The problem isn't that the tanks in question don't have enough HP/AC to handle the mobs.  It's that mobs pong around with a Warrior and not with a Knight.  Why exactly should it be possible for a Knight with less HP/AC to do a better job in PoP with no raid gear while the Warrior is required to go out and aquire raid gear?  Why are the gear requirements supposed to be greater for the Warrior to be marginally effective than for the Knight to be fully effective?<br />
<br />
No one is saying that Warriors don't have the AC/HP to succeed, they're saying they don't have the aggro control to succeed.  If the answer to this is to tell every Warrior in the game who wants to tank in PoP to go out and aquire a boss mob caliber EB or similar weapon to marginally do their job, while the Knights need not meet the same requirement, what sense does this make?  No where in the handbook did it say that without joining a raiding guild the Warrior would be crippled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the mob doesn't &quot;pong&quot; with me, I can hold aggro pretty well... but 1 mob on 2, or 1 mob in 6 in the best groups in PoV/BoT the mobs is starting to hit the slower or the healer (if he CHed the low-life puller for exemple). I can get aggro back pretty fast... but knights are faster than me. For a successful taunt the mob need to not moving : I can't risk to wait 6 more secs just because the mob moved when I press the button, or there is some lag so I miss.... knights don't even bother with gaining aggro BACK. they never loss it.<br />
<br />
However I don't think they need a nerf. there are cases where even them cannot hold aggro (low life, nuker early sit...). i think the problem come from warriors, we lack variety, and we lack the perfect tanking ability we deserve to have as specialists.</div></div><hr />

Guilds built of primarly level 60+ people should be able to kill over 5ish mobs that all drop items that have a lure aggression proc to them (EB and so on). Hell, I could farm CorkScrews if I wanted because the gnome respawns 2-3 hours after he dies no matter if the dragon has died or not. This means that if a low tier guild was actually serious about putting aggression items in the hand of their warriors they could, with ease.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you say every warrior who Ding 61+ need, in order to use his ability in xp groups in PoV like knights of the same guild, who have fought the same mobs, those warriors need to guildremove so they can get EB gear + Ornate/Elemental level armor ? I don't think so. <br />
EB and ornate gear are NOT high end items. There is only ONE item that has an EB proc that is considered a high end item at this moment and that is the BoW. The only reason I would accept for a level 60+ guild not killing the low end EB dropping mobs (Cursed, AoW, XTC) is because they just aren't up. If these mobs are up and your guild passes them then it's a guild problem, and you should modivate them to farm the mobs that you need.<br />
<br />
For the record I have tanked TZ for every kill of RZ we have ever had, and I only have problems if I get fluxed to some wacky place (happened one time). Can a hybrid tank TZ better then me? I don't really see what a hybrid would do for us besides put a tank with lower defensive skills, ac and hps to tank a mob we don't have troubles with by using a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the problems with this topic is that those who oppose the idea of upgrading warriors will break it down into two main componenets. Taunting and Tanking. Knights will fight you on this every time. They want to be the best at one of those things, and look at them as both seperate skills. To most warriors though, they are one in the same. And if you think about it, they really are one in the same. In order to tank, you must be able to taunt. If you taunt, you should be able to tank. There shouldnt be any division of those skills, and honestly, Warriors should be the best at it. Its what we do. Its ALL we do. Why shouldnt we be the best there is at it? No, it shouldnt be trivial to hold aggro, but it shouldnt be a totally frustrating experience for your group or raid either.<br />
<br />
SoE will boil all of this down on the groups ability to control their aggro. But honestly, nobody wants to mess with all of that crap when doing exp groups. It was mentioned earlier, nobody goes out to grind exp for a challenge. Its a job, its at the bare minimum of fun as it stands. You do it because you need to get that next level, or that next AA. Hell, when my guild wasnt raiding, half the people would log off because theres no use in doing exp for most of them. With 100+ AAs and capped at 65...why go exp? No need to do such a thing. So, with going for exp being the bottom of the barrel fun, groups will do their best to streamline it and increase what little fun there is. Killing faster is really the only option, and the main reason behind grinding exp. The faster you kill, the more exp you gain in your play time. Therefore it would be beneficial for the group to have someone tanking that has a snap aggro ability. This way nobody has to stop and wait to debuff or nuke or backstab, etc. But convincing SoE of this is probably the hard part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly does being able to tank boss mob TZ, RZ, or ABC have to do with the problem?  If given enough alone time on a mob a Warrior will always be able to generate enough hate eventually to fairly reliably hold aggro.  And if you have a bank of 3 to 6 clerics standing behind you doing nothing but keeping you standing, then you're golden.<br />
<br />
However, most people most of the time will not have a bank of 3 to 6 clerics standing behind them.  They'll need to aquire and hold aggro much sooner than on a raid mob.  Slow needs to land ASAP.  The average Warrior will not have enough more durability over the average Paladin to make it worthwhile to let the Warrior solo tank the mob rather than having the Paladin snap aggro it right away and allow slow to land immediately.<br />
<br />
Maybe this isn't so obvious when you're walking around with 10K HP and some change.  It's much more obvious to those of us in the mid tier level of gear who are competing with Paladins who aren't any better geared than we are, but who can do the job better due to their spell casting.  They should be using their spells in order to MATCH our ability to tank, not to put us to shame and leave us standing around toeing the ground with our boot LFG.<br />
<br />
You can say, well PoP is a high end expansion all you want, but that doesn't answer the question as to why a Warrior should be expected to have a HIGHER level of gear than a Knight to do the exact SAME job and to still do it WORSE?</div></div><hr />

No matter how you slice, or dice it, Paladins, Shadowknights and Warriors compete for the *same* spot in groups. <br />

RZ Script: Tallon<br />

We've used a warrior to tank TZ Every single time, works fine, we've beat Script 5 times, (Failed TZ 1-2 times since first RZTWL win, which had nothing to do with aggro)<br />

Green Flurries... Hmm.. I dunno when I did NToV Flurries were abitch and owned me hard, Had to use a Warrior and just not over aggro<br />

It was incidentally the day I first got my RGB, in Sebilis, Derrin was there actually along with Vladius, his cleric.   <br />
<br />
It was the day way back when, when the &quot;heal aggro&quot; patch went live in early velious, clerics were getting eaten left and right, warriors were complaining left and right.    <br />
<br />
Every mob we pulled, we rooted, and aggro was pretty easily established.   It wasnt' too tough then, nor is it now.  <br />
<br />
I've always been relatively uncomfortable with root as aggro control though for a couple of reasons.   <br />
<br />
1. It doesn't address the inherent balance issue, where a mob must be rooted for one person and not for another.   While it's not a big deal to root mobs, it's essentially like making warriors wear the 'special helmet'.   <br />
<br />
2. Warriors still are not in any control, nor are they aware of the status of their roots, when they land (granted, a message makes it easy to tell), nor more importantly, when it breaks.   Being completely out of control is annoying to me, it's sort of a &quot;bandaid&quot; to bypass the regular rules of combat.<br />
<br />
3. I have some weapons that I like to use... one of them being Norge`Tal.  This is a nice weapon.  This, and many with similar procs which include a knockback effect are counterproductive when using root as an aggro tool.   On a proc, it doesn't stun planar mobs (which is gay that a raid level weapon with a stun can't stun mobs you're fighting, but that's another topic), but it often breaks root.  This isn't THAT bad because the proc will generally ensure that I have aggro on a broken root, but what IS bad is that if I'm grouped with any other melee and it doesn't break root, those melee get beaten upon until we all re-position ourselves.   Rogues especially hate this.   Now, were it a single weapon, I'd understand, but many of the best non-EB aggro weapons (Galadurblahblah, Short Blade of Lightning, Norge`Tal, SoD, and any other stunning type weapon) messes with rooting as aggro control.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing to me is that I dont' like being handed 'the special helmet' as a warrior using what is in essence an exploit (root to bypass the mob's hatelist) just to perform my function, particularly when I dont' have the ability to do it myself.</div></div><hr />

BoW is an exception. It is the end game item for warriors, but yet it was placed on the god of war (who just so happens to be the gateway mob to the elementals).

Maybe not the strict definition of HIGH END.<br />
<br />
However, they are NOT 1 groupable encounters.<br />

And they are NOT bought off of VENDORS in Shadowhaven.<br />

Which means they are not really a BALANCED method for the average warrior to be able to do his or her job when compared to hybrid classes.<br />

Wow, you killed them with 40, good for you.  Thats over double what my guild can get for a raid.  We don't have the man power for them.  It's not a simple &quot;get off your ass and get it&quot; type thing.  If you want to argue that EB is easy to get for the majority of players, you should be laughed at.  Maybe the majority of players who are in raiding guilds, but not every one is.  Frankly, for us to require loot from raid level mobs, and still not be able to do as good as a pally using a fucking level 9 spell, thats broken.  I don't give a shit if you do have EB, the pally still beats your ass all over the place with aggro.  Just because it's not high end, and you could do it with 40 before pop, doesn't mean jack or shit for the average warrior.  It's still above them , and what they can get.

That is true.  The talk about EB weapons basically comes from the fact that a higher level warrior was acting like EB grew on trees and everyone lvl 61+ should have them, if not then their guild is doing thing wrong.  I was just responding to that.<br />
<br />
As for when you were average.  Back then, if a mob didn't get slowed fast, it wasn't a big issue.  Now with PoP, an unslowed mob beats down the tank fast.  Thus slows have to happen a lot sooner, which is where warriors aggro is the worst.  So the current average warrior has to have higher aggro weapons to keep the mob from causing the slower to either die, or take a lot of clerical mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, I have yet to find an xp mob in fire that isn't rootable.  Haven't spent much time in earth, but with the number of snared mobs our pullers come back with, it seems like most there are rootable too.  That 70% number you came up with is waaaaaaay off.<br />
<br />
Using root to control aggro is a tactic, not an exploit.  That's like saying root and dot/nuke is an exploit since the mob can't get to the caster.<br />
<br />
Is it a workaround?  Sure if you want to think of it that way.  If a workaround keeps a mob off the healer/slower in that first 20 seconds of the fight, I am all for it.  It's not a longterm solution, but those first 20 seconds or so of a fight are the most critical.<br />
<br />
As for the main point of this thread, I think the problem is overstated.  With proper execution, aggro can be maintained on boss mobs.  Sure the occasional wizard gets smoked, but you won't see any tears from me when that happens.  The warrior v. knight problem is more apparent in xp groups.  Improve warrior taunt or defensive skills (yeah right) to make us more desirable, but there is no need to whip out the nerf stick.</div></div><hr />

If you don't raid you will see... maybe 4 zones (zones with mobs) in the whole PoP expansion? If you wish to do well in areas in PoP then you have to raid to get the gear the expansion was based on. Is that fair? No one ever said EQ was a game of fairness.<br />
<br />
The only way you would ever be able to beat a paladin or SK for aggression is if they lowered the agression for about every type of spell to almost nothing. There is nothing they can do to make the warrior top a SK or paladin as the game is now, short of giving us spells. Even if taunt worked 100 percent of the time the paladin or SK would STILL beat you for aggression every time if he wanted to. <br />
<br />
How can you say that you are the &quot;average&quot; when you are in the guild that can't get over 20 people on for a raid? Are you trying to say that the &quot;Average&quot; PoP warrior is in a guild that can't put together a force of at least 30 people with his guild?</div></div><hr />

PoP isn't designed around raiding, even though there are a lot of possible raids.  In fact, exping is a huge part of PoP.  Once 61+ exp turns to shit everywhere else, so you HAVE to exp in PoP.  Even before zones are opened up, you could get to 9 exp zones without a raid (4 first tier, then PoS, PoV, HoH, Tactics, CoD through alt quests), and you could get into BoT with a minor raid (or group depending on gear or if you have a charmer).</div></div><hr />

I never said that EB weapons &quot;grow on trees&quot;. I also never said that any warrior level 61+ should have one.

I am sure that some people have been in the high end so long they clearly have no idea what high end really is anymore, nor what &quot;average&quot; is either.  I think it would be pretty safe to say that the average &quot;non uber&quot; warrior is not in the planes hoping to get into PoT, but is working through velious encounters.  They might be around 60 prob have decent ac and weapons, but prob not any EB weapons, probably have thurg level quest armor, maybe some SS armor.  That is my guess for average anyhow.  <br />
<br />
Part of the problem is Sony made PoP an XP play land.  We can now gain levels faster than ever before.  We can accumulate aa's faster than we thought we could ever.  It turned the old world into a raid/loot only zones.  When is the last time you saw a group of mid 50's grouping in Sebelis for xp?  They also created PoP and like it or not are opening it up even more to the average joe.  yet they have not equiped average warrior who is no-where near the high end game (ie not high end luclin era, and might just be working on high end velious) with the tools they need to do their job.  When is the last time you saw a cleric being thrown out of a xp group because they didn;t have an epic or FT item.  From the sounds of the boards and my own experiance we lose out on groups all the time because we can;t hold aggro even if we had BoC etc.<br />
<br />
Here is the problem though.<br />
<br />
I would consider myself fairly average, and at 61 i can tank in tier 1 or 2 planes and the xp is great when i can get a group.  However in these zones i go for XP i cannot hold aggro better than a knight or SK.  I have been reduced to damage dealer in PoP tier 1 included, because a knight or SK will have similar Hp's and will hold aggro.  It does not matter what weapons you have, because you will still be praying for a Proc to hold aggro, while the knight just presses the hotkey for stun.  The main problem is sure a warrior can hold aggro if a group works for it, but with a knight or Sk they don;t even have to worry about it.  I pray for proc they cast a spell sounds balanced eh?</div></div><hr />

BULLSHIT.  <br />
<br />
-PoP introduced levels 61-65.  <br />
-To get from 60-65 you have to EXP.  <br />
-The only place you can EXP at those levels is in PoP.  <br />
<br />

You can BS all you want but the fact remains due to PoP Warriors and Knights are more out of balance than they ever were.</div></div><hr />

The definition of high end: it's not set in stone and not the same for everyone.<br />
<br />
Definition of average is also in question so it seems.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can tell you that people that farm VT are not average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karthunk</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never said that the AVERAGE player should be killing AoW. The word AVERAGE is subjective and would imply that someone has the actually statistics on the total number of warriors, level spread, gear, ect... I DON'T have any of those numbers so I'm not going to be saying what the &quot;average&quot; warrior should and should not be doing. If you are LEVEL 65, in a guild that has more people then the number of Dixy Chick fans, and you are lacking some sort of EB based weapon then your guild NEEDS to focus on fixing this.<br />
<br />
Sitting around like a bunch of old grumpy men swining your canes isn't going to fix anything. To fix the problem you need to look first at the possible solutions that are open to you NOW. If you are not level 65 then this should be a TOP thing to work on. If you are having trouble finding groups then make some friends, and group with the people in your guild. In fact take the effort and put together your own groups. It doesn't matter if you hold aggression like a pam coated pan trying to cling to a blueberry muffin. If they are your friends they will work with you and they will keep grouping with you. Not EVERYONE looks at what is the best possible choice for spot A, and if we have class B we can do X because C can hold off the extras. I swear my guild has at least 6 people (all classes needed for one group) sitting around doing nothing, because they are just not motivated to form up their own group.<br />
<br />
You can call &quot;bullshit&quot; on PoP being a raiding expansion all you want to. It isn't going to change the fact that if you don't raid you will not see over 1/2 of the full expansion. Please tell me another expansion that has been that selective on people entering areas? Can't name one can you?<br />
<br />
The definition of high end: it's not set in stone and not the same for everyone. <br />
I agree with you here that this is true, but for the overall game itself there is a standard to what is the &quot;endgame&quot;. I listed out what the startard is. If you want to get into the views of what some of the guilds playing catchup with the higher tier guilds feel is &quot;highend&quot;, well once again that is very subjective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - Karthunk, youre the Iraqi Information Minister of warriors - youre so far out of touch with reality its comical.  and by comical, i mean that literally - I am greatly amused.<br />
<br />
yes, in fact, AoW is still a meaningful target.  in fact, im gonna go ahead and use this as a benchmark for future discussions of this sort.  if a person makes a ridiculous claim such as &quot;AoW is a trivial target&quot;... well that person can be discounted as a bufoon.<br />
<br />
now, back to actual ration discussion.<br />
<br />
2.  the role of knights.<br />
<br />
this one amuses me too.  this idea has sprung up that knights exist to be agro machines.  as if the purpose of dots , lifetaps, and stuns was to get agro.<br />
<br />
newsflash.  wanna know why paladins have stun spells?  (this is gonna be revolutionary and crazy so hold onto your seats...)  to STUN mobs.  you know, stop them attacking for a few seconds and stuff?  crazy concept.<br />
<br />
newsflash number 2.  wanna know why shadowknights get lifetaps and dots? (grab that armrest again...) to damage mobs.  you know, reduce mob hp through non melee means and stuff?<br />
<br />
the fact that these spells turned out to be insanely high agro was a bug - an accident - a coincidence of a complex system.<br />
<br />
in other words - knights are NOT supposed to be agro kings.  paladins are warriors who can heal and REZ, not warriors who can taunt like god himself.  shadowknights are warriors who can lifetap and FD, not warriors who can taunt like god himslf.<br />
<br />
...at the end of the day, warriors by design should be the best at BOTH taunt and damage absorption.</div></div><hr />

outside of running up and hitting defensive, we're just Knights without spells.<br />

Ask a knight to tank for a group, and never cast any spells at all.  No buffs, no +aggro stuff vs the mob, no heals, no LoH, no HT, nothing.  How long do you think it'd be before the group booted him/her for being a warrior?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the be-all end-all answer for warriors to grabbing/holding aggro on high end/boss mobs:<br />
<br />
Clicky snare items.<br />
<br />
That's it.  3-5 charges of snare/darkness does the trick.  Kind of silly/stupid that it takes that type of crutch, but It's Working As Intended.  So go farm those greenies for expendable clicky snare items, cause SoE appears to be totally clueless, uninterested, and/or incapable of fixing the aggro vs. tanking mismatch.<br />

I consider it a painful, time-wasting, and annoying but effective  counterpart to what casters have to go thru buying/carrying pdots and such.<br />

On a related note, until the elemental planes, pop itemization for melee classes, warriors in particular, SUCKS.  To &quot;balance&quot; things melee vs. caster/hybrid, they should have had runes only drop in tier4/elemental, instead of on one-groupable mobs in tier1-3...<br />

<br />
In the course of just one 2-3 hour exp session this would require quite a few of these items wouldn't it? I believe that is why they are generally reserved for raids where not getting initial aggro can mean the loss of 60 people instead of 6.</div></div><hr />

Knights and warriors do get too close in tanking abilities but thats after 100+AA and with a nice load of 100+hp items. Average knight or warrior does not poses many if any of those.<br />
<br />
To the later posters: so let me get what you guy saying that average warrior has roughly same hp as knight and dont tank much better? Are you kidding?<br />
<br />
Lets say average 60-65 war has 3-4k hp unbuffed. Average Knight then has 2.5-3.5k hp unbuffed. That may not seem like a big difference but if you do the math its roughly about 25 percent. Also you are tanking better then knights do and have access to discs for when the times are rough. At 65 defensive recycles ever 10 min? Evasive even faster. And you still saying you dont tank better? Dunno if average player now has AE taunt but that is also available for the times then taunt not working 2 times in a row or something. Maybe you should learn more about strengths of our class.<br />
<br />
Knight do have an edge with agro but that never has bothered me and guess what?! There are knights out there just as you go hours lfg! PoP does not require perfect group makeup to xp in either. You want better gear? It is available to EVERYONE! All you have to do is to get off your ass stop xping make a raid go kill the mob you want gear upgrade from. Guess what people from big guilds do that! They sacrafice xp for raids! Yes its not ez, but it is rewarding and perfectly in line. We all play by same rule set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well actually the hp/ac cap in pop is designed automaticly : If you dont have enought ac/hp, you die.<br />
<br />
Most tanks in PoV/BoT got 3500 minimum (althought 4000 is more correct if you leave the camps near the graveyard). I defy you to tank in BoT with 2500 :p. That's rangers.<br />
<br />
one of you talked about itemisation. it's true. In pop, there is special classes for item, they are :<br />
- WAR PAL SHD BRD CLE = plates<br />
- DRU BST MNK = Leather (of course druids are wearing the same thing as monks...)<br />
- NEC WIZ MAG ENC = Int casters<br />
- SHM ROG RNG = Mail people<br />
- CLE DRU SHM = Wiz casters<br />
<br />
THIS is 95% of PoP itemisation. it's flawed, even for casters were sometime INT is not the most important stat (necros for exemple). with monk, who don't need to compete with druids to claim an item, and in our case with tanks, because there is no more (or very rare) war only item. Today every piece of armor/weapon got int/wis and hp/mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Roughly the same HP is a bit off. but, keep in mind, on raids, this difference becomes much less noticeable, and in XP groups, hybrids have buffs to counter. Tanking-wize, the reason they tank better is becuase their taunting ability far outmatches whatever HP and avoidance skill differences we have.<br />
<br />

<br />
1) Paladins have LoH/healing for when times are rough. SK's have snare/FD/fear. <br />
2) We are NOT tanking better than knights.<br />
3) Next person that brings up /disc defensive or /disc evasive in regards to XP groups gets shot. Both discs (evasive is actually ok in my book, defensive must die) is a crutch band-aid for not giving warriors separate tables. You have far worse agro-sustaining ability with either disc on. Furthermore, warriors don't generally use either disc regularly in XP groups, but only as SOS scenario, for which hybrids have an answer to as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knight do have an edge with agro but that never has bothered me and guess what?! There are knights out there just as you go hours lfg! PoP does not require perfect group makeup to xp in either.

<br />
Congradulations. Knight agro never bothers you, want a cookie? No, good, now sit back down. If you choose to avoid discussing this issue, fine, but it remains one nonetheless. PoP doesn't require &quot;perfect&quot; gorup makeup, but it does require a slower, and a healer, both of which are positions that draw massive amounts of agro. Combine this with high -hitting mobs, and tanks with good agro generations becomes a near necessity, rather than a simple preference for the ideal group. As for the whole gear issue; read all of the comparisons between getting gear for taunt vs. buying a lvl 9 spell.</div></div><hr />

Oh, so if a guild considers AoW as &quot;trivial&quot; then they are &quot;bufoons&quot; now? I find it highly ridiculous that you actually think AoW is a &quot;meaningful&quot; target for everyone. Newsflash! He can be killed by less then 20 people by elemental tiered guilds. I find that to be the making of a &quot;trivial&quot; mob. As far as his loot, no he would would not be a &quot;meaningful&quot; target for my guild, he would be a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Bert is a much harder mob then AoW for various reason. Bert's DPS is also much higher then AoWs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TorvalTM</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in pop, boss fights are very short and very high dps. our knights absolutely do not tank anything except maybe some yard trash on huge pulls. pop boss fights usually do not last longer than defensive or evasive. on the occassions all our wars died, our pal / sk's couldn't do it. i tanked druav once when every other tank was down for 40 seconds then i died. i was getting spam heals, it was very fun, but not practical.<br />
<br />
i play a 65 shaman and a 65 paladin. when i group with warriors i stand right beside them, malos on inc, as soon as the spell gem refreshes i cast turgur's. in pickup groups i almost never have aggro problems. i may get hit once or twice, but it's right back on the war after.<br />
<br />
yes warrior taunt is not as good as paladin taunt, but it is definetly good enough to do the job. educate your group to stand near when casting debuffs, slows etc, don't run away or cast slow from 30 feet away, and don't overnuke. i think most warriors out there know this, just not most other classes they group with.<br />
<br />
paladin taunt is just short of ridiculous, i admit. i can and often do not attack a whole fight and just cast force of akilae and cease and have np.  there is a downside though. i wish every day for a way to decrease aggro. especially from group heals. the amount of dmg pop ae's do at the rate they do them, if i try to heal it all i go splat.<br />
<br />
warriors / knights both have good and bad points.<br />
<br />
warr: doesn't taunt as well, higher dps , tanks exp mobs slightly better, tanks raid mobs much better (has def / evasive). pretty much required in pop boss fights.<br />
<br />
knight: taunts much better, lower dps, tanks exp mob pretty well (slightly below a warrior), could tank some (a few) pop raid mobs if spamhealed constantly, not really an option on pop bosses except as a last resort.<br />
<br />
i hope this sounds accurate to most people.<br />
<br />
that being said, a war can tank fine in an exp group, even ones with terrible weapons have done well in my groups, it just requires paying more attention to your aggro. most people are just lazy and want the aggromagnet. pop boss mobs are another matter, this is where warriors shine, and hybrids have to pray for a cheal every round to survive. each has their role.<br />
<br />
finally, i'd like to say if warriors ever got knight like aggro it would trivialize a lot of bosses and dumb down a lot of content. the combo of warriors /disc , superior hp, and better defensive skills (riposte, parry etc) plus knight taunt would be too powerfull, which is why a paladin will never get a usefull discipline. warrior taunt might need some modification, but it's a very fine edge they're walking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it sucks to have your group invite a pally to fill a dps slot for &quot;ahem, dps&quot;, when they are really saying they want a tank who locks aggro in fast.  I have said this many times tho, a lot of my Pally friends admit watching me MT the Badasses makes them envious.  <br />
<br />
I got invited to a BoT exp group to MT a named even tho they had a pally or SK, and more then one occasion.  I am sure it sucked for the Pally to be doing a good job MTing all night and then for the group to have to get a Warrior to take out a named.</div></div><hr />

Terror line does nothing but add hate, and Voice line does nothing but increase the Hate multiplyer.<br />
<br />
Actually, I agree with what someone else said.  It isn't that taunt is broken, it's that it hasn't scaled to match the agro abilities of the hybrid tanks.<br />
<br />
I believe stun agro was added to prevent clerics from chain stunning, so they increased that agro.  Paladins have stuns too...easy to see where problems here are.  I still stand by my idea that they should change it where stuns that mobs are immune to don't generate the same agro. (Doesn't count on resisted stuns, since you don't know if it's immune or not)<br />
<br />
1.  Tricky question...there's a point to having snare and stun actually have agro associated with it.  For the longest time, &quot;snap agro&quot; was a huge boon to classes like the SK.  Not a lot of benefit having SKs on a raid until recently, except that if the raid mob got away from the warrior and headed towards the cleric/chanter...the SK could reel it back in and give it back to the warrior.  Many a SK saved the lives of those other classes.  The problem is, when that sort of agro control is sustainable over long periods of time, and the defensive skills of those classes rival the warrior, who is NOT getting innate upgrades like the SK/Pal, then it becomes bad.  No, procs to hold agro are not balanced against controllable spells, no matter how you shake it, unless that weapon procs a 30 hate proc and goes off 3600 times in one hour (translation: every second), then you could possibly consider it balanced.  Won't happen tho.<br />
<br />
2.  No.  Perhaps warriors with clickies that have stun/snare charges...but that's it.<br />
<br />
3.  Well, I believe that warriors should be able to do their job no matter their level, so I would say it shouldn't be gear.  However, I don't know how to &quot;fix&quot; taunt to make it scale correctly in relation to Hybrid tank agro abilities (no matter if those were intended or not).  I've got plenty of ideas, but I just don't know, really.  If it could be solved with gear, then it needs to be available at lower levels, not AoW level people. (And no, until over 50% of all people who play EQ can easily kill a mob, without people ganking it from them because they want it more or whatever the excuse is, I don't consider it trivial by a long shot.)</div></div><hr />

also slow is a spell that cast once at the begingin of the figt 2-3 taunts no matter what weapon you are using will get you that agro back. CH is not a high agro spell as long as you healer is not a dumb ass does not have you at less then 80% hp on inc he shouldnt get agro.<br />
<br />
Agro controll for warrior is fine the way it is. if anything should be done is it should be tuned down for knights(maybe 80% spell hate reduction). Warriors having the same agro mangment of knight would take away any skill requiered to play warrior well.</div></div><hr />

If stun or any ability that's producing more aggro than it should (and Paladin stuns obviously does) be needs to be fixed, it can be done by doing the Etheral Stun line spell, adding an aggro decrease mod.  Of course, it's not like SoE doesn't know this.  My guess is that it's just not an important enough issue for them to bother nerfing the Knights, and they're probably right.  It's about as important to the game balance as Necros soloing for an AA in 25 minutes or whatever in PoFire while a group dependent classes sits LFG and can't do better than about 50-60 minutes per AA (assuming no Charm is used).  Sure it sucks if you're not the person who's overpowered, but it's not like you can't play the game without this advantage, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot recall the last time that a pick up group had an empty spot and was looking for a tank - and turned down a warrior because they wanted to have an SK/Paladin instead.  That doesn't mean that there isn't an imbalance, I will readily admit that things are much much easier with a paladin/sk tanking, but if you aren't getting groups, class imbalance isn't the reason.<br />
<br />
That said, about controlling aggro with warriors.  All the warriors in my guild have either dual SoD's + primal or SoD + BoC and primal - and unless I decide to be lazy, or the puller slacks off, I can nuke constantly and stay well below FM while still not pulling aggro.<br />
<br />
The difference is, that with a paladin/sk I can start nuking at 100% and still not draw aggro, with a less than uber warrior I'll start nuking at 85% and just pace myself more - instead of chain nuking a few mobs then medding on the next ones, I'll just alternate nuke/click nuke and keep spending mana.<br />
<br />
Heck - we had a fantastic group in BoT with Monk, Druid, Shaman, Cleric, Mage, Wizard, and unless I decided to slack our monk tanked everything fine, of course aggro control was slightly harder, but nothing that you couldn't work around.<br />
<br />
That said - two of my best friends in EQ are warriors in the top guild on server, and the difference between them and an SK is virtually nill in the snap aggro department.<br />
<br />
I do think SK's and Paladin's gain aggro too easily, but I do believe that warrior aggro is fine where is, and people who blame class imbalances on spending time LFG are a bit deluded ;p<br />
<br />
Since PoP, I have never had an empty slot in my group and I invited a random LFG person nobody in the group knew to join us.  I'll just do /who all friends and ask in guildchat and to all my friends if they'd like to join us - if nobody is free, and what we are missing is a key class I'd much MUCH rather two box with EQW whatever class we need, than invite someone random in a group.  If your beef is with the difference between snap aggro of a warrior/knight - then you have my sympathies, if your problem is getting a group, no matter what tank class you play that's not going to change things.<br />
<br />
Finally, there are several mobs that are plenty of fun and good exp to do with 6 man groups, like BoT tower bosses, BoT wing bosses, that drop very good loot and are easy and fun to do with a 6 man group, and while a single cleric + a druid can keep a warrior up long enough to kill Chaoswind or Icestorm with a single group, trying to kill even the lower wing bosses with a 4.2 khp (unfuffed) knight is very difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and by definition, XP groups are not a burst DPS encounter, so whether you nuke to OOM as fast as possible and then take a 5 minute afk break and repeat again, or have your damage paced throughout an hour or 3 doesn't make you do any more damage either way.  But the latter, I suppose, requires people actually paying attention.<br />
<br />
That said, the ability to Knights to get snap aggro is unparalled especially since they can do it at range.  If a warrior can match it, it is because they have an overpowering weapon whose ratio alone functions as snap aggro (Blade of War, and to a lesser extent SEWS).  Is it broken?  Probably, but so is me sitting LFG and all groups are full while some solo class is cranking out 30 minute AA in Fire somewhere.  Sure it sucks if you're not the overpowered person, but you can still function fine.  Just because a necro can solo an AA in half the time I can with the best groups (not counting charm) doesn't mean my grouping experience is somehow ruined (though I sure wouldn't mind getting xp faster).  Likewise just because Knights have ridiculously good aggro doesn't mean I can't do my job.</div></div><hr />

I can not play EQ enough due to RL reasons to get in a guild that gets those weapons and work nights=little raiding, so basically once WoW comes out I quit EQ for good (including EQ2). EB was Sony's Dev lazy way out, wouldn't it be nice if a DD was the proc instead, I bet knights are out-DPSing warriors when you add weapon procs and their virtually limitless mana pools into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um... Warrior DPS dominates over Knight DPS exactly as much as it should.  We are always meant to use roughly the same weapons that a Knight can and our advantage comes from our higher attack due to skill caps (Knights weapon skills cap quite a bit lower).  Sure during Luclin when SoE had the great idea that since Knight skills cap lower, let's give them weapon with 10% or better ratio to make up for it so they end up doing close to warrior damage.  But now that this oversight has been fixed via itemization, the damage is always the same as where it should be.  <br />
<br />
Paladins can't even use mana for damage unless it's Undead.  Although SK has some nukes, most of the time they're busy feeding mana (Zevfeer) and their most damaging spell, Aura of Hate, is shared with the entire group (which is part of the reason why it's so good).  I'm not too concerned with whatever damage SK happens to be doing with their nukes because in a melee-heavy group, the nuke damage is insignificant to what Aura of Hate adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This shows a couple of things:<br />
1) You do not have a point<br />
2) You don't know how to not contradict yourself<br />
3) You know nothing about snap agro. Because if you did, you would know that there is no way in HELL that warriors, no matter what kind of gear they have, have anywhere near the snap agro abilities of a knight.<br />
<br />
The rest of your post is just senseless dribble about how you and your friends don't invite random people. Here, have a cookie and sit down. Next<br />
<br />
&quot;yes warrior taunt is not as good as paladin taunt, but it is definetly good enough to do the job. educate your group to stand near when casting debuffs, slows etc, don't run away or cast slow from 30 feet away, and don't overnuke. i think most warriors out there know this, just not most other classes they group with.&quot;<br />
<br />
If someone who just joined a 6-person group stands up to lecture everyone on proper techniques of managing agro because he is a warrior and cannot hold it himself very effectively, how long do you think that person stays in a group? Do you really expect every warrior to educate every group about proper agro techniques, after they spent the last 64 levels not knowing them? let me rent you a clue; it won't happend. Step out of ideal thinking and consider this practically<br />
<br />
&quot;warr: doesn't taunt as well, higher dps , tanks exp mobs slightly better, tanks raid mobs much better (has def / evasive). pretty much required in pop boss fights.&quot;<br />
<br />
TANKING IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT DAMAGE MITIGATION. Seriously, the inability to grasp this concept is simply mind-boggling. Taunt is an equally important function of tanking. Therfore, because warriors have an HP difference, and better avoidance caps does not override the better agro abilities of a knight, warriors are not better Xp tanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;that being said, a war can tank fine in an exp group, even ones with terrible weapons have done well in my groups, it just requires paying more attention to your aggro. most people are just lazy and want the aggromagnet. pop boss mobs are another matter, this is where warriors shine, and hybrids have to pray for a cheal every round to survive. each has their role.&quot;<br />
<br />
You've got a whole 'nother thing coming if you think warriors that want agro fixes are lazy. I have relatively decent gear, an EB weapon, another high-agro weapon, and an item that gives me an additional high-agro proc(Orb of sky). I know how to manage my agro and am not lazy about it. I still have agro issues. I'm sure Frodlin would say the same, and he is in a similar position. Care to explain this?<br />
<br />
&quot;finally, i'd like to say if warriors ever got knight like aggro it would trivialize a lot of bosses and dumb down a lot of content. the combo of warriors /disc , superior hp, and better defensive skills (riposte, parry etc) plus knight taunt would be too powerfull, which is why a paladin will never get a usefull discipline. warrior taunt might need some modification, but it's a very fine edge they're walking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can you show me any sensible person here that says warriors should have knight-like agro. We don't. WE DO NOT. Maybe that will sink in for the 2,000th time it has been repeated on these boards. Fixing warrior agro trivializes nothing; this is what I call one of the top 3 knight whines about preventing warrior agro from being fixed. Since you mention defensive, you also have another one on that list, all you're missing is the &quot;remember how bad knights were in RoK/SoV&quot; and you have the hat-trick. Next.<br />
<br />
&quot;pop does not requier slower - its nice to have but not requierd&quot;<br />
<br />
No. Slow is REQUIRED in PoP if you want to actually experience in any scenario outside of having an elemental warrior with 150 AA's tanking BC in PoV. In cases where mob DPS is significant, anywhere beyond Tier 2 and including Giants in PoS, you need slow, unless you want to spend every 3rd kill waiting for your cleric to med if you['re lucky enoguh to survive.<br />
<br />
&quot;also slow is a spell that cast once at the begingin of the figt 2-3 taunts no matter what weapon you are using will get you that agro back. CH is not a high agro spell as long as you healer is not a dumb ass does not have you at less then 80% hp on inc he shouldnt get agro.&quot;<br />
<br />
OMG! You just made me spill my vodka from this stupidity. Slow is a spell cast once? How about resists? Yea, you can get agro from a slow back eventually... except if you can't get it back until the slower is dead and the mob isn't slowed. Complete Heal... not a high agro spell? My god, how much was that warrior on e-bay? How in the fucking world can you be stupid enough to say this; have you ever been on a raid? Ever see clerics repeatedly getting summoned? If not, you're lying. If yes, guess why that's happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors can get agro from the distance, it is called a BOW but only the good warriors use this method. Taunt for a warrior is fine, but a warrior needs to be on his toes and do all the right things, sure it is much simpler for a hybrid but a warrior can get the job done if they are smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
a BOW. Really, well my fucking god, why didn't I think of this. Yes, shooting arrows repeatedly for 0 damage at a target, considering arrows have virtually no agro. Wow, you're a genius. A cleric sneezing within 100 yards of the mob yields greater agro than archery. Warrior agro still isn't fine though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am specifically mentioning the average warrior in my guild, who is using weapons from two expansions ago with absolutely no DPS aa's when talking about the huge gap in aggro generation between hybrids and SK's.<br />
<br />
Then, later on, I mention how there is virtually no difference in aggro between a totally uber warrior with about 300 AA's and a ton on ATK gear and an SK - simply because as far as I am concerned I can do whatever (within reason) I want and still be safely below the aggro margin.<br />
<br />
I still hold by what I said -  Assuming you are looking to fill out a group of yours, and you already had the key classes filled out, would you rather grab a level 65 wizard with maxed AA's/elemental + PoT gear who you never grouped with before, or a level 61 rogue friend of yours?<br />
<br />
Karthunk brought up the point long before - inviting strangers into a group is a practice that's dying fast, by the time you are 60+ its your reputation that gets you groups, not your class, expecially with the ease of boxing key classes to flesh out groups.<br />
<br />
I am agreeing that SK/Paladin aggro is far too good right now, it allows for way too much margin of error, but what I am saying is that a group can function JUST as well with a hybrid tank as with a warrior tank, provided everyone doesn't play like an idiot - while a group with a hybrid tank has a lot more leeway in the way of people being idiots.<br />

Uh huh... and in POP bows always hit their targets, arrows never disappear into some unknown void, there are zero z-axis issues, and you always have LOS form half way across the zone.<br />
<br />
I use my bow as often as I can (I always try for &quot;tag&quot; aggro ASAP), but all too often, in places like BOT, I am lucky to get 1 shot off, and it may or may not hit, and it may or may not disappear into some arrow pathing hell, never to be seen again.

<br />
EXACTLY.  EX-friggin-ACTLY.<br />
<br />
People... EQ is a complex system.  It has changed greatly from its inception.  Things that were designed as detriments .. balancing factors... in the original EQ environment , became absurdly overpowering benefits in the current one.<br />
<br />
Knights were not designed as agro machines - but as warriors with useful spells.  I love how these balance discussion conveniantly neglect the fact that paladins can cast RESSURECTION, and shadowknights can cast FEIGN DEATH.  these are the benefits to being a knights - extremely useful spells combined with the ability to tank almost as well as a warrior in every single exp group and the majority of raid encounters.<br />
<br />
And then, due to the changing environment, all of a sudden the former balancing factors, the former DOWNSIDES to playing a knight.. suddenly became their greatest strength.<br />
<br />
And you can actually claim with a straight face this is balanced?<br />
<br />
There is an easy fix to this problem, and it is:  remove all agro from all knight spells, leaving them with the same tools to get agro that warriors have.<br />
<br />
There is a more difficult but more fair fix to the problem:<br />
increase warrior mitigation significantly over knights,<br />
re-itemize the last 3 expansions so that being a warrior actually means you have better tanking gear than a knight, <br />
AND give warriors a ca. 2-minute reuse time ranged agro generation ability.<br />
<br />
Either one is fine by me, because quite frankly knights are obscenely overpowered in the agro department atm.  But I prefer the second...</div></div><hr />

Gah, this is an old old arguement.  And it would have much more merit if in fact all three of the tank classes had similar limitations so that aggro required some effort and skill by everyone to get and was not something that you just got automatically.<br />

Unless you are a Knight then you do get it automatically with a level 9 spell bought off a vendor.<br />

All this other nonsense we are arguing over here does not negate the fact that in terms of aggro generation a inbalance exists between Warriors and Knights.  And nothing else we might have over them makes up for that inbalance.</div></div><hr />

I certainly don't want warrior taunt to be on the level of a pally or sk, that would trivialize the game. Not to having to rely on an EB proc to get agro would go a long way to balance out warriors. <br />
<br />
Another problem, one that has been going on since velious, is all/all items. Its a sign of lazy itemization on SoE's part, all/all items have given pallys/sk/monks the ability to tank almost as well as a warrior. All/all items were responsible for the monk mitigation change. SoE needs to stop with the all/all items and give us class specific items, even stop with the multi class items. My warrior is about to break 1k mana, wtf do I need mana for.<br />
<br />
Some things I'd like to seen done to the warrior class is the removal of defenisve and evasive discs. Give warriors a perament defensive and evasive disc, at a lesser percentage then the current discs. Hell, I'd even be willing to give up some offensive power for it, just like we do when disc. If I had wanted to play a offensive powerhouse I would have switched to a monk or rog a long time ago. Warriors do one thing and one thing well, we tank, I just think we should be the best at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you.  Even with my non-EB, weapons I do not have a problem holding aggro for the most part once I have it.  The problem is getting aggro and/or getting it back when some caster is careless.  The Knights do not have this problem.  That is the basic inbalance.  <br />
<br />
I don't want a Knight nerf, actually I group regulary with a 60 Paladin and we work together and make what I believe to be a very effective tank team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is the level 60ish warriors who are now in PoP where loss of aggro = wipe, and not only that they are either not in a guild or in a guild that hasn;t made it very far in the end game.  One could certainly argue that maybe for warriors such as these (and I myself am lumped in that bunch) would be better off in old world zones, until they have the right gear (which they may never see).  Problem is PoP is too good for XP, and to make it worse Paly's and SK's are not limited by gear in this reguard.  The current aggro system is just not balanced, because it requires warriors to get uber gear (need a strong guild, or at least one with a whole bunch of people) to effectivly control their aggro, a Paly or SK has a modest investment in a spell (even if they nerf low level spells they still have access to higher level spells that will do just as well and be roughly 1/1000 of the cost of a BoC).  <br />

What i have read on this board is amusing . . . the people who have played the high end game so long that their heads are up their rear's are giving the rest of the &quot;unworthy&quot; warriors the finger.

<br />
Since I have the capability to tank the mob... I should have the ability to make him attack me.  If the mob is to beat me.. it should beat me down, not take out the wizard while ignoring me.  I mean if I'm so inconsequential to the mob (at lvl 60 or with my sub par gear), why does the mob not just kill my sorry ass self, then take out the wiz.<br />
<br />
Aggro for war needs to be less dependant on DPS, procs and gear.  It should be weighed more heavily on the taunt button and no major changes should be make in the overall scheme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casai, I'm beginning to wonder about you.  It has nothing to do with risk vs. reward.  Having a Knight able to lock aggro at contact while a Warrior cannot has nothing to do with the Knight having earned more reward because of greater risk.  It has to do with the fact he can cast a spell at range that generates a hell of a lot of aggro.  He didn't 'earn' this ability, it was given to the class.  It was never intended to be the 'lock' on aggro it is, that is a side effect in many cases of not wanting the parent class, Necros for Shadow Knights and Clerics for Paladins, to have the ability to stack too many dots or stun too many times without risk.  The Knights to a great degree benefit from this side effect.<br />
<br />
Their risk is actually reduced for the reward they receive because they have substantially less chance of things suddenly getting out of control.  <br />
<br />
As far as EB weapons are concerned, they were and are a bandaid.  They improve the situation compared to not having them as a Warrior, but the don't make it 'equal' to a Knight.  And the difficulty with aquiring an EB weapon is far out of proportion to the effort involved with aquiring most of the rudimentary spells that the Knights use for their aggro.</div></div><hr />

Stay away from labeling such as this. This not only ruins your argument, but it's just plain insulting. I certainly don't consider myself the &quot;average&quot; warrior, as I buff out close to 8800hp and have good agro weapons, in a guild that is very close to elemental planes. Frodlin's in about the same position. Ainmer, another poster on these boards that often argues the same position is in an elemental guild. Hell, back on the other boards, a paladin from an elemental guild was arguing the same position. Hell, if you trace back far enough, you'll see even Furor arguing this position, and he's the best geared warrior on any server last I hear. There are plenty of people at the high-end stages of EQ that argue this position<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Have 0 credibility, why, because you say so? I don't want to get into a flame war.&quot;<br />
<br />
No. you have 0 credibility because you can't keep a straight line of thought going, nor post relative content. You can't present contradicting opinions. It would be like me saying &quot;knights take slightly more damage than warriors (true)&quot; and then saying &quot;I know knights that can take damage as well as equally-equipped warriors with /disc defensive on (false)&quot;. If I say this as the only really relevant content to the post, I have no credibility. When you said what you did, you have none as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, later on, I mention how there is virtually no difference in aggro between a totally uber warrior with about 300 AA's and a ton on ATK gear and an SK - simply because as far as I am concerned I can do whatever (within reason) I want and still be safely below the aggro margin.&quot;<br />
<br />
No. that is not what you said. Allow me to quote you again since you seem to like twisting your terms:<br />
<br />
&quot;That said - two of my best friends in EQ are warriors in the top guild on server, and the difference between them and an SK is virtually nill in the &quot;snap&quot; aggro department.&quot;<br />
<br />
Irregardless of how many AA's warriors get, no matter what gear they have, nothing will ever scale warrior SNAP agro ability to anywhere near those of a knight. Why, because there is no AA that allows us to cast a stun with 5 sec re-use, or that adds mass amounts of hate to taunt and increases success rate, or adds hate values to archery. These AA's do not exist. Sure, warriors can d-wield a BF/HG or grab a BoW and get ingernuity-3 and have enraging blow proc more often, but this still does nothing about snap agro. Why? because snap means just that; instant. And no matter how you change proc rate, you still can't make it instant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First I am from a decent sized guild. We have just started killing AoW and the PoI dragon. So far we have received 2 Blade of Carnages and 1 Cord Hilted Spike Driver.<br />
<br />
I started Biggwinz because we used to be in a really small guild. It was rare to have anyone on that could tank for my wife (cleric) and me (rogue). So I started a warrior.<br />
<br />
EB items are not the fix to our aggro woes. I think it is complete and total BS that people are even suggesting them as a fix. One, we have to have them actually proc. Two, we actually have to be able to get them.<br />
<br />
Then to top it all off there are two classes that can actually tank the same mobs without aggro woes. All it takes is a simple push of the spell gem and poof they have aggro. There is no, please God let my taunt actually work this time! <br />
<br />
I dont care which class does what, I dont care which class has what, and I sure as heck dont care about other class whines! I am a Warrior, I am a proud Warrior, it is my job to tank the mobs and in order for me to do my job I have to be able to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue the finer points of being a pally or sk then point me to your boards and I will head over there and argue with you all day long. But here on the Warrior boards we would like an improvement in our ability to keep aggro and work towards a fix.<br />
<br />
Yes I can hold aggro 99% of the time pretty reliably it is the 1% of the time that gets someone killed. I have no fail safe to make sure I have aggro or stop the mob from attacking someone else.</div></div><hr />

Taunt &quot;clones&quot; aggro.  That's a highly useful effect (obviously) that people don't seem to take quite as much advantage of as they could.  Granted, taunt's (lack of) success rate/reliability makes it CONSIDERABLY less than ideal, but it's still a workable option to let classxyz generate a ton of aggro then clone it away for yourself...<br />
<br />
A &quot;new&quot; AA or class ability like &quot;dire taunt&quot; (single target, fast refresh, 100%/AE-like taunt + short hate dot) would certainly help a bunch too. ;)<br />

I am not complaining about risk vs reward, or even &quot;red con&quot; mobs.  Heck i have issues in PoV with blue con's, and even in PoD when some were turning light blue.  I am appropriate level and my gear does not exactly suck.  I am surely not the top 10% but not the bottom 5% either.  Actually I don;t have problems tanking most of the time, but with some of the PoV stuff I do because it seems even more vital that i lock aggro sooner.  Problem is while i have to work at it a paly or sk just pop's a spell and poof aggro magnet.  I think we need a little more taunt in our taunt personnaly.  Unless they want to put EB items on 1 group do-able mobs (and not the stupid barnicle axe either, something someone level 60ish pre-epic would use).  Still the bulk of our problem that aggro rellies too much on proc.  If I proc on the first hit, I have no problem with aggro for the fight, else i may have a problem.  I don;t like relying on EB items or whatever else there is out there.  <br />
<br />
As far as using my noggin for other solutions out there . . .  i'd like to chalenge you . . . . what other options are you speaking of???  Getting snare whips??  click snare items??  Joining an uber guild and playing like a mad fool so i can get one item that will allow me to do my job???<br />
<br />
Only option being discussed is Sony fixing the game.  Or maybe breaking SK's and paly's so we could all be equally useless and we could go back to chanter pets for MT's.  <br />
<br />
I am not speaking to all the people who are level 65 and uber about throwing the rest of us a bone, just those who think that we can walk up to the PoI dragon, AoW etc and cough up a weapon like it's trivial.  It dosen't take work to get those, it takes 40+ people AND work to get those.  I can handle work, but prefer the allure of a small guild thanks.  Heck even those who are 65 and uber i am sure would appreciate not having to rely on a stinking proc to do their job.  <br />
<br />
Well maybe with this change to xp, i'll go back to the old world and just be broke there where no one will notice.</div></div><hr />

Tharak man I used to be in small family oriented guild. I could tank just fine then. I can tank just fine now. Learn how to use that taunt button so that it works well with rest of the group. It is possible is all I am saying. On the other hand if you want to just hit auto attack and do nothing else and keep agro. Then work on EB weapon or something that will put you dps far and beyond those who you group with.<br />

<br />
If a knight can tank at 80% of my effectiveness, and this is balanced out with a full spellset that's oriented either around offsetting damage that has already been inflicted upon himself or his party members, or in the prevention of damage (i.e. Heals, Resses and Stuns), then that's the balance... The aggro disparity is NOT the balance.  Back to the point, if he can tank at 80% of my effectiveness in melee, then I don't see why I shouldn't have 80% of his or her aggro generation capabilities.   <br />
<br />
HAVING SAID THAT!   I am also under the impression (believe it or not, I tend to agree with Khumak, Phantron, and Derrin more than others) that the bar should be closer to the level of the warrior than the current level of the Paladin.   <br />
<br />
I believe that the ideal lies higher than warriors are capable, but not by a lot, and MUCH lower than the current Knight capability.   I find it fun having to control aggro, I really do, and making it a challenge for group members, when it's *not* fun is when I have to do this, and someone else doesn't... AND there's very little consequence in terms of melee damage absorption.    The reward is in the journey, not the result.    <br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings would've been pretty damn boring if Frodo could've rode a horse to the Fires of Mordor and tossed the ring into the fire.   Everquest similarly is far less rewarding for receiving 'reward&quot; for little to no effort.<br />
<br />
I DO NOT WANT what is currently knight-like aggro.  I simply don't want to be the retarded kid who you have to babysit in terms of aggro, while others can easily and flawlessly get it, without any direct consequence.  That is inherently UNFAIR!</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree with this, however to make it come to pass would require some pretty serious work on how Knights generate and hold aggro and how Warriors generate and hold aggro.  It would require a small upgrade to Warrior aggro and a fairly substantial downgrade to Knight aggro.  Is it really practical to expect that SoE will take the heat required to take this approach?  Would they really want to deal with the hysteria from the Knight community?  Do we really want to take the grief for suggesting it?<br />

<br />
Probably the briefest summation of my feelings as well.  I'll accept any fix that puts us on an even, NOT SUPERIOR, but even footing with the Knights.  All three classes are tanks and all three classes need to be valued for the ability to tank.  Having any of the three to be at a significant tanking disadvantage is unbalanced.  Atm, the Warriors are the ones disadvantaged and it shows in PoP the most.</div></div><hr />

I've found many SK's to be REMARKABLE groupmates, particularly those who want what is best for the group rather than their own ego.   Aggro transfer from an SK is a great thing, and even better, they tend to see that as a valid role.<br />
<br />
Paladins on the other hand, for some reason, for the most part want nothing to do with you tanking, they WILL take the aggro and generally do nothing to ensure that you have it.   I dont' knoe, perhaps it's a personality thing, people who choose Paladins vs. people who choose SK's, or if it's the spell lines, I'm not sure, but what I do know is that with an SK, a good one at least, I can pretty much rest assured that they'll be interested in working with me rather than fighting me for aggro the whole time, whereas I vary rarely find Paladins who do the same.   Hell, it could be my personal experiences too, I dont' know, but I can only go on my experiences.  My experiences have been this:<br />
<br />
-/ooc 65 SK lfg = SK<br />
-/ooc 65 war lfg = Warrior<br />
-/ooc 65 TANK (all caps for extra bravado) lfg = Paladin</div></div><hr />

Humm well I hate to disagree there, but maybe the paly's on your server ;-)<br />
<br />
On my server most i have worked with (as opposed to against) has gone well.  Paly would stun, shammy slow then I take aggro . . . worked really well.  Actually all night the paly and I took turns tanking (need to give the fingers a break from smashing the taunt key even though it does not work).  We can work well with either class if we want to.  However taunt should do a little more than it does now, right now I might as well hit attack and go afk for all that taunt helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that the folks who go off on the just-get-an-EB-weapon or join-an-uber-guild-that-can-equip-you-properly tangents miss the point entirely. <br />
<br />
It's all about balance. Class balance, game balance. The relevant posts from other class boards indicate that there is widespread consensus that this is the case. Amazing to me how SOE can continue to ignore such an obvious problem. Perhaps they'll pay the price when WoW arrives.<br />
<br />
This is not a situation that calls for yet another bandaid or workaround. It cries out for a solution by the developers. A workaround is only OK as long as you know that the solution is in the pipe. But in this case, as in so many, the good seems to be the enemy of the best.<br />
<br />
It's also unfortunate in my view is the knee-jerk reaction from a lot of warriors here is that SOE should break/overpower the warrior class as they've done to knights. I think modifying the imbalance on the knights' side would be a clearly preferrable solution for all. Continuing to ask that warriors be upgraded like the knights just gives SOE the further opportunity to blast us as whiners who just want to be overpowered. It makes the true case tougher to make and so does warriors no favors, in my view.<br />
<br />
BTW, Frodlin's last point about pallies/SKs is also valid on CT server - SKs generally throw voice on me without my asking for it - pallies just wanna play mine-is-bigger-than-yours. There's a PhD dissertation in there somewhere, I'm sure of it. ;-)</div></div><hr />

knights and sk's way over powered in reguards to aggro atm (maybe those changes to test would change that don't really know).  I still think warrior taunt needs to be looked at and tuned up slightly.  At level 60+ I should not have to hit it more than twice to grab a mob that con;s blue /  light blue to me EVER.  Right now I swear my taunt button on my keyboard is broke.  I also think there is too much emphesis on proc'ing weapons to maintain aggro, DPS weapons and my taunt button should do the trick not some quirky lucky.  <br />
<br />
I guess SK's and Paly's can be equally as big a jerk's but i know more pallies and they tend to work with me as opposed to being glory hounds.</div></div><hr />

We (the people on our high horses) miss the point just like you (the little red headed step child) miss our points, eh? Works both ways doesn't it? I have no problems with aggression, there are lots of other warriors in the same boat as me. The question I would dare ask is, why? Well, as I can see a good portion of the people complaning aren't even level 65. <br />
<br />
As far as I can recall, because it's been ages ago, taunt seem to scale in effectiveness for PoP mobs as I went from level 60 to level 65. Add in the fact that I had an increase of 15+ percent in DPS just with AAs and picked up a blade that doubled my total DPS. Are blades worthy of holding taunt and AAs open to ANYONE, yes. This game works on a simple formula, dedication + time = rewards/results. If you aren't willing to dedicate yourself to get the gear you need and to spend the time required to get yourself level 65 and the AAs, then no you should not be holding aggression as well as someone who will do the above.<br />
<br />
Now you might be thinking, why isn't he talking about this SK and paladin problem?! I don't like playing into the, nerf the other guy game (and no, it doesn't matter how many times you post &quot;this isn't trying to get the other guy nerfed, BUT...). Redo the thought process of this thread to just deal with warriors and no other class. You want to get something fixed, but your trying to get it done by pointing to the guy next to you and blaming him for having something you dont. When instead of that you could just be talking about the problem based on your performance and leave the other guy totally out of the talk.<br />
<br />
Spells take mana with the cease and desist change on test being able to maintain aggro will be costly to pallys.<br />
<br />
That sounds like a step in the right direction atleast. <br />
<br />
Push in the right direction? I thought this thread was for warrior improvement, I guess it was just a cry to get those paladins nerfed all along, eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But according to everything you're saying there is no problem.<br />
<br />
Between warriors, it's always a matter of gear. So it's really not going to help anyone to just sit here and realize that a warrior with a blade of war can hold aggro easily at level 65 when compared to a warrior wielding Curved Claws and Swiftblade of Zek at level 63.<br />
<br />
But what happens when the problem is Flame Lick and Snare?<br />
<br />
Because even if they NERF the hell out of paladins' cease and desist, I know a few chain flame licking rangers who can hold aggro over a BoW wielding warrior without batting an eyelash.<br />
<br />
And the rangers tank just fine too, since recent patches upped their defense.<br />
<br />
There's a few design problems here with Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
Things that the devs never really expected to happen, but that the playerbase simply discovered on their own while playing the expansion and adjusted to.<br />
<br />
Playing the game reveals these things over time.<br />
<br />
And one of these things is, in Planar XP groups, Hybrids are now far superior tanks.<br />
<br />
It leaves Warriors a wee bit frustrated at times, because their name, and reputation and gear doesn't mean crap sometimes now, when they have to compete from time to time for limited space in limited XP group situations against classes that can hold aggro by looting a FIRE BEETLE EYE.<br />
<br />
I won't even go into the stupid, frustrating and aggravating games some hybrids like to play when you finally DO group with them and they decide to &quot;steal&quot; aggro whenever they can just for kicks.</div></div><hr />

Karthunk brought up the point long before - inviting strangers into a group is a practice that's dying fast, by the time you are 60+ its your reputation that gets you groups, not your class, expecially with the ease of boxing key classes to flesh out groups.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I think thats kind of what the original post was about.  In many ways you are right, and it is a person's reputation that gets them groups, but I think what the problem here is that warriors in general have a bad reputation because of our inability to hold aggro.  Certainly being a good person who plays the game well will get you groups in a zone where you know people, but lacking those people a group has only your class reputation to go on when selecting members.  And a warrior's inability to maintain aggro is not exactly a glowing recommendation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knight get More spell (level 61 -65 )<br />
More mana pool<br />
More FT, hp/mana all,all or plate class item, focus gear (hell warrior cant use mana or FT)<br />
More mana regen <br />
<br />
On the other hand<br />
<br />
Warrio get /Shield and what warrior got like stat increase Knight have it.<br />
<br />
Lets say <br />
Knight Power 80% from melee/tank ability and 20 % from spell<br />
Warrior Power 100 % from melee/tank ability<br />
<br />
PoP give knight the 20% power further increase throught the FT, hp/mana gear, 61- 65 spells. While the Warrior still using 100% of the power and get partly benefit from the HP/Mana item and not even a damn weapons skill increase.<br />
<br />
So pop make knight 80% + 20 % X new spell and gear advantage while warrior get a /Shield.<br />
<br />
Root and the group cooperation could help me do my job but hell I am not cripple that need other people to help me do my primary Role in Game. From what I see from SOE give warrior taunt skill cap &gt; knight (from the very old time) and slightly better tank skill, Warriors are mean to better aggro and tank than knight and that why we dont cast spell. I have a EB weapon yet I need to rely on random digit generator to proc to do my role while Knight just press a few gold level 9 casting gem to do it as WILL as the TIME he want. Even I with EB and avatar I still playing Ping-pong with caster everyday. <br />
<br />
/sigh I need to go through the Cooperation with warrior guideline to group all the time<br />
<br />
1. Dont slow, trash before my weapon can touch the mob<br />
2. Stand close to me to slow or tash mob plz<br />
3. When you get hit, dont panic dont run stay in my taunt and /shield range<br />
4. if u want to root mob stand in max range to melee it<br />
5. dont sit down from slow<br />
6. Dont blame me I dont taunt and hold taunt The damn BOC dont proc<br />

Warrior need update</div></div><hr />

How do you propose to discuss class balance without something to balance warriors against?  If there were no knights, then you are absolutly right, we are fine.  Trouble is, there are knights, and balanced against them, we lack.<br />

To be honest, I don't care how they fix it...nerf knights, up our agro, up our tankability...I do not care, just so long as they do something.  From a gameplay standpoint, nerfing knights might be a better solution, but any solution is better than none.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the current system lacks now is balance . . . period  . . . end of story.  If you think it is balanced that is because you can;t even remember level 61 - 64 or when you didn;t have a BoW.  Sorry i just can;t go by your dedication logic besides we all know it is not dedication that nets you uber gear, it's dedication and being in a large guild.  That may or may not fit your play style, and besides should a warrior have to get that gear to tank trash mobs in a zone that will soon be open to everyone level 55+ ?? (hint that's PoV soon).  There is no progression anymore it's open season in the planes.  There is no progression to PoP it's just a feeding frenzy or as i like to call it an accident waiting to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of these things aren't things people should have to be told to do, these are just signs of a good player. No one should be trying to slow a mob before it reaches camp, sit down right after a slow, stand next to a rooted mob, and run around when a mob touches them. Those are not problems with the warrior class, those are game play issues for some of the people you are grouping with.<br />
<br />
This is what I do, and you should try it. Make sure you have your group spell messages on so you can see your group members cast. Then ask your slower how long does it take for him to cast a slow spell. Once you have the number, watch for your slower to start casting. Once you see him cast start the count down in your head. As soon as your countdown is finished hit taunt. If you get really good at this you can be hitting taunt a split second right after the mob is slowed. Watch your cleric on those early CHs. If you have a good cleric they will call out when they are starting a CH, count down 10 seconds in your head and hit taunt. Once again, if you practice and get really good you will be hitting taunt a split second right after that heal hits you.<br />
<br />
Timing your taunt is an art. You don't wait for the mob to run off and start beating someone or smash your taunt button all your time. You base when you use your taunt key by knowing what spells your group peeps are casting and when.<br />
<br />
But according to everything you're saying there is no problem. <br />
Yes, this is correct.<br />
<br />
But what happens when the problem is Flame Lick and Snare? <br />
Where does the &quot;problem&quot; stop? Should they nerf heals next?Paladins will still be able to cast group heals (of course they can't chain cast them because of spell recast and mana issues) and over agro any warrior. Should we go along and look at all the ways ANY class can overagro a warrior and nerf them? Because, that's what kind of a defense is on the table right now.<br />
<br />

Once again you are pointing at the other guy. Focus back on just the warrior class and leave the paladin out of the issue. If you want to really add something to the thread then post up a list of possible solutions to the &quot;warrior problem&quot;. Am I going to post up a list? Nope, because I think the warrior class is fine as is. You're the one who sees the problem though, lets hear those thoughts on how to fix it, that don't require nerfing every hybrid.<br />
<br />
Sorry i just can;t go by your dedication logic besides we all know it is not dedication that nets you uber gear, it's dedication and being in a large guild.  <br />
A large guild means jack shit. You DO NOT need a lot of people to get stuff done in this game. What you need is time and a whole lot of passion. I lead the raids for my guild, and I push everyone to be the best players they can be. I am rewarded by people who are dedicated and have the same drive as me, to be the best they can be. Dedication results in sucess, I know this because I'm seeing the results from that statement with my guild, right now.<br />
<br />
A BoW wasn't just handed to me, nor was any of my gear. My AAs just didn't suddenly appear in my Alt menu one day just because I'm &quot;uber&quot; or whatever term you wish to use. I busted my ass to reach the point where I am. Anyone can reach the same point as me, because i am NOT special. I am just a player with a whole hell of a lot heart who loves his hobby (EQ). So, don't play it off like it's hard. If effort is something you do not wish to put forth then you will always be at the bottom of the pole.</div></div><hr />

What are the mana contraints and spell recast constraints of level 9 spells?<br />
<br />
If one were to actually acknowledge a problem, it may have something to do with the lack of constraints that come from abusing lower level spells to basically obsolete the &quot;fight&quot; for aggro on initial pulls at the beginning of a fight.<br />
<br />
That is, if someone were to actually acknowledge there was a problem.<br />

<br />
The kind of defense on the table right now, the one that Frodlin has offered, is to BALANCE this.<br />
<br />
It's not to summarily nerf aggro.<br />

The problem is that the system is not balanced and it needs to be.  The aggro of a level 9 spell is just plain overpowered period.  Is that nerfing a hybrid to make them use a higher level spell, maybe but not much of one.  <br />

As usual you derail this topic again and again.  You;re mightier than thou retoric just does not add to this discussion at all.

<br />
LOL Karthunk - you disagreed, and then went on to post sufficient nonsense to prove me right, to my satisfaction. Thx - appreciate that.<br />
<br />
This is not a warrior problem. This is a game BALANCE problem. This is a class BALANCE problem. As others have here noted, BALANCE implies 2 things being measured against each other. So your repeated suggestions to  focus only on a single class - the warrior - is absurd and useless. The problem cannot be solved in the context of a single class, since the fundamental nature of the problem is the DIFFERENTIAL between war and knight snap aggro ability. Worth noting that most of the other class boards appear to have reached a rare consensus on this issue.  <br />
<br />
You do not agree - fine. You're entitled to your opinion, even when it is not the same as mine or 95% of the others posters here, the majority of which offer articulate and thoughtful insight - unlike yourself. Instead, you suggest that we time our taunts based on slow/CH messages. Doh! Stop the presses! Brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? Oh yeah - I did - about 40 levels ago. FYI - timing taunt is NOT an &quot;art&quot; - it's a basic warrior skill and one that most of us learned ages ago - and it is utterly  irrelevant to this discussion. <br />
<br />
If this is the extent of your 'contribution' to the discussion, I refer you back to my original  quote. The basis for taunt is the RNG - time it all you want it's still gonna fail often enough to kill overzealous chanters who will not listen to a lecture from a warrior on aggro management and who will next time grab that pally who is LFG. And no RNG-based proc from yer uber gear is gonna change that.<br />
<br />
I don't like playing into the, nerf the other guy game (and no, it doesn't matter how many times you post &quot;this isn't trying to get the other guy nerfed, BUT...).  <br />
<br />
I've never posted what you ascribe to me - perhaps you are once again befuddled - would not surprise me a bit. In my view, there's no &quot;buts&quot; about it - my position has been and remains clear: nerf the knights. I have time and again explicitly suggested here that knights be made to pay a cost for their guaranteed snap aggro ability - preferrably in terms of significantly increased mana cost attached to said ability. I think that's a fair tradeoff. I think that  helps the game by balancing the classes and making the tradeoff explicit. It's an idea I espouse and is my preferred solution. That clear enough for ya?<br />
<br />
That said, like others here have stated - there are a lot of ways to address this issue, and I would be willing to settle for most of them. The one thing I'm ready to dismiss out of hand is your inane suggestion that uber gear or an uber guild is some sort of actual solution if it is somehow combined with your 'art' of timing taunt.</div></div><hr />

Primary reason that i am not level 65 is the ony place to get decent xp post 61 is PoV / PoS and other teir 2 zones.  Maybe the line of level 65 warriors lfg might be a problem there.  Level 65 is not a solution to the problem, because i am complaining about mobs that are blue to me (in PoV) that should be easy enough to control.  Your solution is still a band-aid to the larger problem.  It's like throwing EB items out there to fix a design flaw . . . it will work eventually but it's much less of an ideal fix.<br />

I have never struggled as a casual player like this, i've always been able to do my job.  Now I can;t , I am not asking to be able to hold aggro as well as some uber high and mighty player, I would however like to be able to hold my own on mob's who are blue to me, and i should hold taunt better then players of less level and gear than me (which is currently not the case).  No one is saying we want all the &quot;lowbie&quot; warrior's with no gear to be just as good at aggro as you mr. I am 65 and you're not.  However for mob's i fight (and I am certainly capable gear and level wise) I should be able to function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Karthunk, let me try and use small words to make this point clear to you.  There are 2 more plate tank classes in this game besides warriors.  This discussion is about balancing them.  Therefore, paladins are part of the issue.<br />
<br />
No one should be trying to slow a mob before it reaches camp, sit down right after a slow, stand next to a rooted mob, and run around when a mob touches them. Those are not problems with the warrior class, those are game play issues for some of the people you are grouping with. <br />
<br />
And yet, with a knight tanking, they can do most of these things.  This is why some of us are saying, quite clearly, that nerfing knights is the best solution.  It will reward the good players(the ones who don't due the above), and penalize the bad players(who do these things, and rely on knights to tank so they don't have to learn basic skills).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Karthunk, you keep mentioning reward for investment of time, and it's true, more time invested = more reward.  But the issue is farther than that.<br />
<br />
I think you need to look at this from every level to truly see if this is a game balance issue or a investment vs. reward issue.<br />
<br />
A warrior in full Kunark gear has no ability to tank for xp for the same efficiency as a Paladin/SK in full Kunark gear.  However, the Warrior can tank Phara Dar more efficiently than the Paladin/SK.<br />
<br />
A Warrior in full Velious gear has no ability to tank for xp for the same efficiency as a Paladin/SK in full Kunark gear.  However, the Warrior can tank Avatar of War more efficiently than the Paladin/Sk.<br />
<br />
A Warrior in full Luclin gear has no ability to tank for xp for the same efficiency as a Paladin/SK in full Velious gear.  However, the Warrior can tank Emperor Ssraeshza more efficiently than the Paladin/SK.<br />
<br />
A Warrior in full PoP gear has no ability to tank for xp for the same efficiency as a Paladin/SK in full Velious gear.  However, the Warrior can tank Fennin Ro and the Paladin/SK can not.<br />
<br />
In all the above situations, with all the above gear, the Paladin/SK make better xp tanks.  In all the above situations the Warrior makes a better raid tank.  Should there be a reason to choose a Warrior tank for xp? <br />
<br />
You could choose a warrior for DPS, but an SK can outdamage a warrior pretty easily in PoP.  Choosing a warrior over a paladin might make sense if you are really low on DPS and the warrior is well equipped and really knows how to keep aggro.  On the other hand, you could just choose a run of the mill paladin and have fewer issues.<br />
<br />
You could choose a warrior due to high dps xp mobs, like if you don't have a slower, or are xping somewhere wierd like Plane of Earth B.  High dps mobs are inherently inefficient, however, so those groups are few and far between.<br />
<br />
Why take a warrior if not for DPS or the need for a thousand more hit points?  Inquiring minds want to know...<br />
<br />
The reality is, there is nothing really special the warrior brings to the xp group.  Sure, we all know warriors get groups.  I get 'em all the time.  Well, mostly I create them and I'm married to a cleric.  Anyway, there should be a good reason to take a warrior in a group.<br />
<br />
The issue is not limited to warriors, though.<br />
<br />
These classes have great reasons to take them:<br />
<br />
Cleric - Healing and Rez.<br />
Druid - Healing, snare, porting, damage shields, Tracking.<br />
Shaman - Attack buffs, Slowing, healing.<br />
Necro - Attack buffs, dps, Rez and summon corpse.<br />
Enchanter - Mana Regen, Crowd Control, Attack and Haste buffs.<br />
Magician - Mana Regen, DPS, Damage shields.<br />
Wizard - DPS, snare.<br />
Shadow Knight - Snare, Attack buffs, Feign Death, Summon Corpse, Tanking.<br />
Paladin - Rez, Healing, Tanking.<br />
Beastlord - Slowing, DPS, Attack buffs.<br />
Ranger - DPS, Attack buffs, Snare, Tracking, Tanking.<br />
Bard - Slowing, Haste, Attack buffs, Tracking, Snaring, Crowd Control, Mana Regen<br />
<br />
Then you have the &quot;pure melee&quot;:<br />
Monk - DPS, Feign Death<br />
Rogue - DPS, Shroud of Stealth<br />
Warrior - Tanking<br />
<br />
The Warrior in this example does one thing.  He is unrivalled at tanking, though others can do it well enough for all intents and purposes.  <br />
<br />
The Monk in this example does two things.  He is middle of the road for DPS relative to the rest, and Feign Death is of questionable value to a group, particularly since anyone can pull for xp in PoP.<br />
<br />
The Rogue in this example does two things.  He is near the upper end of DPS, although still behind a few of the other DPS classes.  SoS is of questionable value to a PoP xp group.<br />
<br />
These three class do not excel at their limited roles enough to make up for the lack of adding anything else of value.  Most of the other classes that perform the same functions as these three either do it better, or offer additional benefits beyond the basic need for Tanking or DPS.<br />
<br />
For xp, these three classes need to bring more to the table.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to solve this issue.  <br />
<br />
One is to increase the DPS of the three.  This motivates a group leader to choose a warrior over a paladin/sk/ranger because there is xp efficiency value to doing so, even with aggro as it is today.  This also motivates a group leader to choose a monk or rogue over other damage dealers when the other requirements of the group are filled.  You have to realize, when you only do one thing well, shouldn't you be the best at it?  (BTW, I see the utility added by a wizard or a mage in this day and age as very slight.  Wizards and mages are on the edge of not bringing enough to the table, but the DPS advantage they have keeps them in groups.)<br />
<br />
Another is to provide some utility that makes the three valuable relative to the other classes.  I don't know that I like the idea of adding more utility to pure melees, as it messes with the whole idea of &quot;pure melee&quot;.  However, it may be required so as not to make a warrior a &quot;good damage dealer&quot;.  I wouldn't mind seeing warrior group buffs, like battlecries similar to bard songs, or some kind of situational dps such as rampage.  <br />
<br />
All in all, pure melees need to bring more to an xp group than they do today.  <br />
<br />
Now, off to start a War/Cler/Bard/Wiz/Ranger/Shaman group!  Having a pocket cleric is $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karthunk</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not a warrior problem. This is a game BALANCE problem. This is a class BALANCE problem. As others have here noted, BALANCE implies 2 things being measured against each other. <br />
No, that view is subjective. Thanks for sharing what balance implies though, I will file that under &quot;things I already knew&quot;.<br />
 The problem cannot be solved in the context of a single class, since the fundamental nature of the problem is the DIFFERENTIAL between war and knight snap aggro ability. Worth noting that most of the other class boards appear to have reached a rare consensus on this issue. <br />
This is where we clash. I feel that a warrior is a &quot;balanced&quot; class as is, even based against a paladin. If the problem is that people are having trouble holding aggression , which most people in this thread who are siding with you are saying, then the view should be instead turned towards increasing the aggression power of the warrior class by just looking at the warrior class. <br />
You do not agree - fine. You're entitled to your opinion, even when it is not the same as mine or 95% of the others posters here, the majority of which offer articulate and thoughtful insight - unlike yourself. Instead, you suggest that we time our taunts based on slow/CH messages. Doh! Stop the presses! Brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? Oh yeah - I did - about 40 levels ago. FYI - timing taunt is NOT an &quot;art&quot; - it's a basic warrior skill and one that most of us learned ages ago - and it is utterly irrelevant to this discussion.  <br />
I really like what you did right here. First you told me having my own opinion is fine, and then you turn around and insult it. The problem is we aren't all as smart as you, nor are we all armed with a thesaurus when we post. Not all warriors would think of timing CHs to the cast messages to have the taunt hit a split second after the spell hits. You will have to forgive me as I am only speaking to those of the low IQ level, the ones like me.<br />
If this is the extent of your 'contribution' to the discussion, I refer you back to my original quote. The basis for taunt is the RNG - time it all you want it's still gonna fail often enough to kill overzealous chanters who will not listen to a lecture from a warrior on aggro management and who will next time grab that pally who is LFG. And no RNG-based proc from yer uber gear is gonna change that. <br />
What exactly have you contributed to this thread might I ask, I mean besides trying to insult me? I do just fine in exp groups, you might even say just as well as a paladin. So, I feel that the issue is not between paladins and warriors. <br />
I've never posted what you ascribe to me - perhaps you are once again befuddled - would not surprise me a bit. In my view, there's no &quot;buts&quot; about it - my position has been and remains clear: nerf the knights. I have time and again explicitly suggested here that knights be made to pay a cost for their guaranteed snap aggro ability - preferrably in terms of significantly increased mana cost attached to said ability. I think that's a fair tradeoff. I think that helps the game by balancing the classes and making the tradeoff explicit. It's an idea I espouse and is my preferred solution. That clear enough for ya? <br />
Let me try to make this clear for you. The first set of sentences were directed to you. Then this strange thing called a space appears out of no where. Then I go on to make a few more sentences that have NOTHING to do with the small section I quoted from your post. Could this then mean that maybe that part of the post isn't referring directly to you? Wow... maybe so, huh?<br />
That said, like others here have stated - there are a lot of ways to address this issue, and I would be willing to settle for most of them. The one thing I'm ready to dismiss out of hand is your inane suggestion that uber gear or an uber guild is some sort of actual solution if it is somehow combined with your 'art' of timing taunt. <br />
Kinda like I'm dismissing your &quot;inane&quot; fix of &quot;nerf the nights&quot;. With such a striking idea you are clearly set apart as the North Star of brilliance in this thread.<br />
Karthunk, let me try and use small words to make this point clear to you. There are 2 more plate tank classes in this game besides warriors. This discussion is about balancing them. Therefore, paladins are part of the issue. <br />
Let me use small words for you. My view is that the warrior class is fine as is and there is no &quot;balancing&quot; needed. I also feel that if people have a problem with the warrior class in the areas of taunt then we should just look at our class, and not some warrior vs paladin crap. I don't like classes being nerfed just because people have penis envy and that's what this is.</div></div><hr />

There would be nothing wrong with tossing something into the mix to make warriors having issues a bit more &quot;inviting&quot; to groups. I would even be willing to brain storm out a lot of ideas, but the fact remains that this thread doesn't seem interested in upgrading the warriors. People seem more interested in getting the knights nerfed, which will do not a damn thing to help any warrior complaning here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just make taunt work 100% of the time at max skill?  Would it really trivalize the game anymore then it is already trivial?  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
You have a warrior with EB weapon(s), on a raid, about to tank the big guy... send in a ranger with weapon shield up, have them build rediclous agro, then AE taunt.... oh gee, you have amazing starting agro that no one can come close to touching (unless they are REALLY trying to pull agro) before you start procing and then... you're proccing, so you have solid agro anyway.  (from what I understand from talking with warriors who have both EB weaps and AE taunt, perhaps I am wrong and this isn't nearly as effective as it has been made to seem to me?).<br />
<br />
Knights already have 100% agro control.  If you want to argue that, go to test, make a paladin, /testbuff, and tank using cease and decist spells, you won't lose agro unless someone is trying really hard to take it... and that's at level 25, before you get better stuns, etc.<br />
<br />
So, for XP groups there are classes that tank fine, and have 100% agro.  For raids either a knight can tank, or you can generally use the agro switch with ae taunt to ensure solid agro on the tank (be it knight tank, or warrior ae taunting off a ranja).<br />
<br />
knights can stun more then once every 6 seconds also, so they'd still have an advantage in agro, although a considorably smaller one.<br />
<br />
summery:<br />
1 - knight classes have 100% agro all the time.<br />
<br />
2 - in proper set up with ae taunt warrior has close to that (ae taunt, level 60+ ranger, EB weapon, again, from what i have been told by other warriors who i trust, and clerics, etc).<br />
<br />
3 - in xp groups a knight can tank anything.<br />
<br />
4 - on raids either a knight can tank or you can set up a way to transfer initial agro to warrior.<br />
<br />
5 - a knight would still be able to ensure more perfect agro than a warrior, even with taunt working 100% of the time at skill cap.<br />
<br />
Over all it would seem to me to be a way to narrow the agro gap in a similar way that the HP and AC gaps have narrowed.  A knight would have slightly better agro control still, and still have slightly less HP/AC, more utility, mana dependancy.  A warrior would have slightly worse agro control (though greatly improved), slightly more HP/AC, much less utility, no mana dependancy (other then your healer ;P).  Either class would still be able to fill the role of tank in an XP group, with differances being less drasticly in favor of knights over warriors.  On raids this change wouldn't take anything away from knights, and wouldn't make holding agro truely any more trivial then before.<br />
<br />
I'd even be happy with taunt only working 100% of the time at skill cap, and at level 65, or 60+ or whatever.  But I don't want a gear bandage, or an AA bandage, or some stupid ability (/shield anyone?) that doesn't really help.<br />
<br />
EDIT: or just nerf knights, either way you get rid of the ugly disparity that exists now.  another fix - make the disparity in midigation, avoidance, and HP so great that warriors have that CLEARLY in the lead just as knights do with agro.<br />
<br />
For a while on old boards i agrued that I didn't think warriors were broken, I was clearly wrong, playing a level 25 testbuffed paladin on test and watching my RL friend who was level 58ish paladin in about the same level of gear tank &quot;better&quot; then my 63 (at the time) warrior was enough to see that.  Now he is 60 (or 61) and I'm 65, I don't see a reason why I should even play warrior with them rather then level up a rogue or DPS for quicker kills.  I don't think it's penis envy, I think it is that warriors are truely broken and useless outside of encounters that require defensive / evasive to tank because the vast agro disparity coupled with the very small HP/AC/midigation/tanky stuff margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it will.  It will increase warrior desirability in exp groups.  Not every one agrees that nerfing the knights is the best balance solution(in other threads on this topic, I think it has actually been a minority opinion), but it is one that will adress the most common complaint warriors have:  we are third choice for tanking, and have no other valuable role in a group.<br />
<br />
You know, and I know, and most everyone here knows that a warrior can tank effectivly in an exp group.  We all also know that a knight can effectivly tank in an exp group.  The trouble is that an exp group tends to want easy, fast exp.  With a knight,  exp is easier.  Agro will not bounce around as much, the healer will only have to heal one target, the casters can get away with doing a little more(slow earlier, nuke earlier and harder) with less risk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm trying to read your posts and find exactly where it is you stand.   I'm struggling though.  It seems to me that just about every warrior except you can see that there's a basic imbalance in the ability to generate aggro in relation to tanking durability.   What I and many other people have been saying all along is simply this:<br />
<br />
- If it is necessary for the vast majority of one class to perform less efficiently in order to enable the group to perform, and not another, then this is an imbalance.<br />
<br />
- If there exists an offsetting imbalance, then both imbalances would by nature &quot;balance&quot; each other out.<br />
<br />
- There doesn't exist this offsetting imbalance at this time to enough of a degree that it's noticeable, making one class noticeably better at one aspect than another.<br />
<br />
Let me spell out my view of the &quot;balance&quot; issue for you, which you are fully entitled to disagree with, I only ask you to back up your disagreement with something that doesn't include &quot;In my experience&quot;.   Let's be serious here for a minute, in this thread a couple of things have come out.   You are in a leadership position in your guild.   In a position such as this in a social heirarchy, people tend to want to 'curry favor' with those in leadership positions by engaging in conversations, picking their brains, offering advice, and doing things that benefit those people, hoping to receive some sort of return favor.  Not expressly demanding it, but just planting the seeds.  It's not a real mystery that someone in a leadership position in a successful guild who is VERY well equipped can find people to form an experience group with.   You are also knowledgeable, it seems to me a very good warrior, and play quite seriously.  You are matter of fact, and it makes people at ease to know that they can rely on someone who's both got a strong personality and sufficient knowledge to care for the details of engaging in combat in EQ.  <br />
<br />
The thing is, this really alters your perception of the overall game.  As a go-getter, you saw the solution to your issues as &quot;ok, screw it, I'll become better equipped, with great weaponry, and so on&quot; and saw to it that it happenned.   This is what many people do, and it helps, I dont' think anyone can deny that.   The thing is, you are unfortunately seeing others as *needing* or even having the fortitude to take it as seriously as you.<br />
<br />
The difference between you and I is, I see the fact that you equate your ability to generate aggro with &quot;necessary raiding steps&quot;, and I don't think that that is reasonable.   I think your 9900ish hp and Atk being almost capped and greatly increased DPS is the reward for your efforts, I don't believe for one moment that your ability to generate aggro should be linked with raiding, simply because it's not necessary with any other class in EQ to require raid level gear to perform their core function.<br />
<br />
Let's say for a minute that clerics got to buy a 3500hp &quot;complete heal&quot; spell at vendors at level 39 rather than CH the way that it is... let's also say that the spell &quot;complete heal&quot; was a drop from mobs the caliber of AoW or higher (Maybe I should say XTC or higher since he's easier than AoW).   On the other hand, let's say you had druids who get a 2950point &quot;complete heal&quot; which they could cruise on over to Shadowhaven and get for some plat.    Druids have all sorts of additional abilities, which make them remarkably attractive and powerful, while the cleric has his heals and buffs and that's about it.   This would be what I would call &quot;unbalanced&quot;.    Now, remember, in my little scenario, the spells dropped from certain mobs.<br />
<br />
Now, knowing what I know about you, you would figure out a way to ensure that your guild's clerics got those dropped spells, which would allow them to be what they have always had the potential of being, the best healer in EQ.   To me, it would be incredibly imbalanced, but let's say you got them the hard way.   My guess is that you would figure that if you could pull it off then everyone should be able to pull it off, and since the spell is available with a little extra effort, then it's clearly not an &quot;imbalance&quot; you just have to work harder to get it.<br />
<br />
The way I would view the cleric in this instance is *precisely* the way I see warriors and their aggro generation in PoP.    There's certainly tools to help you along the way (as long as those mobs are up) in EB weapons (yes, even I sport one EB weapon), even with EB, it's not necessarily the same, because there's still significant volatility with the warrior.   Now my Paladin friend over there was able to walk on over to Shadowhaven and pick up a copy of Cease and another copy of Desist for a few plat, and is able to significantly outaggro me for fairly minimal mana cost.  He only has to concern himself with the folowing:   Does he have an equipment level which meets the basic requirements for tanking PoP mobs?    The reality is that one can purchase fairly easily and cheaply in the bazaar an armor and accessory set which will ensure that this is possible.  A Paladin (Or SK for that matter) can be well enough equipped tank in PoP for the most part (excepting some nameds) without ever having gone on a raid.<br />
<br />
The Paladin and SK also have spellbooks for performing other secondary functions (i.e. Paladins carry more reserve hitpoints in their manabar and LoH button than a warrior has, and an SK has the ability to cast himself into a higher DPS bracket than a warrior does, while giving his party mana).   The secondary functions are what 'balances&quot; warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
Then you have aggro generation!   Knights essentially use spells outside of their design for this function (with the exception of SK's who have spells specifically designed for this function).  They are, in essence manipulating the spell code in EQ to being something to their party that the spells weren't necessarily designed for.  Kind of like my view of root parking being nearly an exploit to bypass a mob's hatelist, stun aggro is essentially performing the same function.   The real kicker is, stun aggro works quite well on spells that have no actual effect on mobs.  This is contrary to what I would consider to be &quot;good game design&quot;, and I would call this &quot;imbalanced&quot; that someone can use a spell interruption spell in a way that it wasn't intended to be used in order to perform a function that it was never supposed to perform.   Hate spells exist in EQ, they are the terris line, and EB.  Other spells which have the side effect of aggro to prevent OTHER classes from abusing them, aren't designed for hate, they're designed to fiull their role.   Adjusting the hate on those spells is anything BUT a &quot;nerf&quot;, it's effect would be to make it harder to generate aggro, but if the Paladins feel that they shoudl have a spell line which is for generating aggro, they should ask for it, not exploit aggro from stuns, etc.</div></div><hr />

Most of these things aren't things people should have to be told to do, these are just signs of a good player. No one should be trying to slow a mob before it reaches camp, sit down right after a slow, stand next to a rooted mob, and run around when a mob touches them. Those are not problems with the warrior class, those are game play issues for some of the people you are grouping with.&quot;<br />
<br />
i agree with this, totally. if someone does these things it's simple to carefully word a message to them about how they can change their methods.<br />
<br />
what did warriors do in kunark? velious?? this situation with nights holding aggro better has always existed. warriors hold aggro in exp groups just fine, and in raids there is no debate about aggro (at least any raid i do) if a knight gets aggro you go splat. harder hitting pop mobs just make it more evident when group members do stupid stuff.<br />

see, this is what i'm talking about. aveen jumps on the &quot;warriors need upgrades&quot; bandwagon. you aveen are a half elf female warrior, in the guild &quot;the syndicate&quot; you wield a twisted steel bastard sword (many droppable 2h or 1h combos are better aggro) and wear a pretty motley assortment of armor. i can even tell you who you're married to in game because your profile says it and i can tell you what the whole profile reads. <br />
<br />
i've grouped with you on several occasions before i got malos on my shaman, you held and got aggro just fine. i never took hardly any hits even after multiple slow ressists. all i did was stand next to you, cast malaisement (cheap on mana and usually all i need!) on inc. it hit just about as it gets to the group, then cast turgurs till it sticks, i stand beside you till i was sure i wasn't aggro then went and spear / sick dog / canni / jbb. i've grouped with warriors with frostbringers and other such gear and they've done fine.<br />
<br />
warrior taunt is perfectly sufficient as is, it's just lazy or unskilled people want the quick and unfailing aggro of a knight. let me preclude all who say i have no idea what i'm talking about before they speak. i have played every class post-60 at one time or another, and i have access to a number of warriors and other classes atm. who i do play on raids and in exp groups.<br />

besides the good post on this thread i see a lot of complaining, lot of arguing, some ranting, and even downright trash spewed with nothing but a lot of cursing. if you think there is a problem, offer solutions. <br />

i also think frodlin makes good arguments and at least trys to talk sensibly, and for that i applaud you. anyway, rather than debating it, i'm going to log on my pal, demem all my spells and tank awhile, and log in a few underequipped warriors i know and see how they do. i'm at least willing to look at your side of the argument. we'll see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

So in your opinion there is no problem at all. You have stated that numerous times. In my opinion there is a problem, and I don't think mudflating the game would be the correct solution. This is why I favor tuning down some of the guaranteed aggro knights posses today over inflating warriors.<br />

Cease and desist were put into the game to give Paladins a spell inturrupting ability prior to getting stun. They were not meant to provide aggro domination all the way to 65.</div></div><hr />

Honestly...could the game be any MORE mudflated? Youre killing gods now. You can eventually travel back in time... <br />
<br />
Does anyone else see the big giant brick wall in front of them? Who cares if mudflation occurs? SoE plans on releasing 2 more expansions, and with each expansion there is tons of mudflation. Why would letting warriors have some form of reliable snap aggro(that doesnt take 3 years to recycle), be so devastating to a game where the other two tank classes can infact do that already? <br />
<br />
Being a former early release Necro and getting pulvarized with the nerf bat many many times, Id hate to see anyone else get that too. A hybrids snap aggro can be very useful on mobs that split or have linked aggro. They can lock those down and be an integral part of a raids strategy. To lose that would hurt the game more than giving warriors a snap aggro ability. Dont nerf, just suck it up and raise the bar. The only people who would complain are the challenge freaks and those who like to wave their virtual penis in the air over the fact that they are old school and it was hard to level way back when.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with the notable exception of the (CASTABLE ON OTHERS) SK agro buffs, these spells are not put in the game to get agro.  the high agro associated with them is a bug, an exploit, an accident.<br />
<br />
See the funny thing is, despite what Mohammed al-Kathunk is saying about leaving knights out of the balance discussion (WHY?).. I actually agree with him on one thing - <br />
<br />
Groups who play stupidly (and yes, inviting a knight allows you to play stupidly) dont deserve to be rewarded, as they would if warriors could agro as well as knights.<br />
<br />
However, he fails to realize that nerfing knight agro would solve all these problems in a heartbeat.  Warriors would then be the best tanks, closely followed by knights, for exp groups AND raids.. as it should be.  and stupid groups would die a lot.. as they should.<br />
<br />
I find it endlessly ammusing that anyone could say &quot;since warriors can mitigate damage better than anyone else, they are balanced in their role as tanks&quot;.  Tanking is a combination of agro and mitigation.  Enchanters can out agro anyone in this game, hands down, if they want to.  Does this mean enchanters are balanced as the best tank in the game? of course not, since they only have one half of the equation.<br />
<br />
Sound familiar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what you guys fail to realize is warriors ARE THE BEST TANKS! Similar equiped war and kinghts unless we talking about really uber guilds will have an edge in HP by about 20 percent easy. Combine that with higher skill caps and damage output. and we are best tanks! Yes we dont have the best agro but we have what I've listed above! Also if you have a decent weapon combo you will be able to have all the above PLUS hold agro as well as kingts. Combo is not requiered its a bonus! Since as you keep pointing out most of the players out there are not high end for most part warrior is best tank. You are bitching about knight holding agro only because that is the only thing you see. Group with a kinght let them tank(similary equiped) and see how much healing they need. Then tank yourself you'll see a difference.<br />
<br />
Original poster was talking about gap between uber pal/war there the difference in hp is almost non existant warriors may have 7k hp ubuffed and 6500 for pal buffed percentage difference will be very low and by then both warriors and kinghts have maxed there tank AAs and will perform tanking very close to warrior on mobs that dont need discs. That I agree with.</div></div><hr />

Downside of nerfing knight classes to balance vs. warriors for exp grouping:<br />
-it's not very nice to ask for, for courtesy reasons<br />
-will impact high end raids negatively (i.e. makes CC problematic, could be why someone posting here dislikes this option perhaps?)<br />
-difficult to do &quot;fairly&quot;; nobody will ever agree on how much is enough.<br />
<br />
So, a &quot;solution&quot; that increased warrior desireability in EXP groups ONLY, that didn't negatively impact knights or benefit warriors on raids, seems to be the optimum solution.  Or am I missing something?<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. My personal favorite &quot;balance&quot; fix would be to make warriors hybrids- of bards.  I'd love to see every singing-only melee related song (i.e. no mana regen, charm, mez, eb, etc.) added for warriors.   Would definitely make up for the knight's mana pools, which destroy any conceivable hp or ac/mitigation advantage warriors have over them...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all tank, We do that all the time.<br />
<br />
What people are saying is that when it comes to finding a group, Why should a group have to settle for a warrior, when they can get a paladin and kill at a much higher rate. Sure we could all educate the masses on aggro control, but why do they need to learn if instead they can just get a paladin and do whatever they want? <br />
<br />
People follow the path of least resistance, guess what, a paladin holding aggro add-infinum with no ping-pong no worry is the easiest path.<br />
<br />
What people are saying is that in EXP situation, there needs to be something done to make warriors more attractive for groups. Be it a dramatic increase in tanking ability over other tanks, more dps, or better aggro control. Any of these can be done.<br />
<br />
What will probably be done? Nerf knights, is that desireable? not really,  but that is SOE's normal response when something like this occurs.</div></div><hr />

Disagreeing with that point is a simple waste of energy.<br />

Assuming verant ever tries to fix our agro problem in regards to knights, it will come in the form of a change to the agro that their spells cause, a change in the recast times of those spells, or a re-engineering of our taunt skill. <br />

So, maybe my view on the warrior abilities is tainted and I'm willing to accept that, but I still disagree with dragging another class into the problems we are having. I understand that you are saying that the hybrids are the problem, but I'm not so sure that is the true issue after reading people's post here. I get the feeling that they wish to have great aggression abilities like the SKs and Paladins, not have more tanks dragged down to their level. Even IF stuns cost more mana or take longer to cast this hybrid is going to STILL outagro a low tier warrior. It's not going to solve anything except to piss the hybrids off and once again we will be back to square one.<br />
<br />
I believe we should look at the warriors who don't have issues and the warriors who do. Compare them, find all of the differences (gear and play style) and then work up a realistic list of changes that we want for our class. Otherwise, SoE is going to nerf the hybrids some and then leave you alone, because you will be fixed then, right? Wrong. <br />
<br />
Lets say we have two candy companies who both supply a town with chocolate. Candy company A (the warriors) provide a good taste, but have nothing flashy to their wrapper, plus they can be costy at times (some warriors say they have aggression problems). Now we have Candy company B (the paladins) who provide the same taste as the Candy company A (the warriors), have lots of little flashy things on their cover (buffs, CC, heals), plus they are cheaper (as in they have fewer aggression problems) then the candy made by Candy store A (the warriors). <br />
<br />
Instead of Candy company A focusing on improving the quality of their taste, maybe adding some flashy things to their product, or working on making things cheaper for their customers they are plotting on how to ruin Candy company B. Lets say you do make the candy from Candy company B (The paladins) cost more, it will STILL be cheaper (as they will STILL hold aggression better then warriors) for customers to buy Candy company's B (paladins) product, plus they get more flashy stuff when they buy it. All your going to do is be left with Candy store B (the paladins) pissed off at us and Candy store A (the warriors) left in the EXACT same place they already are. People are NOT going to start running for warriors if we get paladins nerfed. People are creatures of habit, it would take years for those people who like paladins to switch to warriors as a choice of tank. <br />

Let's say for a minute that clerics got to buy a 3500hp &quot;complete heal&quot; spell at vendors at level 39 rather than CH the way that it is... let's also say that the spell &quot;complete heal&quot; was a drop from mobs the caliber of AoW or higher (Maybe I should say XTC or higher since he's easier than AoW).   On the other hand, let's say you had druids who get a 2950point &quot;complete heal&quot; which they could cruise on over to Shadowhaven and get for some plat.    Druids have all sorts of additional abilities, which make them remarkably attractive and powerful, while the cleric has his heals and buffs and that's about it.   This would be what I would call &quot;unbalanced&quot;.    Now, remember, in my little scenario, the spells dropped from certain mobs.<br />
<br />
Now, knowing what I know about you, you would figure out a way to ensure that your guild's clerics got those dropped spells, which would allow them to be what they have always had the potential of being, the best healer in EQ.   To me, it would be incredibly imbalanced, but let's say you got them the hard way.   My guess is that you would figure that if you could pull it off then everyone should be able to pull it off, and since the spell is available with a little extra effort, then it's clearly not an &quot;imbalance&quot; you just have to work harder to get it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is by far the most elegant summation I have read to this date that summarizes the problem of Enraging Blow items. And indeed the inane situation that has resulted in Planes of Power with warrior aggression. <br />

Yes I have a Blade of War, and yes I think it is ridiculous that every player in my class should be expected to acquire a weapon of its caliber to compete with hybrids effectively for an xp group position.</div></div><hr />

And doesn't that really kind of undermine the accomplishment as well?  Here I have helped slay one of the most powerful creatures in the world, nay, the very planes as well!  And I have been granted the boon of a weapon like no other as recognition of my mighty efforts!  But of course, every other Warrior in the game will now have to try and duplicate my accomplishment, just to be able to be half assed successful at their job.<br />

I imagine so.  No detrimental meaning was intended with regards to your accomplishment.  It's a significant one, worthy of respect.  And I'm sure the weapon lays down some serious hurt.  However, this should be something that rather than just making you pretty capable at holding aggro, should make you nearly godlike in holding aggro.  It is after all the best weapon in the game, currently.  Being merely capable should be for the rest of us who will never see something along these lines.  Yet we don't even get that, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Karthunk, no disrespect, but you and I will never see eye to eye.  You believe that as a Warrior you must either constantly educate your groupmates to work with your aggro control or you must join a raiding guild and go aquire weapons that allow you to do a reasonable job.<br />
<br />
I don't.  I believe that the class should be able to do it's core job without raiding being absolutely required, because it's not absolutely required for any other character class.  The very fact that people can say that the problem can be fixed by raiding proves that the problem exists, because raiding should always add additional strengths beyond the bare minimum, it shouldn't be required to reach the bare minimum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the Problem is Warrior Aggro has not kept pace with the requirements of the expansions, especially in relation to spell and range based aggro, how do we fix it?<br />
<br />
- nerfs are being talked about, and while I don't know many pallies that I actually like, I hate supporting nerfs on principle, but they are a possible solution<br />
<br />
- EB weapons keep being mentioned as a &quot;solution&quot;... do we ask for them to be made more readily available? i.e. have the equivalent of Sleepers prismatic farm for EB that aren't as good as a BOC? Start em at say 12/20 with lesser stats but having the proc? How common do we make them?<br />
<br />
- do we ask to get some other type of new aggro generating ability? New AAs? (Will AAs help those who are currently struggling?)<br />
<br />
- do we ask for taunt to be 100% effective? with a reduced timer like 10 sec instead of 6?<br />
<br />
I think we have honestly beat the issue to death... we need real possible solutions to offer. Lets see the ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(1)  Give a warrior the ability to permanently shield a party from 20% of all melee damage.  That way even when a warrior doesn't have aggro they provide a tangible benefit to the party and make people &quot;feel&quot; safer.<br />
(2)  Give a warrior the ability to boost attack, AC, Haste through abilities similar to bard songs<br />
(3)  Give a warrior the ability to do different types of melee damage that will give them a situational DPS advantage.  For instance, perhaps a warrior can get a damage bonus when fighting certain types of creatures.<br />
<br />
Suggestions like these do not really break the current raid game, but add some good advantages to warriors in xp groups.  Would a cleric putting together a group choose a warrior or a paladin if the warrior automatically intercepted 20% of melee damage to the party?  How about if the warrior could make significantly better DPS for the party?  Or if the warrior could do significantly better dps than the knight?<br />
<br />
It would all come down to the kind of party the organizer wanted to put together, and would make all tanks equally viable and useful in the xp game.</div></div><hr />

:) I am starting to like these kind of suggestions more and more.  This is game afterall and games are suppose to be fun :)  <br />
<br />
If I have some abilities that either help or at least make the game more enjoyable for groups then I will be wanted more in groups.

I have a long post above about why I don't believe this unbalances anything.<br />
<br />
Give warrior an ability on the same timer as kick/bash that adds equivalent agro to a stun, or is acctually an instant cast manaless stun, using a button rather than a spell (which can be done, the origonal BL warder anyone?).  Paladins would have more stuns and be better still.  This would also lower warrior DPS in (I would imagine) a similar way to how knight DPS is lowered by stunning to keep agro.  This could be added to the class at level 1 or 9 (paladins can stun at 9).<br />
<br />
Add a stun proc that goes off 100% on kicks, with all normal stun abilities/limitations (resists, etc), leave the special warrior stun in place as it is.  (reason i'm harping on stun is then everyone would KNOW it was giving us the same agro as a paladin casting stun, and then I don't need to take guesses as how much agro stun adds numerically).  This could be added again at level 1 or 9.<br />
<br />
All three of this ideas i would enjoy.<br />
<br />
Gear is not a solution, unless they are good weapons, that only cost us a couple plat to buy (like the spells for knights)... and having every warrior that couldn't raid for better being forced to use one of 5 or 8 &quot;bandaid weapons&quot; if they want agro really does not appeal to me.<br />
<br />
New AAs are also not a way to balance a class against something that is far easier to get (several platnium at level 9, or level 50+ and a few hours farming AA?  not very fair).<br />
<br />
my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

I think I do a decent job at tanking and aggro control.  I also think that the Knights have such an easy time that it's imbalanced.  For practically very little mana (inifinate with KEI), they can hold aggro throughout the fight with no problem at all.  Hell, if there is a knight in the group I sometimes ask them to tank.<br />
<br />
It depends on the folks you group with.  I was with a crazy rogue that was double backstabbing and geting crits for 800+.  Low and behold I had a hard time keeping aggro on myself.  My GoT didnt proc as often as I liked, even with boon on.  When I did proc fairly often, mob stuck to me and rogue did his job.  Thing was dead in no time.<br />
<br />
Substitute a knight in my place, and they wouldve gotten that same result again and again.  [Rogue wouldnt have the sneak either] That wouldve increased their mob kills and thus exp gained.  Hell I wouldve pick a knight over me.<br />
<br />
VI can either nerf the knights for their relative ease in gaining innital aggro and holding it thru out the fight, or increase our ability to produce aggro.  I for one am against nerfs in general.<br />

Level 55 - range increased to 20 feet over normal range<br />
Level 65 - range increased to 30 feet over normal range<br />
<br />
Double taunt -<br />
At the start of level 60 the warrior has a chance to taunt twice in a row instantly when he presses his taunt key. At level 60 the percet is 10 and will increase by 10 percent per level, so that at level 65 a warrior would have a 50 percent chance to have a double taunt.<br />

Increase the amount of lure proc weapons for warriors in the game -<br />
Of course they don't have to be of the same level as the proc enraging blow. Also if this is done they would need to be made no drop.<br />

<br />
MB would still be unnerfed, mages would still be providing endless mana rods (and hating it...), Necros would still be going afk and coming back with 10 aaxp points, enchanters would still be locking down every single loot dropping mob in the planes for their own personal profit, Bards would still be simultaneously killing every single mob in HoH, monks would still be out tanking the average warrior, etc.<br />
<br />
In a general sense, what you are saying makes sense.<br />
<br />
In this particular case, we are talking about an accidental ability which is really screwing up the game.  I think sometimes, you ahve to be willing to sacrifice some politics for game balance.<br />
<br />
And its really not difficult... make these spells have almost no agro.  Its been *done before*, even.  SO i know its an easy coding problem.<br />
<br />
And if, in fact, warriors dont ahve agrop issues, as you contend... well then knights wont either, since they have access to all the same tools except AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, sorry for bumping this those that already read it :)<br />
<br />
The only way mana cost vs. aggression would provide a big  enough trade off that people might take a warrior over a knight is if the knights had to take a long mana break between, say, each second or third mob - that's a massive change and would also quite possibly tip the balance too far the other way.<br />
<br />
Such a fix doesn't address the central issue in the balance arguement. To my mind (and to reiterate it again, sorry :) ) the issue is that  Taunt skill, EB and/or any other aggro proc weapon doesn't give you aggro AT WILL whereas Paladin/SK spells (including those of the correct level) DO. So long as this difference remains as pronounced as it does warriors will remain third choice to tank. <br />
<br />
Many people turn around and say AE taunt is the cure but a 15 minute timer (along with all the other issues with taunt) makes for a very partial fix in comparison to the overall aggro-at-range utility of a knights spells. Digressing for a sec I would also argue  that AA skills (if things were done right) shouldn't be 'required' to make a  class able to function - they should be little extra's to make you better, above and beyond your base utility (so yeah rangers/rogues get the short end of the stick too but at least they have additional innate class skills that make them stand out).<br />
<br />
Spells for knights are relatively easy to obtain and can generally be considered as part of their basic class make up.<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly fine with knights using level 9 spells to increase aggro SO LONG AS  I can compete on a relatively level playingfield just using my own basic class skills and abilities (not AA's or EB weapons).<br />
<br />
That obviously isn't the case, thus the situation can be considered  unbalanced.<br />
<br />
If we cannot adjust spell aggro to more appropriate levels of 'tauntability' then there needs to be something available to warriors as a basic core ability that will offset his lack of aggro management in the minds of a group - to be honest though so long as a knight can readily dictate who the mob hits with as much ease as he does at this time i think that may be very difficult. <br />
<br />
This last is the true rationale behind a knight 'nerf', not penis envy, nor any desire on mine or most warriors parts to put the boot in to our knight friends....<br />

<br />
Thinking about it, if we had &quot;chants&quot; (in the style of diablo2 paladin) which were instant cast manaless songs, uninterruptable even by stun (edit:fixed a typo here), but did not last longer then they were &quot;on&quot; (no twisting).<br />

Have, AC, HP, damageshield, pulsing rune, I donno, some fun stuff that would be useful for groups, maybe haste, small regen, just something.<br />
<br />
that'd be really cool, though I am sure that some warriors would not like this idea.  But the more I think about it the more fun it sounds, especially if they allowed us to solo even a tiny bit against light blues w/o specific nice gear.<br />
<br />
maybe 8 different chants, or some such, get them free from a vendor, and they just scale with level from 1 to 65, mem time really low, or make them buttons (like disc, but you turn them on / off, only one on at a time, no refresh).<br />
<br />
hrm.<br />
<br />
anyway, i'd like that, i'm sure plenty of others wouldn't... nice ideas though Ainmer =).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the compliment, and I think I'm understanding your positon, which is essentially that if you have an aim of getting one class's value to a given point, and you have identified the point as (insert other class's total value here), the way to even out those points is not to make the one have equivalent value if by giving that class the additonal value, you remove aspects which are important to many members of said class (i.e. the challenge of the game), nor is it to take members of the target class and bring them down to your level, but to introduce added and unique value which the competitive class cannot account for.<br />
<br />
I hate to be all philosophical and stuff, but I think that we're getting pretty deep into the core values of warriors here, and we have to.   <br />
<br />
I can see a lot of validity in that philosophy, and wouldn't be too quick to discount it, particularly in light of Ainmer's suggestions, which seem to me to be really good.   <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I believe that in finality we absolutely *must* do a comparison against those who's primary role in experience groups is to tank (i.e. Paladins and to a lesser degree, shadowknights) in order to discern balance, because it is the &quot;tanking&quot; group slot which is the one that we are competing for.   <br />
<br />
I think that if I had my way, the chips would fall like this:<br />
<br />
- Warriors would be clearly and unquestionably better in the areas of defensive melee and offensive melee than either of their counterparts, and this would be a 'class advantage', not a 'gear advantage' (i.e. I fail to see the equity in the fact that while I'm a significantly better tank than many warriors, paladins, and SK's here, so also are many of my guildmate Paladins and SK's significantly better at tanking i.e. melee defense and offense than many warriors here, and I find that to be unfair).    <br />
<br />
- Knights, since they are designed around versatility and customization would be granted things that are quite unique to them to make them attractive, PARTICULARLY in a non-tanking environment.   One of the biggest issues that knights have is that they have few real options of group desirability outside of tanking.  It would seem to me that people with spellbooks are far easier to customize than plain ol melee people.   They should be perfectly adequate in terms of tanking (i.e. it should be sacrelige to say &quot;we must wait on a warrior to complete this group before we can move on) but their real strengths should be in roles which are non-tanking.  Currently they're not.   Let me give a couple of examples.<br />
<br />
1. There are many self only and group buffs out there, but there currently aren't any which are castable ONLY on others and not onesself.   I can think of a few that would be phenominal, such as a SK spell which imbues a hate proc similar to call of fire, yet must be targeted.   The clear benefit of something like this would be those groups who had shadowknights and warriors working together.  How about a cast spell which must work *through* someone (i.e. a group AC tap which when cast upon a group member would have that group member cast a recourse spell onto their target, crediting the group member who has it cast upon them with the aggression from that spell).    Something like this would *increase* desirability on both groups AND raids, and wouldn't cause a warrior to be changed one iota.   <br />
<br />
2. Paladins have many defensive buffs, why not one that's castable on others but not themselves which enchances defensive performance?   Why not be able to call upon your god to use an instrument of your choosing by which to smite your opponents via stuns or whatever, again being able to benefit the party or raid without replacing someone?<br />
<br />
A situation like this ADDS value to BOTH parties, and ENCOURAGES working together and discourages working separately.  There's a gazillion different combinations of these, and I'd be more than happy to be left *exactly the same* only more effective when grouped with a Knight than without one, increasing his or her value and mine simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

It's been pointed out again and again that in the current game the tanking gap has been reduced and indeed POP mobs knock off hp's so fast that I wonder if even a 1000 hp difference is THAT noticeable in normal group play....so could knights not make the grade as tank without garanteed aggro?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another solution:<br />
<br />
Special taunts!<br />
<br />
You know how a couple of different melee classes can kick right? Warriors, Beastlords, Rangers and monks.<br />
<br />
But only monks get special attacks that are superior to kick.<br />
<br />
Do the same with taunt.<br />
<br />
Give Warriors a LINE of special taunts as they level up that are superior to your bargain basement, plain vanilla taunt that Warriors, SKs, Paladins and Rangers are get.<br />
<br />
Call them Taunt, Insult, Instigate, Below the Belt and Jo Mamma!<br />
<br />
The superior taunts can either add hate/aggro of a certain amount with each increased level, giving the warrior the ability to manually increase their aggro without having to rely on procs. Say, 15 points at the first one ... 25 points, 40 points and 50 points at the top level.<br />
<br />
OR, each superior taunt increases the chance of successful taunt at the higher levels, capping out at something like 80 to 100 percent at the highest level.<br />
<br />
Or a combination of both.<br />
<br />
This idea has been offered many times before.<br />
<br />
It may need some polish to do this properly and balanced and make it a reality on LIVE servers.<br />
<br />
However, it's a sound idea. And a very good step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
If there were actually some feedback/communication/responsiveness from SOE on the topic, there might actually be some hope.<br />
<br />
I've seen  a ton of great ideas offered (not just the above one, which btw, I wasn't the first to suggest, it's just the one I liked best, and I was the one who started comparing it to monk kicks, giving it an actual basis for implementing it, since, well monks are pure melee, warriors are pure melee, it would make a lot of SENSE to give warriors an special set of abilities or power boosts in the area that is their job, just at it made perfect sense to let monks kick better than other classes). <br />
<br />
So basically what we have here is a lot of warriors see a problem.<br />
<br />
MANY warriors have offered solutions to this problem.<br />
<br />
And that's where we've been stuck at for quite some time, even on the old message board.<br />
<br />
SOE barely even replies to direct questions at fan faires about the issue.<br />
<br />
It's kind of sad really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
perhaps make warriors taunt refresh faster, or add a new skill that adds a small amount of hate, or make a warrior's taunt skill refresh faster and add a small amount of hate (not sure what would be acceptable). only problem is it would need to be carefully balanced.<br />
<br />
maybe make taunt refresh faster, and add some hate, but only add the hate if someone is higher than you on aggro?  perhaps also looking at the success rate of taunt too. it definetly should not be no fail though.<br />
<br />
i'm sure you guys can do better than my ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 To address the problem without hurting pal/sk , i think warriors need to have a slightly larger edge in tanking ability , nothing drastic but enough to offset the aggro capabilities of the other plate classes. It should really be a hard decision on who you want in your group , as it stands it really isnt (for exp'ing anyways) since the paly/sk are roughly 90% the tanks we are but are infinitly better at attaining/sustaining aggro.<br />
<br />
 One angle i thing they could take its similar to what they did with monks. Monks are damage dealers , and even a NAKED monk can hand out a good deal of damage (haha punny) . I think even very average warriors should be better tanks then well equiped pal/sk , just as average monks/rogues still outdamage warriors.<br />

I think most of us can agree that warriors currently have the edge on these categories.  In cases where they don't it is a matter of itemization that brings Pallys and SKs close to us, and I don't see SoE changing that at this late date.  <br />
<br />
The obvious solution is a change in the taunt button.  I like a lot of the ideas that have been previously posted about this.  100% guaranteed taunt is an interesting idea, but I wonder what this will do to the challenge of the game sometimes.  I tend to disagree with anything that is a &quot;guaranteed&quot; aggro generator, and this includes hybrid spells.  This only tends to make players lazy and would probably make the game boring in some respects.  Instead of these lazy leveling groups selecting pallys over warriors they will instead have two classes to choose from to support their lazy behavior.  I'm not sure that the idea is actually an improvement.  It only allows us to have an equal shot at finding a group, it does not improve the game.  <br />
<br />
I would however be for the idea of our taunt button either improving in percentages as we level or special taunt abilities likened to monk's kicks.  This would improve our aggro generating abilities and still give us a sense of pride that we actually worked for it =)</div></div><hr />

easy to code, if they can code required/recommedned levels and changing stats, this is just 2 lines of added code in a warriors ability...<br />

At the start of level 60 the warrior has a chance to taunt twice in a row instantly when he presses his taunt key. At level 60 the percet is 10 and will increase by 10 percent per level, so that at level 65 a warrior would have a 50 percent chance to have a double taunt.<br />

level 55 - 10 percent bonus (900 hp buff would give 990hps)<br />

<br />
<br />
Karthunk, I have to say these are actually the ideas I agree with most, very good ideas.  I also like the idea of us being able to imbue ourselves with a hate based proc.  Not quite as good as enraging blow, maybe taunting blow level?  As long as we could control when it was on us, I think that would be good, since it would allow warriors to use a larger range of weapons instead of everyone using the exact same weapons.<br />
<br />
As for their aggro being an exploit, technically, yes, but I think with the addition of SK pure hate spells SOE has decided that they want knights to have the snap aggro.  Reminds me of another exploit actually, AEtaunt being used for guaranteed aggro on a single mob instead of for an area effect taunt.  Also, FD being used for pulling, isn't what it was originally meant for.  Times change, things that were originally exploits become accepted practice, and even become their new purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things I would like to explain - as a mage, I  depend totally  on the aggro of the main tank as by far my limit to do DPS, since I lack concussion and any way to reduce my aggro.<br />
<br />
I believe there is an imbalance between warriors who miss all their DPS AA's and Paladin/SK's with the same gear in the aggro department.  I believe warrior taunt is balanced and perfectly workable with as long as the warrior has some pretty common aggro weapons - and no I don't mean EB items, just something like a willsapper is fantastic, and its very easy to get with 6 non uber people.<br />
<br />
I also believe that the truly top end warriors, have virtually the same aggro capabilities as Paladin/SK's, because although they don't have any fast refreshing 'snap' aggro ability, they build hate at such an astonishing rate that they tend to always draw back aggro nigh instantly on a failed taunt.  I *DO* NOT believe that it should be required for warriors to require 300 aa's and a very rare dropping item in order to be that good at snap aggro - I am just stating why warriors at the very high end don't see it as a problem.<br />
<br />
For example - we were doing Chaoswind with 6 friends, and I was of course recklessly nuking, with a good warrior friend tanking, who is probably the number 1 or 2 tank on the server.  I got particularly careless while talking with my room-mate that I nuked non stop a good a minute with sun-vortex chained with firebolt of tallon (pre insta click nerf) and I of course ended up summon, warrior taunted, taunt failed, I ate one round, then the warrior immediately regained aggro without using AE taunt before Chaoswind got a chance to hit me a second time.<br />
<br />
I fully believe that a max aa's and fully geared level 65 warrior is a total machine, both in the tanking, DPS and aggro generation department, and the gap between such a warrior and a 'vanilla' 65 warrior is fairly wide.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER - it is entirely possible with very minor adjustments by just being sensible to let any class tank - and as long as the main tank is a warrior with good gear, its very rare that unless someone acts as a total retard the warrior loses aggro - and I realize this myself, that every time I pull aggro from a warrior in group its because I slack off, assuming the pull rate is good.<br />
<br />
I also feel that the advantages that warrior have over knights are a bit understated as well - our top warrior has around 6000 hp's, and our top hybrid has 4500 or so.  Disciplines in groups are absolutely fantastic as long as you aren't just sitting in valor single pulling razofiends.  While a warrior needs UBER gear to hold aggro nearly as a well as a paladin, a paladin needs INCREDIBLY uber gear to tank nearly as well as a warrior.<br />
<br />
You don't believe me?  Try doing random wing named in BoT with a vanilla level 65 paladin - its possibly, although VERY VERY hard, and forget even using CH, you better have a cleric with a very high mana pool spamming SL or get lucky and hope slow lands.  Wanna try a tower boss with 6 people?  Heh good luck doing it with an Knight tanking, while with a warrior its very easy and fun.<br />
<br />
I don't believe classes are balanced, and I do believe that the aggro generation gap is way too big, expecially between non uber warriors and non uber paladins, and it should be adressed, but blaming taunt differences for inability to gain groups is just refusing to face reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just looked over the Magelo profiles of my guild, unfortunately two of our paladins haven't updated theirs, and since we play on an item loot server some people specifically asked not to have their magelo linked on a public board - but here are the numbers:<br />
<br />
Thumblin - officer in guild and by far our best geared knight has 4428 HP's.<br />
<br />
Ulrick - has 3400 hp's, but he hasn't maxed his HP aa's.<br />
<br />
Both are level 65 - with about 70 aa's, primal etch, and the rest of our knights average out at around 3600 HP's or so.<br />
<br />
Our LOWEST hp warrior has 4900 hp's - and is level 61 without most of her AA's maxed - our top warrior has 5960 hp's or so.<br />
<br />
Now - this gives you an idea of the relative strength of our guild, and I can say that while it is possible to do mini-bosses with Thumblin tanking, I *CANNOT* use CH when healing him, and its not a sure affair at all.  On the other hand - our level 61 warrior tanks them and hardly breaks a sweat, defensive is just amazing.  On a ft 15 cleric with every mana regen buff you can think off- I was down to 15 mana by the time to boss had died just spamming SL.<br />
<br />
Thumblin with FULL raid buffs is barely above of 7000 hp's - and he is not a vanilla level 65 paladin at all - at least as far as Rallos Zek goes - he is probably in the top 5 geared knights in non elemental guilds on our server - by contrast our worst geared warrior tanks much much better than our best geared paladin.</div></div><hr />

It's entirely true, vs. those minis, I'm a drastically superior tank, I take less mana, and the fight is safer.   <br />
<br />
No one exp's off of those minis.  Yes, exp groups kill them, but they're not &quot;experience mobs&quot;, they're &quot;loot mobs&quot;.    Clearly, if you want the best tanking situation in BoT considering those minis and tower bosses, the answer is this:<br />
<br />
- Tank experience mobs with Paladin for solid aggro control<br />
<br />
- Every 6 hours when a mini pops, log on the warrior, tank him and log off and return to Paladin tanking.<br />
<br />
That's the best way to tank there.    I'm sorry but being able to tank something better once in a while, or raid level mobs is NOT the payoff for losing out in the area of grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you - but my point is that if people wish to use the argument I don't get groups because my taunt sucks (which is a fallacy imho - you don't get groups because you aren't proactive) then the flipside is that you get groups because its quite possible to kill lucrative mobs with a warrior in group - which is very difficult to do with a paladin.  I think you'll admit though that one of the main incentives people have to group in BoT is the ornate drops from the minibosses, and the good amount of spectrals.<br />
<br />
The argument isn't just mini-bosses either, evasive helps a ton on mobs with very harsh procs like Kriegers who are fairly MR and take a while to slow if you don't have full debuffs.<br />
<br />
Personally, I feel there is a mild imbalance in taunt, expecially in bad groups where nobody tries helping the warrior out, because even in a shitty group where everyone tries their darnest to steal aggro, a knight will mantain lock from the start, but warriors offer various other advantages, that don't QUITE compensate for that much aggro (which is mostly not necessary with a well behaved group).<br />
<br />
I am agreeing with you Froidlin, I just believe that people who blame losing groups to SK/Paladins are delusional - and that disciplines and the superior mitigation/hp's come into play more often than warriors are willing to admit (and less than paladins would have you believe though;p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't read everything obviously cause I mean, there is a limit at what a sane human mind can take but there is a small comment.<br />
<br />
I tend to think that paladin might get aggro too easily, especially compared to the difference in tanking but that's my only real gripe about the issue.  Especially lately with the retarded mob that quad for 3500 with tripple the hp of before, you can be certain that tank transition have become more common since it's not really possible to tank without defensive for any lenght of time.<br />
<br />
My experience in xp group is simple thought.  If group is mana &quot;bound&quot; toward the healers, then the group kinda suck, and having a paladin to help heals is probably better, as having a shaman/druid too.  Assuming the group doesn't suck, can pull alot of stuff and is not mana bound toward the healers specifically, it then become a factor of how quick you can kill the mob.  (And if the group is &quot;pull&quot; bound or &quot;mana&quot; bound or whatever then the group probably suck and the problem is greater then what we are talking about here).<br />
<br />
The equation is then very simple.  Warrior and knights can tank the mob, but warrior dps &gt; knights (sk are much closer but need to use pets and they also have group buffs that help everyone include warriors too).  The dps difference can go from 25% up to 50% for very high end in my findings (with warriors doing 160-170dps).<br />
<br />
The dps difference is a very important element for all the class balance discussion that most people seem to forget.  The only time it doesn't &quot;matter&quot; is on raid with 1 MT out of 50 persons.  But that's also where warrior have to tank mob that quad for 3500 with defensive.  If you ever mention that knights have heals/easy aggro, etc, then you have to mention that warriors do more dps, and ultimatly dps is the thing that make monster die, not more healing, the very essence of a game like everquest.  I could quote tons of casters that say they don't have a problem spending mana when warriors are tanking so I don't see how this can be an argument.  Saying casters have to hold back on nuke is basically saying they can't nuke more then what they mana regen, something completly stupid whoever you look at it unless the pulls are done once every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Basically, don't forget dps (and maybe some didn't I did not read the 19 pages) if any serious class balance discussion or it won't be a really serious discussion anymore.<br />

<br />
Here's my argument in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
- Warriors and Paladins perform different tasks on raids, and yes, Paladins have DEFINITE raid roles, I'd take it a bit further and say that if you had 5 Paladins and 5 warriors on a raid, 5 Paladins would have a definite contributory role and one warrior would.  The &quot;raid role&quot; argument is nonsense, EXCEPT from SK's, who don't have much of a big raid role.<br />
<br />
- Warriors and Knights do NOT have the same value in an experience group.   For the tanking of experience giving mobs, which is in essence what Warriors and Paladins do for the most part, and Sk's do well plenty, but also have the added dimension of &quot;hate manager&quot;.    <br />
<br />
This is imbalanced, period, regardless of what the ramifications are.  If two players of the same role have different values, then they're imbalanced.<br />
<br />
Now, I also agree that more passive people will need to look for other reasons that they can't find groups if it's adjusted, but as it stands, warriors ARE losing groups to Knights because of a competitive imbalance.</div></div><hr />

I personally dont think anything needs fixing, well maybe fix duel weild so thats its atleast up to par with 2hander damage. I will agree the lines between a war and a knight is getting more blurred with better gear and more progress into ele planes or time. I as a warrior want to see us do more dps and some unique aa's that are actually half decent instead of another taunt button fix.  Knights always had better taunt they just never had the gear or dps as a war - with luclin and more so pop they are closing in and maybe some wars feel threaten by this, but if you a skilled player it really don't matter.  This is all IMO don't bust a nut over my comments, it just jibber jabber.<br />

Oh god, and I have read everything...oh well, who needs sanity.<br />

No one exp's off of those minis. Yes, exp groups kill them, but they're not &quot;experience mobs&quot;, they're &quot;loot mobs&quot;. Clearly, if you want the best tanking situation in BoT considering those minis and tower bosses, the answer is this:<br />
<br />
- Tank experience mobs with Paladin for solid aggro control<br />
<br />
- Every 6 hours when a mini pops, log on the warrior, tank him and log off and return to Paladin tanking.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I wish there could find a way to balance things such that the answer to that was:<br />
<br />
-have both a pally and a warrior in group.<br />
<br />
Not sure exactly how to make that happen, but I think that would be an awesome solution.  Find ways to make carrying 2 tanks desirable.  Knights and Warriors get groups faster(YAY!), and you are covered for both situations.  I do know that I have had a few groups where there was a knight in group also, and, generally, those groups went very well, using agro stacking to get past slow, a little extra safety(in case healer say lags out and misses a heal, the other tank can jump in).  Hell, sometimes it is nice just being a DPS person too.  So much less work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no way on this green earth that you could get away with a nerf of that proportion. To be honest I dont even what something like that, I just want to be able to hold aggro just as well as they can.<br />
<br />
what you guys fail to realize is warriors ARE THE BEST TANKS! Similar equiped war and kinghts unless we talking about really uber guilds will have an edge in HP by about 20 percent easy. Combine that with higher skill caps and damage output. and we are best tanks!<br />
<br />
No, no we are not. Lets make up some numbers here.<br />
<br />
Tanking Ranking<br />
100 Warrior<br />
95 SK<br />
95 Pally<br />
-20 Cleric<br />
-10 Shammy<br />
-30 Chanter<br />
<br />
So with a Pally or SK you have a 95 tanking ability all the time, period.<br />
<br />
With a warrior tanking sure you can have 100 tanking ability but as soon as you lose your aggro you can watch the mob ping pong between casters and be at something as low as a 40 tanking level.<br />
<br />
Now mind you that those are all BS and imaginary numbers but none the less it is a way to look at the whole picture.<br />
<br />
Sure I can keep aggro 99% of the time it is the 1% that gets someone killed</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if it would be possible to reward xp groups for &quot;going the extra mile&quot; to make it work with a warrior.<br />
<br />
How about, say, a  5% bonus to all experience earned in groups of size 2 or more with a warrior in it.</div></div><hr />
