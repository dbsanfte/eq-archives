<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...to do a little experiment.  The fucking raiders in this crowd keep saying that GoD has the single groupable content to get quality gear and keep people happy.<br />
<br />
Now, I direct this thread, in particular to 2 people.  First is Zotha, for posting this mangelo.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587<br />
<br />
And to Frodlin, who has complete faith in my gaming abilities.  Is this magelo accurate, and is this stuff single groupable for people OF MY CURRENT GEAR LEVEL?  I encourage any other input into these items from anyone else as well.<br />
<br />
Here are the stipulations to this.  <br />
<br />
1) I need to be able to take this shit down with SOME group.  My normal play group is currently Warrior (me), Shaman (me), Druid (Bourbon), Rogue (Homicydall), Warrior (Rasco).  We have the capibility to add any 6th we see fit, or rotate and exchange players at random.  We can substitute in an Enchanter, Cleric, or probably a bard if need be. No, I will not be rerolling a fucking paladin.  This is Haass, and always will be.<br />
<br />
2) This is Haass, as I left him in Februrary or whenever the fuck I quit -- http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48986<br />
<br />
Here is my Shammy -- http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71943<br />
<br />
Here is the DPS man --<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=530330<br />
<br />
Here's the 2nd warrior/offtank --<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=442735<br />
<br />
Here's the little bastard that's kept me alive for 65 levels and a ridiculous amount of AA's (he's been somewhat cannabalized in my abscense I see :)) --<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1075448<br />
<br />
Assume that other characters that we need to rotate in will be similarly equipped and AA'd.<br />
<br />
3) Depending on how this thread turns out, and what the best Magelo that we can come up with for single groupable shit (NON FUCKING RAIDING, NON FUCKING WEEKLONG GODDAMNED SPAWN SHIT), I may be enticed to reactivate my accounts and start working at it.  My SoD/Hammer will likely be anger augmented shortly thereafter, and my bank account will be plentiful, like it always was.  We will also be doing minor gearing up/aa'ing to make up for the prolonged abscence from the game.  I can use the farming cash anyway.<br />
<br />
4) The goal of this is to determine if in fact, this stuff is achievable for a hardcore non raider.  I'm as fucking hardcore as they come, and always have been.  I know how to play, the guys I play with know how to play, and we've been doing shit that I've seen entire guilds wipe to for as long as I can remember.  If it CAN be done, it WILL be done.  I'm not into grinding out a full new suit of 1492 armor from LDoN, i'm into challenging content that everyone says is provided in GoD, but is basically being locked away from non raiders due to HP and LFG concerns.  I am NOT looking for spoilers, strats, etc.  I'm looking for all this content that some people claim exists.  If it does exist, then I shall conquer it.  I'm actually willing to give this a shot if this is 1 groupable for a warrior that needs the gear, rather than what Time guilds are doing in their off hours.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to put my opinion of the game on the table here and I'm allowing YOU to convince me that this game is worth playing, and that I can accomplish what you say I can.  Prove your case to me, and, if a couple other situations work out with RL shit, then I'll come back and prove it's possible, and that all the people bitching about this, are in fact, not working hard enough.  I'm giving you an oppurtunity to prove your point, go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cool. Let me know how it turns out, sounds very interesting and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haass. Your magelo is like mine. I'm not in a guild and roll with my wife's 63 shaman and good friends 145aa cleric. We successfully tear up all the open GoD zones (ferubi and barindu for the Rhylolite Earring of thralldom and Mantle of Feriouciousness), Riwwi (Chest, maybe some others), and the Sewers (Taelosian RuneBranded Girdle, Turepta Spine Ring, Pitted Vambraces). We've gone to vxed, and gotten beat down but survived. After I finish my defensive AA we'll be going back (with better pickups too), and I expect to be able to get the Vxed drops (Chanting stone mask, Burnished antique greaves) from that profile.<br />
<br />
Bracer of the heartstriker is from tipt, and I'm confident that we'll be able to beat tipt when I've gotten the rest of the uprades possible, but it's going to be fucking rough. I've tried it a couple times now, and I can be kept alive on the trash, but EVERYBODY has to be ON THE BALL the whole time, we get wiped due to adds usually.<br />
<br />
The weapons on that profile suck ass. You'd be better off with the wailing coral greastaff from sewers 1 IMO. Or just go get a GBoS from eindride in BoT.<br />
<br />
That being said, most of those are extremely rare drops. I've farmed ferubi for several 4-hour sessions and seen no mantles. Ditto on the taelosian runed girdle. I do have the turepta spine ring. Whether or not the amount of farming time necessary to get them is comparable to the amount of time needed to get roughly equivalent pieces in a raid guild is something I don't know.<br />
<br />
My gripe with GoD is the lack of High AC visible slot pieces. Really, the lack of AC in general, since AC is whats needed to survive in GoD as a tank. You'll note that that dream profile has 1404 unbuffed AC, including a piece from jhiru, which people seem to think you should have 2k ac to tank. I will have 1400 ac (but &gt;1k less hp) just by getting the 10ac augs from ldon and a loyalist shield, but that nowhere near enough to tank tipt according to most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1072786<br />
<br />
As with anything, you and your groupmates have to babystep up to it.... via ldon you gotta gear for trials 1-4.  Nice loot and augments drop in these sewers which can further boost you into trials 5-6.  These trials have even more loot + hp and ac augments.  These, coupled with Ldon, Hard-Ldon, and ferubi/natimbi augments can help you to be successful in KT.  Gear from KT and augments therein can help you to be successful in yet more single groupable Ikky instances.<br />
<br />
If youre asking is it possible to simply jump into this stuff with under 6k unbuffed .. then the answer is no you cant.  This game is about cumulative small upgrades eventually allowing you to unlock even more upgrades and so on and so forth.  Unless you've taken the time to gear up in prior content, then no you probably wont be ok in a lot of this GoD stuff.  As it stands, trial trash will rip you to pieces without a strong equally geared for the encounter cleric at your side pumping away, as i dont think that druid will do much good against trash mobs who quad for over 1k.<br />
<br />
Your entire group of friends needs to be geared for the encounter ... at the moment no, youre not geared for everything GoD has to offer, but there are quite a few upgrades in that magelo that you can get now quite easily.<br />
<br />
I just noticed you have no GoD aas ... grind out 60aa and voila ... you now have fully half a thousand more hps to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Apolyon, that magelo has hundreds of hours of LDoN required. Could ya look for another path, even if not quite as good?<br />
<br />
  Haass, are you looking for advice on items to camp/buy to help you get geared for GoD or no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look at my magelo if you want suggestions.  I've a total of 10k ldon points earned, and all of it spent on 40hp/10ac/anger3 augments.<br />
<br />
The majority of my strength still stems from LDoN .. but not from hours of tireless point grinding.  Check out all the Hard LDoN droppables and nodrops i've farmed.  This, more than anything, helped to open up GoD trials 1-6 and pave my way into KT.  putting 80-100hps in all your offslots does wonders ... a smattering of ornate gear to patch in the holes fills the gaps quite nicely and makes one a formidable tank.<br />
<br />
I've done it without buying any Takish plate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haass, are you looking for advice on items to camp/buy to help you get geared for GoD or no?<br />
<br />
Well, that depends.  Do I need to gear up for GoD? I don't know, and I can't honestly answer that question myself.  I would guess that I would get a wide array of answers, and from those, I'll decide if I need to or not.  Even without anger augments, I've already got rocking aggro, so I'm not concerned there, but my AC is fiendishly low compared to what some people are pulling these days, and CH doesn't work out so well when you can't time it to be efficient.<br />
<br />
I can obviously gear up a little just by getting back into the game and catching up with the bazaar, but beyond that, I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haass: Short answer: No. Don't buy the bullshit. This board has people that think you can't tank hard ldon with &lt;8k hp.<br />
<br />
You can go to GoD now and have fun, just stay outta the mountain trials for a while. You'll need more healing power than just a druid healer, most likely, but you DO have two tanks. <br />
<br />
Whether or not you'll gear up in there and ldon at anything resembling an appropriate rate is subject to discussion elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh sorry, forgot to make myself clear.  Shut the fuck up Apolyon.  Stay the hell out of here.  I don't want to listen to your bullshit rambling anymore, and I'm not gonna turn this thread into the same thread the others are.  This is not directed at you, nor do I give a flying fuck what you think in that deformed brain of yours.  Got it?<br />
<br />
As you wish your majesty!  In the meantime you just missed the point in your hatred for me, tossing a lot of good advice and suggestions out the window.  Last i checked this board did not belong to Haass, so any thread posted in a public forum is open to anyone/everyone that can read it.  If your really do want the input of only 1 person, i'd suggest you send a PM or perhaps an email.  But, seeing as my participation in anything only brings out the worst in you, i'll humor you and keep my mouth shut.<br />

Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">with tight puller you could do sewers/Ferubi fine with a cleric healing ya, druid would be pretty tough.  Its all a matter of how well you and your group mates play together.  Sure its safer with more hps/ac but why the hell would you want it safe?  Dont try it with a pickup group though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you can tank PoD trash then you can hunt in Natimbi for augments and whatever else.<br />
<br />
If you can tank PoN trash then you can tank in Qinimi.  I'm not sure that much equipment actually drops in that zone, though.<br />
<br />
If you can tank BoT trash then I think you can tank in Riwwi.  This opens up the first step of upgrades for you.  Riwwi has a surprising amount of loot and content.<br />
<br />
If you can tank BoT krigers and wing-named then I think you are ready to try Ferubi trash, Barindu trash, and most of the sewer trials.  This opens up a lot of sources of equipment upgrades.<br />
<br />
If you can tank content like hard LDONs (I'm not sure if you had LDON or not when you retired), then you can do sewer 1 and you are probably ready to give Vxed a try.<br />
<br />
Tipt is just plain hard, and regardless of what you might read from others, Tipt really doesn't depend on the warrior's gear.  It depends on the group's ability to charm a mob that hits like Rallos Zek, to stay alive while babysitting that mob for 1-2 hours, and then to kill a boss mob within 45 seconds or so.</div></div><hr />

Oh, we used to have a cleric, she was the healer for the assist group, while Bourbon actually kept me alive :)<br />

Having less than a CH just ensures that the druid heals BEFORE you're dead :)</div></div><hr />

Great, this is information that is useful.  Allow me to relate some of my many exploits.  Look at the above group, and now think that we took that group to Chardok kennels at level 58-60.  We had no enchanter, and generally don't have an enchanter.  Tactics revolve around me and Rasco pissing shit off long enough for it to die.  This was no change when we started in BOT....it wasn't uncommon for me to be tanking a Kriger and a gimp while Rasco and Homi killed another.  If the content is similar to BoT, or even slightly above that level, then I am 100% unconcerned, and this will be a success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can say that with my gear, Ferubi is still a pain. Mobs can pour out some serious hurt. I retired just a little bit into GoD, unfortunately, so I can't give specifics on what you're going to need there. One thing I would suggest is finding yourself a new cloak and running with tribute haste. If your bank account tends to be pretty well off, you shouldn't have any trouble feeding the tribute machine. It's a good source of additional hp and ac as well, if you can afford it.<br />
<br />
  The one thing I love LDoN for is the ac augments. If you can stand going there anymore after you get your anger augments, I'd definitely spend some time getting 5 of these. And actually, I'd probably suggest that you go ahead and get Ykesha augments rather than anger 3 augments if your LDoN tolerance is low. The added DPS will help out in groups and the cost difference is pretty huge (1020 points for 2 lowest Ykesha augments, 2300 for 2 anger 3 augments).<br />
<br />
  I'm sure your bazaar shopping will turn out anything tradable I could suggest. I'd definitely suggest looking for an ornate BP ASAP. 9ac and 25hp is very decent, and it also gives you the option of using shielding over focus if you want the extra ac. You may want to try Vhaksiz the Shade in PoN as well. 31ac 65hp shoulders are amazing and oddly tradable.</div></div><hr />

I'll be honest and say I haven't read dick for any of these threads in a good long while.  Reading about a game you're not playing gets boring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Holy light. Cleric GoD quickie heal makes me cry.  :( <br />
<br />
Defense aa's or not, almost any Cleric/Druid will go splat with the right mobs on em. The only good thing about having a cleric over a druid is that damn god heal. Highest crit I've done with it was 9k or so and with a 2.8 second casting time, even without a crit 4kish heal is nice. I haven't seen any Druid god spells so I don't know how they compare.<br />
<br />
That's what you really need in god, quick heals. But that's just from my exp in Tipt/Vxed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's fine, we can make a cleric happen.  Got one stalled at 53 right now, can get him to 65 and SCM3 and FT7 or so pretty quick, rest is just gravy.<br />
<br />
We're definitely not tied to the druid by any means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just go kill for your ornate BP. You can tank it, just bring 2 healers and then enough dps to clear the room and kill him before repops. One charmed, hasted krigers works well. If you need a GBoS you can get that up there too. <br />
<br />
WRT Ferubi: I'd say it's significantly harder than anything on the main floor of BoT except possibly Gaukr. Think lots of low hp gaukr's, some of them roaming and see invis. Very fun zone. Low rvr for xp/loot though, IMO. Stuff in there hits like a freight train and has procs to boot. They also root you, and run faster than SoW. Lots of interesting NPC behavior. Grats SOE.<br />
<br />
Sewers 1: Think hard ldon. I'd say the beginning hits a little easier than hard ldon, but once you hail ansharu mob atk gets higher. Max 1100ish, triples + procs on some I think. I can tank it fine (and so can you) but you need fast healing before mobs are slowed, and you've gotta have single pulls or excellent cc. Bard or FD puller works fine. You can probably pull just fine if you have an enchanter for cc, too.<br />
<br />
If you start playing again, DO go to GoD. It's GREAT fun compared to hanging out with all the PoP babies in BoT, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We're definitely not tied to the druid by any means.<br />

5 years and this is the loyalty you have.  Yeah, we'll see how long you live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hah. Keep the druid. Just get a cleric in addition. You need backup heals and snares for pets, anyway. Get yourself an enchanter and you've got a solid group, except for when you need an FD puller. Get your other warrior to reroll an Monk, SK or maybe Bard and you'll never need to bring a pickup again. Hah.<br />
<br />
Fwiw, you can probably get away with paci/lull pulling too, although most people I know get scared to try it when theres a lot of white cons, and I don't think it works on yellows at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You and Roscoe are right where I an HP wise, and while you're a chunk lighter on the AC, the warrior tanking advantages should make up for most of it. I can handle all the open GoD content except for the mountain trials - I have to find a warrior to hide behind, or bring 2 healers.<br />
<br />
Also, on the sewers: The Purifying Plant is the roughest of the four sewers. Pools / Lair / Crematory mobs are generally on par with tactics ogres near the pit, occasionally a little rougher due to Chaos Claws. Plant mobs are hard LDoN mobs on crack, with the nocs being up in the same damage output range as NToV flurry drakes, for much the same reason. Mercifully, their flurry is a lot less frequent, but Chaos Claws sucks ass. <br />
<br />
Ferubi appears to be divided into three parts: The entrance area, full of blue trash that's roughly on par with Hard LDoN, and just as boring, a central area, which is about the same diffculty, if tighter packed, more varied, and more fun, and deep in, which is full of whites and yellows and reds and similar love - the raid portion of the zone.<br />
<br />
Cleric healing is essential, and not so much for complete healing. Spikes kill. The deeper open zones spike much, much more than you've ever seen before. All Ukun, all nocs, all mastruq, and and I think all ra'tuk proc Chaos Claws: You won't resist it, it can and will rip you from end to end. With the combo package of Supernal Remedy / Supernal(Holy) Light, a properly focused cleric is the anti-spike machine in ways a druid just can't handle. If at all possible, get ornate arms/boots onto your cleric, and try for worn spell haste. Focused up, Supernal Light can pour out the heals, but mana pres is a must for extended use of it.<br />
<br />
For pulling indoors, I actually prefer a skilled monk, but an enchanter/cleric can handle most of the paci work with a few rough spots. A good bard can do anything he wants, as always. A highly skilled SK can handle things, but expect him to die lots more than the others would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have done a truckload of GoD with various groups. You will not be able to jump in to Vxed or Tipt right off the bat, but you can certainly work up to that even with just bazaar gear. Keep your druid around and get your cleric up to speed. Having 2 healers can make up for the lack of AC. On unlsowed mobs you will need fast heals to keep you alive, once stuff is slowed you can use CH, but the druid will have to keep an eye on you and be ready to supply gap heals.<br />
<br />
IMO, GoD is the most underrated expansion to date. It has everything people have asked for - hard single group content, decent gear upgrades, fresh new encounters, etc. If you like a challenge for single groups, this is the place to be.<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend picking up 5x the 10ac augs out of LDoN. Also, farm Ferubi for the 2 15ac augments - they drop every time and the named are not uncommon. That's an easy 80ac you can pick up from augs alone.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend getting a Tak BP. With the 40hp LDoN aug combined with the 2 Tipt augs, you get a 69ac 200hp BP, which is pretty sweet. While you are at it, you might as well give Tipt a go. If you don't get too beat up by the trash, then you should be able to survive the first named. She always drops 1 aug and can be done in under 20 minutes with some practice. Get everyone all the augs they want from her, every bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Seems like they proc every other hit. Those procs hurt. It's not enough for them to hit like there's no tomorrow but they gotta proc like hell too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">GoD zones are definitely a different pace of healing, and it will really take some getting used to by the healers.  It's not a place where the cleric starts the CH at a prescribed % of your health, at least not once you get past Riwwi.  The mob damage is ridiculously streaky, which means the healing must be just as streaky.  You will at times go for 20 seconds without taking any real damage, then suddenly you'll need a couple fast heals chained together to save your ass.<br />
<br />
Sony started this trend of streaky damage in POP, made it streakier with Hard LDON, and even streakier again in GoD.  People could still cope with CH in Hard LDON, but in most of GoD it's the fast expensive heals that rule: Supernal Light and its upgrade, Holy Light.  Divine Intervention has also changed from being raid-only to being a valuable single-group tool, once you get to Vxed and beyond.<br />
<br />
One additional note - Tribute was a new feature in GoD, and I think the mobs were designed with the assumption that you would use tribute, just like Luclin and POP were balanced around AA's, and LDON was balanced around augments.

Reason I ask is because if we fill the 6th spot with Cleric, we're kinda hosed on CC. My shammy has full healing AA's and spell haste 4, but Tnarg still kinda sucks the big one.  We can replace Druid with Cleric and then add CC/puller in 6th slot.  Quiescence pretty much makes up for druid I would think...I can keep that shit on constantly.</div></div><hr />

Agreed 100%. Gimp healers haven't caught up with the times and expect to drop a CH every now and then even with their FT15 and IH4 and MP4, and then complain cuz they don't have a 10khp 2kac tank. GoD is challenging for everybody, and we all have to develop some new strats. I call that fun, some people whine about it. Oh well. In GoD HP healed per second rules, instead of HP healed per mana.</div></div><hr />

If you start in earlier GoD areas, two healers should be more than enough, and it should still be just fine in Ferubi, I'd imagine. By Ferubi, you'll have upgraded gear... and frankly, if you can't handle Ferubi then you'll just go somewhere else until you can. At worst, you have the chance to try and fail as much as you want.</div></div><hr />

Just to give an idea of how much time it takes, I have spent  probably over 300 or maybe even 400 hours in GoD and have seen only one item off yard trash which was some earing of moondancer that warriors cant even use.

While they may be true, we do have only 6 slots to fill.  The warriors and the rogue are staying, the shaman has to stay, then we've got healer and CC, and that doesn't leave us with many options.  We'll deal.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy god lots and it challenges me.Lotta stuff in god moves very fast you might miss snare if you're boxing a lot.A lot is crawl through fast respawn too so if boxing there will probably be serious cc pressure.I've only done Vxed,Tipt and Ferubi with cc.I've been tempted to go to vxed without cause I single there mostly especially if at zi,but, it would be kinda scary and suicide to crawl probably.We did hold the named pooka camp without cc for a few  hours,but, getting there would be tricky.<br />
<br />
I usually pull,unless I'm lucky enough to have a bard along.I've pulled all the sewers with varying amounts of cleric pacify np with the exception of 3.Although,a lot of people probably do 3 with a rogue hehe.I've got groups past the turtle pool without any cc,but, always ran into trouble after that.With a chanter it was fine.<br />
<br />
For me a lot of GOD seems a more intense kind of old dungeon crawl.Runners will kill you fast.It's easier to pull singles usually by far than say hard ldon,but, healing is usually pretty heavy and respawns force movement.Don't know how many your boxing...just running my wife 's shammy and me is a full time job for me,but,you'll probably want reliable snare and cc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Not to talk you out of getting back in the game Haass, but I can't see how GoD would be much different than the game you left.   Even if you can eventually get all of the items found in Zotha's magelo, why would you?  Most of the items on the GoD upgrade path require a lot of farming to get loot thats equivalent to bazaar gear (i.e. Blood-Speckled Scaled Boots, Flowing Argil, Canescent Bone Bracer.)   There are surely a lot of good items in there too, like Bracer of the Heartstriker, Sash of the Yunjo's Champion, etc., but most of those items are still going to be difficult to get even if you already had everything in Zotha's magelo.  <br />
<br />
IMO the vxed and tipt drops help to skew that magelo, if you take them out and replace them with the next best thing you can find in GoD, the magelo should look a lot like a well geared bazaar magelo.  Yours actually isnt much different from Zotha's, there's a 1600 hp and 100 AC gap.  About 700 of those hp are just from sturdieness and stamina.  Another 100hp and 24 (worn) AC comes from Whimsey of the Masters, which increases in power the longer you're in a zone, so you can pretty much count that out if you plan on zoning or dying much.  Of the 800 hp remaining and the AC, you're likely to be able to make a good bit of that up with a few bazaar upgrades (RZ helm, better rings, a smattering of other minor upgrades like neck), and for the rest of the difference will be made up a lot more easily by one groupable content from past expansions (especially ldon hards for loot).  <br />
<br />
Even if you went through GoD to try to get all your upgrades, you still end up with the problem that you hit the end of your progression pretty quickly.  Really LDoN is the only place where you have any significant amount of 1 groupable progression, and that progression is mainly in accumulating points, not content.  GoD isn't an expansion for casual progression: it's a raid expansion with a limited amount of zones that are done with single groups, and as such it seems that most of the items that drop (in vxed and tipt) are meant to help catch up under-geared raiders, not as a progression path.  Once you get past tipt and are in KT/Ikk you've pretty much done it, and the only thing left to do will be to go back to the old content you skipped to flesh out the pieces that GoD didn't provide you (which is a lot).</div></div><hr />

The reason we all quit is because we had hit the wall in our progression.  Our only choices left were joining a guild and raiding, which we were unwilling to do, or farming items and grind AA in the same zones over and over, equally unappealing.<br />

This is very likely true, and when we hit the wall again, it's easy enough to cancel a subscription again.  But for the time being it's starting to look like there might be something for us to do.  We'll come back and give it a go, if it turns into a shitty grind again, we quit, nothing ventured nothing gained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I wouldn't say that the progression path is that short for non-raiders in GoD. My group hasn't been playing much the last 2 months and we are still working on farming bracers from Ikkinz 3 as well as the bosses for their drops. I have yet to see another non-raiding group on CT that is even close to this. I'd say unless you are insanely focused, you will not come close to finishing the single group progression in GoD before OoW is released.<br />
<br />
As for the difficulty and drops, I wouldn't focus on the random drops as much as working through the progression and letting them come as you go.  Since the retune, the mobs are not that hard. There was a post above about ferubi tearing apart an elemental geared warrior. This may have been true on release, but they are chumps now. I went there the other day and our chanter kept going LD and I was too lazy to pacify so I'd just pull 2 at a time and tank them both unslowed, and it was no problem at all.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be run around the open zones and pick up any drops from spawnable named that would be upgrades.<br />
<br />
Then head to Ferubi and take a couple trips and at least pick up a 25/25/25 for everyone, and a 15ac for the tanks. There are 2 of each of these augs if you really wanna take some time. You may pick up nice random drops in the process. This is also a good way to get a feel for where you are at. If you can do survive well enough here, then the sewers shouldn't be bad. <br />
<br />
As for group make up, I'd suggest a cleric just for res if nothing else. Nothing like losing someone deep in ferubi or in a trial and having no way to get them back. It's just annoying and easily avoided with a ressing class. Also, if you can get the shaman casting subtlety 3, then you can slow extremely early without much worry. I often box a shaman for my group and I can drop in slow right off the bat and hardly ever pull aggro. That being said, I'd say cleric/shaman over cleric/druid. However, I've never had a bard in the group so I don't know how they do.<br />
<br />
It takes focus and can be frustrating, but there is a lot of great stuff in GoD for single group, and as a fellow hardcore non-raider I'd say it is the best expansion yet for hardcore non-raiders.</div></div><hr />

Look at his magelo to get an idwa of what is possible with a single group. I you concentrate on progression and farming named loot (forget the random trash loot, too rare) I would say that you would have a solid 2-3 month before you could really farm Ikkinz single group trials.

The point is that games right now, quite frankly suck ass.  I'm not in the WoW beta, Doom 3 doesn't come out until next week (and basically it's not going to keep me too occupied for longer than a week or 2 anyway), and there's just nothing else on the horizon that peaks my interest.  It's so fucking boring and lameass to just play Warcraft 3 for 12 hours a day on my days off.<br />
<br />
Now, EQ falls into that category as well, but this is the perspective of me when I quit..which was without LDON and without GoD.  I didn't buy LDoN because quite frankly, I wasn't impressed with it, and I'm still not very impressed with it, but I need the anger augs, so whatever.  GoD I didn't buy because I'm not one to get force fed shit repeatedly.  Time has gone by and a lot of the people who's opinions I respect say that GoD does indeed have what I'm looking for in it, which is actual progression.  I play the game when I have something to do and I cancel my subscriptions when it gets boring.  As long as SoE keeps it so I have something to do, then they get my money.  When they start making retarded decisions, that's when I pull the plug.  I'm not Anti-EQ, I'm anti stupidity, and always have been.</div></div><hr />

Do the sewers trials, you're ready for em.<br />

My experience was, easiest trial is trial 3.  Trials 4 and 2 are a bit harder and trial 1's probably the hardest of the Sewers trials, although it's not beyond you.  When I did the trial, the end boss hit for 2k and AE rampaged (I believe he doesn't AE rampage very often nowadays).<br />

In the mountains (trials 5 &amp; 6), having a charming enchanter makes a big difference.  When I did those trials, the enchanter pet was doing more damage than the rest of the group put together.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, give some real thought about the item's you need to get from Point A to Point B and I'm convinced you will do it.<br />

I doubt that you will be able to avoid LDoN entirely since the BP (or a Kizrak BP) may be your best choice and your need augs. But with careful planning you should be able to minimize the time you spend there.<br />
<br />
You needn't fill all your aug slots in LDoN, since when you are ready you'll be farming augs in Ferubi.<br />
<br />
Unless someone has a better suggestion, Lcea Katta's mask and a Loyalist Shield are still awfully good and may be worth concidering.<br />

I think that getting from where you are, Point A, to Point B is not only possible, but will involve fighting in a fair number of zones and doing some content ranging from ho-hum to nail bitting. Just the kind of challange a hardcore group Warrior would relish.<br />

Have fun when you do the arena battles for the sash. Finally quest battles that aren't boring as hell.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I personally wouldn't do GoD (most of it anyway) without a cleric.  This is because of rez.  Everything in GoD has a long run back, closest you can bind is the boat or at an LDoN camp and you will often have to run back across 3 or 4 zones with kos mobs and some that see invis to CR.  Some places (Ferubi or sewers especially) if a critical person dies you either go on without them or waste 2 or 3 hours and go back to the zone-in.  I have had more nights in GoD ruined by our cleric dying deep in a dungeon when we were almost to a named than everything else put together.  If you don't have a cleric then this happens no matter who dies.  <br />
<br />
My trial group is warrior (me), rogue, druid, cleric, bard, ranger (usually).  Most of us have a whole lot better gear than you, so I'm not sure exactly how hard it will be, but I think you will be able to handle Quinimi, Barindu, maybe even Ferubi.  Sewer trials 2 and 4 for sure, 1 is really the only one that's harder than LDoN hard.  The one thing I wish we had was a backup rezzer, so I wouldn't advise going deep in these dungeons with no rezzer at all.  Rogue makes the sewer trials a hell of a lot easier so you'll be glad you have one of those.<br />
<br />
I don't know if some of these people have been to Ferubi lately, but it's not very hard anymore.  You definitely don't need a crack puller.  I do just fine with my cleric on autofol for pacify.  I don't know how bad the named are, but other than the fucking roamers sneaking up from behind and killing the cleric, ferubi is no sweat.  <br />
<br />
LDoN?  I hope you can do hards.  They are a hell of a lot better than easy.  The main problem with hard is that you have to have a puller.  Pacify doesn't work worth a damn  in there so you need crowd control (shaman tanking adds probably isn't gonna work on mobs that hit for 900) or a FD puller or both (bard).  With a good puller though, LDoN hard is a lot of fun and pretty profitable.  With a dedicated group you can probably get your AC augments in no time, and A3/40 hp augs too.<br />
<br />
From all of these threads I'm pretty much conviced that with skill and dedication it's possible to go a long ways with 1 group of non-raiders.  It sounds like a lot of fun as a matter of fact.  Will be interesting to see how you do.<br />
<br />
BTW, I dunno how purist you are about the 1-group thing, but if you can attend/organize one pickup raid on suled dar's shade, you can do vp keys and get THIS STUFF (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=122303&amp;postcount=30) easily with one group, as well as opening up a kick-ass AA grinding/random loot-dropping area.  This stuff, once you have the key, is easily 1-groupable and the items are huge upgrades for you.  I thought the quests were pretty fun too, some of them anyhow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never tried a LDoN hard before (or fuck, an easy for that matter), but I have no doubt at all that we can burn that shit out.  We do have a little bit of work cut out for us there, gotta get my augments up to par on my weapons and add some AC here and there.  <br />
<br />
In the meantime, we'll work on finishing up the Ornate pieces we're missing, adding Dozekar loots when we can, and start cracking on GoD.  My new 2nd box is in the mail right now, so we'll likely get rolling on that shit next week or the week after.<br />

Oh, and it's not so much that we're anti-public raids, it's that Rasco and I both work overnites CST, and Bourbon is on west coast, so our playtime doesn't exactly coincide with when most people would be raiding.

Being a one group &quot;Purist&quot; would be a harsh term.  It's not that we're doing this for the sake of being purely one group accomplishing things, it's that we basically hate everyone else.

High end bardic pulling is a very complex art, and a bard who's not the absolute center of his player's total attention doesn't bring half as much to the table because of the highly active nature of the bard. While you lose overall damage with the SK(probably), it reopens the possibility of offtanking mobs, provides adequate pulling, especially with the shaman/chanter combo of 'we can mez and slow simultaneously', and provides an easy mana-based kick in the ass you need to get past Protection of Discord, while he comes with a more potent snare. Of course, if the bard is the only toon being played by this person, he'll blow the SK away in all these except for offtankage.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes mob trippled for 1k and finished me up fast but I died maybe 3 times in 2-3 hours tanking which I wouldn't call bad. One of the times was even an enc we invited in later to replace bard pet breaking on a pull and we got add so 3 1k hittier in camp one on enc usualy doesn't end well  anyway. This was Vxed btw grp was at first beast druid cle bard war monk later on we traded bard for enc and beast for another monk.<br />
<br />
As cle I could keep a SK alive who has maybe 5k hp healed no problem he never died once healed at 1% once but didn't die lol=). Only time I had trouble was on the ancient named to get the flag ranger died on pull and ate casters before I could heal at which point was too late for us to get corpses and everything. This was in Sewers cleaning plant or whatever not sure which number that is. Grp was ranger cle enc sk wiz mage. <br />
<br />
So what I am saying here is , I actualy have a point, you have to know that these mobs hit hard and sometime will miss a few then others tripple for max so heal appropriately to your tank clestial healing isn't gonna save the world but it then casting cheal  on inc worked well for me. Boxing in GoD is suicide can it be done yes recommend it no. So far I have not seen any of the good drops yet but after two night really wasnt expecting it but at 3% aa /kill or 2% aa with charmed pet its some really nice fast exp since mobs have little(20k?) hp.</div></div><hr />

The mobs tend to be fairly well spread and it'll give you a good sampling on what to expect. I'd also suggest hitting each dungeon on easy at least one time to get a feel for the layout themes. On a normal Guk mission, I pulled ~ 12 mobs via chain aggro by creeping into a room, for example.</div></div><hr />

I love shaman healing in GoD.  My shaman friend (who regularly is my MH in hard ldons), can heal just fine in GoD.  Yes, you do want the cleric for the Rezzes.  <br />
<br />
War, Sha, CL, Rogue, Enchanter is a good basis.   After that it's &quot;what you can get  away with&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bard or Druid or Necromancer will give you a nice wide range of options, but you might want to experiment a bit before you settle.<br />
<br />
I've had nice experiences with Warrior, Ranger, Shaman, Bard, Cleric, Enchanter.  I've also had success with Warrior, Beastlord, Cleric, Rogue, Druid, Enchanter.<br />
<br />
I've Ldoned enough to get 2 pieces of Tak armor, 5 10 AC augs, 5 40 HP augs, and 3 Anger III augs.  I found the investment more than worthwhile.  If you just want to rack up hard Ldon points - Rujark is the only dungeon I'll do with pick up groups.  Hard Taks are the place I check people out with before I go deep into GoD if I haven't grouped with them before. <br />
<br />
If your bard can pull a hard Takish, and your enchanter can keep something charmed for the whole dungeon without dying, you have your pulls covered for life, and a group who knows how to keep their 'chanter up on charms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">HELL YES!<br />
<br />
This is precisely the kind of thing that I was hoping to see, and from Haass nonetheless.   The thing that makes GoD so badass is that there's stuff that runs the gamut from not difficult to INSANELY hard for a single group, but it's ALL progression and it's ALL progression that requires no more than one group.<br />
<br />
If there was an expansion that was tailor made to fit the style of someone who wanted to push the limits without the need to go on a raid, GoD is the one.<br />
<br />
LDoN shopping cart should include:  <br />
<br />
All of the 10AC augments (510AP's each), one Anger 3 Aug, and one Ykesha Aug.   The other possibility is the 40hp augs, but that's a hell of a lot of LDoNage, which can get pretty damn boring.  <br />
<br />
For cash raising purposes... Riwwi is the place to be.   In the Coliseum, there's a couple of rooms that contain nocs leading up to an &quot;officiator&quot; area.   Every one of those nocs is a placeholder for a guy called &quot;Dedgerex&quot;, the cash cow of the century.  He drops 2 items, both 1hb's.  One is for Knights which sells pretty well (15-30k), and one for Dual Wielders with a 625DD proc called &quot;Dedgerex's Flintforged Cudgel&quot; that sells for 70-100ish K.   While you're in the arena, there's mobs that pop and come out into the arena that kill the little Yunjos.   Those are also named PH's, many of which drop relatively serious plat items.<br />
<br />
If you see anything no-drop in GoD that's not a tongue, it's for the BiC quest.  Some parts of that quest are tremendous fun (Qinimi 6 man event/Riwwi Coliseum event), but since the BiC requires an 18 man event, you prolly wont' want to mess with it except for the Riwwi part and the early Qinimi part.<br />
<br />
Based on your gear, you won't be upgrading much in Riwwi, your upgrades will come from Barindu/Ferubi/Trials/Vxed/Tipt, but dont' avoid Riwwi, and get LOTS of Hynid, Tuna, Crab, and Crag food and Taelosian Tea.  You'll want to build up faction with those Yunjos by feeding the starving/thirsting ones.  If you got the boxed version of GoD, make sure to /claim the little staff, it'll save you TONS of time at this part.<br />
<br />
A tracker is pretty damn helpful for gearing up in GoD, particularly in Vxed.  <br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing how this turns out, I think your'e gonna love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's kinda the plan.  I look at that magelo on the front of this thread, and see 16ac, 135hp shoulders.  Well, that's fuckin nice and all, but in this day and age, we can't be having that kinda crap AC, i'd much rather have the Pauldrons of the Deep flame for the extra 22ac or whatever it is than 35hp.  And I haven't checked the bank since we've been back, but i'm 99% sure we're only one piece away from those.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm gonna go Dual Yak augs, mostly for DPS.  I understand that 99% of people on this board have a hard on for Anger + EB, but I still believe that it's the most overrated shit in the game for the majority of warriors.  If you're tanking Gods, you need Anger.  If you're sitting around with 2 other dudes who are 2 boxing, you don't need that kind of Hate, and stun augs are gonna be just fine, with the benefit of added DPS.  I don't have aggro problems, and I have a hard time believing I ever will, considering the people who I play with.<br />
<br />
I probably won't get around to the 40hp shit for awhile, but yeah, I planned on the 10ac augs for the time being.  The rest of the group has their eyes set on a couple ohter augments, so there's plenty of time to grind out a few things, especially since from what I hear, I can probably do normals just by running thru the zone with autoattack on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Definitely agree with the Doze killing. It's alot of fun, and hell, the stuff would last a raider into EPs (and beyond). It fits in nicely with my gear; I think I have 4 pieces of Doze quest armor. Dual ykesha procs is what I would (and did? I forget) recommend as well. Double stun proccing weapons should be fine for aggro. <br />
<br />
  Frankly, I wish I could join you. When I started Fitemore, I did it with 2 RL friends with us all living together. Warrior, cleric, bard combo. I ended up falling behind a bit due to me being completely reliant on them and them not being reliant on me... Then we joined a guild, yada yada yada. I had the most fun with just us three running around camping stuff, fending off 8 mobs at once and just relying on our skill to carry us through. If I had the time and a tight crew like you've got, I'd be stoked to go do exactly what you are doing.<br />
<br />
  LDoN missions, especially if you don't try to grind normals and instead head for the hard missions ASAP, are quite a bit of fun... for a while. Don't get too down on them when you hear people complaining about the repetitiveness. Most of them did normal (easy) LDoNs for a long time before even touching a hard mission. Easy are probably the best points per time, but you'll do less TOTAL hard missions and thus grind less. It's only like 5 hard missions per 10ac augment, and only 5 of the 25 have to be in MM. It's 15 hard missions for 2 of the best ykesha augments. If you stop after 40 missions, you should have gotten ~ 20 AAs and some loot you might even use.<br />
<br />
  Other random thoughts: Check out that guide on BoT tower bosses. You ahould be able to get them with just your crew and some pick up people. A GBoS and an ornate BP would do you some good, as well as FT2 priest helms. Also, get Tactics flagged. If you ever want to just grind out some FUN experience with some spells and ornate thrown in, Tactics pit rocks. Mobs die fast, wander lots, do lots of damage and STAMPEDE! There are also some named mobs you can probably take out in Tactics, if they're up, for stuff. You know, you WOULD look good with a SBoD mainhanded!<br />

Well, ya had me right up until that SBoD crack...I think my Sceptre of Destruction will be staying in my mainhand for a long time to come, due to the farming of the BoT towers which was rampant on CT when I left.  It seems like the population has dropped off some, maybe we can manage it.<br />

Myself and a friend both 3box so we have a full group.  We never raid and are planning to do the LDoN/GoD progression.  We're a little further along in the gearing up process than you are but I'm sure you'll catch up since it sounds like you play more than us.<br />
<br />
My SK is our maintank and we don't use CC, so we're a bit different from a normal group.  Our group is SK, rogue, wizard, cleric, shaman, monk.  Monk pulls, SK tanks.<br />
<br />
We decided to put together this group when our &quot;mains&quot; were level 52 about a year ago.  We leveled up mostly in LDoN and it got pretty boring after a while.  We just started doing hards about a month ago though and I have to say, they're a LOT more fun than 65 normals.  If you can handle hards, I highly suggest you grind out all your LDoN points on hards and avoid normals.  Hards are more challanging, you get more points for winning, the dropped augments are better, and the nameds drop some gear that will really help gear you up for GoD.  Plus, from everything I've read, learning to pull and tank hards is a good way to prepare for GoD trials.  I know my group has learned a bunch of useful tactics from pulling in Takish hards.</div></div><hr />

I'm as fucking hardcore as they come, and always have been. I know how to play, the guys I play with know how to play, and we've been doing shit that I've seen entire guilds wipe to for as long as I can remember. If it CAN be done, it WILL be done. I'm not into grinding out a full new suit of 1492 armor from LDoN, i'm into challenging content that everyone says is provided in GoD, but is basically being locked away from non raiders due to HP and LFG concerns. I am NOT looking for spoilers, strats, etc. I'm looking for all this content that some people claim exists. If it does exist, then I shall conquer it. I'm actually willing to give this a shot if this is 1 groupable for a warrior that needs the gear, rather than what Time guilds are doing in their off hours.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to put my opinion of the game on the table here and I'm allowing YOU to convince me that this game is worth playing, and that I can accomplish what you say I can. Prove your case to me, and, if a couple other situations work out with RL shit, then I'll come back and prove it's possible, and that all the people bitching about this, are in fact, not working hard enough. I'm giving you an oppurtunity to prove your point, go for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alright, heres whatcha do in this situation - gather 6 friends (you do have 5 friends right?) offer them nice gear, and fun twice a week or something... Go explore with the 6 people make sure each person knows their role/class, i'd say start on Innoruuk in Nadox (he's one groupable, very good RvR mob) try ToV west wing dragons (telkernor, gozzrem) - do Dozekar in HoT for very nice quest outcomes (1 groupable if ya get him slowed).    Try to setup a zlandicar checker and do him when ya can.. Try Guardian of the Seal in the hole - these few enemies will get you and your buddies geared up well and you'll see/do more new and fun things in the process.  As you get geared up, do ldon's until you have good enough gear for ldon hard. Do hards until you have the drops from each zone, then start working toward GoD content, try the one group sewer/mountain expiditions, they have nice outcomes and very easy. This kinda stuff will gear you up fast, then you can backtrack and test your group on enemies like; Vallon Zek, BoT towers, Mujaki the Devourer, Korocrust, Xanamech and more which are all one groupable if the people can work well together.   Also - Augments help ya out a ton heh, my guilds new to elemental, i've only gotten 3 drops from ele and i'm nearing tanks whom have been there for months  and past it due to my augments (get every slot +hp/ac) its not hard to do and pays off in the end since they are removeable.    If none of this works come to Saryrn server come to the rathe arena, let me beat you to death, then delete your characters and quit eq.   Its fun trying to one group raid mobs. We have 3 hydra teams on Saryrn who do it alot, but also a few independant groups of 6 that can go around and do the enemies aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh ya, and http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587 everything on there is attainable with one group or less, Lotta sewer drops, barindu named, 5 ferubi drops, 2 vxed items, 1 tipt item, 3 riwwi drops.   Its easy stuff to attain if you work at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">The way god is set up atm at level 65 groups moving through GOD progressively(relying on GOD for gear) will probably need cc.Probably a chanter for tipt as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, I somewhat agree with most of what you said Froggerx but the part about Vallon Zek, Mujaki, and Xanamech being one groupable I have to strongly disagree with you on.  Those all require 3 groups or more.  I won't say it is impossible but if a single group is doing those mobs they must be Time+ geared at least.  There is no way in hell a single pre-elemental geared group can do them.<br />
<br />
Korocust I have no idea because I have never fought him.  <br />
<br />
Bot Towers are two to three group doable at Haass's gear level and one groupable at elemental gear level for sure, on par with winning Tipt.  Once OoW comes out and his group is all level 70 and has slightly better gear, he probably will be able to single group the one for the GBoS and the one that drops the GSo4W.  The sand tower is probably going to be too hard for a single group and the other one is marginal at pre-elemental gear levels.<br />
<br />
The part about farming gear in hard LDoN is valid--lots of nice stuff there, especially if you are not concerned with winnng.  Zone in, track for a close named, and kill or get another expedition if none close.  The LDoN BP and legs are pretty comparable to the Ornate BP and legs unless you put all the augs on them and then they are better.  Ornate is good if he wants to spend plat and gear up and LDoN is good if he wants to earn his gear in LDoN but the chances of his group one grouping BoT towers for an Ornate BP or legs is pretty slim though unless he has another group or two help him out.<br />
<br />
Once OoW comes out there may be higher level LDoN gear availiable so I wouldn't recommend spending LDoN points on any Tak armor until then Haass.<br />
<br />
If you want good experience, LDoN Hard is not bad and is less trains than BoT and it allows you to hone your groups skills even farther.  Once you can win LDoN hards consistently, then you can do the GoD sewer trials and win.  <br />
<br />
If you choose to do Ferubi, the Ferubi nameds are two groupable at your level but be careful as Ferubi mobs respawn pretty fast and you definitely need a cleric to rez since you will die a lot at your gear level.  I would also suggest you either power level up a 65 rog alt and get SoS (best choice) or level up a Necro or SK to summon bodies (cant summon on same account though) and camp him in GoD for CR purposes because nothing sucks worse than a CR in Ferubi since invisible is useless there and trash will occasionally one round you.</div></div><hr />

K, you can come watch when I do them one group next time, okay? pre-elemental we did them with one group, could probably do with 3 people now if we refined strats even more.  note; You can mez/stun fake vz's. note; you can charm shadow steeds for dps in mujaki event. note; you can charm mobs for xana fight and increase dps by pet weaps/haste.   Shei Vinitras, and all the VT named are also one groupable, Seru aswell. Just takes time/effort and once the time and effort is put in, the gear will follow.

<br />
Xanamech can easily be killed with three groups of Velious-geared toons.  Using a bit more risk (and a charm hasted pet is always a risk) could definitely decrease the numbers.<br />
<br />
Mujaki...well, I don't tend to believe that the event is single-groupable, even with a single charm pet, but the whole thing was bugged anyway when I was doing it.<br />
<br />
Korucust?  I don't believe he is one groupable, especially not with the saves that Haass and company probably have right now.  Koru is going to be about killing him before the DOT kills you and a single group with low saves is just not going to beat the clock.  But that's my opinion. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd recommend single-grouping Trak and getting the old VP key - then getting in on a PUR (yes, I know you hate them....so, whatever, take this with a grain of salt) and completing the six VP quests.  If you are going to be doing some of the old-world Doze quests and the like, accessing ST presumably by killing Zlandicar et al., then you might as well throw in teh VP peices in that area.<br />
<br />
Whatever.  You probably already have a game plan so me preaching about my recommendations isn't going to be particularly useful.  G'luck. <br />
<br />
BOT named are completely doable with your crew and skill, especially with a charm pet.</div></div><hr />
