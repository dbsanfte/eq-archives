<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">;) Ok, Ive been getting very proactive with my armor and have begun getting the loot togethor for getting my  hands on Ornate armor..Well, here is the problem..Its  on a teeny tiny bit better the Helanic with the exception of a few items.. Notably the chest and I think the arms.. So, rather then dumping a large sum of loot into buying the Ornate breastplate mold, is there another avenue I should pursue or no..It just seem like that big of an upgrade..Please let me know what you think..Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Unless you can find a deal. There's always ldon armor too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalos Nathsar</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend at least the arms, chest and gaunts as upgrades from Helanic Tundra armor.  I also bought the helm (got a decent deal), but was using a diseased skullcase before... minimal upgrade, but I'm quite happy with it. <br />
<br />
I seriously doubt I'll upgrade either bracer, boots or legs (STA is maxed out, making the effect useless, and not worth the 80k) with it... the small difference in stats doesn't justify any of those pieces in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Chest and Gaunts should be a priority though, I use both effects quite regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">effect on the BP is probably worth getting it for... its a good few extra HPs when grouping without a shaman, and I know a few warriors who use it in favor of focus when raiding for the extra AC.<br />
<br />
Personally BP and gloves would be the only bits I would consider spending the plat on, and I wouldnt bother with the gloves if you can get an eyepatch of plunder.  Everything else its better to save your pennies for the LDoN drops - warlords steel gauntlets, mana  threaded bone bracelet, bloodied boots of dark rites etc</div></div><hr />
