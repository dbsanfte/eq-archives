<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok asked this in the JoS thread but its getting a bit too long. So:<br />
<br />
Do you think JoS has become a real alternative for DBotW in mainhand and EoE / Quarmmer in offhand? Due the poor dbotw droprates and the faster progression into PoTime for many guilds (thanks GoD) we see a real shortage in warr mainhand weapons....<br />
<br />
I the top endgame agro mainhanders are:<br />
DBotW &gt; BF &gt; JoS (?)&gt;(?) EoE <br />
<br />
where top dps mainhanders are:<br />
<br />
JoS &lt;(?)&gt; DBotW &gt; EoE &gt; *a TON of weapons* &gt; BF<br />
<br />
The top3 time farming guilds on solro are at 0/8 3/2X 4/2X (correct me if I'm wrong tarkas / mourning :) ) on DB drops per RZ kills which kinda sucks.<br />
<br />
What do you think about JoS + A3 as mainhand weapon?<br />
<br />
(Using EoE + BF right now and we have many MTs waiting to upgrade their BoWs.. plus we are kinda lucky with EoE drops.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have EoE/JoS 2xA3 warrior and she is really satisfied with the agro.<br />
<br />
I doubt EoE (or JoS) will ever replace DBlade mainhanded.<br />
But EoE could become a viable solution agrowise.<br />
<br />
IF you have a BF i dont see any reason to remove it from the primary hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree with Emilia, JOS will never replace the Dblade in terms of aggro, but it can certainly be a viable alternative in this day and age.  <br />
<br />
Anger 3 augs really changed the face of the game when it comes to aggro weapons, you can realistically turn any decent weapon into a decent hate weapon just slapping one of those on.  It will probably never produce the hate that a Anger3 auged Darkblade will, but taking DPS and its current proc, plus an anger3 aug into consideration, you could definitely make a JOS a good mainhander.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, if you do decide to mainhand a JOS as your main aggro weapon, i would not go for a quarm hammer.  I would definitely get an EOE.  Quarm hammers proc is basically 0 aggro, and if i was using a JOS mainhand, i would definitely want an offhander that produced some hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As most have said it wont be near the same aggro but it should hold its own espcially with A3 in both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gakmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have not tried either JoS and eoe but actually if you have either of them, IMO, get anger3 on it and weild it with a BF until you can get a DBoW<br />
i think it would really be a waste of ldon pts and  a waste of dkp (or whatever your guild call it) for a weapon that you would bag in a month or two</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have not tried either JoS and eoe but actually if you have either of them, IMO, get anger3 on it and weild it with a BF until you can get a DBoW<br />

This of course assumes you have a bloodfrenzy. Which the original poster does -- but it's an interesting discussion:<br />
<br />
What's the &quot;longevity&quot; of a JoS+A3/EoE+A3 setup? Is it enough to last a warrior until the &quot;Darkblade of Discord&quot; is discovered?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Discovering vs Obtaining ....<br />
<br />
EoE+JoS is surely a kickass combo. Better than BoW<br />
Probably worse than BF +  EoE/JoS agro wise.<br />
<br />
Darkblades arent that common anyway.<br />
And its not because we see &quot;Darkblade of Discord&quot; that they will be available.<br />
I know a shitload of Wars that farmed Cursed/RZTW/RZ and never got class weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, its a bummer that Darkblades aren't common, but if you do Plane of Time enough its bound to drop eventually. Whereas Bloodfrenzy was a different beast, non instanced content on a weekly spawn with a ginormous drop table.<br />
<br />
Rallos has a significant but not obscenely large drop table and spawns every 5 days or so in a zone where competition (at least in my server) is enough to allow for weekly farmings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can throw Fleshbiter into the mix as well now, probably aways better then JoS but not as good as Darkblade as far as aggro goes.  Been seeing it linked in game, no clue what drops it yet so it could be a mined link still too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I really hope that's not &quot;THE&quot; warrior sword for this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its probably as much as the warrior sword as darkglint is the ranger sword or uqua mace is the paladin weappon, marginal or lateral upgrades at best<br />
<br />
hopefully later zones have better ones which i'm almsot sure they will</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is no doubt later zone will have better weaponry. Basicaly this is a DBotW, higher dps, better stats, lesser aggro. To bad it's primary only. It's not worth to upgrade either for the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;and the faster progression into PoTime for many guilds (thanks GoD)&quot; - quote<br />
<br />
How has GoD helped with PoP progression?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">500hp WA5 from GoD<br />
50ac 200hp from LDoN<br />
<br />
Time is a LOT easier than it was last summer.<br />
<br />
This is just a piece of shit some retarded Dev put in Uqua.<br />
Just like Darkglint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hopefully they tune that thing.  ranger weapon from ikkinz looks gay, but is roughly 25 dps increase from eoe+timespinner.  extra 5dps from fleshbitter doesnt outweigh the aggro we lose...  unless it has a proc modifier, if anyone knows how to check that it would be cool.<br />
<br />
think i rather use a vdd then that thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Talk about a severe disappointment, that weapon will rot even faster then the Darkglints did for us heh.  All of our warriors have a darkblade, none of them would bag it for that =/<br />
<br />
Bleh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok this is interesting, especially for the lower MTs in the line...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That looks sort of like the GoD equivalent of a BoW (yes, I know it's 1h and BoW is 2h, but I'm talking about it being an intermediate weapon worth getting).  Course, a DBOW &gt; it, whereas a BoW &gt; everything before it.<br />
<br />
So they f'ed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BoW was lesser aggro than BF + BoC/HG but better dps.<br />
This one lesser aggro than DB but better dps.<br />
It's a problem of scale though, BoW was a huge dps upgrade, this one is a slight upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's a pity thats primary only, would own secondary</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">K we got one tonight.  No proc mod, yeah that proc sucks big time.  Stat wise, it's better than DBoW, but unless it gets a proc mod/new proc, it's just a toy really...<br />
<br />
I have eoe/jos and a bf, for aggro i use bf/jos, and when i'm not in the front of the lineup, i use eoe/jos for the dps.  However I've found myself using the eoe/jos alot in uqua/ikkinz for offtanking etc., and honestly, i've never had any serious aggro issues...in fact sometimes i find myself accidently jacking aggro from the MA, and he's usually dbow/eoe :\<br />
<br />
WA5 owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Plz tell me this doesn't look like the Elf Shoe.  Being a WE if I ever pick one of these up I'm REALLY gonna get some Ranger jokes my way :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">it has same icon so prob same graphic! haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That Fleshbiter needs to be offhandable. <br />
<br />
Unless the devs meant this weapon purely for new recruits and people that havent got a darkblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yes it's an elf boot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seriously, whats with the sudden hardon for making every warrior-only weapon primary only. No other Time or GOD class weapons for dual wielders have had this restriction. If they really badly want us to use shields they should give us an actual reason to do so rather then just fucking us over with weapon slots constantly.</div></div><hr />
