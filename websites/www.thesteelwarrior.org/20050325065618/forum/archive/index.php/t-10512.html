That's the single group thing.  I tried it something like 6 months ago or more and got beat down.  Getting the group together was tough.  You fight mobs 3 at a time and they seem to be unmezzable and immune to root/snare.  So we took 3 tanks.  But you also need pretty good dps to get done in time.  With 3 tanks along, that's kind of tough.  I don't see how else to occupy all 3 mobs sufficiently though.  Maybe a mage pet could handle one for awhile?  At the time they were a bit tough for that.  <br />
<br />
Then there's the boss at the end with his drunk AE.  We failed a couple times by running out of time just a little too fast in large part because our mage was too drunk to cast.  I think alcohol tolerance helps with that, but as a warrior I wasn't trying to cast spells and was quite busy, so I dont know if it effected me enough at 200 tolerance to be a problem or not.</div></div><hr />
