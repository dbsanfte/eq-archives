<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought today was going to be another bad warrior day.  Got in a VERY bad BoT group (the 64 enchanter didn't understand how she could keep the Jord from gating with mez).  After one death I quickly repped myself with a paladin :D. <br />
<br />
Moved on to the coastal giants in PoS.  It was my first time tanking there instead of being rampage tank and DPS so I didn't know about that nasty FD stun proc (wish WE got a proc like that).  Anyway, after the first pull, with me lieing down on the job literally, the 65 SK says he'll tank, cause he can keep aggro.  So during the second pull the SK bites it really fast and I'm tanking the rest of the way with no problems now that I know about proc.  Cleric clicky's the SK, and he's like, need to watch my HP better, it's going down faster than the warriors (DUH!).  So during the third pull the SK bites it as fast as before and again I'm tanking the rest of the way with no problems.  At this point the cleric is like, the warrior has more HP than you and seems to have gotten the hang of dealing with the proc just fine, let the warrior tank.  Made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  The funniest thing about it all was, found out later the SK had a 65 warrior too, he should have known better :p<br />

Edit: Misspelled too, Valeris is getting to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogmol</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did another adventure last night, group was me, monk, rogue, cleric, shaman, and enc. We tore through that dungeon, killed 2 nameds. I got a Vampire Hunter's Stake (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23401) .  Haste ring also dropped. Anyway, after the split at end of edventure, I had almost the entire group say &quot;great job of tanking, better than most of the tanks we have been on adventures with.&quot; Kinda makes a warm fuzzy feeling deep down inside. ;O) Basically, they assigned me to pull and MA, and I did so almost nonstop the entire dungeon, only taking breaks for the cleric to med up occasionally. I loved the Vampire Hunter's Stake, procc'ed regularly and allowed to me actually work on piercing some more. Usually, in a dungeon, I stick with the CHoS/SotB combo, now I have an optional setup.</div></div><hr />

I was at upper earth in BoT (near gaukr) and the group was owning and stuff. Then I got asked for brells. I was all like &quot;WTF I'm no stinkin' pally!!&quot; Then they were all like &quot;oh&quot; collectively, and then said &quot;Well you hold agro like one!&quot; That made me happy so I went and got my aaexp point and left the group!<br />

I get asked for SoW's all the time just because I'm a half elf.  Sometimes I have fun with it and while I'm lfg I get my bow out in PoK and see how many idiots ask the half elf in full plate for SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use to get the worst of it being an iksar. back before i had my plate armor eveyone wanted me to pull and would say, you should FD when you get low hp =/<br />
before that in my earlier lvls i used a harpoon of the depts so everyone assumed i was a shammy, totally ignoring my offhand weapon, and hail me for a sow.<br />
even now i cant even hold a 2h weapons w/o some one assuming i'm a SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been asked for a port...by a lvl 53. Ranger of course. I told him to /d me and i'll port him, and he did. So i started beating on him...and then shot a few arrows up his arse before he ran off screaming. I was cracking up. Also i got asked for a port by someone while running through Freeport. Well, i figured it was a newbie so this time i explained that only druids or wizards port. I've been asked for sow, shammy buffs, brells, whatever. And that's when i use a BoC/Red epic and my armor is colored warlord's color/black - like Steenky. When i was 62 i was grouping with a fellow warrior, and i had black armor and made myself woodelf with the crown. He thought i was a rogue, and i was using both epics! When he had to go he started looking for a tank until i told him 3 times i will tank, then he was confused and i had to explain that i was a warrior! Probably had particle effects on and had really bad eyesight, or was on drugs :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the topic...Ya shouldn't even let those knights think of tanking! When i group with a knight i kindly direct them to the mobs arse. If a knight wants to tank, just leave. But great job making a fool out of that shadowknight, Mvreena, they deserve it :) Especially since he had a 65 warrior...Either he was ebay or an extremely bad warrior who made the SK because he couldn't keep aggro.</div></div><hr />

Such is the curse of the Iksar warrior, probably one of the rarest kind around...<br />
<br />
But you know what they say, the few, the proud :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to get the SoW pls~ thing all the time, but when I look back at old screen shots and see myself in a treeweave or barbed ringmail and with the brown crusty armour and green from a hero bracer I think I would have asked myself for a SoW too.<br />
<br />
Has only happened to me once since I've been wearing a plate BP and had my epic, though I have been accused of being a Pally a couple of times when using a 2 hander.<br />
<br />
Another half elf warrior in my guild picked a up crow foot lance a few weeks back which has the same graphic as that knight lance from Sol Ro that seems to be getting pretty common, so now we've got all the pallys redirecting brells requests to him. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar thing happen with me. I joined a LDON group with a Cleric, Shammy and Pally among others and I don't know if the Pally was not paying attention or what but he could not hold agro to save his life. About 5 mobs in the Cleric and Shammy asked if it would be okay to let the Warrior tank to see if he could hold agro any better. I tanked as we completed the rest of the adventure and never had an issue with losing agro. heh when we left the dungeon the Pally said something along the lines of: This is a first I have been out tanked by a Warrior. My reply was simple &quot;Oh ? Never been in a group with one before?&quot; It made my day to see how things happen when roles get reversed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar thing happen with me in LDoN. I've been in the situation before where folks wanted to play loose and the pally in the group could hold agro better with stuns and such. <br />
<br />
I'm usually pretty laid back, so as long as i get exp, if he wants to take the beating that's cool. <br />
<br />
Started the LDoN group with me tanking, but he kept pulling agro. My partner, a druid, was our healer.  She sends me a tell to let him tank since we kept ping-ponging, it was eating her mana. So I am like, sure NP.  With him tanking it REALLY ate her mana, so after he died, I started tanking again, and pulling and we did well. Finished the adventure successfully with a minute to spare. <br />
<br />
I got an unexpected rush of 3 mobs close to the end and after my rez, I got my gear on and I'm like.. let's go!!! We ran in and got the last two mobs. It was good to have the pally in the group for the rezzing and for backup. Once we worked things out, we made a good team.</div></div><hr />
