Quote:-&quot;&quot; A bard using 32 manasong essentially adds 2 clerics in terms of long term mana regen. A necro using twitch is the same thing for most encounters (where necro mana pool counts), and better if using mind wrack. The role of cleric mana pumper will just transition from bards to necros.<br />
<br />
The reason it's being nerfed is best explained by crowd psychology. All opinions vary over time, and there's even a particular shape this trend takes, time and time again.<br />
<br />
When PoP was being created, bards were at their low point, in terms of perceived power. Thus bards were helped in PoP.<br />
<br />
At the same time, monks were at their high point, and were nerfed during PoP.<br />
<br />
Now the two trends are reversed.<br />
<br />
Bards are getting nerfed because right now, bards are perceived as being overpowered. That's the only reason. It isn't based on logic. It's emotional. Logic only kicks in after the emotion decides what direction to take. The choice of the 32 manasong over something else was made by the logical part of the brain. But the decision to nerf something was entirely emotional.<br />
<br />
Don't dismiss this trend just becase it's based on emotion. Emotion is much more powerful than logic.<br />
<br />
A class is overpowered, by definition, if it is displacing other classes out of their assigned roles. Thus bards are not overpowered. The only class bards ever displace is monks, and only in the role of pulling...and monks aren't supposed to be pulling in the first place. How many fantasy works include a martial artist that...pretends to die over and over and over again near a group of bad guys until all of them get fed up and go home but one? The argument that SOE ever intended FD to be used for pulling is ludicrous. This is ignored by monks because, again, emotion rules logic, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
The designers emotionally &quot;know&quot; that bards are overpowered and that they need to be nerfed. Their rational brains kick in to help decide what to nerf. Nerfing 32 won't cause a huge outcry that nerfing something bards like to do would, and helps satisfy the urge to nerf SOMETHING about bards, because there's no arguing against an emotion that is telling you that something needs to be done.<br />
<br />
This is showing a greater capacity to use logic inside SOE than in the majority of businesses that exist. This is a GOOD thing, that it's 32 manasong that's the focus of the nerf. It's not a fun role, it doesn't trash the bard class, but it lowers bard power while leaving the parts of the class that people actually enjoy doing, alone. Bards lose power but don't quit, which is good, because there aren't many bards. Compare this with the monk nerf where they wanted some monks to quit and play something else, because there were far too many.<br />
<br />
If it were possible to override these basic emotions, we would no longer exist as a race. It's emotions that drive the human race to improve and grow. Without them, we'd all come to the logical conclusion that there is no purpose in continuing to live, since there is no logical reason why life should exist over its lack of existance. It's emotions that drive us.<br />
<br />
While the basic emotional cycles can't be changed, the strength of each phase can. What we, as bards, do and say on the boards, at fan faires, and in game, can make the negative impulse spike deep or shallow. It can change what direction the emotional impulse will take (32 manasong vs. resists vs. fade vs. whatever).<br />
<br />
It's monks that are the primary driver of anti-bard sentiment right now. It's monks that should be our focus, in terms of what happens to our class and what happens to theirs. Right now, monks are already fixed, at least by the definition they use for fixed (being able to pull better than bards), thanks to environmental changes on LDoN raids (indoors, high MR), and even hard adventures (indoors, massive lull resists). Unfortunately this isn't well known, because a lot of guilds don't do LDoN raids and few bother with hard adventures, and it certainly hasn't penetrated to the emotional, limbic portion of the brain. Thus the monk emotional calls for nerfage continue. This is the sort of pattern that leads to the large spikes then corrections afterwards, instead of a nice smooth increase to the proper value, or decrease to the proper value, with no overshoot.<br />
<br />
The logical brain may make the perfect change, balancing everything out, but the emotional brain doesn't yet believe it. The logical brain is forced into making more changes until such time as the emotional brain finally catches up. At which point, the logical changes went too far. One can use the argument that the majority of monks don't know about LDoN raids/hard adventures, but that certainly doesn't apply to the designers, and it's they who are nerfing 32 manasong. The emotional wave is still in force. They will keep making changes until the herd is satisfied.<br />
<br />
The next expansion will be a PoP-like expansion, with new AA's and levels (at least, according to rumor). This is the expansion that will probably overpower monks, and nerf the hell out of bards...unless the emotional trends reverse.<br />

Granted I have no opinion on whether the song is nerfed or not, because I am a big dumb warrior and what do I know about mana, nor do I really like Monkly Business with its  rants and requests for God mode, but I have never seen someone go to such lengths to cover his &quot;my class is getting nerfed and I am pissed about it&quot;  feelings on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thott, whining? Say it ain't so.<br />
<br />
 P.S. having a 52 Bard of my own, I can state that while this may effect raid bards due to the 32 song no longer stacking with the AE song, for casual groups it's a good thing. It gives them a non-instrument needed mana song with duration. That being said, maybe some changes will be forthcoming to the 34 song.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thott might be uber, but he's wrong about most of his major claims. Most of his essays are fundamentally flawed. At any rate, bards are clearly over-powered. I've watched bards solo 50-80 mobs in one shot and earn 2.5-3 AA in 20-30 minutes, without ever taking a lick of damage. On the other hand, there are few enough of them around that maybe it doesn't matter much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen someone say this before, and it didn't ring true then either....if he had 50-80 mobs, he wasn't getting any experience.  The other mobs would beat down the primary target too quickly for the bard to break the charm and get exp for the kill.<br />
<br />
So, I hate to do this to a fellow warrior, but I call BS on the 2.5 - 3 AA in 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Bard AE damage songs are point blank songs.  I suppose it would take extended range AA and the like.<br />
<br />
Ok...well, I guess if EVERYTHING went perfectly, no lag, no mistiming, etc,  I suppose it COULD happen.  If that's what he's talking about, I'd LOVE to see it done.<br />

I've just never found it viable.<br />

I appologize that I came off like an ass.  I didn't think past swarm kiting.  And I've been around a long time too! Just ask my wife! She's been an EQ widow for 4+ years. :) Just didn't post on the boards here.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is that I've seen it happen. He rolls into PoV, aggroes everything in sight, takes them out to the flat spot in front of the AD door, and just runs them around and around in a tight circle. Eventually, mobs just start dying.<br />

<br />
tho i think bards and monks are NOT in need of a balance before warriors, booohoooo i cant pull anymore im stuck as a dmg class with a haste glove epic, hey sparky, at least you have a job, im making coffee!</div></div><hr />

He gets 2.5-3 AA a pull, which takes him 20-30 minutes start to finish.<br />

It does not require two bards, though I imagine that's easier.</div></div><hr />

40-50 hoh mobs were being soloed by 1 bard.<br />
<br />
not a group of bards, not 2 bards.. one bard.<br />
<br />
each pull was 2-3 aa's<br />
<br />
yes they lose a few due to the beatdown. <br />
<br />
but when you have 50 mobs who cares if your timeing is off on 3-4?<br />
<br />
yes just because you cannot do it does not mean its impossable.<br />
<br />
oh and there are very few (2-3% maybe) bards that can do this from what i have read. need the right equipment for it.</div></div><hr />

For the game to be fun, everyone needs to feel like they contribute in a reasonable manner. When one is offering less than most, it's a good thing for us to find a way to improve their contribution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">When PoP was being created, bards were at their low point<br />
<br />
Of course, if he use his char just to add &quot;2 clerics in the chain&quot;....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Part of the &quot;fix&quot; for swarming was that there is no longer a limit on how many mobs will attack a charmed mob. This means that if the entire swarm turns on the pet you either get lucky on breaking charm (invis/etc), or your pet is killed for no exp. It used to be limited to 4 mobs and it was much easier to swarm before the change.<br />
<br />
Do I believe it's 2-3aa per half hour? Not really. Is it possible? Yeah, in theory, if EVERYTHING goes perfectly.  Each mob could be 4-5%, so 20-25 mobs per AA, so if he had 50-80 mobs, and was able to drop them all for exp, and killed each mob in 15 to 30 seconds, I guess it could be done.  And there are some extremely skilled bards out there. <br />
<br />
As for the original post, who cares. If all a bard was doing was sitting in a group pulsing 32 mana their skills were going to waste or their guild has WAY too many bards :D  From the bards in my guild, few used the song often, normally only during ressing or if they were bored during downtime. Not going to be all that missed. <br />
<br />
This is still a damn game. Suprises me that people have fun analyzing each and every minor detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hey! Weren't Monks nerfed to the point of uslessness before PoP, and then brought back up to some degree, also before PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>AnielaCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I got bored before I got halfway thru Thott's essay... eeeh... Well, since I have spent the last 10 months playing solely my bard, here's my cp on the bard soloing matter...<br />
<br />
Swarm kiting isn't possible past tier 1 due to level cap on charm. But before the changes in HoH (adding the summoning mobs) a single bard could kite pretty much the whole zone, pull everything to one of the trial basements and AE the bunch. You had to be extremely careful with pathing, but one kite could yield upto 6AA. Personally, I suck at AE kiting, I get my tail handed to me everytime I try. :p Bards generally tend to kite alone, because of the amount of mobs we can pull and kite... Imagine if someone else gained agro on that bunch? *splat*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just for the record<br />
<br />
charm kiting past tier 1 is not really viable, but bards can kite massive amounts with this technique while leveing up.<br />
targetted dot kiting is viable anywhere and about as big a exp timesink as you can get. best used in kiting only grps not really efficient solo tool but doable.<br />
PB AE dot kiting is still viable everywhere. its very hard to do but can reward the skilled and stuborn with large amounts of aa/exp. there was even a nerf in HoH to make it harder to ae kite there.<br />
<br />
as for the 32 mana pulse song. its one of those songs that doesnt work like anything else. bard songs normally run for 18 seconds and then the bard twists(refreshes) it. this song works for 1 Tick so can be refeshed every 6 seconds. its subject to voice modifiers i.e. amplification, shei cloak, voice of the serpent, hydrotha mask etc. I guess this is being viewed as an exploit or outside the vision. conversely bards at 32 are sorely missing a good grp mana regen song. so i think this is a nerf of an exploit and a fix to younger bards. <br />
<br />
from a tactics perspective this bard song used in cleric groups to pump mana to clerics on things like xegony. it sorta acted as a bridge early in the planes for those who didnt have maxxed mana regen. not that its really any fun refreshing a pulse song every 6 seconds for 40 to 70 minutes. can u say carpal tunnel?</div></div><hr />

As soon as he can point me to that classic literature, I'll consider the validity of the claims, but until that point, I'm afraid he is simply applying standards to others which he doesn't apply to himself.</div></div><hr />
