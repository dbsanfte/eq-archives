I'm compiling a list of AA's that are badly worded, misworded, vague, etc and I could use the help of warriors to point out which warrior AA's are wrong<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate any help from warriors who know what they're talking about :) No offense to those who don't but I'm trying to get a list that is as accurate as possible..<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for would be the name of the AA, it's descriiption and how it is incorrect, along with what it does in reality or what it's supposed to do..<br />
<br />
What im NOT looking for is class balance discussions or anything like that :) I really just want an accurate list so I  can send it in..<br />
<br />
Thanks, once again any help is appreciated.. Just post here<br />

Tactical Mastery: Does not negate the riposite damage. It simply allows you to hit throught it. You do not take any less damage when you get this AA.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with an &quot;increased change of making a specialization check&quot;. It is a straight mana reduction on all spells cast.</div></div><hr />

It is a straight mana reduction on all spells cast.Well, it is right, but that's because when your specialization check succeeds, you save mana on that spell. With SCM the check always succeeds, so you always save mana.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, that is not the way the game works. There is no such thing as a spec check, before or after SCM. Spec simply reduces the amount of mana a spell takes, and SCM reduces it further.</div></div><hr />

yep, could't have said it better, i really don't believe that there's an actual &quot;check&quot; that it can fail, and if there is, i've *never* seen a difference where it failed, CH has taken the same % of mana on my cleric *every* cast, like clockwork.</div></div><hr />
