<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize the range slot is not the first thing a warrior thinks about when its time to upgrade but I &quot;think&quot; Im to that point. I am a completely bazaar equiped my warrior. I have 200 fletching and make all my own arrows and really get into trying to do a few points of damage to every mob I pull before I get it back to kill spot. My question is: (1) with my gear would I be better off spending the pp on another slot/weapon upgrade? (2) If I do decide to get a bow, which bow should I pick out of the big 4? (3) Would a faster bow with a decent dd proc get me more agro than a harder hitting bow with more hps and regen? Do these bows proc anymore than the other bows I have had? (4) I would guess the 2 best choices would be the Featherwood Compound Bow or Stonewood Compound Bow would be my best bet since the Featherwood has a &quot;stun&quot; effect = incoming agro but the Stonewood has the most HPs total and added 2 hp regen on it. Any and all advice is welcome. What do you guys use or what would you think is the overall best Bow for a warrior to use?<br />

<br />
1. Featherwood proc isn't a stun, it's actually an aggro debuff, but it's nothing to worry about.  It's basically just 75 extra damage.<br />
<br />
2. Featherwood has same HP as Stonewood.<br />
<br />
3. Featherwood has 35 MR, which is undoubtedly more useful to warriors than 35 DR is.<br />
<br />
I went Featherwood.  The only thing I regret is not having one of each in my bags for resist gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the cheapest :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is saying the Featherwood has more HP because it has STA on it instead of STR<br />
<br />
Heck I would do the Featherwood also when I get the cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Featherwood and stonewood are equal in HP -- 10sta, 100hp.<br />
<br />
The cheapest route works fine if you want to lose 10 sta, but for the marginal price difference, you might as well get the 10 stamina too and then never have to look at the bow slot again as far as the bazaar goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I missed it on the stonewood <br />
<br />
Having taken a better look at them I would have to opt for the Stonewood</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without question you should try to get a stonewood bow.  While AoB isn't that impressive every little bit helps.  On top of that you shouldn't &quot;need&quot; the MR like you might need another resist, warriors have an innate bonus to MR and a lot of warrior gear has it on it.  On the other hand you might find that your DR is quite lacking, I certainly did which was another big bonus for the Stonewood and myself.  I personally wish it was poison instead of disease but I'll be replacing it soon anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your MR is less than 200, go with a featherwood.<br />
<br />
If you don't have 305 AGI, but have MR 200, go featherwood.<br />
<br />
If you value 2 to 4 DPS more damage, go stonewood.  This will not increase your hate per second generated.<br />
<br />
If you are below 150 CR/FR, but 305 AGI and 200 MR, go Obsid/Primo.<br />
<br />
If you failed all of the above, go cheapest.</div></div><hr />
