my regular group goes there a lot and we were having to evac 3-4 times a night due to revenants pathing to the very top and then back to their spawn.<br />
<br />
looks like they have fixed it now, spent the other night there didnt get a single revenant all night.</div></div><hr />

A couple of months ago, my guild did the Master Yael, and I dont remember seeing any of the ghosties...then a couple of weeks ago, we went down for someones spear of fate, and there where these reverants showing up...and ive never seen them before, and didnt realize where they where coming from till we got to their house along with the quest NPC/mob.  Glad to see they fixed this.  I thought they where a new mob since ive never been to that part of the zone before.</div></div><hr />
