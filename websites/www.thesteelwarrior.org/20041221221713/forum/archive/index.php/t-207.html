Less proc, but 2x maybe more the DPS.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, work that 2HB. Greatstaff of Thunder is well worth the investment.</div></div><hr />

Last night on AoW, guess who was top of the hate list when the MT died, over and above a warrior with full offensive AA's wielding red epic and cord hilted thing off PoI dragon ? Yep me with my sole 1 rank in PB.</div></div><hr />

used my formula staff cam out about 2 dw combo came out about .7 so .7 x2 =1.4 so staff has .6 on the dw combo</div></div><hr />

That was the point of his post, to see which one held aggro better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not normally impressed by the performance of a weapon. In the last year my warrior has weilded many combiniations of Frosty, WC, Fleshgrinder, SBoZ, HoH, Defiance, LSoEE, you name it and I probably tried it.<br />
<br />
I got a Windblade and I was pleasantly surprised that it held agro as well as and dual wield combo I had tried.<br />
<br />
Then I got a Gratstaff of Thunder. My 2hb skill as a measly 34 (yeah I know, all other skills are capped!!) and I figured I would work on skill a bit and give this thing a shot.<br />
<br />
HOLY SHIT CAN THIS THING HOLD AGRO!<br />
<br />
In case you missed it ...<br />
<br />
HOLY SHIT CAN THIS THING HOLD AGRO!<br />
<br />
Seriously. It procs like a mad dog and boy does it piss off the mobs. As someone mentioned, it will stun mobs up to level 65 so it will work on exp mobs just about anywhere. Even with my super low 2hb skill this weapon PWNZ. I can't tell you how awesome this is, it's the best item I have ever bought for my warrior.<br />
<br />
I guess I am set for weapons so I can start saving for a BoC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im addicted to my Greatstaff of Thunder!<br />
<br />
When I bought it I had no idea what it looked like I just like the stats.  I knew I need someting a little faster than a Windblade and the fact that it had a proc was just a bonus.  After I bought it I equiped it then hit F9 and quickly crapped my pants!  This thing looks weird as hell.  It doesnt look like what you would think a 2 hand blunt weapon would look like.  It certainly doesnt look like the staff for the icon.  I quickly headed to PoN to group up and try this thing out.  Now remember this is a 2HB weapon.  I had a skill level of &quot;1&quot;!  The very first thing I noticed is that it sounded like a piercing weapon.  I hit F9 and it looks like Im piercing.  I expected myself to be wacking the bad guys not pokeing them.  Then it proc'd.  The proc looks exactly like the SK/Necro spell Fear with the little green skulls floating around.  The very next thing I noticed was that I was tanking mobs that conned red to me with a skill level of &quot;1&quot;.  This weapon is just wacky and I firmly believe whoever designed it was smoking crack! Crack is good, game designers need to smoke more crack!<br />
<br />
Finally an excellent agro/dps dropable weapon that the average player can obtain that is just plain fun to use.  Thank you SOE!</div></div><hr />

Pur steal!  The staff is a great weapon.  the DPS is so-so, but the agro is insane.  I can actually keep agro in groups no problem, even against my friend with his staff of flowing water.  It is truly a great weapon.  Buy it and keep it because it rocks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad everyone caught onto this... I gotta agree with everyone else.  Last time I was in steelwarrior serverwide chat and someone asked for a good agro weapon... I linked it, and everyone scoffed.<br />
<br />
Glad to see things have changed :D  This weapon is incredibly underpriced (at least on my server, goes for 25kish) for the amount of agro/dps it produces.  It is a streaky proccer, but the proc imo outagros my CHSD's taunting blow... one proc from greatstaff and I can hold through tash/slow without a hitch.<br />
<br />
I'm seriously considering going back to it once I get a 41% haste item that fits in a slot other than secondary :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Yeppers, it do hold aggro well.  I can hold aggro away from an almost identical warrior usin' a windblade, but, sadly, me armour isn't as good as his, so the cleric usually requests HIM to be MA..../sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I go back and forth between a frosty/SBoZ/Spiked Velium Mallet/Seb Croaker 1-hander mix-and-match, the great staff of thunder, Windblade, and War Marshall's Bladed Staff. Here's how I see aggro, purely from an &quot;it feels like it&quot; perspective, because I've given up on parsing for the time being:<br />
  Great Staff of Thunder -- Great aggro, if a bit spotty at times against even/yellow/red con mobs. I've heard from other people that the proc's small knockback can be a detriment, but I've not noticed a problem with it.<br />
  War Marshall's Bladed Staff -- No proc, but a great ratio in a fast tradeable weapon makes this one a winner. It's one for reliable get-and-keep aggro operations. This one is still my favorite all-around 2-hander (yes, there are better out there and, no, I can't get some of the uber no-drop stuff just yet, not enough DKP ;) ).<br />
  My 1-handers (Switfblade of Zek, Frostbringer, Spiked Velium Mallet, Sebilite Croaking Dirk) -- I call this my &quot;keeping the skills up&quot; weapons because, except in a few special situations, they don't hold a candle for aggro to the Greatstaff or the War Marshall's Staff. Still, they aggro better than the Windblade, at least for gaining initial aggro and on short fights.<br />
  Windblade -- AWESOME damage, but kind of slow and hard to gain aggro with it. The longer the fight lasts the better your chances, though, because it really piles on the DPS. I keep this one around for when I'm not MT/MA in raids.<br />
These are the personal observations of a level 57 warrior with very few useful AA's (I keep telling myself I'll get AA when I reach 60....we'll see) and not all tanking situations are the same, so your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up a GoT yesterday for 16.5k (absolute steal) and damn, it is nasty!  I still got benched in an xp group in favor of a 63 SK because the chanter was too lazy to let me build aggro.  After the SK left, we got another 64 warrior who was dual wielding.  Before I logged I pulled out the GoT again just to see what I could do and the poor dude simply could not get aggro off me.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to using this more often.  I've banked or sold all my one handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost exclusively group with my wizard and my higher level friends, but last night I wasn't in the mood to 2-box so I decided to go LFG on my warrior. I got in a group with a 61 war who had been tanking for the group for some time. He was dual weilding, they where PoP or LoY era weapons because I did not recognize them. He seemed to hold agro well enough that the shaman was not taking a beating when he slowed pretty early. At least one of the weapons had a proc, not sure what it was, but I did see an emote mob_34 staggers.<br />
<br />
I started with my DW set up - SBoZ+HoH. With CoF+50% shammy haste I was able to crank out DPS at will. No problems at all pulling agro.<br />
<br />
I switched to Windblade to crank up the DPS a little. Again not too much of a problem. I did pull agro a few times when I would get a string of big hits, but it was easy enough to drop agro by turning off attack.<br />
<br />
Finally, I busted out the GST. I was not entirely surprised but the effect was even more pronounce that I anticipated. I pulled agro early and often. I would often have to turn attack off for long periods of time to lose agro - upwards of 10-15 seconds. Backing away from the mob only made the mob follow me. The proc generared neck snapping agro - without fail the mob would turn to me on every proc. With the 56 shaman buffs I had on I had 200+ DEX so the GST was procing like a mofo. After a few mobs I had to bag the weapon because I was taking agro too much agro.<br />
<br />
Buying a GST has been the best purchase I have ever made, truly worth its weight in platinum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was pulling aggro last night off an SK with GST and i was attacking late and staying at max melee range.  He was chain casting to keep aggro.  I admittedly loved the fact that he was getting his ego severly bruised after bragging to a lot of people that NO ONE ever gets aggro off him.  <br />
<br />
I am really believing that this weapon is the reason why Verant claims that they are happy with the class balance for Tanks.  At this point the only time I need to use Taunt is when the slower likes to land slow early.  <br />
<br />
The best part is that the dps alone keeps me close enough to the top of the hate list that if slow pulls aggro off of me, a single Taunt gets it back 99% of the time.  The rest of the 1% of the time if it procs before Taunt refreshes, aggro is mine anyways.  <br />
<br />
I used this in BoT with a Hunter GAR and two 65 Marauder Rogues.  Absolutely no isues with maintaining aggro after slow.  (or holding it through slow either really as mentioned above :)<br />
<br />
So all warriors who can get this need to get one and let a Pally or SK MT and pull aggro off of them ALL the time.  Start demonstrating to whoever has been whining about warriors holding aggro that Warriors can take care of business.  <br />
<br />
There is, however, a VERY important caveat.  You better have good armor.  Cause in most pulls the mob is going to be locked on to you ALL the time.  You won't get that 4 second respite while the mob runs over to the Shaman to slap him silly for slowing him that will allow the cleric to pump a CH.  You will get beat down.  <br />
<br />
With enough hps and AC though your group will love you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got a Norge`Tal yesterday! OMG!<br />
<br />
For mobs where the proc on it is not resisted its fantastic. Need to be at a decent haste level though ideally since its a bit slow. <br />
<br />
Given that you are at 100% or more though it has the aggro of the Greatstaff with the dps of the Warmashall's bladed staff.<br />
<br />
It really came into its own last night just crawling through Hate's Fury with no cleric. Some fights the mobs never got to hit me as I chained 6 second stuns!<br />
<br />
Of course now I have to keep all 3 on me. Most PoP mobs resist the Norge`Tal, so the greatstaff is still very useful against casters there and if I am not MT I'll use the Warmarshall's still to stop myself ripping aggro onto myself.</div></div><hr />
