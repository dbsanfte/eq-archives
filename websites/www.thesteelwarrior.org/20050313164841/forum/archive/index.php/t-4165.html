They got them all mezzed and the tank we had assigned as MA was right behind me so everything was great... until somebody rezzed me! So I asked for buffs and went and got a drink and came back and they were still killing the spiders :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The frustrating part about this encounter is when the CH rot is smooth as silk, but the add groups are floundering. Both need to be running smooth to win.</div></div><hr />

They had soooo much damned hp at first.  One warrior tanking Xegony would sometimes spawn the next wave before we could kill them all.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it was because too many people were afk at that point or running around trying to get their PoTime key piece, but we had a LOT of people on them still and they were dying soooooooooo slow.</div></div><hr />

Getting to Xegony is super stupid, Sony is wasting our time -- Raid members suicide near zone in and get hooked to be summoned corpse and ressed to Xegony playground.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQSgmorris</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i find this fight a pain in the ass little like fennin if the MA die's and your SA and your not at the top of the hate last you can kiss half your cvlerics good bye nd pry you can get agro befor you lose the res tof the clerics<br />
we have tryed this ho many times yet to down her but where geting there.<br />
just hope they dont nerf her like RZ. IF you cant bet her then you should not get a hand me down from SoEi was pissed win ther nerfd RZ.<br />
<br />
my server has 2 many uper guild's and elemnets are geting to be hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its not that bad, we have 7-8 EP guilds and only thing perma killed is Coirnav and thats from euro guilds wiping learning it. Xegony u can put a second MT on at max range with a druid healing AE if you really dont trust your clerics. DI is hardly used with us and it usually fades, her DPS is much more predictable then Fennin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">her DPS is much more predictable then Fennin. <br />
<br />
Man I dunno if we've been killing a different xegony than you but xegony we fight has crazy spikey dps, wouldnt call her predictable by any means - you never know when a bad round &amp; riposte is gonna dish out 8k+ to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, we never have any problems with Xegony's melee, but when we fight Fennin there's lots of puckered sphincters.  While she technically can do 8K+ per round, her tendency to one round a tank with AC over 2K is far lower than Fennin's imho, and due to fuxxored pathing nodes where we fight Fennin, his drift is far, far, far worse.<br />
<br />
As far as losing a tank, we've had some sloppy fights where we have had to transition multiple times...best scenario is later in the fight....tank goes down, wizards get summoned 1 by 1, SA has time to get the chain set and take over while ranger/beastlord spam heals keep him alive ;)  If she drifts and you lose some chain healers, just spam heal MT thru transition disc, rez the downed clerics and have them Divine Rez themselves and slot back into the chain.<br />
<br />
Then again, our dretardation (thanks Tork~) is usually at an all-time low when we fight her.  Which is probably why we love this fight so much.</div></div><hr />

Xegs melee is more forgiving though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have your second tank melee at an angle where she can't riposte.  The AE damage is trivial.  You can assign an extra shaman to cure it or you can just heal the damage.  Even with the slow effect on Winds of Xegony the 2nd tank should have considerably more aggro than whatever your clerics are getting.</div></div><hr />

So, i have been putting together a strategy and info about the Xeg encounter on the boards at my guild website and have just a few questions if any would be so kind as to answer for me.  One of my questions is what level are the non named adds that she spawns during the fight?  Is an off tank needed or just zerg force them?  Also, do the anyone know the names off the sets of adds off the top of their heads?  Searched on allakhazam but it said nothing of whether they were summoned mobs or not.  Anyway, thanks for your time, this fairy's going down soon :) .</div></div><hr />

i got a bit tired of looking at feet all the time meself... here's whatcha do...<br />

hit F9 twice, and you'll be looking at the back of your own head, then alt+up arrow and you can look the mob dead in the eye. helps a ton on stuff like firetail and dawneyes cuz you can tell which way their facing.<br />

But you have to make sure not to agro the other mobs, that are around xeg spawn point since they can not be mez.   If you agro the big elemental guards, get a tank on them, since they can not be mez.<br />
<br />
ie:  Get the level 60 spell speed of the brood for your enchanters, so they can haste you for the raid.</div></div><hr />

Dont need alot of ench like 4-5 covers it.  And yeah named arent too hard either disc not really needed. keep someone to cure mt and clerics from ae and focus on add control once you have mt down then it is a cake event</div></div><hr />

Spider boss AE silences, the rest cast diseased cloud which is like 1250dd and slow. make sure everyone has DR and AE song<br />
<br />
Spiders and Bees have most HPs and if your melee has em disc Xeg guards if agroed or bosses<br />
<br />
We just keep Xegony paralell to wall and have one paladin keep her close to MT<br />
<br />
Healers with ER4 sword or PoE bracers &gt; AE<br />
<br />
We actually have Wizzies stand at add spawn points and AE em to agro em to add team. Works well, anyway u can to not let em get to Clerics.<br />
<br />
Highsunning Xegony when raid is a wipe = adds despawn and Reset and go again. When MT goes down we highsun and already are trying again in 5 mins</div></div><hr />

We lost though, but revised the strat and are ready to kill the biotch the next time she is up</div></div><hr />
