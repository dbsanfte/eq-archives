<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is your opinion of OOW so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What my guild has done of the MPG raid trials has been pretty fun and interesting.  Crazy objectives/things you have to do, fun stuff though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jadesii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't bought it yet, so I can not really form an informed opinion. However, what I have seen so far is at the very least, intriguing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from the first glance, OoW doesn't seems to follow GoD, as the lore pretends, but rather stays before in game progression. But since its much easer to play within I will just forget about it and say it's an OK expension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was getting pretty bored of EQ, even playing my friends bst sometimes.  OoW has brought the fun back to the game.  It has new spots I can go to xp and nice loot drops.  I think its a pretty good expansion.  I also like the only 1 zone is a flag zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So far I'm pretty happy with it.  It offers alot of content to the majority of players who didnt get much from GoD.  Someone posted that they like how zones aren't flagged, I would prefer it the other way tbh.  But I can see the point, it's just aggrivating to have asshats chattering away in ooc, or training zonelines that make no sense, which wouldn't normally happen in yxxta/qvic etc.  Hell, even KT has become idiotland now that vxed/tipt have been made easier.<br />
<br />
The raid events in MPG...pretty damn fun.  Some of them need some more tuning, but they put alot of thought into these, and it shows.  The one group events seem easier then they should be for the loot that you get, but I suppose we're a bit overgeared for them.<br />
<br />
Only having one flagged zone, that doesn't appear to be hard to get flagged for, may end up boring the top guilds, we'll see when we get there I guess.  Should be pretty soon ;)  God knows it can't be worse then tacvi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aielman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My issue is with the lag and the xp per mob...the former being ridiculously high, and the latter being too low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sad to say, I miss flagged/keyed zones already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sukrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Content wise, OoW is great, fun wise, OoW is great.  However running two clients at the same time is causing some people to blue screen in addition to extreme lag.  <br />
<br />
Time for an upgrade I guess :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the majority of oow is great due to the fact of the summit basically, they scraped it all after and redid it more throughouly, nothing seems buggy, nothing seems crashing zones, maybe a virtual memory error now and then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't own it either....but ( unlike GoD ) ... I want to purchase this expansion solely on what people's feedback is about it. I figure on that idea alone it was worth a comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven't fought there much, but I have a few friends who have and I only hear good things from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dafthaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't have it yet =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deerboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i dont have it yet but am thinking of getting it soon hopfully till then seeya all soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I didn't buy it. Which is good, 'cause I probably wouldn't log in much anyhow. Oh well, Fitemore fades to dust...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>madhacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What is your opinion of OOW so far?<br />

I like it.fun zone's well thought out for camp for single groups(one group pu's).reminds me of the older expasions.dont have to be uber or in one of the top 5 guild to get good loot and a good time.train's have away's been and part of this game.CB at level 70 least it's not boring. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now wait 2 or 3 months and give the same poll again.   :)</div></div><hr />
