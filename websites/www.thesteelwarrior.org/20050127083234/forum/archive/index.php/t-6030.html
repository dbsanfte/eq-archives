Frankly I did not think it would ever sell at that price. That has surely got to be a server wide high for a price paid for a single warrior weapon. Thats not a typing error, thats almost 1/2 million PP for a single item.<br />
<br />
Just shows you how valuable that item is now, or it shows that the servers are flooded with Plat..... <br />
<br />
Naturally I didn't sell the one I actually have for use heh.... I had 2 and sold one.<br />
<br />
Man how far I have come from the days of selling a cracked staff for 1pp made my day.</div></div><hr />

Frankly I have not seen a item advertized for sale on Sullon (cept guys that selling bat wings for 1million pp or junks like that) ever for that much. Seen BoC for 350,000 recently but nothing over 400K.... <br />

I'll be the first to admit that emarr's economy has always been jacked, but good greif man, as others have said stuff sells for 100s of K all the time.  I'd bet it does on your server to.  Do you not go into the bazaar often or something? How can you not be aware of this?</div></div><hr />

Right now 115K for a Fungie is the server high warrior item.... I got my BoC for like 250K...

<br />
I check the bazzar 3-4 times a day, and my seller is up 100percent of the time I don't play, I have 6 guys to equip and am not in a guild so Bazzar is almost 95percent of my lootz....</div></div><hr />

As far as my magelo, yea I do have alot of stuff, always been a collector of interesting and rare stuff.  However I did win the Bladestorm at a GM event last year, so I have not had it since it dropped.  Still neat to have however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol i never understood what people see in that item. i think what im learning here is if you have something rare AND valuable then you are a target of ebayers scammers plat buyers and so on and can set the price thru the roof.<br />
<br />
but the elder beads? those things arent even rare! so now what do i do with my rallos zek helm? put that up for a million and hope someone buys it? i mean i never see it for sale and then all ofa sudden there is one for 100k and i buy it. could i really get a million for it because someone out there was given 10 million plat for his birthday and wants to spend it if it kills him?<br />
<br />
might be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elder beads = priceless <br />
<br />
I had some in the bank several months back, looked at them, thought they were crap and sold them for like 1k.  Someone got rich quick off me I am thinking.  :(<br />
<br />
I always keep my eyes out for bargains.  I picked up boots of the storm for 20k about a month back, on Stromm nonetheless.  There are some up for sale now for 175k.  Some of the prices on Stromm are just nuts, 75k for a wind-worn handblade, but some knucklehead will probably pay that much for it.  I've been looking for a cobalt bracer forever, but the only one for sale is 75k and no way in hell I'm paying that.  I wish people would just stop paying stupid prices for gear, if they did that then people wouldn't charge stupid prices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-scouting/pre-targeting mobs (nice for this)<br />
-poor man's tracking; eyeball in wall (not real kosher)<br />
-eye hammering (OT hammer vs. eyeball = gate... eventually)<br />
-some fairly obscure reasons you might want to have a corpse on demand.<br />
<br />
All of those can be done with stalking probes and/or the spider drop from sol b, but infinite charges &gt;&gt;&gt; consumables (esp for eyeball hammering).<br />
<br />
I'd kill for a shieldstorm. :/  <br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. there's also a trivially quested clicky item that has 5 (?) charges of bind sight, requires some sarnak blood, some running around in pok, and a trip to drooga.  Reflecting pool of somethingorother iirc, quest starts in POK.</div></div><hr />

People with lifetaps can simply lifetap themselves to heal.  62+ SKs can bring up an eye during downtime for their healer and hit it with Zevfeers to give some mana once a minute.<br />
<br />
It's a small benefit, but having it available is powerful in different cases.  Will it make a difference in a boss fight, probably not.  In exp groups?  It can be a big help.</div></div><hr />

Since when were they not rare? I think there may be 20ish max on our server.  And yea they are really handy, I use them in LDoN and other areas all the time.</div></div><hr />

Necro reason is the best reason like someone already said.  They can go into lich mode to slowly transfer their HPs into mana, and tap the eye at the same time regaining those HPs.  Way ups their mana regen.</div></div><hr />

1.1 million plat is a helluva lot of stalking probes. :\<br />
<br />
Oh...and apart from the peeps with million-plat rusty short swords, the priciest item I've seen recently in the bazaar on The Nameless was a BoC for 600K (then again, I tend to only look at druid/warrior/rogue items...there could be other stuff for other classes that is more expensive).<br />
<br />
So...anyone on The Nameless wanna sell me a Flayed Barbarian Skin Mask for 87230pp? &lt;-- That's how much I'm worth...I might be able to scrape up another 8 gold 3 silver and 5 copper...maybe. Heck, I'll even throw in the grimling contraption my rogue is currently wearing! That'll make it an attractive 90K or so! :P ;) (Flayed Barbarian Skin Masks are selling for 240K'ish....ugh)</div></div><hr />

Truncheon of Doom and the Earthshaker.  I looked in bazaar to see the prices on them and nobody had an earthshaker for sale and someone had a ToD for 350k on their trader.<br />

In a very specific situation that rarely happens in EQ.  I have an earthshaker, I know how it works, but I would never consider paying that much for one.  It is a toy at best.</div></div><hr />

*gasp* wow.  Does the Truncheon not drop anymore?  I know that I tried to get one a few months back, and spent countless days killing that frog with nothing to show for it.  Then finally saw one for sale in Bazaar for 9k and picked it up.  Did I get extremely lucky on that?  Or is this guy selling one for 350k just high?</div></div><hr />

The market is flooded with plat, thats why people are paying whatever for most any item.<br />

<br />
I know the trader you speak of.  He jacks up all his prices in an attempt to drive up the market by creating veiled utility out of thin air.<br />
<br />
Nobody buys from him.  And the ToD isn't worth anywhere near 350.<br />
<br />
The true value of an item is based on what folks pay for it, never what they might pay or what someone else thinks they should pay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, SZ's bazaar must truly suck.  Even on Stromm there is a lot of ornate plate available.  I just bought a BP for 100k and gloves for 55k.  I haven't checked prices on other servers, but for Stromm that's really reasonable, and there's usually anywhere from half a dozen to over a dozen pieces available at most times.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit, thats what that little zit lives for.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I had TWO earthshakers (and only one warrior). I sold One of my Two earthshakers for 444K then bought another for 200K. Now I have two again, at 244K profit....<br />
<br />
Using the one on my warrior a lot lately.... but like last night we (in addition to my 6 guys, a bard, a better warrior and a slower were in the group, my 3 wizards were out of group) set up and did two good pulls and then in comes an enemy chanter (who modem plugs so he's oor when yur right next to him) who shut us down for 2 hours while I try and kill him ...... SZ is not an easy path 20percent extra bonus or not.....<br />

Also if you look at my current magalo you will see that I probably have some of the best agro weapons possible.....</div></div><hr />

Wow, SZ's bazaar must truly suck.  Even on Stromm there is a lot of ornate plate available.  I just bought a BP for 100k and gloves for 55k.  I haven't checked prices on other servers, but for Stromm that's really reasonable, and there's usually anywhere from half a dozen to over a dozen pieces available at most times.  <br />

Sullon Zek has to be the worst bazaar ever. Jacked-up prices, expensive resist gear, and nazi sellers = bad.</div></div><hr />

I don't consider it a waste at all. Sold that shitty 19/13 Mirror 3 hammer from LDoN for 60k, looked in the bazaar, saw cobalt bracer for the first time -ever- at 74k. Figured that was a good trade :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I bet that Ornate Stone Hammer for 60k went fast on Stromm.  :)  There was a cobalt bracer for sale for 74k for about hmm...  3 weeks.  I think the guy started at 75k then went down to 73.9k, hehe.  However, a few weeks before that there was one for sale for 40k, it stayed up for about 3-4 days.  I thought about buying it, almost did, but decided it was still too much.  I offered 30k, but I'm sure the seller knew he could get 40k no problem.  I am sure it will be awhile before another comes up for sale, but I always group with a shaman, so it's not a big priority for me.  Although if I see one for 40k again I'll snatch it up probably....<br />

I still won't overpay for gear even if I know that is the only way I can get it.  I have boots of the storm I paid 20k for.  Most of the rest of my gear I just paid fair prices for.  I just wait for prices to become reasonable....  but I am a bazaar rat so it's easy for me to wait because I enjoy looking for gear.</div></div><hr />
