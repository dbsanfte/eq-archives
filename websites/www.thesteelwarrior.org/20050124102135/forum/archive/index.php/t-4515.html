<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a Soulscream Belt (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65570) in the waist slot and a Moss-Covered Cape (not in Lucy yet, so: +12 AC, +7 vsMg, +7 vsFire, +7 vsCold, +7 vsPos, +7 vsDis, +70 HP, +70 Mana). This gives me 21 raw AC, 160 HP's (counting STA), and 31% haste.<br />
<br />
I have the opportunity to replace the above two pieces of equipment with a Heavy Rubicite Girdle (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27854) and a Cloak of Flames (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11621), which would give me 35 raw AC, 159 HP's (counting STA), and 36% haste. However, the cost to do this is 110Kpp, minus whatever I can get by selling off the soulscream belt and the moss cape...figure about 32Kpp, so my total cost is about 78Kpp.<br />
<br />
I group a lot with a chanter, so my haste tends to be close to the cap at all times, but my STA is not maxed for my level. Given this, the difference in haste is close to negligible for me, so the only real gain I see is in the AC.<br />
<br />
Thus my question really is: does it seem worth it to spend 78Kpp on 14 raw AC and a very minor upgrade in haste? Am I perhaps missing some benefit that is obvious to anyone else and that would make the HRG/CoF worth the extra plat?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What earrings do you have? 2 Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement would be a better way to spend that 78k (and still have 38k left)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd keep what you have and go for those.</div></div><hr />

My Magelo is pretty current, except maybe for the skills, so AC and ATK may be off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd use the cash to fix your face and head.  raldukan helm and maybe the veksar mask (kylong? can't member the name but there's a full suit avail of it and it's chain and up). more ac, sta, hp's and saves and you'll still have loads of cash left over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;and you'll still have loads of cash left over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Always a good strategy.<br />
<br />
My only question though, is ... what is it you plan to spend the loads of cash you have left-over on exactly?<br />
<br />
A cloak of flames will remove the need to upgrade your haste for quite some time, thus easing the stress you feel to get that 41 percent haste item if you ever do start &quot;raiding&quot; or killing mobs that drop 41 percent haste items.<br />
<br />
Also, it will give you an edge over your standard, pickup group bretheren who on the average run around with 31 percent haste (the soulscream belt is quite the rage these days). Which will, here and there, benefit your DPS and aggro capabilities.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's worth the 110 k.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying, it's worth considering what it is you want out of your 110k.<br />
<br />
Haste is a good investment. The cloak of flames is still one of the top notch haste items in the game, and will provide you with some palpable benefits.<br />
<br />
If you've got a huge shopping list of items you want to upgrade or spend plat on, then yes, the save your platz route is probably the way to go.<br />
<br />
But if you're pretty happy with your gear, and that 78k or so would just sit there in your bank, not being spent on anything ... then why not splurge and get the better haste?<br />
<br />
Sorry. You've probably asked yourself this question many times too. Heh.<br />
<br />
I can be an impulse buyer at times in EQ, so maybe I'm not the best to be giving purchase advice too.<br />
<br />
But I have worn a cloak of flames for a long, long time. And I felt it was worth the effort it took to get it, as I simply just ignored competing for haste upgrades until I entered Vex Thal, when they became much easier to obtain.<br />
<br />
One raid I attended, the shiny trinket of speed dropped, and about 12 people were vying for it, for example.<br />
<br />
The haste boots I got from VT, it was between me and one other person.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoF + Heavy Rubi Girdle is the way to go.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's also the best there is.  Get it, and you don't have to worry about those 2 slots again ever.  Yes, it's expensive, but you're going to want them eventually.  Get them outta the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, what does that girdle sell for anyways? Never see them in the bazaar and I have one I need to price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been told on our server selling channel that it sells for 10K or so for the belt. I have 14K and have been looking for weeks but I have not seen a single belt sold. I have friends even in uber guilds trying to get me one for 10K but still no luck on any being sold. I am about ready to give up on this belt and say it is a fake :P..............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm .. with 110k you might look for something even better.<br />
I might be wrong here, but isn't the Helmet of Rallos Zek down about 100-120 kpp by now ?<br />
<br />
Helmet of Rallos Zek (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8171) <br />
AC: +55 Str: +15 Sta: +15 Magic Resist: +15 HP: +100<br />
<br />
The difference over your old Tae Ew War Helm would be :<br />
+31 AC<br />
+15 STR<br />
+15 STA<br />
+75HP<br />
+15 Magic Resist<br />
<br />
-4 AGI<br />
-4 DEX<br />
-3 Fire Resist<br />
-3 Disease Resist<br />
-40 Mana<br />
<br />
The iteresting here is the whooping increase of +75 raw HP and 31 raw AC from just one piece of armor that you wouldn't have to worry about for a long time too. Heck, it has more AC than your breastplate. :D<br />
<br />
If you can get one for that price offcourse, but I think it would be worth looking for.</div></div><hr />

Im not planning on touching that slot for a while.The built in ultravision and see invis is nice beside the stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, and if a Helmet of Rallos Zek is too expensive, you might be able to buy a couple of Ornate Armor molds. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montagor</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference in haste between the CoF and Soulscream belt is only 5%, clearly NOT the way to go for that kind of pp.  Save your pp for a better helm (read Anker's post).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Therris-Thule we have some ornate molds going for as low as 8k on ones people really want to get rid of and get cash from, but now they are starting to go up because of LDoN.  Not as many groups killing in PoP.  Plate Bp has gone for as low as 125k (lowest ive seen it at), but bracers and gaunts are 20k to 40k max.  Ornate is also some really good gear and you wont need to replace it for a long time.  GL with your choise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same choices to face. Of course I am not limited for Pp as my Im spending all the income from 6 toons on the warrior right now heh... <br />
<br />
I went with CCoM, CoGP and HRG..... Got the FAceguard of Bentos for the see ivisible...<br />
<br />
See my megelo.<br />
<br />
That Cloak of Greater Purnicity is just to good with the 25STr and 50HP and 10Sta and the 25Cha for DI.... <br />
<br />
I just could not justify losing so much stats with the CoF.<br />
<br />
One theory I am going with is to get the ornate where the effeict is useful (legs, BP and maybe hands if you dont box with a chanter like I do) and royal attendant in the other slots (bracers espically). <br />
<br />
I really rounded out my guy now.. no really weak slots (bracers is next for upgrades) that neck was very hard to come by but 50K was worth it.</div></div><hr />
