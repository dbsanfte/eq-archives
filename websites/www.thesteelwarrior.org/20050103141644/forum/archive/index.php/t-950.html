<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So my guild and our ally decide that tonight we're going to try the Storm Lords in PoS.  I'm thinking cool, this should be fun!  New baddies to kill =)<br />
<br />
Nearly 5 hours later, desert and ocean lords dead.  We're happy we killed them, but geez, we got a handful of items, which are ok at best, and crap as far as RVR.<br />
<br />
So, if your guild wants to see if you can kill the Storm Lords, go for it, but don't expect anything out of it but a lot of time.  I mean, I'm not unhappy about the loot anywhere near as much as I am for the sheer amount of time we spent killing the Ocean giants once we killed the &quot;fake&quot; lord.  Killing them was an accomplishment, but unless you have many spare hours to kill, I wouldn't go after them.  They pretty much don't mean anything.<br />
<br />
Please tell me that future time sinks in PoP are slightly more interesting until you get to PoEarth.</div></div><hr />

Low ZEM + even lower drop rate = SoE's definition of fun  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it was nice they put the medallions on the lesser 65 named but yah its not worth your time to do pos lords, takes too long to pull all the giants to spawn the lord. they should be 3 day spawns and always targetable.<br />
<br />
however if you are keying up for bot, and bunch of ppl need the beards/sashes/bones anyways, might as well knock em off. especially the forest one, probably the easiest to clear.<br />
<br />
in general, all pop needs 2 more loots per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">best farm mobs i seen so far in teir 3 are in tactics, easy to get to and spawn every 3 days. several can done with 2 groups if ppl take the time to do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah you realy dont start getting good stuff till RZ and MM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">supposedly the 67 tower bosses in BoT will drop loot everytime in a patch or two. the tactics mini named are already like this and take less time to clear to. you will always get an item/mold + a rune and spec normally. they spawn daily too, not 3 days, VZ/TZ/RZ are 3 days. VZ/TZ doesnt take too many ppl either after you figure it out, VZ a little easier imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These guys definately have some screwed up RvR for as tough as they are.  Worst part about em is not that the items suck, its that they only drop ONE goddamned item per kill... I mean seriously, who wants to take an hour clearing for ONE damned item, especially when each lord has at least one shit drop.  An hour of clearing, then a fight in which a dozen+ people die, all for a 12/18 scimitar... joy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're thinking of PoS minis... the guys that are 2 group doable anymore.<br />
<br />
the lords in PoS are the ones that are pretty comparable to AoW in difficulty, with several differences.  However, the single largest difference seems to be that the RvR is so insanely crappy that they aren't even worth glancing at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL,<br />
<br />
We used to farm those guys when we were getting people keyed up for BoT.  They'd drop 4 medallions each and were the source of medallions.  You basically HAD to kill them multiple times to get a guild keyed up for BoT.... once we had gotten done, they introduced the minis.  Talk about going through a crapload of work and having it taken from under you by changing flag requirements.</div></div><hr />
