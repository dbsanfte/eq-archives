I dont have any Extended shielding.<br />
<br />
We both tested on the same PC who was sitting down, inched towards the person one step at a time doing /shield seeing how the ranges differed with a warrior the AA and a warrior without the AA.  The result was my warrior friend was able to shield our target 3 steps further than I was able to shield, now I dont know but... 24 aa's is alot to spend on this type of AA, I would have thought this AA would have doubled the range at least!  My impression is, each skill train = 1 step extra shielding distance, so I wouldnt go out and buy this AA it doesnt do that much from my standpoint, the /shield skill is one of the nicest skills we have that gives us a bit of diversity.  Wonder if anyone else has noticed this AA ability not living up to what they'd expect it to be^.^) personally would rather get warlords tenacity max'd out than this!</div></div><hr />

I was pretty surprised that the range didn't at least double. As you stated, the difference is literally about 3 feet.<br />
<br />
As someone in another thread said, this is one of those skills that sounds great on the drawing board but ended being one of those HAHA GOTHCHA! type skills from SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield has a range of 15 locs.<br />
<br />
When I tested it in beta, Extended Shielding 3 parsed out at 30 locs.<br />
<br />
I'll get it before Strengthened Strike and Packrat.</div></div><hr />
