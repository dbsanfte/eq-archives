<br />
hasn't been a date of release announced yet, but looks impressive, new epics, more aa/skills, raised level cap, check it out. discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">thats what we need, another expansion while the newest one out is still all fucked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I certainly hope that the second Epics involve the first set in some way.  From the sound of it it almost seems like a separate quest.  That would be  areal burn to those of us who went through the hellish tasks ours entails.<br />
<br />
And I certainly hope this will be their last expansion for awhile. These things are flying out like popcorn lately and if they can get them out this fast they sure as hell can combine them into a single expasion to make them more worth the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh look, rather than ADDING to it, lets just make it a FUCKING SELLING POINT for another CRAPPY expantion.<br />
<br />
let me guess? time level only need apply for new epics?<br />
<br />
they cant get it thru their heads, we would like more content given to us for the fucking 15$ we pay a month, not expect us to buy a buggy, shitty expantion.<br />
<br />
unless its flawless on launch day, i hope they choke<br />
<br />
&quot;these weapons are for the upper end of the spectrum only&quot;<br />
<br />
so fuck the rest of us that put weeks of time and raids into our first one? yah, fuck you to<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
/assnine off<br />
<br />
/anger repressed<br />
<br />
...sigh...<br />
<br />
i am going to write them a letter to explain how i feel about having 2 expantions in a row that only make the game fun and exciting for 10% of us in it, it makes me really upset to see such great and awsome content, then relise that 90 percent of us wont even see the new rats :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On the ordering page, it said that it is expected to be released on July 27th, 2004.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">looks impressive <br />
<br />
Uhhh, nothing looks impressive about EQ anymore.  It all looks like unfinished, buggy shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">when this game will come out, they better let it go live COMPLETE, not some chit like GoD was, targeted for only maybe 200 player per server.<br />
<br />
They have to. WoW is coming out and they should make the player have fun and not try to grab them in a succession of meaningless trials you need class X or preflag Y, and where you can only obtain the story of the things you need to do not on a website.<br />
<br />
Epic 2, new titles, new abilities... We'll see. I will wait before preordering, to see if they can really add more fun to the game or just &quot;more work&quot;.<br />
<br />
And guild tribute, improved graphics, new levels... thoser are selling arguments I dont care. I want FUN, GAMING EXPERIENCE. not just a grind a la Lineage II.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you hate it so much, then why dont you just stop playing and paying for your accounts now :P<br />
<br />
I think it'll be an OK expansion. New epics have been bitched about for how long now? Now all of sudden they introduce it and you guys are mad? /boggle<br />
Sony, imo, have been steadily trying to work their expansions to single group content whether it's elemental group geared or normal everyday group geared; while, yet, still having the high end content available for those no life having raiders :P sorry, tis the truth, lol :P<br />
<br />
But I do agree, fix the 'latest' expansion as best you can before slapping another one on the table to basically forget about any problems with it.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dude, you're not thinking of actually BUYING this shit are you?<br />
<br />
I'm serious, I better not hear one fucking word of complaining from ANYONE here, because you all know goddamned well what this expansion is going to contain, and it's going to be garbage.  If anyone buys this and is actually surprised that X doesn't work, or this is bugged and incomplete, you should seriously consider seeking professional help for your poor decision making abilities.<br />
<br />
SPEAK WITH YOUR WALLETS.  PLEASE.  Stop encouraging this company to produce shit, thus lowering the amount of work that the genre deems acceptable for releasing a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Uhhh, nothing looks impressive about EQ anymore. It all looks like unfinished, buggy shit.<br />
<br />
Amen.  And I absolutely refuse to buy another expansion where unless I go get myself PoTime geared I don't get crap from it of use but some cheesey quests I don't want to do and some subar tradeskill items I can't even make because the crap for them drop in a zone that eats your soul if you don't have 400 AA and gear up the butt.<br />
<br />
Enough.  SoE needs to stop trying to claim to be accommodating both the uber player and the casual player in every expansion.  People are getting tired of being freaking lied to like they're complete dumbasses.<br />
<br />
And it would be nice, just for once, if when released all the content was actually there and worked reasonably well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
how dumb can you be? we wanted new epics we could ATTAIN, anyone with a epic has ALREADY put a ton of time into it, and making it elemental plus would be fucing retarded, and i bet that is what they plan to do.<br />
<br />
this is the first expantion im going to wait for the review on before i buy it, i have pretty much switched to CoH for my MMO needs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hahahahahaha...they just dont have a clue, it is almost funny to watch (in a sad way). <br />
<br />
I can just picture it:<br />
<br />
&quot;haaaay guys, players are leaving in droves because GoD is a horrible buggy unfinished steaming pile of shit; should we fix the problems, or rush another sloppy expansion out the door and raise the level cap to make things even worse?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Requiring the first epics is a bad idea imo, do you really want a plethora of high level players being forced to go to kunark to complete a quest? All the old  bottlenecks will become conjested again (well the ones that wernt fixxed), warriors camping sev but each warrior can solo him? Heh, recipe for diaster..<br />
<br />
Having the old epics give you a step up in quest (thats not worth to do to just skip that step) is the most amount of involvement that the old epic should play.<br />
<br />
But then again I dunno if It will even be a concern to me, GoD really burnt me out and dunno if I can get my interest high enough to want to grind through another xpack (and well finish GoD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well crap system bug and dont seem to be able to delete so ignore this PoS message :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is how they intend to fix GoD guys. Pallys cant bitch cause with 5 more levels they will be able to tank the content and with the AAs they will likely add (as if most of us have what we want already). This is gonna be a damn grind, levels, AAs, etc....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I mean.... heck need i remind ya of AC's ring of fire event being scrapped<br />
PoW scrapped from PoP scrapped<br />
GoD still causing odd deaths on boats and other bugs....<br />
<br />
<br />
im not impressed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Epics 2.0 should definately require the first epics to complete. <br />
<br />
I cant wait to see the war epic 2.0 quest, probably involves having to kill quarm and the cragbeast queen, then turning in a mosscovered twig, 2 holgresh elder beads, a manastone and your signet of might to an NPC in freeport. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hell i bet this was announced at E3 because they wanted to poke all the other MMO online games in the eyes and reduce their floor space.<br />
<br />
i still think epic 2.0 should be doable by anyone that finished the first one, and it should be REQUIRED because flags are required to get into time.<br />
<br />
i still use part of my epic, the blue blade and the 2 hander kinda blow... its sad that i won a GSoFW that blew my 2hander out of the water and it only took 2 hours of pick up raiding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lvl 70, more AAs for me to grind thru.......dammit im not even done with all the AAs i want and they are gonna add more....../sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm definitely not pre-ordering another expansion ever again. I'll wait to hear the reviews before I let loose the cash. I'm still miffed over the 2 accounts worth of shit I bought a few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oops.<br />
<br />
So this isn't a totally meaningless post, I'll say that there were alot of people that were excited when pop came out that there would be new epics, and now people are against it. I don't understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lol, you have got to be kidding me.  I guess they are in damage control mode at the moment.<br />
<br />
I liked the idea of Epics ver 2.0 when POP was released, but not now.  Its been too long imo.  You cannot win with making it require the first version or not without pissing a lot of people off either way.  In fact like someone else said here its going to be kind of funny in a sad way to watch how much fighting will start when inevitably one classes epic is harder than another, or like previous epics one is made so badly that there is a cockblock  for weeks/months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">god forbid they make it so as long as you put in the time you get the reward, nope, they put in every chance they can for someone else to fuck ya over, such as someone killing in the turn in mob, someone outdamaging ya on serv etc.....<br />
<br />
why cant they just make it so that if you invest the time you get the reward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">From my server boards<br />
<br />
I threw this into the handy Sony to English translator and this is what popped out.<br />
<br />
Follow the Wayfarer's Brotherhood because we don't have enough creativity on our entire staff to expand the Everquest lore beyond Planes of Power. <br />
<br />
If dollars were spooge, we could call this expansion: Firiona Vie: All Star Bukkake Jam.<br />
<br />
New features you didn't ask for:<br />
<br />
Level cap increase!: We have no intention of slowing down our rampant mobflation so we're just going to give you guys enough levels to actually kill the shit now. Yes we made the ENTIRE FUCKING GAME outside of POP green to you, but you shouldn't concern yourself with that silly stuff. You should be in GoD and OoW doing your epic 2.0! <br />
<br />
Epic 2.0: Even more shit to bog your guild down with while we finish the broken shit in the end game zones!<br />
<br />
Guild tribute system: What? The tribute system is gimped beyond all reasonable usefulness? Try doing it for everyone in your guild! Get 30 minutes of 150HP for a mere 1,000,000,000 plat worth of twink gear!<br />
<br />
Task system: WoW looks like it's going to eat us alive and shit us half digested, we had to do something so they don't look so &quot;innovative&quot; with their quest system.<br />
<br />
Custom PC titles: Nevermind that you can't tell a 300 AA titled player from a 75AA titled player, we're going to confuse the matter so much that titles don't matter for shit. Oh yeah and fuck your achievements too.<br />
<br />
New Disciplines/AAs/Items/Spells/Quests/Tradeskills: Hey, they're easy to add. Besides, we've fucked the rest of the skill system up so bad that AA's are the only way we can expand the game now. <br />
<br />
Improved graphics: Remember that graphics upgrade we told you that we'd give you all for free? Surprise fuckers! Gordon needs a new Ferrari..<br />

So, when they release this shitty expansion will it get rid of the message trying to get me to sign up for the last shitty expansion that I never took the time to get rid of?  Or will I have two messages trying to get me to order two shitty expansions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Seriously involving old epics as part of a requirement would really be a bad decision, while on paper and for people who have epics it sounds like a &quot;good idea,&quot; in practice it would create too many problems, think how many people have entered game since epics (for some class's) become mosrtly  a novelty thing, do you realy want a ton of level 70 people fighting over kunark spawns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Lvl increase is a bad bad idea IMHO ...<br />
<br />
Instead of making MORE zones to exp in .. going to be few again, just different ones.<br />
<br />
Using the 5 lvl rule that seems to work since they changed EXP, going to rule out PoP for exp, unless you are flaged for elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Thraxnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm undecided about the lvl 70 thing...  I'm looking at it and thinking oh no-thats more lvls I've got to grind out... and xp after 65 is going to be so slow...  but the other part of me is looking at it and saying that will make it easier to raid mobs and you'll need fewer people because the ones you have are more powerful..<br />
<br />
And looking at it... one grouping white cons  should always be possible if you have the equipment up to that point (EG can one group wing nameds easy with pre ornate equip) so does this mean we'll be one grouping some of the gods required for PoP and useing 18 people raids to kill others.... I hope not I truely do beacuse then every tom dick and harry will be able to get to EPs and we'll  be seeing open raids to elemental gods... <br />
<br />
I hope they've thought this out, because they're opening a can of worms there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">We heard the same song and dance about epics with PoP, dont be shocked if that bulleted point goes missing once the hype is large enough</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
people still fight over those spawns, if they didnt a scale wouldnt cost 40k, if your not willing to do an epic sized, 2 part quest i dont think you should have the epic, it is that simple<br />
<br />
in my hands i hold the god of wars old weapons, the best there was before he got his axe foraged,its epic 2.0 as in extended, you cant have planes of power and leave off the rest of EQ, same should go with epics, you have to expand off what is already there, at the very least we should get a LARGE step ahead, or be able to turn in our old epic for AA points since it was a bloody waste of time.<br />
<br />
maybe this upcoming &quot;revamp&quot; will be the same as the flags getting removed, because this next expantion seems to be GoD based, and unless they really are trying to get us all to quit i cant see em making another hardcore expantion after GoD(normally its hardcore, casual, hardcore etc)<br />
<br />
on another note i think the reason they are asking everyone what they think will improve their class or make the game more fun is because they plan to use that information to make the expantion, and probibly another class.<br />
<br />
(first caster/caster hybrid woot woot :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>BolarGimack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Lvl 70? So does this mean those of us who aren't fucking time equipped and unable to get into the good exp zones will be fucked?<br />
<br />
More aa's? Holy shit batman we need more trash like make my group fearless yay. Whats next give my group enduring breath? Or maybe a zone wide taunt thats it yeah zone wide taunt.<br />
<br />
More Discs yeah like we don't already use only 2 of them. So lets get 10 more useless fuckin discs. (Yes I understand Stonewall and a few others are okay but ummm yeah.) What disc do you commonly use? Incite Defensive.<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0. So they gave us a quest to turn a red scale green thats almost as donkey shlong sucking as the cleric frag farming. All you need is to spend 8 hours of your life sucking your thumb while you try to navigate through plane of skyairplaneclouds (what do they call it today?). Epic 2.0 is a nifty idea buttwheat.<br />
<br />
Okay I am done being pissy. This expansion will be umm another expansion to piss us all off.<br />

How can you honestly not be bogged down by all the rampant bullshit that goes on this game?  You don't get tired of seeing patch messages week after week that prove the devs are wasting their time looking at something as ridiculous as regen rates instead OF FIXING MAJOR COLLISION ERRORS IN THE GAME?   You don't get tired of them making artificial caps on progression to slow you down until they can finish the zones?  You don't get tired of them shoveling expansion after expansion out the door just to turn a buck, and not really caring about the game at all?<br />

Hehe, I play on test, so I get at least 5 times as many bugs as the live server players, and frankly I don't see what everybody is bitching about.  I'm raiding in the elemental planes, doing exp in earth, fire, and LDoN, and 95% of the time I have no issues doing what I want to do.  I understand why the guilds that have been stuck on uqua for months are mad, but hell that doesn't even apply to the #1 guild on some servers.  It has no effect whatsoever on me, so I don't give a damn.  If you're not in a Kod'Taz+ guild I don't know why you're crying so hard.  Yea, the dx9 thing was screwed up for a couple weeks, but in a game I've played nightly for 5 years, a couple weeks of bugs (most of which had very little effect on me playing the game, even though it was more like a month on test) isn't something to shake your fist at the sky over.  <br />
<br />
I play every night, and I have fun playing.  Just like I always have.  If it wasn't for all the crying on the boards (which I personally think is 80% parroting what uber people say) I would have no idea that EQ was &quot;dying&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You speak like the dx9 engine is working perfectly right now, which is about the polar opposite it currently is.

Hopefully with soloing it will be possible to get the extra levels quickly so PL'd &quot;Tanks&quot; don't have to work for them.<br />
<br />
It will be a pain for those maintining bots as if they were Mains, but that's not really a downside is it?<br />

Truth be told, it looks pretty exciting with several innovations.<br />

I have however seen my guildmates stuck in the ground in PoK and elsewhere and two of my friends have accounts that are so bugged that they can't even move their toon anymore.<br />

The new expansion doesn't really do anything for me, my main toon is only lvl 53 and I never really figured I'd make it to 65 before I left for WoW anyway. I didn't buy the GoD expansion and the only justification for actually buying it would be to get rid of the popup nag screen. Not worth it, I'm not hardcore enough.<br />
<br />
I can't wait till Blizzard and WoW assrape Sony right out of the MMO game and they sell Verant off to someone who actually cares about making quality games.</div></div><hr />

If it is a relitivly bug free launch i will be happy, but we saw how long it took them to get the bazaar working(people able to kill traders and take the loot when it went live, who tests this stuff?)<br />
<br />
the real reason we have our pantys in a wad is the GoD content isnt relitivly settled, nore is it working as intended as far as scripts go, and the fuckwads are already pushing the new expantion on the live site, sent to go live in july, thats not to far off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">&lt;&lt;I'm in the middle of a 60 person raid in plane of earth with all names and all models and all particle effects on. I have zero lag, and my computer is a year and a half old. I don't know what T&amp;L or Vertex shaders are, and I don't care.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
what you are saying brutul is that if YOU have no problems with dx9 then you could care less if half the people DO have problems and a quarter of the players find the bugs crippling. its not enough that SOME people dont have problems.<br />
<br />
and please dont tell me about upgrading my machine. ive seen all the posts on sony's tech page from people with top of the line equipment and the suggestions by the techs that what they should try next is reinstall their BIOS or motherboard drivers or reinstall windows. thats about as lame as it gets.<br />
<br />
as for me? well after yesterdays patch for the first time in 3 months in TWO zones i now have MUCH less lag than ive had in 3 months. my framerate went from 5fps to high enough that i cant detect framelag anymore. what does this prove? that i was right after all! that my machine wasnt the problem. their code was. now they need to fix all the other zones and the standard wont be &quot;is brutul getting lag&quot; its going to have to be everyone with even a halfway decent machine.<br />
<br />
as for increasing the level cap. well it sure beats adding another 100aa and thinking that this constitutes a serious increase in power. i have news for all you time raiders out there. in one more expansion everyone (level65)  who was not flagged for a thing will suddenly find themselves more powerful than you are today. all they need is 5 more levels which for all the trouble is not like the 2 years youve spent in PoP getting no drop loot that you are going to bank or destroy 6 months into the new expansion. no drop loot is very deceptive. it is not a true character enhancement it is just a bandaid to last until the next level increase when it suddenly becomes trivial to obtain.<br />
<br />
so ... everything that doesnt require flagging becomes green in one fell swoop. well they better remove the flagging requirement then or you will have 3/4 of the server in a couple dozen zones and everything in luclin and ykesha abandoned (its close to that already). <br />
<br />
so how do i feel about the expansion? well lets just hope you dont have to go through PoK to get there since a huge number of people cant even get through that zone. lets just hope they dont require you to go through any GoD zones since a lot of people cant cross those zones either. lets hope they dumb it down because guild rosters have been falling as high tier players cant get onto their accounts.<br />
<br />
oh yay guild tribute. one more excuse for the guildleaders to withhold the cash from raids from their members. in all my time in eq ive only been in ONE guild that has ever split the vendor loot with their members. now GL's will give all the loot to guild tributemasters increasing the power of the guild leadership over its members. and it will give me just one more reason to avoid guilds. this feature is probably the worst of all the expansion changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I have to agree with Haass here.  We just took some people through the hedge event tonight in my guild.  People were more concerned about getting stuck on the walls than doing their job.  That to me is the sign.  When the bugs take precedent over actual strategy.<br />
<br />
Hell maybe it's just me and a few others, but I remember what it was like before toons got sucked halfway into the ground.  Before *GASP* touching the environment might get you stuck or make a mob untargetable.  I used to corner mobs, now I can't.  I used to use walls to pin mobs, now I can't because they may fall through the world and warp back to spawn.  What a fucking joke.  If this was any old single player game 99% of us would have tossed it aside long ago.  People are just willing to forgive the MAJOR flaws because they have A) invested assloads of time into their characters, and B) play the game alongside other people who have become their friends.<br />
<br />
FIX THE COLLISION ISSUES NOW!!!!!<br />

I don't want to adapt to buggy crap, I want to adapt to a game designed to use actual strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I used to throw boxes for a living, I was the lead of the trailer crew at Target after I graduated.  My boss was the hardest working guy I'd ever met.  He had his head screwed on straight, he knew what he was doing, and he put in 70 hours a week trying to get as much done as target asked him to get done.  Oh, and he was on salary too, making 32 grand a year. Do the math.  He worked his fucking ass off for target.<br />
<br />
I walked into work one nite and one of the higher-ups called all of the leads into her office, and she sat us down and said &quot;Deke quit this morning.  I don't know what happened, he just walked out.&quot;  Something wasn't stirring the Kool Aid here.  I went home in the morning and called him, because what Target didn't count on was that we all had relationships outside of work.  He told me &quot;Nope....they came up to me this morning and told me that I could either quit, or be fired.&quot;  I walked into work early that nite, filled out a couple of forms to cash out my vacation and told the store manager where to shove his fucking job if he couldn't respect me enough to tell me the truth.<br />
<br />
To this day, I still don't regret doing what I did, because everyone I know that is still employed for Target is getting fucked in similar ways virtually every week.  It was only going to be a matter of time until they came to me and said the exact same thing they told my boss.  Why the fuck would you willingly stick around for that?<br />
<br />
What does this have to do with anything?<br />
<br />
Releasing unfinished expansions and blocking the top guilds with an unbeatable mob is lame, I'll give you that. Definitely shows a lack of respect for the customers. Personally though, I don't get to them until a year after the cockblock is out, so it doesn't effect me. <br />
<br />
This is what pisses me off about your attitude Brutul.  You fully admit that there are things in this game that affect other people more than you (including the DX9 change), and then you fucking insult us for bitching about it.  I'm happy that your life is rosy and sweet, but don't expect the rest of us to sit around taking this shit.  If a company decides that they're going to make poor decisions that have bad impacts on a portion of their customer base, how long do you think it's going to be before they do something that does impact you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'll put my vote in now. <br />
<br />
I will be extremely suprised if the epic v2 encounters are not so hard that most elemental guilds as they stand at the moment will be incapable of completing them..<br />
<br />
I will be *astonished* if the epic v2.0's do not require the original epics. <br />
<br />
And I will be speechless with astonishment  if all of them work when it's released.<br />
<br />
I think they have dug their own graves with PoP mostly. There rampant and insane inflation set expectations which are simply not being matched by LDoN, GoD etc. In a way I think augments were one of their biggest problems. They are powerful true, but they are BORING.  Even though a tiny fraction of the EQ playerbase has full sets of time gear, the spoiler sites have seen to it that a huge majority of the EQ playerbase is as jaded as the 40th quarm run time farmers.  They look at loot coming out of GoD on allakhazam etc and yawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Yeah; Brutul plays in an EQ world that most of ya's haven't seen in years.<br />
IT's really a great place. If I never played on Test before quitting EQ i'd have a lot more hatred for it than I do :D. I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">LOL Haas.  I think you should have saved that story for something more profound. <br />
<br />
But I said that people that are in top-end guilds have a right to be mad many times in this thread.  As far as the dx9 thing, I have 2 computers, one of them is over 3 years old, both play EQ better than they did before the changes.  I have 3 friends here at work that play eq, and between them they have 8 computers of all different ages and configurations, and none of them have had any problems.  Out of the 100 or so people in my guild, maybe 4 or 5 had to buy new video cards, but the cards they replaced were so old you couldn't play any other current game on them either.  <br />
<br />
If you ask me, it was a good thing for the vast majority of EQ players.  I mean from all the tears shed over it you'ld think they did it just to piss you off.  There's no reason to make these changes except as an effort to keep the game current and make it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I liked Haass' story and feel like it really pinpoints why I've come to the conclusion that corporate America is disfunctional.  It almost seems as if much of American middle management is staffed by habitual liars who can't even imagine that their employees have half a brain and might possibly see through their bullshit.  What does it say about the corporate world when one of the primary qualifications for management is how well you lie to your employees?<br />
<br />
But anyway, back to the SoE hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Kelvon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I can only speak for myself but I decided long ago  that I play EQ because I personally enjoy it, I don't have to measure myself against anyone.  I can play level 20 toons every day for the rest of my EQ career and find unadulterated enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Also, these expansions, updates, patches, etc prove one thing loud and clear.  EQ is in no danger of dying.  Developers are not trying to phase out EQ in favor of EQ2.  They are interested in bolsetering the existing engine to compete with what is out there and bring their fan base enjoyment and keep the subscriptions flowing (the aim of any business).  I like the expansions and look forward to all of them.  Even on a limited income, it's what I choose to spend my &quot;play&quot; money on.  If you spend money on it, so what?  If you don't spend money on it, so what?<br />
<br />
So bring on those patches, expansions, updates, upgrades, augments, levels, and anything else you can think of.  In the meantime you will find me playing and enjoying the game.  I don't need to get all hot and bothered because it's just not worth it, in 20 years I'll probably be playing something else and EQ will be a fond memory.<br />
<br />
Of course the future may prove me wrong about EQ and/or EQ2.  In that case I still won't freak, I'll just move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Truthfully can any of you look at this and not realize what happened here?<br />
<br />
The reason for this expansion isn't an attempt to save people from flocking away from the broken game.<br />
<br />
It's the reason that broke the game. SoE pulled their devs away from GoD to work on this new project; do any of you wonder why the current shit hasn't been fixed yet?<br />
<br />
The devs don't want to put out this crap content, I guarentee you. SoE execs are seeing constantly dropping subscription numbers and pushing a new expansion without realizing why subscriptions are dropping. They are overestimating the effect of simply competing games, and underestimating how broke their own game is.<br />
<br />
I think if this new expansion wasn't coming out, the devs would have had more time to concentrate on fixing the current bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">i dont see why SoE keeps giving out content to the time and elemental players, they need to make another expantion with something cool for everyone like velius(sp), it had raids, it had XPing zones(velks) and it had nice content, something for everyone.<br />
<br />
almost everyone is upset so they should try to throw a bone to each group with this next expantion, but i dont think it would be possible considering that i would think the hardest mobs would be guarding the merimite(sp) king, not already dead in telosia(sp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I think with raising the level cap, there will have to be new exp zones.  Jumping to 70 is going to green out almost everything outside of PoP, and make the PoP zones much worse exp, so my bet is that there will be at least 4 or 5 level 70 grind zones and hopefully LDoN will scale up to level 70 as well.<br />
<br />
GoD has 3 or 4 grind zones as well hehe, but nobody uses them because they are hard and people don't want to do CR.  Hopefully the GoD retune will make zones like Ferubi more attractive to single groups.</div></div><hr />

These fast expansions are milking the cash cow while the cow is starting to falter.  EQ (the cow) will not die for a while, but the erosion is happening.  SOE must make money on their products.  They will do whatever it takes to do so within the bounds of being legal.  Your game play experience is secondary to SOE making money.<br />

Thanks but I'll spend my money on products that are well designed, tested, and implemented as well as being fun.  SOE's policy of rushing out poor quality expansions is killing EQ and they only have themselves to blame.  The DX9 disaster was the last nail in the coffin for me.  It was bad enough shelling out an additional 30 bucks every 5 months for another halfassed expansion but for SOE to release live an &quot;update&quot; that they KNEW did not work is a reprehensible business practice.<br />

<br />
Brutul, it isn't that the dx9 engine broke graphic cards...it's that it altered some of the very basic dynamics of raiding...especially for tanks.  Go to SSRA and try and corner Emp or anything.  Go to VT where you can corner some mobs, but not others.   Now add in mobs being pushed INTO walls and warping back to spawn.  That isn't video card issues, that is collision coding gone haywire.<br />
<br />
I agree lag is down.  I think the new more static sky may be a large portion of it.  But it's the collision issues that are really fubar.  The environment has become almost as dangerous as the mobs.<br />
<br />
Yea I know we can just fight them out in the open.  But WHY does the fucking world have to end if we touch a wall.  They should just fix the lame ass code and be done with it.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't be an issue so much if I was in a hardcore guild.  But a casual guild learns new things at a casual pace, which is frustrating for me.  I have to watch people not understanding WTF is going months after the changes ahve been in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">The main problem i am having would be the fact that when I am in pok  the game will lock up forcing me to reset comp. But after the latest patches it has not happend to me. Perhaps they fixed it.  The other problems I am having is the fact that I now have to be a gnome inorder to corner mobs. Even then I cant corner right all the time. Did a Vindi &gt;Statue raid few days ago. Had a hell of a time getting him to corner. He kept running out of corner and then right as i moved out of corner he would run back to me. then run away again. Summoning me. I must say I have had more problems with Vindi after the Dx9 came out than i ever have had. Cornering just isnt the same, as we have all  /agreed on. Now I am not a EP flaged warrior. I have  all but the RP trial done and still need the major gods and such for EP flag. We did koru in Halls of Betrayel lastnight. Once again while trying to corner him i get the message &quot;Can not see your target&quot; Now this mob is verry hard if you dont corner him. His AE will rape your clerics draining all thier mana and then if your DPS starts eating too much AE they will shurly die. Now korukust has always sort of climed the wall. Not a real bad problem but when you cant corner a mob that MUST be cornered inorder to kill. Well it sort of defeats the purpose of raiding this mob. Also in  the Greg incounter we had problems with us warping to zoneline. That seems to be fixed. But i have been to scared not to use gnome illusion as of latly. IMO~ if they are making it so you have to be a gnome inorder to corner a mob. Give us a gnome illusion like the gay woodelf one. Something so we dont have to buy those stupid pots. or pray the chanter with project illusion is on and in your group.<br />
   LvL 70? Well ya shure thats cool. But that  will just make it that much easir for those EP , time flaged people to kill me. Now we will have to fight for the ability to kill mobs that are green or white cons to upgrade our guild. YAY that will be so much fun. On the other hand it will be nice to be able to single group most of ToV and other mobs that are lvl 65 and such. So now will they make a restriction on such places much like Nagafen and Vox? I dont think we can slam this new expac just yet. But then again I am just a simple iksar warrior who runs around with no planar gear pulling more or about the same HP as those fat ogre's and trolls. It will be interesting to see what unfolds in the next few months. As for me. I will continue to play EQ simply because i rather enjoy it. Do i get mad when i cant do osmething the way &quot;I think&quot; it was intended you bet i do. But  i am still able to have fun. Our guild is growing all the time. I have been in it since it was formed. Started with 6 friends that grouped nightly we added a few others got tags and started out thing. We are able to do mobs that other bigger guilds cant simply becuase we use the strat. <br />
   Sorry for the rant. But i can see alot of you are really bitter. As i am not in the content you all are it would seem i guess i have no room to talk. But  we are all having problems. some of them are fixed. some are not. I am shure that SOE will be fixing them.  I know where i work selling umpire gear. We all know baout new product coming out a long long time before it actualy does. we also tell our consumers before it comes out. We have alot of stuff that comes out and is well just crap. So we slam out something newer and better. If it dont work we go back make it better and slam more out the door. We are the second if not the first in umpire gear. We do verry well. but i know how it is to have to constantly make the consumer feel like we are the best. we are with them every step. Some of you who might simply work in an office or what ever. Dont know what its like to talk with customers daily. Its alot of fun when you get the ones who are cussing and screaming because you fekd his order up. Come to find out his stupid wife got him the wrong thing. ya lots of fun. so before you go slaming a company saying how shitty they are and all they want is $$ perhaps you should put yourself in thier shoes. try working in customer care. Most of you would rather cut your own wrist than do such work.<br />

You know I think SOE is pretty smart. They release new expansions almost on top of each other and force you to buy stuffs in smaller and smaller chunks increasing their profits. Instead of releasing a super large expansion like PoP, now they release 2-3 smaller expansions, increasing their income. <br />

you just dont get it do you? most of these people who are screwed by the code have very standard equipment and ive seen so many people with state of the art equipment get f'd up by it that your argument is nothing more than wishful ignorance. remember its the people with win-xp that had the bulk of the pok crashing problems not the people with 98. the people with the atis and the people with the nvidias. as for me when i switched my ati to an nvidea like yours my problems got much worse so i went back. these are the people who have been shut out of the game. win-98 is standard ; your amd is not. the reason you dont have problems is because you are lucky, but you credit it to your own intelligence in choosing a system.<br />

I don't think its all that much luck, you need recent drivers, keep disk defragmented, and use quality equipment. For ever person who cannot play there are 50 who can. But belive as you will. <br />

I won't be upgrading my operating system at a couple of hundred dollars solely and simply because I want to play an online game.  Win 98 may be trash, but it's trash I've already paid for and that works fine.  SoE needs to stop setting the bar higher and higher on hardware and software upgrades with every expansion.

Hmm, well lets see.  DX9 changes introduced and people are forced to go out and buy new video cards, even though the ones they have are supposedly &quot;supported&quot;.  Collisions are so screwed they have to come up with a special utility just to unstick characters, and that's so screwed up they have to back it out.  So instead they open a chat room for people who are stuck in game, so the can log out where ever they're stuck, if that's possible before they're killed by something, and go log into chat to beg for someone to come help them.  Boats that path right through the aggro areas of mobs and are effectively sure death unless you invis first and it doesn't wear off.  The boat in iceclad ocean actually grabbing characters and attaching them to the hull and not letting them leave.  Boats in general being so whacky, as they have been for years that they basically shut them down and have port hoe gnomes at every dock.  And hell, these are just the ones I know of off the top of my head, I'm sure there's a ton more I'm not even aware of.  Yeah, the game isn't buggy.  GoD isn't buggy.  Oh no, everythings peachy.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but 98 works fine and nothing since has offered anything worth the upgrade.  If you have a text editor that fulfills all your needs why go spend the money on something with more bells and whistles that you don't want and don't need?  Same thing with an operating system.  Much of the time it seems that microsoft throws out a software upgrade not so much because they really need to, but as a way to generate more revenue.  98 is on a hell of a lot of machines still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Have you used XP?  It's far better than 98 IMO.  Much more stable, much easier to install, much better drivers.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
all my drivers are current. its lame requiring recent drivers in any case.<br />
<br />

<br />
highly overrated utility. if you are not caching to disk (and im not) then defragmenting will not affect lag.<br />

&lt;&lt;For ever person who cannot play there are 50 who can. But belive as you will.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Also lots and lots of problems can be traced to heat buildup&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
heat related problems are almost always irreproducable crashes. the crashes many are experiencing particularly the pok crashes common to winxp users are very reproduceable to those who have them. they are not heat related. please dont try to tell me that falling under the world is a heat related problem too.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; or bad memory.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
common scapegoat .. rare problem. results in crashes but not reproduceable bugs like getting stuck or falling through the world or excessive lag. usually when a person has bad memory it cripples the entire machine for all applications not just eq.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; I buy PC3200 ram and UNDERCLOCK it&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
how come? is your memory defective?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;, and I have a 80mm fan on my processor, maybe that has contributed to my good luck, you think?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
nope. doesnt make a bit of difference unless you have a heat buildup problem. and those are better handled by upgrading the power supply fan.<br />
<br />
so i repeat sam .. you are lucky.<br />
<br />
you apparently DID use good sense designing your system as most of us did. you will become obsolete in a few years too and perhaps you will spend 2000 dollars (on each of your 6 machines) once again so you can play eq for another 2 years. but not all of us think eq is worth 2000 dollars every 2 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, the company I work for (no, not SoE  :p ) just dropped support for 98 and ME.  The reasons we did this are:  (1) we were having lots of compatability problems that are specific to these 2 Windows releases when using newer development technologies (.NET) and (2) it was hindering our development effort since we had to code specifically to support those versions (i.e.: gimp what we could offer all customers so that whatever we delivered worked on 98/ME.)  <br />
<br />
Yes, people use these versions, but people also have upgrade options that have been available for 4+ years now and it's not unreasonable to update the &quot;supported&quot; list.  Given unlimited resources/time, could we have continued to support 98/ME - sure...but nobody has unlimited resources/time.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Its also 200 bucks per computer. Thanks but no thanks. We have 7 computers in my house, 6 of them run 98, 1 runs XP. I like XP, but that doesn't change that it is not as old as EQ *You on crack?*, security bugs and vulnerabilities are popping up for it frequently even still, and on and on. I'd probably still be running Windows 95 if DX9 hadn't made that impossible. As it is, I don't play to stop using 98 SE for a long while. Maybe when the new OS comes out I'll get XP.<br />
<br />
Edit: And yes, 98 is trash. I don't use 98, I use 98 SE. 98 SE = okay, 98 =  trash. Theres a difference. Learn it. Most people who say they use 98 mean SE.<br />

Edit #2: Sam believes he speaks for the masses. The biggest raid he has ever done is Vallon Zek in tactics, but he still thinks any raid issues that occur, he can downplay because obviously being there is overrated. Same thing for memory issues, or gameplay issues. He doesn't have them, so he can safely say nobody does. Thats how it works when you have a center of the universe complex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not necessarily unreasonable.  However, SoE's problems haven't been primarily with operating systems.  The problems are more frequently video card drivers/hardware.  I've upgraded my video card on one computer three times and twice on the other just to accommodate SoE.  And one of those upgrades was on a card that was less then a year old and SoE claimed to support, but which wouldn't work with SoE's DX9 changes, despite their claims to the contrary.<br />
<br />
If SoE came out and said that it wouldn't support SE98 anymore, and this was the first and only time they'd not been compatible with something, I don't think most people would have real heartburn with that.  The problem is, SoE isn't compatible with a whole lot of stuff a whole lot of the time and people get tired of constantly having to tweak their box solely and completely because this one company can't seem to get it right.</div></div><hr />
