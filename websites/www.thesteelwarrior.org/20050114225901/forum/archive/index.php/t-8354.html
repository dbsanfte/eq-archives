 1. Would rather see a 'medium difficulty' worth 100 added and hards moved to 150 if you're going to do this. Easy IS too easy.<br />
 2. Would be nice, don't see it happening.<br />
 3. Agree strongly.<br />
 4. The only problem with this is that if a group able to XP off the old mob is there, the Fabled pop will bring that to a screeching halt. Otherwise agree.<br />
 5. Don't care one way or another, I won't be after Ornate.<br />
 6. Don't care one way or another, farmers will keep supply low either way.<br />
 7. TNZ does this, AFAIC.<br />
 8. Agree, but won't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I aggree there's a distinction between the concerns and suggestions of casual players about themselves, I don't agree that non-casual players can't meaningfully contribute toward their list.<br />
<br />
One prominent Warrior does not hesitate to povide his input in Paladin forums and threads where the Paladin Class Issue list is discussed. This is much the same thing especially if the contributions are intended to be helpful and not argumentative. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, if ya know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Besides, IMO it's a good idea to include helpful suggestions from any source assuming non-casuals have anything to contribute.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guyfencin</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a casual (you did say open to all), I like Partha's #1:<br />
&quot;'medium difficulty' worth 100 added and hards moved to 150&quot;<br />
and BB's #3 &amp; #5:<br />
3. LDoN - 18 person Medium difficulty raids with no drop loot mobs.<br />
5. Make Ornate molds and patterns No Drop by making the mobs drop Baroque molds and patterns henceforth (tuned in for the same armor).<br />
<br />
As for #3, I see nothing wrong with NODROP loot in instanced content, especially with time to complete and RvR tuned decently.  I think there should be a significant fraction of the better &quot;casual&quot; loot that requires you to actually be there helping to defeat the mobs, rather than just buying a pile of pp on PA to buy gear in bazaar.  Same justification as #5 actually, but in instanced content without free substitution it takes morre effort to work around (though you'd surely still see 6 raiders doing these with a dozen wannabe twinks if the rewards were good enough).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point on the NODROP, I hadn't thought of that. But yeah, if it's going to be raid styled content, make the rewards raid-styled as well by being NODROP - it encourages progression that way.<br />
<br />
 EDIT - didn't realize you meant this as directed mostly at non casuals, BB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I mean the thread to be open to suggestions from all. Not just a collection of my thoughts, but everybody's. Not a substitute list or subtitute thread from Frodlin's but since his asks for input by casual players only, this to be entirely open until/if he starts an open thread himself. This surely isn't my thread, but one I felt was a good idea since Frodlin's was restrictive (and there are many good reasons to do so).<br />
<br />
Should he as Warrior Coresspondent open the Casual Issues thread or start a second one allowing suggestions by all, then this one ought to be closed. And it may be that there are so few suggestions that it will and should drift into obscurity 8).<br />
<br />
I have 0 (none at all) interest with competing with Frodlin in his role or eroding it.<br />
<br />
He's doing an AWESOME job.<br />

<br />
Mods, unless someone objects strenously, please lock this. We should support out Class Corresspondent.<br />
