No it probably doesn't belong here, just i know you types (i am one) we like to take a beating and keep on walking.<br />
<br />
Just figured you would like to see this.<br />
<br />
http://www.kefen.btinternet.co.uk/TRAIN.JPG <br />
<br />
Thats a tank at the front of that lot.<br />
<br />
http://www.kefen.btinternet.co.uk/Tank3.jpg <br />
<br />
Under that lot of mobs, somewhere, is a tank.<br />
<br />
And no he didn't have a line of 10 clerics doing a heal cycle on him, infact during the entire pull he didn't recieve a single heal, not sure about once things got going as i was a bit busy blowing stuff up.<br />
<br />
He can, and did, die, as did us all, its dangerous dealing with taht many mobs.<br />
<br />
Another thing he did, which you will all appreciate.<br />
<br />
When things were going badly, he would tell us all to run away and to CoTH him to the entrance.<br />
<br />
I thought that was kewl too.<br />
<br />
For the record, this wasn't some lowbie mission, where you can do it at level 10 but not when you get high level.<br />
<br />
This was at level 40, and thats the highest level.<br />
<br />
Also bear in mind, this isn't based on this guy being a powergamer able to put in 100 hours a week, any tank with the right power choices can do this at level 40. Playing more often doesn't really benefit you that much, other then levelling faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW was that the top end TF mission?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks to me like just a normal nemesis mission - the 40 TF if I recall right is mainly Crey/CoT/DE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit that as an invul/ss tanker, once you get your damage resists slotted and get invincibity, the number of mobs that can be tanked goes through the roof.  I solo 6-8 white/yellow mobs at level 19 (my new tanker on Pinnacle) and walk away without a scratch.   Tanking in CoH is much much better than tanking in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, just spent the last few hours pulling mass trains for my SG - 100+ mobs at once - drag em to a tunnel where the ar/dev blasters have been laying mines and boom - things fall down :)<br />
<br />
Course if I miss a provoke at wrong time or the blasters open up too soon you have blaster soup - but hell I live :)</div></div><hr />
