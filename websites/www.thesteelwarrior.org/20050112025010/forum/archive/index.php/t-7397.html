One warrior in attendance is an applicant and uses Blade of War, we had to force the Fleshbiter on him since it was rotting. The fact that it's PRIMARY only makes Fleshbiter basically useless, IMO. I could see it going in offhand paired up with DBotW, but primary only makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

I still don't have one and probably never will.  DBoW is the only weapon I can think of that obviously puts out more aggro than a Fleshbiter based on damage/delay and procs.<br />
<br />
Though it wouldn't hurt if they remembered to put an increased proc rate mod on Fleshbiter like DBoW, and make the stun stun up to level 65.</div></div><hr />

Sure it's not as good and needs to be tuned a bit.  But for guilds that have absolutely shitty luck getting Darkblades, this isn't a bad item.  If I already had a Darkblade I wouldn't loot it of course, but if I didn't I prolly would.</div></div><hr />

What is the level limit on Static?</div></div><hr />

&quot;The stun portion of this effect works on creatures up to level 55.&quot;<br />
<br />
Needs to be raised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry :|  I kind of assumed most warriors beating Uqua would have one. All mains and all alt warriors (except for 1 twink) in my guild have Darkblades.<br />
<br />
A resisted/immune stun is the same aggro as a successful one. This weapon would own a BoC, hands down.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it would own a BoC, I just can't imagine any warrior progressing this far in the game who's going to be using a BoC or anything close to BoC. Seems like a meaningless comparison, like saying BoC would own a fine steel shortsword, because of how far apart obtaining the two are.</div></div><hr />

  I was just answering the above post, which did bring up a BoC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ratio is a whopping .42 better, 1.17 compared to .75. The aggro via proc is about 300 less per proc, or 600 - 900 aggro less per minute (dependent on WA). I guess it depends on whether or not the hugely different ratios, and therefore DPS, make up for that loss in proc aggro. My guess, seeing as I don't have a Fleshbiter, is that the BoC would lose rather significantly.</div></div><hr />

Just a reminder, 95% of VT+ raid-level items are in the eqitem database.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the proc difference comes out with the BoC 900 ahead id say the dps difference would come out with the fleshbither about 1200 ahead. if you had a yak auged gstaff of 4 winds and a BoC, the gstaff would win out by a little bit most likely, and thats basically what a fleshbiter is, with a little less dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanek</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">JOS is better aggro than BoC, and has pretty much the same proc aggro wise (if not a bit less) than Fleshbiter.  <br />
<br />
Fleshbiter does really need to be tuned though.  It makes no sense to have the warrior weapon of GoD be significantly worse than the one from the expansion before.  And considering how much harder Uqua is than Time...Grats SoE</div></div><hr />

Better than EoE or JoS mainhanded.<br />

Change the fucking graphic.<br />

<br />
Make it proc a bit more or make it stun 65 though.<br />
<br />
And people grossly overestimates the aggro attributed to procs, unless it's Anger.</div></div><hr />

So... useful for LDoN as a DPS weapon than.. since no raid mobs are level 65 now adays.<br />
<br />
Btw this is not the end game warrior weapon of GoD, I assure you, Uqua is far from End game in GoD.  So technically it can be on par with time weapons and still be usable for some that dont get time equipment.  GoD has alot of loot thats time quality so far with a few extra's that are slightly better than Quarm loots, but also alot of it just isnt much of an upgrade, so it goes to those members who did not get time upgrades in each slot in most cases.</div></div><hr />

Yes amazing for time trash clearings and LDoN's, this is a GoD item, you'd think it'd be designed for that type of content ^^</div></div><hr />

I use the BBoE and the stun doesn't affect any PoP mob but all de damed if that proc won't pull aggro of a cripple of slow cast instantly.  I somehow doubt that the 95 damage is does to the mob is that overwhelming and make it hate me more then a slow or a cripple.  So a resisted stun proc is pretty good aggro, heck just aska pally and they will tell you.</div></div><hr />
