<br />
Seriously, Fix =/= Overpower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they would never implement such a complex fix to our class.  It has to be simple.<br />
<br />
We should have more HP's to set us apart as a tanking class.  A 10% increase would be sufficient<br />
<br />
We should have a better hit rate, by default, because we are masters of melee combat.  A 5% increase would be sufficient.<br />
<br />
We should retain our rage when switching stances without having to waste talent points to do so, or at least 25% of our rage by default.   Remove tactical mastery and add another useful talent.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you have some very good other ideas to improve some talents.  Defiance and anticipation should be improved.  I think the other talents are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anticipation is generally crap anyway, especially versus other warriors. Gimme a raw HP boost talent.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery is fine as a talent. You don't really need to switch between stances until you can get TM anyway.<br />
<br />
Removal or at least a tweak of the dual wield hit penalty would rule a lot. So would a longer duration on Battle Shout, but that's more of a laziness thing.<br />
<br />
Warriors are pretty awesome as is; we're not the strongest in PvP but we can be very useful if played properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about replacing Anticipation with a Hardiness talent?<br />
<br />
Hardiness (Prot): Requires level 10<br />
Increases your base hitpoints by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
That would put warriors ahead of Paladins in hitpoints, but require some work from them, not just a given innate attribute.  Or, increase HP gained from stamina for warriors from 10 to 11 per point?  Instead of getting 3000hp from 300sta, a warrior would recieve 3300hp.  That is a 10% increase for a decent 60 War.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">straight HP boost. may as well leave stamina alone because warriors with like tyrant's or ornate mithril would not see a large benefit and will still have fewer HP than warriors with more stamina related gear.</div></div><hr />

gotta disagree with you wholeheartedly here.  I think forcing folks to spend talents on TM is a talent sink, especially with a 5 point in arms pre-req.  Talents are supposed to enchance your character.  Without the TM talent you have no way to snare when you're in def.  which is something I find myself switching into battle stance constantly to do.  I also switch in to battle from def for overpower hits.  Being able to switch stances on the fly is pretty pointless if you cant do anything with it when you switch.  Especially when you factor in all the hoops we gotta jump through to get rage anyway.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see the warrior by default able to switch stances w/o being penalized the way they are without talents right now (as in you loose all your rage; therefore, abilities).  I'd like to see something like TM enhance an already innate ability to switch stances and be able to perform abilities.<br />
<br />
p.s. what does =/= mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you need rage right after you switch stances and don't have TM, you can always pop Bloodrage. In most situations you will have enough healing to offset the small HP loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that small HP loss gets pretty big as you level up.  Its % based, not a flat number =(  And its only usable every 30sec.  That works for those once in a while situations, but I can easily have 3 runners or have overpower come up 3 times in 30 seconds.  The ability to switch to battle and pop em with snare or overpower is pretty basic imo if they're gonna let us switch the way the do.<br />
<br />
I think it would make more sence to give all warriors the ability to retain 10 rage across stances, move the TM talent to the first row so we can spend 3 points on that instead of imp. rend if we want, and make it more like this:<br />
Rank 1: retain an additional 10 rage when switching stances<br />
Rank 2: retain an additional 15 rage when switching stances<br />
Rank 3: retain an additional 20 rage when switching stances<br />
<br />
making it so a warrior with TM maxed keeps 30 rage where folks with no talents only get 10 rage. Something to this effect would be more in-line with the idea that talents are an enchancment rather than a completly new set of abilities (which is what TM pretty much is in its current state, a new ability more than an enhancement).   Make it so we can use abilities that cost 10 rage or less by default but make us sink points into talents if we want to be able to do more after a stance switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they should make it so that priests have to be in healing stance to heal and in shadow stance to cast shadow spells, but when they change stances they have to lose all their mana, unless they spend 10 talent points, then they can retain 25% of their mana when they change stances!<br />
<br />
That is basically in effect what bliz has done to warriors.  I understand there is not a direct correlation between mana and rage but there is no logical reason for us to lose all rage when changing stances especially given the fact we are unpowered as is.  Giving us the ability to retain rage while changing stances would not overpower us, in fact it would help bring us more in line with other classes.  If out of combat for a duration we still lose all our rage, we still have to build it up in combat!  Merely allowing us to retain some or all of our rage naturally is a logical change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wouldnt same logic apply to druids shapeshifting and retaing mana when they shift back into druid form? (not 100% sure if they do keep their mana or not though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how Bloodrage works :D I still use it when I need it, which is practically never now.<br />
<br />
I do see some of y'all's points about rage. retaining 10 rage for free while shifting stances would still allow us to keep 35 rage total with TM5. that's more than enough for most anything you need.<br />
<br />
yes we are a little underpowered compared to other classes, but I don't think twiddling with rage during stance shift is the way to bring us up, even we even really need it. Battlegrounds will be a huge test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have played a druid to 23 so I have toyed with the caster/bear/cat switching.  Caster to cat:  The druid retains all his mana pool and infact regenerates mana while in form (although its hidden til you switch back to caster).  While a cat he gains energy like a rogue would, 20/tick.   Caster to bear:  The druid retains/regenerates his mana pool (hidden again though).  He must build rage as a bear tho to use what few skills are available to him in bear form.  While in form, the druid cannot use spells such as heal/nuke/root.  There is a seperate &quot;pool&quot; of skills/talents available for each form.  If you think its hard to gain rage as a warrior, you should try it as a Druid, its nearly impossible since the damage done is determined by his level and strength alone.  In no way does the damage on his equiped weapon translate while in form.  So, in short, yes druids retain mana even after shapeshifting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good - this is available anyway but is a pain to set up, there is no real reason for this other than poor UI design. On the other hand, as the ability is available anyway it doesn't *really* make any difference in balance, only in the perception thereof.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tactical Supremacy:  Requires level 35<br />
   You gain the ability to use all skills in Battle Stance.<br />
<br />
<br />
... words fail me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle Shout:  Increase duration to at least 5min.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why ? What problem is this addressing ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Impale (Arms):  Requires 3 points in Deep Wounds.<br />
   Critical Strike damage done by abilities increased by 20, 40%.<br />
<br />
Two-Hand Spec (Arms):  Requires 15 points in Arms Talents.<br />
   Increases damage done with Two-Hand weapons by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
Cruelty (Fury):<br />
   Chance to score a critical hit with melee weapons increased by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is presumably to address a perceived lack of dps - if this is the case, why is it tied to talents ? Also, increasing the max crit is a bad idea for PVP. <br />
<br />
<br />
One-Hand Spec (Prot):  Requires 10 points in Protection Talents.<br />
   Increases your damage with one-hand weapons by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's at the top of the tree for a reason - so you can't combine it with sword mastery  etc. It also *is*, 2/4/6/8/10% already anyway.</div></div><hr />
