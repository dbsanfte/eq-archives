Now I do not know what to do. Should I keep on heroing? Or where should I go? EQMAC isn;t crowded and sometimes it can be hard to finda good group<br />
<br />
Please do not make cracks about MAC I need  help!!! i can't wait to get to planar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heroing? Is that some mac term, because I don't speak &quot;Mac&quot;avelli!<br />

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
Seriously, what is heroing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reamer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he means the hero bracer quest....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And go to dreadlands, or check out gunthak, also Not sure if it is on EQmac or not but look for the hot zones coded with an exp bonous for your level<br />
<br />
if heroing, isn't doing that damned quest then I don't know what the hell he is talking about ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>smfannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrugs* I didn't make a hell lof of sense out of it either, If your asking if you should be keeping your hero bracers or saving for another item I'd say save and save for a haste belt so you can hit faster and level up to farm easy platinum.<br />
<br />
Where to hunt ? a) Lower Guk has a excellent experience bonus and the mobs run at 12% if their alone and Frenzy camp has a chance at a Flowing Black Silk Sash and it'd save you coming back to slaughter the place later on for faction for a Crown of Deceit.<br />
                          B) Head too Velketor and pickup Ebony Earring of Hatred ? and the helm which drop in the back room for some upgrades, i think the earring has ac10 50hitpoints on it and the helm is about 20ac 35hp..or you might even get lucky and find yourself in a top spider group where the loot is insane.<br />
Grab another tank but cause your gear is old school</div></div><hr />

Okay, time to come to the realization that we can't add &quot;ING&quot; to any word and make it a verb.  Allow me to demonstrate.<br />
<br />
Hay guys, I've been spending a few levels Championing, and I have done a little bit of Myrmidoning, but I want to know, is it worth my time to do some Warlording, or should I just skip that and do some Ornating? <br />

No clue about population on the MAC server though. Just most servers DL is pretty good 40 to 50. Maybe even try Velks if you can get a good group and do the first floor area.</div></div><hr />

PoJ exit groups are really easy to get and great exp up to 52.  There are other camps that are good there after that.  Once you get low 50s you can try PoI and PoN, or if those are too difficult you can try Velketor's Labyrinth.   <br />

To this end, you should first save up money for another velium ring, and buy some earrings that have hit points (even the 2AC 35hp 25mana earrings are better than what you have).  Your boots and pants are perfect examples of the type of gear that you should be seeking for all of your slots.  Your boots and pants have decent AC, decent +HP, and a smattering of other stats.  Put the crown of the forlorn on your head, or better yet, quest a crafted helmet.</div></div><hr />

Edit: appearently i hit a wrong button somewhere along the line and posted before i was finished. anyway, there's plenty of good suggestions that people posted, including the most important one, which you seemed to ignore even tho it was posted 3-4 times, was to stop lvling and farm some gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">if your server economy allows you so, go for Fierce Heraldic armors<br />
otherwise go hunt is Karnor's Castle (lvl 40-55) for some Cobalt Armor where you need them<br />
otherwise go for bladesman(former berserber)/champion armors from Plane of Growth (lvl 50+) / Thurgadin.<br />
you can try Plane of Hate for indicolite, but since the multiple revamp (especially epic's mob) it would be a chalance for lvl 46-50 groups.<br />
go hunt in Droga for the CHoS/SotB past lvl 50<br />
take Vox/Naggy down before you miss your chance. <br />
<br />
when you search a better item keep the formula 1AC = 5HP = 1Sta =1str = 6dex = 6agi = 10Resist (at least before lvl 55, after it change a bit) to help finding out if it worth it or not (after lvl 55, you should concentrate only on AC and HP/sta because all the rest, ie str dex agi resist, will be given by spells).<br />

when you will have Cobalt quality armor you will be able to hunt for Myrmidon quality. Try to know if the tradeskills armors from expansions are available. You can't use FH because you are agnostic, but if it's possible to make black acrylia armors (SoL) and farwater armors (PoP) then it's worth it to look after them.<br />
<br />
when you will have strong tanking gears, you will be able to hunt strong mobs for better aggro weapons from pre-EP PoP and top SoL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mac server doesn't have farwater armor because they don't have elemental planes access.  I don't think they have black acrylia armor because that was a patch to acrylia caverns.<br />
<br />
If people sell MQs of the Velious quest armors, that might be worth looking into.</div></div><hr />

Why MQ it?  Get a group and camp in Kael.  At 46-ish, you can handle the bank camp, iirc.  Otherwise, I'm in complete agreement that cobalt armor is a good way to go in the meantime. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">gratz for one lvl more!<br />
<br />
1. I don't remember if you got the Spiked Goblin Ring last time, but I think you already know that it's a poor item for warrior and that you have to bank pp for a second Velium Fire Wedding Ring.<br />
2. I don't remember what we said about tribute. Is it awailable on mac server ? if yes use it for haste and a bit of AC/HP if you have enougth pp to feed it.<br />
if there isn't find yourself a haste item (soulcream belt is better than your belt so it can be only good to get one).<br />
3. well you said you are working on lodi shield and eyepatch of the P. so I won't comment on your mask.<br />
4. since you hunt in velious for the two items above, try really really hard to at least start getting Champion/Blademan armor. (upgeade priority : bracers and gloves)<br />
5. don't forget KC either because the clickies from Colbalt armors are usefull (bracer!!! ~&gt; invisibility, ...)<br />
6. I don't like that much your weapons but I can't find somthing powerfull and availlable on your server and that you can get ...<br />
7. stop now with acrylia armor, you upgraded what was the your worse slots, now the diff would be minimum.<br />
<br />
conclusion : worst slot listing<br />
1. Spiked Goblin Ring (~&gt; another velium ring)<br />
2. Mask of the Eight Eyes (~&gt; Eyepatch ...) / Cougar Claw Earring (~orc fang or better)<br />
3. Ry`Gorr Chain Coif / Hero Bracers (cobalt or better for both) <br />
4. Giant Scalemail Bracer / Iksar Scaled Gloves (cobalt or better for both) <br />
5. Smiter's Girdle (soulscream) / Crafted Pauldron (no idee for easy to get)<br />
6. Glimmering Mithril Torque / Acrylia armors (can wait a bit longer)<br />
<br />
NOTE : if you don't have anyhaste, then the soulscream is your top priority.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
EDIT : about the weapons, try to know if the traderecipies of troll smithing include the ykesha weapon. because two Honed Blade of the Ykesha (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9784) would suit you better than what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Roneb McRae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well that honed blade is damned near impossible.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Roneb McRae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">for the shoulders I was thinking greater guard of haste...11% it drops of aero in twilight sea...opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">drum roll please ...... cobalt scar!<br />
<br />
hunt the little otter thingies and loot crustacean armor. its plentiful! its full of stamina! and if your server is as poorly equipped as it appears to be then everything you cant equip you can sell in the bazaar for  much money to buy other slots. no i dont mean solo. i mean a group of six. bring someone who can harmony or pacify because they assist and they run fast. snare the mobs because they run faster than your sow. you will die the first time you go there but its doable.<br />
<br />
if its not doable .... try again in a few levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">don't know anything about gaud of haste, lucy give only this Lesser Guard of Haste (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=2959) which is even poorer than your crafed one.<br />
for haste go for soulcream but sure that you can't hunt in Veksar right now so hope it's avaiable in bazard.<br />
other wise there used to be one liste of haste item somwhere on the old board.<br />
and if you choose tribute (is it avaiable?) don't get an haste iten wihch don't allaow you to get ride of tribute.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : ok, I found the greater version of GoH on alla, it's a bad choice. the 11%  haste is not for a lvl 45+ war, you should already have at least 24%.  and the other stats are not really an improvement from the crafted pauldron, it's much like an even fight.<br />
so if you don't have any haste, go for one, but not a funcky one (under 20%) exept if it costs you nothing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">if they accept then it's enougth, KC mob lvl range is 40-55 so a group of lvl around you should be ok. start with the easy one to gear you up and then you will be able to face to bigger one if single fight (single pull or good CC).<br />
<br />
when you will get used to it and that you hunt safely in KC ask them if they want to try Veksar (lvl 48-65) where there nice dropable loot (not that great of an upgrade for you before the top mob , but still good pp in bazard. and the lvl 55+ can give you soulscrean belt that you really need, and maybe some kylong darmail). or you can try  velious (Keal, ...).<br />
and since you still not have a worn haste item, I suggest to have at least two of them :<br />
 * enchanter (that fit in CCand have the biggest spell haste)<br />
 * a shaman (best buff, debuff, good dps, second best spell haste) <br />
 * a beastlord (good buff, debuff, better dps, third part spell haste) but doesn't stack well with shaman<br />
 * a bard (excelent puller, little CC, improved haste and normal spell haste) stack well with everything.</div></div><hr />
