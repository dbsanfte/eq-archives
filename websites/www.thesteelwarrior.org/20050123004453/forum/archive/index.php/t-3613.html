My main was a Shaman, i played him over 2 years. But now im sick of slow and buff. I sold all my gear and was able to get a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic and 30k in cash.<br />
Is it possible to solo to 54 . I ask because as a Shaman i know if you dont slow, you die fast or your cleric is OOM fast.<br />
I cant inmagine to solo anything besides Old World mobs.<br />
Sure,I read lots of post from people who claim that say can solo easy to 50+ even without a FUNGI !!!!.<br />
Im sure a Shadowknight CAN solo to 50+ so can a Ranger VS animals, but a Warrior or Monk must go toe to toe.<br />
Can i go toe to toe with Kurnark or Luclin mobs 40+.<br />
I wont bet on that.<br />
Thanks for info.</div></div><hr />

But it will be real slow after level 40 or so.  Get yourself a bandaid knife or guaze press, a snare whip, and a truncheon of doom if you can, along with some good dps weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cipps</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you don't have to go toe to toe.  Yah with the right gear you can get to 54.  You can prolly solo to 54 with bandages and stuff.  I know you can stay in highkeep till 40 or so.  I soloed the raider room when I had like crafted.  So i am surea fungi and 30k in other gear will do it easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was soloing in TM at the Katta Castellum zone-in till the low 50's.  That was without a fungi or ToD, or snare whip.  I found that getting the first AA pt in bind wound made a huge difference...  with regular bind wound taking me to 50%, I had to zone into katta a LOT of times to save my ass.  Being able to bw to 60% stopped that about 80% of the time or more.  If you are going to solo a lot, get at least 1 AA in bind wound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your hitpoints/ac (fungi adds some number of hitpoints based on how long the fights are) determine what you can solo, bandages and other stuff help you be more efficient.  You don't want to fight something if you know beforehand that you have to get a proc in order to win.<br />
<br />
Finding stuff to fight that matches your style is important.  I like to straight melee, and run for the zone if necessary.  Lot of empty zones out there, so I don't feel bad doing it.<br />
<br />
With new equipment and the blue changes some time back, you can probably solo into the 50's in solb.  (Used to be a gap in the high 40's where kobolds turned light blue and bugs were still tough.)<br />
<br />
Used to be able to do nurga/droga also, but that went away with the dungeon revamp.  Dunno what level you could start with nurga again now.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns on the deep side is working well for a bunch of my chars.  I suspect it may become just too little exp before 54, but the taskmaster is surprisingly weak.  If you can stand just killing one mob every 20 mins, the taskmaster will get you there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 In combination with some of the weapons mentioned by other people for snare and slow it should be fun to see how you do with them:).<br />
<br />
I am planning to return to eq soon and therefore I have been reading up on the augments stuff and seen that it is possible to add a 50hp lifetap to weapons or even 75lifetap. It would be interesting to see what would happen with these added to blood points. The only drawback is that they do not work untill lev 51 but you were talking about higher level soloing anyways.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tools for the solo warrior:<br />
<br />
1- Fungi. You got that. It's a start.<br />
<br />
2- A good haste item. You need to improve DPS.<br />
<br />
3- Clickable haste. In other words, Eyepatch of Plunder. So that you can stack spell/song haste on top of your good haste item.<br />
<br />
4- Truncheon of Doom. Past level 50 it starts to proc. And it's invaluable because of this.<br />
<br />
5- A lifetapping proc weapon. I used the Black Acrylia Halberd at those levels, but the bloodpoints also help. Basically, what you're doing is reducing your enemy's hit points while increasing yours. This is very useful.<br />
<br />
6- If you forego a lifetapping weapon, make sure you forego it for a very GOOD DPS weapon or weapons. To toe to toe you need to kill the mobs as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
7- Invigorate BP. Cobalt, or Champion's or whatever. It may take awhile due to long cast times and large number of hit points most warriors have, BUT ... you need a way to get back to 100 percent health. Bandages at those levels max out at 50. And the fungi regen is SLOW on a 3 to 4k hit point warrior.<br />
<br />
8- Buffs. Whenever you can, get buffs from people, like Temperance or whatever.<br />
<br />
9- Damage shield. Regal Band of Bathezid, the Shield of the 8th, and Kiva's Blistering Flesh. Let the mob HELP you kill it.<br />
<br />
10- An escape route, and a means to use it. SoW potions. A horse. Run 3. Whatever. Just be able to run away from the mobs if things get bad.<br />
<br />
10a- If you are gonna run faster than the mob, remember that jousting can work, as can bow kiting. Nowhere near as effective as a ranger bow kiting, but runnign away from a mob when you're low on HPs, allowing your fungi to regen you, and still keeping the mob's hit points going DOWN, is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider ...<br />
<br />
Proc augments.<br />
<br />
LDoN offers a set of lifetap proc augs, as well as Guard augs. Both are useful for soloing. However, to get them you need points in adventures, which means you need to group.<br />
<br />
But it's something to consider.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Have fun. But be prepared for large amounts of downtime, even with all the fun toys.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, if you don't have the group skills (read aggro management) you're not going to get picked up for groups in the later levels.  Or I should say, you'll get picked up after lfg for hours, only to be repped for a paladin when the slower/healer/nuker gets tired of you not being able to keep the mob off him/her.  NOBODY should go into the warrior class looking to solo IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solevita</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was right. Solo seems &quot;Impossible &quot;and is even more boring then LFG.<br />
BTW Begging for Buffs is not solo.<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
I agree even with Fungi which gets me around 20 hp sitting as Human war will take some time.<br />
I think i stick with Shadowknight, less trouble at all.  Life Taps , Snare  Invis..... FD not to mention.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for Info. Bye...</div></div><hr />

Riiiiiiiight.<br />

Find me an SK that &quot;solo's&quot; in the planes and doesn't spend some time adding an Ageo or a C3.<br />

Yes, but its easier to get to 54 as a SDK, less trouble. Sure these days noone solo`s without at least a KEI.<br />
But i bet i can solo the SDK with less frustration.:) <br />
Time will tell.........</div></div><hr />

I really don't get your post.<br />
<br />
At all.<br />
<br />
Do you want to solo as a melee?<br />
<br />
If so, MONK is probably your best choice.<br />
<br />
Instant FD, less hit points so the regen on the fungi is much more useful and the easy monk epic is by far the most game-breaking soloing tool out there. And then there's Mend.<br />
<br />
Do you want to be an efficient SOLOER?<br />
<br />
If so then really, Shadowknight ... Warrior ... Monk ... NONE are a good choice.<br />
<br />
Druid, Wizard, Beastlord, Shaman, Necromancer, Bard.<br />
<br />
Pick one, and don't bother with a melee.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying SK's can't solo. I know they can. You know they can.<br />
<br />
But really, what the heck is your point? Why bother coming here and asking if a warrior can solo?<br />
<br />
Of COURSE they can. It's just boring.<br />
<br />
I think you'll find fear kiting excessively boring as well, and that's your primary solo tactic as an SK.<br />
<br />
Good luck. But if you REALLY want to solo for XP, you're barking up the wrong tree.<br />
<br />
Play a beastlord or a necro or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My brother solo'd his iksar to 55 pretty much. Buncha my banked/leftover gear. Some garbage from my guildmates. Borrowed Fungi. Rotting Dain axe. This was early Luclin I guess. He really didn't have real high playtime either(certainly less than I did when I hit 55=P). It was so slow at that point he got bored though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soloed a warrior to 52 with a Fungi.  (Well, 98% solo - I would group if people desperately needed a tank). <br />
<br />
It was immensely easy to the mid-30's.  As an example, at about level 28-29, I could stand in the courtyard of the fort in LOIO and fight single blue mobs non-stop - i.e. the mobs couldn't do enough damage to overcome the regen - I could come out of 3 or 4 fights back to back with close to 100% health. <br />
<br />
It was reasonable to about 45. <br />
<br />
It was very slow after I hit 50. <br />
<br />
I had only an FBSS for haste and my other equipment was marginal (this was well over a year ago).  With better haste, better DPS weapons, better all-around equipment and additional regen through AA's and other items, I could probably have kept going, but I can't imagine it ever being faster than grouped experience post 50. <br />
<br />
My suggestion, if you haven't already tanked the idea, would be to go ahead and get the fungi and burn through 35 or 40 levels. With an additional 30K in equipment, you will level faster than grouping in the right places.  Then sell the fungi and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solevita</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ Superchum.<br />
My point was to ask YOU  WARRIORS if it is possible to solo to 54 with a Fungi and 30 K . NO Offense at all, but it seems that it is a long road, i know grouping is the Key but these days the are no lvl 20 40 groups.At least on Veeshan.<br />
Beastlord is not an option since im sick of slow and then send in pet.<br />
BTW if you get an add as beast you in the same boot as a mage.<br />
I was impressed when i killed Ice Giants with my shaman how STRONG the BL pet was, but believe me, after 55 the mobs hurt badly and you have no root and your slow is NOTHING compared to Shaman until 60+.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />
