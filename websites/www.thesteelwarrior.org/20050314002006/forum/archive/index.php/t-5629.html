You should get a spell that's called protection of something or another, I can't remember the names of a lot of it right now, and I'm too lazy to do the search myself right now. It's an eyeopener in game, and out. I suspect this is what you found, mobs pop it around 10% health.<br />
<br />
The essence of it is... Far too large a number of the mobs /disc stonestance. It kills your BoW, it kills my Greatstaff of Misery, it kills our monk's Battle Fists. It sucks, and there's a version of the same for nukes.<br />
<br />
Edit: I can spell, but, on second thought, I don't need to swear quite that much.</div></div><hr />

I saw a leather bp, that puts the Elem bp to shame. As someone in my guild said, its probably SoE employees linking these items in channels to get people excited about the expansion so they'll go out and buy it.</div></div><hr />

All these extra abilities are not worth the 1% AA per kill they're giving us. The only reason to do GoD right now is drops, xp is way better elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

FYI - Anger procs and Incite are unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you understand how stun immunes messes up Paladins.  Very few Paladins I have played with (actually, none) just start chaining Cease and Desist before the mob's in camp.  What they usually do is either do a Force of Akilae as the mob gets in melee range, or do a Force of Akilae as the mob turns to someone else.  Now immune to stun still generates aggro, but Paladins count on the actual stun to stop the mob from killing your caster.  That's not going to work anymore, at least not all the time.<br />
<br />
On a side note, it feels like stuns are producing less aggro... but can't really verify it, just a feeling.</div></div><hr />

Ok, first of all, you're level 54.  I thought The Overlord's Sanctuary was for &quot;high level&quot; discussion or whatever.  So, I dont even think you'll have to worry about a single thing in GoD, since you won't be going up against it.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I believe I heard it mentioned before, but a spell produces the same amount of hate regardless if it lands or is resisted.</div></div><hr />

Do you have any idea how condescending and elitist that sounds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with stun immunes is that if a mob is immune to stun then stunning it won't stop it from killing your casters.  A lot of people overlook the actual stun part of stun.  Stuns were never more aggro than EB and if a Paladin isn't memming low level ones he can only stun once every 12 seconds (never seen anyone that has the 10 second stun memmed), which isn't that much faster than a high end warrior's ability to proc aggro spells.  However, the 3 seconds where a mob can't move at all is huge for getting you extra time to taunt the mob off the caster, or heal him, or whatever.  Now you can't do that anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why anyone who's not level 65 needs to be concerned with aggro issues in Gates.  It's not like regular mobs are that great XP and you shouldn't be messing with the 1200 hitters on the hard instance dungeons if you're not 65, much less tanking them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have any idea how stupid it sounds when someone who has no experience with higher end raiding comes on to a forum specifically designed for the descussion of the high end game and bitches about class balance?<br />
<br />
This forum is for HIGH LEVEL warrior posting. It is heavily moderated to ensure it remains that way. PoP elemental, Plane of Time, and Time-Level Ldon discussion only please. <br />
<br />
Right.</div></div><hr />

So true!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">several of those mobs with the &quot;gantru + white paint &amp;puffy hair&quot; model seem to have an insane AC boost, like defensive, when they start running at around 20%. my slashing and blunt weapons had no problem until they tried to run off. it was hitting 50s to 90s then suddenly it dropped to single digets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like all the other zones the devs are gona look and go &quot;hey when the mobs in a zone suck the zone sucks&quot;.<br />
<br />
GoD is seemlingly set up as a drive through expansion. There may be some game play there that is intersting but the fun zones are the ones that people play in, I am sorry but haveing mobs run with stoneskin sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can dispel Protection of Discord.  Be glad it's not Reflection of Discord which can't be dispelled (at least I assume that's why it has 198 counters of some kind).<br />
<br />
Like I posted above, Mastruq mitigate somewhere between 80-90% of all melee damage when they get low and it's also a DS.  Either dispel the Protection of Discord or wait for it to run out (2 ticks), or have your nukers finish it off.  You might as well think of it as an enrage on all sides.  It even lasts about the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 60 seconds, it also has enough of a recycle time that you don't really need to worry about it once it goes down: If you can't kill it in 48 seconds of full scale pounding from 20%, you shouldn't be exping off it.<br />
<br />
While I can't say I like watching my melee fall through the floor, I do appreciate the new usefulness this breathes into compact dots such as Blood of Hate, Horror, and the like. My usual group is quite melee heavy, and at the level of DPS we put out, 36 seconds is running at the average LDoN mob's lifespan, be it in normal or hard, and lost ticks of DoTs are very common. Reflection will suck. Alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs with reflection seem quite a bit less common.  I've only seem it on the girl type mobs.  Maybe the priests will have reflection too (that'd make sense) but they don't appear to be a common mob type at least in Natimbi/Barindu/Qinimi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone smacked a reflecting mob with Anger/Incite and watched to see who the final recipient was? It's something that could be quite important, depending on reflect code, and how it interacts with spell-built aggro. This goes doubly for ykesha and the like for building aggro through stuns.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, an SK fearing a reflecting mob for aggro without being Fearless himself could prove to be enormously amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas-<br />
<br />
Any gotten any finishing blows on the dk blue mastruq's yet?  Never bought all the AA upgrades on it, don't know what level those are... wonder if/what a 32k FB would mitigate down to too.  Don't think it could be reflected, and I also didn't notice any reflected weapons procs on the spellshielded ones... yet.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">procs don't get reflected.  The Mastruqs seems too high level to get killed by finishing blow but if they're below 59 then I'd imagine they'd still mitigate 80-90% of 32000, which means they'd take around 3200-6400 from it.  That should be enough to finish it off still.<br />
<br />
If you're really worried about the vie effect just dispel it when they emote.  I don't think they can recast it, at least not for a while.</div></div><hr />
