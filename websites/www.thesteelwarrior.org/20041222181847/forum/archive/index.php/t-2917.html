<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed in the class balance area that some warriors think that archery generates beg level aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if they are doing any damage at all on incoming...<br />
<br />
Using a fairly ok bow (Twisted longbow) class 2 steel silver tipped arrows and a fleeting quiver,  my archery skill is  maxed out at 240.<br />
<br />
  I can often get off around 2-5 shots for  75-600 hitpoints of damage in areas like HoH, before the puller makes it back to me, and effectively switch the pull aggro to myself, it helps a tremendous amount in certain situations and I'd just like to share that.  While this is a very small ammount of damage  compared to aa'ed rangers, the amount of damage done on incoming makes a very noticable difference in my holding aggro.<br />
<br />
  In one case just recently a ranger friend decided to start firing just after I did at an incoming mob.  He was critical hitting for about 3 hits x500, and it still stuck to me, needless to say, I was suprised.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's possible some don't know that you need silver tipped or acrylia arrow heads to hit planar mobs, or any other magic arrowhead, so perhaps this is why they never generate aggro with archery, or perhaps their skill is too low to do any appreciable damage?<br />
<br />
I'm curious to see where other warrior's archery equipment and skills are at, and if others have also noticed this.</div></div><hr />

That would be why. Seriously, when is the last time you ever heard of someone loosing aggro to someone with a bow?</div></div><hr />

During the pull, i'll always have the puller run past me while i tag with a bow.  As long as no one else casts a high agro spell, the mob will always run straight to me and I've found it's much easier to hold initial aggro.<br />
What I'm assuming you're seeing is better agro becuase you're getting the first swings in.<br />
Btw, I'm quite sure it's not the damage you're doing that's generating agro b/c it works the same for me whether I use summoned (magic) arrows or class 3 wood arrows, i.e. no damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
75 to 600 Dmg .. with Class 2 Arrows and a 32 DMG bow?<br />
<br />
<br />
How you do that?<br />
<br />
I have raidbuffed around 1700 atk and use the MM Bow or the Elemental Earth bow and had never near 600 dmg with a class 6 arrow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that when a mob is inc if I start tagging with arrows and a ranger does as well the mob usually turns towards me.  I can't explain it since obviously the ranger is going to outdamage me.  It works though so I don't complain about it.  Bow tagging is huge for us since it is our only means of gaining aggro over a distance and it does usually work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also possible that rangers are coded to generate less aggro with archery, the way wizzies are with nukes... it's obvious that the game can take class into account for various checks for various things, wouldn't surprise me if they toned down ranger ranged weapon damage aggro a bit.  On the other hand, ranged damage seems to generate much much less aggro for anyone... will have to test.  Wife is a 65 high AA ranger, I'll try to set up a &quot;aggro&quot; test to see if she generates less than I do (will use same bow (stonewood) and arrows (condensed shadow).  She'll still do WAY more damage of course, so if we both open up at long range, side by side, it should show if there's any reduction by class.  Will try alternating who hits first, to see if aggro order makes a difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From everything I've seen, no matter how much damage a ranger does on the pull (assuming the ranger is bow tagging only) the mob will always agro me after my tag as long as the puller runs PAST me. <br />
<br />
In other words, the mob will agro whoever is closest.  The amount of damage done doesnt matter a lick.  Like I said, I tag with wooden arrows (hey, I'm cheap) whenever a mage isn't around to summon me some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be more clear I did mean 75-600 roughly total damage on incoming not from single shots.<br />
<br />
 Seems like all the pull aggro from a monk for instance using a shurikan  to pull gets transfered to you, or the pull aggro decays when some damage is done.   I remember when PoP first came out,  I  was using cheaper arrows, and it wasn't working well for me  I couldn't do any damage to the mobs and they tended to ignore me much more than if I did a small amount of damage at a distance.<br />
<br />
 This is perhaps something to do with the code that deals with summoning and damage and pull aggro, and related to the old trick of doing some damage to a mob in order to get it to stick to you and pull it past another group. <br />
<br />
  In some cases I do get summoned with old world mobs, it's kind of funny :)</div></div><hr />

Gives ya that little chance at some nice incoming aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always use a bow on incoming. The highest hit (crit I think) I've noticed is 483. Stonewood Bow, Shadow Tipped Acrylia Arrows, 240 Skill, FA, a bunch of Vengence, and a Hawkeye potion (shh don't tell, well worth using under unusual circumstances).<br />
<br />
What it won't do is guarantee that the mob won't kill the slower if they slow on incoming. In an effort to rescue him, a Cleric will have cast a heal and DA'd, you be running to get close enough to AE Taunt, and some nuker at the other end of the raid will get excited and the fun begins.<br />
<br />
IF everybody behaves themselves and you live through the double quad of 2000's from the unslowed mob and you get an aggro proc which prevents the mob from annilialating the slower and performing the scenario outlined above, then you can smile a little and call yourself a Demi-Knight.<br />

or take something like this Forlorn Totem of Rolfron Zek  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=2569) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't matter how much archery damage you do on inc.  I don't even think it matters if you do any damage at all.  All you are doing is getting on the mob's hate list, so then proximity gives you the mob when he gets there (assuming that the puller gets behind you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plink Arrow, then sit.  Mob comes right torwards you, which is good for putting it into initial position.  Stand up right before it gets to you and start whacking away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont even need to sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I hunt with a damn fine Ranger alot, arch hate is so low that the difference in damage we do is irrelivant when compared to the hate bonus I get for simply standing in front of him when he runs by with the pull.  As long as he does not snare, or Frozen Wind or something like that, his 200-5k incoming damage compared to my 75-400 does not matter.  But I will agree that the first guy to wack away gets a noticable aggro boost.  Plinking on inc is good practice.</div></div><hr />
