It is directly above the main chat windows with the 3 buttons (LFG, Invite/Accept, Decline/Disband).  Look for a vertical layout group window soon as well in the Alternate Layout section of the Download page on my site.</div></div><hr />

Your UI is easily the best I've ever used.  Sad to hear you're hanging it up, guess I'll need to learn to code XML if SoE ever adds more functions to their UI.</div></div><hr />

Sars 3 = I was unemployed and our guild was stuck farming bane weapons.  Sars 4 = full time job, managing 3 webpages, starting my own business, girlfriend, etc etc etc.....you get the point.  Updating a UI takes a little time.  Creating a UI requires large chunks of time.   Do not worry this UI is in permanent beta phase where new things will be added all the time and made available to you at your option.  What you have now is just the base!  Im glad all of you approve and like it, and thanks for using my base.  I am very flattered to know that all your base are belong to me.  <br />

That got a chuckle, and great job on your UI. I'm  considering changing to it.</div></div><hr />

I know where the stats are and will look there if I want to.  I dont need this big silver shiney area that stands out against the rest of the dark chat area and item equip.  Dont get me wrong I LOVE the UI.  I love the buff/song window.  I love the group layout I love the clickies and how you explained in a manner my feeble mind can understand in the readme how to personalize it.  I love the flashing attack line on the top of the screen instead of around my name.  I love the attention to detail you have shown.  This thing is a work of art.  I just need to make that silvery area around my stats not so bright.  Thank you for the hard work.  As soon as I get paid I will be donating.  Something this good should'nt be free.  =)</div></div><hr />

The flashing red line is very cool, but I wish it was at the bottom of the screen or across the top of the chat bars.  Anybody know if it can be moved?  I couldn't find any place where I could grab it.  After reconfiguring all 20! of the hot-swap windows I concluded that I need a lot more clickies...a LOT more.  I will have to work on this.  The weapon slots in the bags is pure genius, although I don't think that's new, it is really great.  Good work and thank you sir.</div></div><hr />

Thats where I put mine. It is your player info box. So do a &quot;/loadskin default 1&quot; and move that sucker to where you want then do a &quot;/Loadskin sars 1&quot; ( or whatever you called it )<br />
<br />
Or you could just type in the x/y  in the UI_Charname_server file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right on, thanks Varaho.</div></div><hr />

Great work Sars.  I think this is the best Melee UI out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalamaf</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI is excellent yet again.  Thanks and keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sarsippius</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole principle behind Sars 4 and why it is my final UI is because I need to stay with this one and make it the best and the most customizeable UI out there.  I hate console UIs because there is no personality behind them...they are screenhogs and cookie cutter.   No two people have the same taste and modular UIs allow personal preferances to take front row center.  <br />
<br />
Sars 3 never satisfied me, and i immediately started to work on sars 4.  You probably remember it was over a full year from when i started to work on it and actually finished it, and during that time, Sars 3 stayed the same while I changed sars 4.  When i came up with the theme behind sars 4, I was finally satisfied enough to know that I would be happy with this design as my base for all my forseeable future playing EQ, not to mention the fact that it takes soooo much damn time to tweak these things out from scratch especially when you are a perfectionist like myself...and I will never have the time I once did to dedicate to this game.  <br />
<br />
Sars 4 will never be finished, but the important fact is that I will be using this day in and day out making changes and adding alternate layouts available for each end-user to have the options available to tailor-fit my UI to their likings.  I am always looking for input and ideas on alternate layouts to make available, and now that the general theme is done, small changes take no time, minor tweaks take 20 minutes and layout changes take less than an hour unless it involves new graphics.  Please stop by my boards and drop any suggestions or ideas you may have as well as check out the other alternate layouts available for your UI when i get started on them.  And as a special bonus....as per Gear's request.....there is a link below to a  hotbutton window without the chrome.<br />

<br />
Thank you so much!  Im really happy to see your intentions are to continue to support the UI.  Ive tried other UI's before and this one just really hooked me from the beginning.  I was using SOES before I tried SARS4 and I cant imagine using anything else in the future.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just downlaoded it, and was wondering if there is any way to move the chat windows? My 3 windows i had going are now all on top of each other and i cannot move them =(<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind htough, that this is only my second UI ever, and i used Oceanspray until about marchm Default since then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just found out I can't use this UI :(.  I love the look everything works fine but I can't find my group window for some reason.  It will show the box for 2nd person in group but not the other 4 is there something I'm missing I really want to use this one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasEci</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The chat window thing kinda got me too. Just stretch and pull em to where your old one's were, just keep moving em. Not bad once ya get the hang of it. (I have 3 upper left, just below lag o' meter, /gu /tell &amp; /channel)<br />
<br />
For the group box, re-load default UI, drag the group box left and below the window selector, this way it'll show the 5 other members in your group. Then just re-load Sars.<br />
<br />
And btw, Sars &gt; all <br />
This is the UI I've been waiting for, and no disappointments!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sars is totally fantastic.<br />
<br />
The single greatest thing is range and weapon slots that are equippable just by opening a bag. I so love that feature.<br />
<br />
And what's truly incredible is that it was made by an *iksar*.  Who'd have thunk it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moving the chat windows is a little cumbersome, but you only have to do it once.  If you really need to move your windows a lot for some reason, there's instructions on the installation page on sars site to turn the title bars back on.<br />
<br />
Somewhere near the bottom of the very last cluster of code and above all of the &lt;Pieces&gt; entries is a line that says &lt;Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Titlebar&gt;. Change that to &lt;Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Titlebar&gt;, save the file, and then press your reset hotkey and voila! If the window is not resizable, you may notice some clipping at the bottom. To correct this you will need to locate the &lt;Size&gt; portion of the same cluster of text at the bottom of the page for that window and add 21 to the &lt;CY&gt;value&lt;/CY&gt;. <br />
<br />
After using this UI for a week, I definitely like it a lot.  I am tempted to go buy a bigger monitor now tho hehe, 1280x1024 makes the text pretty small on a 17&quot; monitor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josua</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have spent a few hours modifying it into something I really like, great job.  I just changed the mouse pointer, inventory, spell book and a few other minor things.<br />
<br />
Thanks Sars.</div></div><hr />

I used it before, and when I came back about 8 weeks ago I didn't have a good updated version.  Thanks for all the work man, going to download it and use it tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group window automatically expands to the right above the chat box when you add members to your group. Works great, and takes up less space when ungrouped.</div></div><hr />
