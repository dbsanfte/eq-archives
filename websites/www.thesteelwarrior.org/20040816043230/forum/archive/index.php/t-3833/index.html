<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although I am new to this board, I am not new to playing a warrior.  My main is a 56 war, to whom I've grown quite attached.<br />
<br />
As many before have posted, I too recognize the difficutly of maintaining aggro when grouped with a pallie or an SK.  However, I fear that merely modifying the taunt skill will not fix our LFG woes.  With the advent of LDoN, Paladins are clearly more sought after than Warriors.<br />
<br />
While we like to accuse the Pallies of having useless utility spells, one thing is certain...  it's awful nice to have a pacify puller in an LDoN adventure.  Even when I assemble an adventure group, here's my priority list:<br />
<br />
1) Secure a cleric<br />
2) invite a slower (Enchanter idealy, but bards and shammies work great also)<br />
3) Find a pacify puller.<br />
<br />
Even in my regular guild adventure group, I feel like a third wheel...  or in this case, a 7th wheel, I suppose.  The group is made up of the following classes:<br />
Cleric, Pally, SK, Wizzie, (Chanter or Shammie) and then me.  <br />
<br />
The Paladin pac pulls, and then the SK immediately takes aggro with a stun.  Basically, this group would be better off with a rogue, as opposed to me.  I feel like they invite me to come because they're my friends, and not because of my contribution to the team.<br />
<br />
I suppose I'm just frustrated that I've invested so much time into this char, only to find that the lvl 12 pally alt I deleted may have been a better path?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FYI, Enchanters can paci, and Bards have a decent lull pre 60 or so.<br />
<br />
 You just have to make sure the Enchanters /assist off you instead of running into the next room. Bards, well, hell, they gotta do something to justify being in plate. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clerics can lull as well.  I work very well with a cleric friend.  I give her targets, she lulls them, I pull.  She follows me on pulls and is ready to go.  Might not work as seamlessly with a pick up group, but when people know there roles and are good at them, a cleric lulling is as useful as anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed.  We have our cleric pacify alot also, if we can't find a pally.  Adventures are definitely do-able with out a pacify puller, don't get me wrong.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is that one utility spell makes pallies significantly more desirable in adventure groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Venr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">and then the SK immediately takes aggro with a stun <br />
<br />
just nitpicking here but SK's cannot cast any type of stun<br />
<br />
Edit: also if i were in that grp setup i'd have all 3 tanks on a diff mob and the wizzy and shaman use ae's and rains rather than single pull</div></div><hr />

I couldnt care less about maintaining agro when grouped with a Pally or an SK.  If they want to measure their dick against mine they can have the agro and they can accept the rez too.  I do pimp DPS from behind anyway.<br />
<br />
Its maintaining agro when grouped with an enchanter that I care about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">3 plate tanks vs 2 plate tanks and 1 rogue / ranger<br />
<br />
Basically, plate tanks have a survivability edge.  You all can take a mob and slap it around and the cleric and take thier time healing you and not lose mana doing it.  The best group I have been in for being relaxing and no stress was<br />
Cleric<br />
Bard<br />
3 Warrior<br />
SK<br />
<br />
Warrior pulling, cleric pacifying rooms in front of us.<br />
Bard always overhasted/Damage shielded.   We were all solidly bulit and just waded in and who cares if anyone got agro except the cleric?<br />
IMO this tank factor is severly underrated for LDON.  IMO the game is much more enjoyable / relaxing if you can just wade into battle and not always have to keep the eye on your enchanter for fear of overagro and death. <br />
<br />
Who cares if the rogue or ranger has 20 percent or whatever better dps than a tank.  Any tank has the advantage of being able to forget them in a 4 / 5 pull situation.  It was rather odd after the 4th or 5th intentional overpull on my part and my wife the cleric, when i asked if she had agro, was like &quot;why would i have agro? i havent needed to heal anyone yet, and its 1 mintue into the combat.  Im beating the snot out of this skeleton.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is the way I do LDoN, and it does not always involve enchanters, clerics, and or shamans!<br />
<br />
Get a decent group with some good DPS. Hell I don't always do it with good DPS groups. You just have to have momentum and you have to know hwat you're doing. It doesn't have to be &quot;balanced.&quot; If no clerics are available, get a druid. If you have a druid, try and get an enchanter or bard. If no enchanter, get a shaman! so now you have either 2-3 people. Get antoher tankish class like a warrior, paladin, SK, or ranger (I prefer the ranger for attack buffs and they can dish out good DPS and still tank decent), and some DPS (monk, rogue, wizard, mage).<br />
<br />
We never ever &quot;pull.&quot; I hate pulling in LDoN, and I hate it when I have monks in my groups that think they have to pull (or anybody for that matter, but it's usually monks that have a pulling mechanism bolted into their brains). My groups move TO the mobs and rarely the reverse. You kill 2-3 mobs. You move to the next room/area of mobs. I don't ever bother pacifying or what not. I just charge a room, which gets all the mobs on me. Enchanter or bard can mez, or shaman can slow (the only time I ever care if mobs are slowed is if we don't have an enchanter or bard to mez). Mobs can be root parked. Whatever floats your boat. Your 2nd tank class can tank one while the rest of the group assists you. If a mob gets on the healer, I just beat/taunt it till it's back on me and continue killing my first target. It may get sloppy sometimes but it works fine for me. Don't forget to shield and area taunt if you have it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i had a cleric pac and pull for us today and it worksout great as long as he knows how to do it. i'll take a pally or 2nd cleric and a chanter or shammy for haste/slows. best group i was in was me pally sk bard cleric and anothewr warrior. the cleric never dropped below 50m lol. i put together some odd groups sometimes. had one with war war sk pal druid ranger we paid a 65 chanter for haste and kei and finished the dungeon WAY ahead of time and killed all the named mobs we could find</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I generally pull for the adventures I go on (normal difficulty). On normal the mobs don't do anywhere near enough damage that I need to spend a lot of time medding, so I'm either pulling or meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gerald -<br />
<br />
that is exactly the way I do LDoN to a T.  There is that way, and the wrong way :)<br />
<br />
Monks do great damage but what you have described is exactly the reason I pick up a secnod warrior before I pick up a monk.  Most of them just feel the need to pull too much, and get upset when I tell them its not allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My normal LDoN group lately is Clr/War/Pal/Pal/BL. The usual 6th we look for is Wiz/Mage/Bard/Chanter - rarely Shaman. One Pally pulls, I piggyback and tank, we do like Gerald does, clear enough of a room to avoid adds and move move move. Cleric is never LoM, Pallies both use their Wave heals after a pingpong happens and I reestablish control. That being said, the RNG truly sucks.<br />
<br />
 N.B. They seemed to have fixed collection mission. Did a collect 27 in 62 minutes and a 29 in 68 minutes with a Bard 6th. No big runs of no items like before, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">alot of people dont seem to &quot;remember&quot; what exping was like before PoP, by the time you were 55, damn near anyone could tank the typical exp garbage for a min or 2. PoP seems to of convinced everyone that only the plate classes can handle the hits. i remember that when a pull went bad in OS, yes, Old Sebilis, everyone tanked something to keep the mobs off the important classes, which was usually just the healer and maybe some random guy in back with a robe, even pets offtanked, or people just learned how to use root more effectivly. i think what it boils doen to is people are just getting lazy, shit, the first month or 2 of PoP damn near every mob enraged until they had to remove it beceuse people were still trying to attack the mobs, even people that werent even tanking. with lvl 65, AAs and all the better equipment out damn near anyone can tank, or at the very least, find a way to keep a mob occupied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well if you are doing normal difficulty LDoN adventures and you are in a decently high level raid guild there is no reason to have a knight or warrior in your group.  Stick a Beastlord for MT, rogues, rangers whatever melee DPS you can get, they all tank just fine, add a healer of some type and go to town.  People do need to keep in mind that for every area a paladin infringes on a warrior from a tanking standpoint(except aggro of course), melee hybrids infringe on the paladin on the other end.  The highest DPS tank that can hold aggro and take the hits is the best one, more AA/FT/DPS the group has the lower on the tanking totem pole you can be to get the job done.  <br />
<br />
An example, a lvl 65 Beastlord does around 50-70% more DPS than my paladin, holds aggro as well, can be the groups slower and can downtime heal.  The extra DPS they cause generally makes up for the extra healing they take so in the end, you kill stuff faster and as efficiently with the BL as tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I appreciate what everyone is saying.  I'm certain that regardless of the specific composition, there are any number of combinations of classes which will be sucessful in an LDoN.  Assuming of course, you're dealing with players who are aware of their roles, and fulfill them well.<br />
<br />
Personally, the only class that I would be nervous to be missing is a Cleric.  I realize that 2 drus can heal almost as well as a cler, but they're still missing the all important Rez factor...<br />
<br />
I guess the other side of the coin is that if you're group is doing well, you won't need a rez.  If you do require a rez, regardless of whether or not you have a cleric, your chancing of winning the LDoN drops significantly.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I find myself waiting for a very long time for a cleric... it's rather frustrating, actually.  Do you typically find that LDoN groups with out a cleric fare as well as groups who do have a cleric?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hell, get a paladin and don't sweat the slight extra exp loss, PoP zones make regaining it trivial. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The original poster is level 56.  At level 56, Paladins are awesome pullers in LDoN.  As you get to the level 65 dungeons, the mob level goes over 55 and Paladins no longer can Pacify pull.  So as you level toward 65, the Paladin's pulling advantage will disappear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Last night I did an LDoN with a group composed of the following:<br />
<br />
cler, chanty, dru, war, war, war.<br />
<br />
Fantastic group.  We won the adventure with 35 mins to spare.  Aggro stayed on the MT 95% of the time, because the other two wars were conscious about aggro management.  <br />
<br />
When a caster accidentally took aggro, one of us would taunt the mob off with in seconds.<br />
<br />
Chanty pacified before the pulls.  If the chanty was having problems getting a mezz to stick on an add, one of us would taunt it off, but not attack it.<br />
<br />
Terrific harmony and great team work...  Would be nice to find more groups like that one.  I changed my mind.  Who needs a stinkin pally?<br />

<br />
I still remember a certain bst getting peeved when I parsed higher dps than him (no pet). I'm like... of course I do, you're a nerfed melee dps class (like a bard).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Did a hard mission last night with this setup -<br />
<br />
 56 Cleric<br />
 59 Bard<br />
 60 SK<br />
 60 War<br />
 60 Enc<br />
 62 Mage<br />
<br />
 Mobs tended from 59-61 and hit for a max of 454. Had we had either the cleric 60 or the enchanter 61, we'd have won easily - as it was, we had no reliable way to single pull and no way to mez adds. And, yes, the SK was able to tank it - had he been a Paladin, he'd have had an even easier time because he could throw heals.<br />
<br />
 (For comparison's sake, we went to PoV afterwards. Mobs hit for more than 500 there)<br />
<br />
N.B. When I say reliable, I mean that there is a small chance that Bard lull will aggro, unlike paci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">SK splitting with FD+snare is nice for when nothing else will work, but it's too slow for LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When on my warrior I make sure there is a pac puller or in some cases just a sham and a back up healer will do.</div></div><hr />
