<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I liked the movie a LOT. I don't even remember being as big a fan of Nightcrawler as I am now...His fight scenes were amazing; being a teleporter and all how he'd warp in and out like that...for film it was one hell of a great job.<br />
<br />
Only dissapointment is .. No Gambit. I guess they replaced him with Iceman for the object of Rogue's affection.<br />
<br />
I liked the sneak bit too on Colossus as a young'un.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ang Lee directed X2? I thought he was doing Teh Hulk.<br />

Also, just wanna say this now, mark your spoilers please. Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whoops yeah My Bad... :D ... I think The Hulk was spinning through my head as I was writing the X-Men thing. :D<br />
<br />
THAT looks excellent as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>grobsmashprexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The movie rocked I really recommend that people go see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't get to see it cuz the last 3 showings of the night were sold out :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>newbbarsher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I saw it last night. For some reason in North Carolina shows dont really sell out unless its Star Wars. I got to the box office at about 4:55 pm, the show was at 5:00 pm. I had to wait in line for about 2 min. and I grabbed two tickets. Anyways, i thought the movie was great. The special effects were also cool, and there were also a few humorous parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The movie was awesome, the attention to detail was very good. The one little thing that kinda irked me was Colossus not having a russian accent..hehe.<br />
<br />
**SPOILERS** <br />
<br />
Being a big fan of Phoenix/Dark Phoenix in the books, I really like the lead in they did to all of that.  I'm guessing we'll be seeing Jean Grey's alter ego in some form or another when they make another flick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">whats the best part?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nightstalker going ballistic in the white house. intense !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lol in the whitehouse. i gotta see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&lt;--&lt; SPOILER &gt;--&gt;<br />
<br />
I hope they do make a 3rd movie. The inclusion of the beginning of the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix saga was an excellent addition. My favorite scenes were Nightcrawler's white-house ownage scene, Magneto's escape, and Wolverine's berserking while defending the school. Lot of people died, which, I found, matched the comic books more accuratly.<br />
<br />
Definetly a must-see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SPOILERS, including possible characters for X3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked it a lot, enjoyed it more than the first. The tie-in with the Phoenix was rad, so was Wolverine's utter badassness. All the mutants were cool, I didn't really not like anyone. And the part where Mystique flipped the base guards the bird while sliding under the closing door was nice. =)<br />
<br />
Sorta disappointed that Gambit was just a name in a database, and Hank McCoy was a blurb on the TV in a bar, but they should be more prominent in the next film.<br />
<br />
Also I saw some character sketches for X3 in a magazine today. Among them were Gambit, the White Queen, Archangel, Juggernaut, and Apocalypse. Take that for what you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">COLOSUS  WRU !<br />
<br />
Awesome movie, just pissed i only saw my favorite for 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Borix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">**SPOILERS** <br />
<br />
Of course i liked the movie a lot, but i was a bit annoyed with some thingies that did not match with the comics.<br />
<br />
Things like:<br />
* Storm doing a snowstorm deep underground?<br />
Storm is only able to do her tricks while being in contact with open air. She is claustrophobic too.<br />
<br />
* Wolverine gets shot into the head<br />
Ok, the guy can regenerate. But dead is dead. I found it hard to believe he can regenerate from that (My corpse can't regenerate either in EQ).<br />
<br />
* Cyclops who got easily beaten by Lady Deathstrike.<br />
Geez he only has to look at her to waste her.<br />
<br />
* The fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike.<br />
Again being able to Regenerate is nice, but the rate at which they regenerated was just hard to believe. <br />
<br />
* Prof Xavier is hurting every mutant in the world. <br />
Well shouldn't he have influenced Jason too in that moment? And when that would happen, wouldn't the illusion on Xavier have been gone too? Doesn't seem right.<br />
<br />
One of the nice features of X-men is the story behind each character. I think they managed to do that very well in the first X-men movie. In this one the action is obviously more important. For me X-1 was the beter film but that is of course just a personal view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Few things to comment on, from posts, and the movie of course.<br />
<br />
Wolverine getting shot in the head and not dying = easy to explain ... his bones are coated with INDESTRUCTABLE adamantium, his skull is a bone, hence INDESTRUCTABLE, you gotta hit him in like his nose, or an eye or something to puncture his head.  That cop prolly shit his pants when he saw Logan get up.<br />
<br />
Gene as Pheonix is gonna rock, shes so much cooler when shes a bad ass.<br />
<br />
Dont piss off the 16 year old kid that can manipulate fire, specially, dont shoot his bud in the head, it makes him mad. (my favorite scene BTW, love the way he obliterated the cops)<br />
<br />
When Wolvie is pissed, dont fuck with him, or try to shoot him with tranquilizers, he just gets more mad, and ends up killing the other half of your army.<br />
<br />
Walls of ice blow up really neat like.<br />
<br />
Nightcrawler never seemed as cool before i saw him on screen.  Just something about the way they portrayed him makes me feel kinda funny, like when we used to climb the ropes in Gym class.<br />
<br />
If your jealous of your girl's affection for Wolvie you change your mind after you watch him make sushi outta an entire batallion of trained soldiers.<br />
<br />
Collosus doesnt like people picking on kids, he throws them through walls.<br />
<br />
If your in a room with a guy that disappears and reappears behind you, dont shoot at him, your just gonna get pounded.<br />
<br />
Tornados are cool, but storm needs a better haircut, and less clothes.<br />
<br />
Iceman is never gonna get head.<br />
<br />
Cyclops is still as gay as he ever was, hes just there for artillery, and will never ever be as cool as Logan.<br />
<br />
When in doubt, change the radio station.<br />
<br />
I noticed a cameo appearance of one of Eva Frost's students (New X-men, issue 114 i think), those chicks are evil, something about quintuplets that equal Prof. X when they link is just scary, considering they are teenagers.  Maybe it was just her haircut though.<br />
<br />
Little girls make the best alarms in the world.<br />
<br />
The little girl in Professor X's dream thingy mind control sequence, forshadowing for his twin perhaps ?? (New X-Men refrence again)<br />
<br />
ok, im not gonna say anymore, cause well, thats pretty much the whole movie, and i dont wanna spoil it anymore for those who read this and havent seen it.<br />
<br />
Even if your not an X-men fan, its worth seeing, cause well, its a damn good action flick as well.  <br />
<br />
MUST SEE ... KICKS ASS ... HARDCORE ASS<br />
<br />
oh, and one more thing, Dont piss off Wolverine, cause well, he doesnt stop till hes dead, and well, he dont die too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Garyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">colossus was cool, magneto's escape was awesome and wolverine was even more badass than he was in the first movie<br />
<br />
however, i was hoping there would be sentinels and gambit in this one. I guess you can only have so much. :( <br />
<br />
also they did a really good job of making cyclops looks like a useless piece of crap pansy @ss =/ they coulda had him show some leadership and do something useful but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They butchered anything relating to deathstryke's storyline, think I heard a whole 2 lines in the entire movie. Guess Kelly Hu was just there to fufill some market segment demographic for males. Colossus had no accent as mentioned above, kinda ruined that character :\ <br />
<br />
On the positive side tho they didn't devote him much other then a few select scenes in the end, nightcrawler was very well done. That opening sequence was badass.<br />
<br />
Going to see it again and try to spot all the mutant cameo's. Saw a few but I know tons more are hiding in there :p</div></div><hr />
