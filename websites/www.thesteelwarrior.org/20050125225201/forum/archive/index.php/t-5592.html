Cost is 1150 adventure points, Mistmoore theme.<br />
<br />
I've been considering getting a Regen I augment for my gloves (to complement Regen II and III in wrist slots). I've always just assumed that the Regen III augment (gleaming ore of dark healing) being labelled as LORE would prevent me from having two (duh). But last night I was screwing around with magelo and successfully added two of this augment to a profile without receiving the usual &quot;this item is lore, you can have only one&quot; warning that you get from Magelo when you add two Lore items to a profile... like when you try to add a Lore item to your bank without first deleting it from your inventory, for example.<br />
<br />
So, my question is this: Is Magelo just not 'catching' the dual lore items because they are augments? Or is it possible to get 2 gleaming ore of dark healing?<br />
<br />
I'm 99% sure it's just magelo not catching it, but I figured I'd ask anyway, and see if anyone has tried. I'd try to pick up a second one, but I'm afraid it would let me purchase it but not let me use it, thus wasting 1150 points... or something shitty along those lines (never fails). Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I tried to purchase a second heated blade aug and it kicked out an error and I still had my points and no second aug.</div></div><hr />
