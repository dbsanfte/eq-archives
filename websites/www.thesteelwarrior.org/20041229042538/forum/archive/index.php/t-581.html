<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey guys, since i got told about that shadow heart and longsword of freedom ive been revolving everything around that<br />
<br />
some hours ago i got a raid together and we went in the bug man cave and began clearing it,<br />
<br />
sadly i had to order AE TL because the raid didnt seem to understand how assist worked, and i knew it was a wipe waiting to happen<br />
<br />
but my question is, when we were in there no sign of the spirit on track, and i dont have much info on him, is he a timed spawn, triggered, random, has placeholders, info on both appreciated, but specifically looking for the one in the bug cave, the thought of setting off the netherbian cycle scares me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Netherbian caves can be tricky.  Best bet, fight up until you are near the Swarmcaller.  Have someone run through the Swarmcallers room, aggroing him and running him up the tunnel.  He summons, so moving him up the tunnel can be a pain in the butt, but you can do it.  Get him up to about the point where the ice starts in the tunnel.  Kill the Swarmcaller there.  This starts the cycle down in his room, but since no one is near his room, you can safely ignore it.  Kill Tawro's guards.  Kill Tawro himself.  When Tawro dies, his Spirit spawns, kill that.<br />
<br />
For Shadow Heart, go kill Radir.  Almost the same as Tawro (Spirit spawns when he dies) except Radir is bit tougher but you don't have to deal with the Swarm cycle which makes things a bit easier.<br />
<br />
If you are upper 50s-60s, this is a single group encounter.  If you are low 50s, it is a good way to train your raid force.  Screwing up in the caves isn't fun and hopefully people will learn quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is how our guild does it. First off he should show on track when outside the caves so don't bother unless he is up. <br />
<br />
The hardest part seems to be getting everyone inside the cave and just far enough inside not to aggro the mobs inside or outside. This is usually where you are going to wipe out if you wipe out at all. <br />
Pull the cave moving in a little deeper as u can. Once you have a clear path to the named mob pull it into the caves just around the corner from it's spawn point. This way once it dies and the spirit pops you have time to med up and get ready if needed. After that all rush in letting the tank lead ... get aggro as usuall. Not to bad at all. I think i was tanking them at 55 or so and never died on the actual mob but getting inside with out aggro can be difficult. The skellis like to aggro from the cieling if someone runs in with aggro and doesn't notice...<br />
Hope it helps and good luck. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah...keep the mobs out of the walls unless or u get summoned to the underworld from time to time but they might have patched that since the last time I have been...</div></div><hr />

One is fire and the other is cold... iirc.  Also one set is undead and the other set is live.  so ivu or invis will work once in the tunnel.  Use ivu to get to the tunnel and gather your forces outside the tunnel before entering.<br />
<br />
I was xping outside one of those tunnels and saw this guild all head into the tunnel.  Anyway, I ask the cleric to group ivu us and awaited the spectal to follow.  sure as Sh*t one of these guys aggroed a skel along the way and the mob started to beat on the pc that aggroed the skel.  With ivu, I went inside to watch the WHOLE guild wipe on a skel hitting through the roof... Was one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  That said, I sent tells to consent and got their clerics all a rez.</div></div><hr />
