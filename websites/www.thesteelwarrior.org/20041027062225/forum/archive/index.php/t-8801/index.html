Spell Icon Effect: Itching Madness<br />
Type: Combat<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that the &quot;itching madness&quot; proc on this generates hate &gt; dd procs, and (perhaps significantly) &lt; yak/stun/hate procs. Anyone have certain knowledge/informed guess?<br />
Oddly, this has a recommended level of 55, but I played with it on a 54 warrior and was getting the proc message (&quot;...whispering voices&quot;).<br />
This dropped off a mob in GE, but I'm pretty sure it was not the mob listed in Alla, or at anyrate that the mob was not level 55, but lower. It was a named, but was dark blue to 54 warrior.</div></div><hr />

I've never used it myself.  I went for the negative hate, -60 dex proc poisons for debuffing instead.  It does have a -30PR resist mod, so the chances of most general mobs resisting it is pretty low.  I don't run across too many that resist Scoriae Bite or Confusing Whisper much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That should generate significantly more aggro than tash: The debuff portion is meaningless, but the poison counters should be quite effective at generating aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used the BoI for 5-8 levels or so and loved the weapon for its ratio, its looks, and its utility for day-to-day exp groups. It is not an aggro weapon, though.<br />
<br />
The ratio makes for nice DPS, and that jagged scimitar look is really cool. The proc is the hard part. I never once saw a mob whip around towards me when the itching madness proc went off (imagine for a second the way a mob turns to you when the Sword of the Bloodsworn procs). On the plus side, my group mates had an easier time landing their spells on the mob once my proc had gone off.<br />
<br />
So -- it's a very mixed report from my end. I loved the weapon, but I had to give it up because I just couldn't rely on it to keep my friends from harm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah, thank you all. <br />
I used this (mainhanded it, in fact) after we picked it up for about two hours in GE while tanking for a shaman, cleric and beast, all of whom were a couple levels higher than the 54 war I was playing. <br />
I had no real troubles retaining aggro while using it, which surprised me a bit (lol and the beastlord even more). As Lathen's experience indicates, I thought it would have significantly less aggro than the droga weps, and presumably it does, but it didn't get anyone (except me) beat up during the experiment, and it didn't seem that the others were throttling themselves back that much. But I assume aggro retention in this case was a function of my groupmates knowing how to play rather than my unique Uber aggro mojo.<br />
Did seem to help the shaman land some spells, as some GE mobs appear to have high resists for their levels.<br />
anyway, thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />
