<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi :)<br />
<br />
I just started playing fresh on Stromm and didn't really know what I wanted to play as a char. For some reason it just hit me in the face &quot;OGRE WARRIOR&quot;. I started him up last night and level 13 now. I've never played a warrior before, so i'm not really sure how i'm supposed to make money to upgrade my gear. All my other chars could solo for money and when I was a newb I killed aqua gobs in BB for great cash. <br />
<br />
But from what I hear/experienced so far warriors really aren't soloing machines, and aqua gobs were nerfed, they don't sell for crap now. :mad: <br />
<br />
Question is, how am I going to make money to keep myself in decent armor/weapons so I can still level? I know that most people say &quot;just level don't worry about it when you get 50+ you'll start getting cash from groups&quot;, but how do I get stuff that will LAST me to 50+? Not a very good tank with newb armor and a rusty sword. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Edit - Is there a serverwide warrior channel? I couldn't find it while searching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the quests for crafted armor but in the meantime look up some minor gear upgrades at Alla's and go camp them.<br />
<br />
The secret that nobody knows however is that green mobs are easy to kill and drop loot you can sell to vendors.<br />
<br />
In short you will not be able to get gear that lasts untill level 50 right off the bat, thats a caster thing.<br />

Oh and the serverwide channel is serverwide.thesteelwarrior<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You may need to split your time between grouping for experience and killing greenies like spiderlings and animals to loot tradeskill components. Bone chips off skellies work also. Newbie armor works to 20s as said. Make friends with healer types, because as a Warrior you cannot solo well for experience, especially on Stromn where you cannot twink yourself. Don't loot every kill or you'll get a bad rap, but definately loot your share, since odd ammounts of coin do not split and default to the looter. You're an Ogre, collect every piece of crap that you can off mobs, it will all add up eventually<br />

Have fun</div></div><hr />
