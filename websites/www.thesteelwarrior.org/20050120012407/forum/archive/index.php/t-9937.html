<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Gaspie on the armor suggestions, and the legs would be the largest upgrade.<br />
However, I'd also say that your AC &amp; hitpoints are pretty good for now, and you might want to consider haste. For  slightly less than 20K you could get a soulscream belt (31% haste) and that would probably do you until you could afford tribute. A spiked seahorse belt is also a possibility, but would probably cost more than 20K (34% haste). Of course, the haste you've got is perfectly fine for the next nine or 10 levels, so if you want you can wait to see if prices fall and deal with it later, while scooping up the AC/hp upgrades that Gaspie suggested now.<br />
But you're well enough geared now I would think you'd be able to have your group cleric practice meleeing or skilling up on his nuking skills as it stands now. Heh.</div></div><hr />
