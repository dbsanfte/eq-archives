<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...is in Sol Ro Tower.<br />
<br />
Your cleric doesn't need much FT, only level 65 for Armor of the Zealot, and you're gtg.<br />
<br />
Your warrior needs around 1600ac and 6500hp unbuffed. (and of course defensive aa's, but that goes without saying)<br />
<br />
Now you got all that settled, zone into Sol Ro Tower and see if anyone is camping the upper 3 stairs. If they are, great, you just got a head start to get to where you want to go. If not, it's gonna take some tricky clearing and time.<br />
<br />
Let's start with the part where groups have cleared most of the 3 stairs for you. head up the far left stair and go left to the long stairs leading up to Xuzl's tower. There will probably be a light blue mephit lackey close to the bottom of the long stairs. If there are still some sentries of ro up guarding the stair, it's no biggie. Just run your warrior with defensive all the way up to Xuzl port-up, with your cleric in tow. Autofollow might be too close as the cleric can get agro as your warrior runs by. Click up with your cleric first, if your warrior can take the few seconds of beating standing outside the port-up, else have your cleric DA before entering the top room.<br />
<br />
Now for the second method to get up there, when you are alone in zone, get your cleric the spell Pacify and an ER IV item. when splitting the sentries, nudge your cleric further and further to your pull, and pacify. Resists can happen, but there is about a 10% chance for that, in my experience. Now for the tricky part. When you are running up the wide stairs from zone-in (either left or right), up top there are 4 sentries. the first 2 up top you can see from standing in the stairs are easy to split with pacify. Once you have killed those, you have to get your cleric targetting the closest of the two mobs up top, without betting in Line of Sight. You just nudge your way up until you see his head, and then you can pacify. Pull the one farthest away.<br />
<br />
Now the rest should eb a breeze. One thing to note, when you are training the mobs up to Xuzl tower, they will NOT follow you once you have clicked up, they will simply warp back to their spawn points.<br />
<br />
As for the mobs in the actual Xuzl tower, they are all easy exp, have less HP and hits for less than the sentries in the main area of the zone.<br />
<br />
You will have to pacify-split the &quot;whirl of cinders&quot; type mobs to the left in the first room with the lava. all mephits on that room can be single pulled, and a named red-con mephit &quot;a pumice collector&quot; can spawn in the place of the &quot;a fire mephit&quot; in the upper right corner of the first room. He can drop runes, a no drop ranger 2hs, and some crappy droppable bow.<br />
<br />
And oh yes, everything here can drop ornate :) pants too!<br />
<br />
ENJOY<br />

<br />
What exactly do you pacify? Do you pacify the guard closer to the back two, then pull the one farther away? Or what? (I think we tried this but had a wanderer up there which aggro'd some more or something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well either you had a roamer or you got too close while pulling, the first 2 at the top are easy to pull away from the ones at top that you can't see from the bottom of the stairs, using just pacify at max range and then an agro spell at max range.</div></div><hr />
