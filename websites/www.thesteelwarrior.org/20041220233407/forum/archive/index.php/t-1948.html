when i was in a PoD group this  monk in a pretty good guild said holy cow a ranger in my guild just used a bow to bowkite he said he averaged 270 dps and said that was low. now to me tanking on a raid the ranger might as well say bye bye. so my idea i know this doesn't have much to help our taunt but help downgrade rangers give them aggro reducing arrows that are summonable at like level 45. then to help us give us a questable quiver that summons arrows with hate like already preposed. i personally have trouble when my friend uses his bow in exp groups and giving up that dps isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I group with rangers almost every day.  One of them I've been grouping with since we were both in our thirties....while I was on my hiatus from the game he passed me up.....by 300AAs.  Anyway, I've seen him dish 270DPS before (using TS) and not once did that mob turn away from me dishing out my little 68DPS.  The only time a ranger get's bow agro in a XP group situation is when he starts poping the mob on incomming.  Assuming you have a monk puller, when the monk FDs then the ranger is the next target (because he has done more damage to the mob since your two arrow shots = 1/100th of the two he dropped in on incoming.)  This is easily fixed, and doesn't require special AA's or items, tell the monk not to FD till you've engaged.<br />
<br />
Now if the ranger pulls (as in most outdoor zones these days) of course he's gonna have agro when the mob comes into camp.  If the rangers any good at his job you will grab agro shortly and he will take several steps back and you'll not see him get hit again.  While rangers know they can take or give up agro whenever they want it, they also know they don't want it most of the time.  Ranger agro is great where it is right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he's kiting, then he is either snare kiting it (moving), or using root/shoot (rooted) which completely negates the double damage bonus on archery for rangers.  At best he was doing in 80-100 DPS range, unless he was using his disc to kite (stupid for exp usage), in which case he might get 180ish at best.<br />

<br />
Tell your ranger friend to stand further away if possible if hes going to chain Brushfire like that (2.5ish cast time, 30 second recast).  The extra distance will help keep his aggro down.  That, or use a Cjolt or Jolt every other nuke.  He should be able to tailor his aggro match your abilities given the tools rangers have to manage aggro... assuming he has a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that the dps added from nukes if i'm already riding the argo line with a warrior (on my ranger, melee'n instead of bowing) aren't worth casting if it means I have to jolt right off after. Dps gain is tiny when you factor in dps lost from attack rounds having to jolt, pretty much wasted 300-370mana for close to nil benefit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To each their own, however I consistantly find that chaining Freezing Winds (if casting a nuke every 30 seconds can be considered chaining) in an exp group in Plane of Fire over the course of the night adds 35-50 DPS (depending on bard in group) to what I would do with just pure melee.  That including casting Jolt when needed, though most of the fights last around 50-60 seconds, so its rare I need to Jolt, because by the time I recast FW and it hits, the mob is nearly dead.  But even then, tossing a 1.5 second casting spell into a parse where the weapon delay is 3.0 unhasted has little impact on your melee DPS.<br />
<br />
I hardly call that wasting mana for next to nil return.<br />
<br />
Of course, the orginal poster said 600 point nukes, so I can only assume hes refering to Brushfire with no focus items... but then, you can't chain cast that one either (recast of 30 seconds), so Im not convinced the poster has all the facts.  But, just as with using my 2H weapon, tossing a Jolt into a fight when using a bow (unless hes using Destory or Windsabre) will have neglible impact on his DPS due to delays and casting times.<br />
<br />
So in my opinion, if his friend wants to maintain his DPS without pulling aggro, just work in a Jolt every so often.  Next to no real impact on DPS, and keeps aggro where it should be.</div></div><hr />
