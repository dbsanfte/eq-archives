<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Spent a good deal of my time camping the obsidian sword out of fire, mainly for the rarity and look.  Well i spent a bit more time to anger it out and now i use it as my off hand tanking weapon.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I've been tanking with it for quite a while and w. an anger proc and boc/a3 anger in mainhand and anger 2 on the pet proccer i have zero trouble w. aggro even on raids.<br />
<br />
now however, i'm thinking of mainhanding it and tossing an A3 aug on it for one reason:<br />
<br />
Those pets /shield me when low on life.  Now, during the course of a fight even offhand i'll see 2 or 3 pets.  Mainhand it's like a Korgo party of pets, and all of em are willing to sacrifice themselves in order to mitigate damage for me =)<br />
<br />
SOOOO awesome that these pets /shield me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">do proced pets count as a death on encounters that spawn mobs on a death?<br />
<br />
otherwise it's totaly cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've heard Carpin Horror stories from pet weapons, although I don't know from first hand knowledge.  (as far as I know we haven't ever had anyone use a pet weapon on those)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow....that's actually a half decent idea....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Could be coded with like 1hp?  Not sure I don't own the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah pets from pet weapons have really shitastical hp. so if one did shield you, it'd take one hit and die. unless you're hunting in CB or something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That bastard D'Vinn needs to die!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The damage taken can still out damage the hp of the mob correct?  aka when i get DT'd  i take 32000 even tho i only have 10.2k.<br />
<br />
so if my little 10 hp pet gets owned for 1000 on a shield job, doesn't he mitigate the full amount of that damage for me?  If that's the case this would be the best weap ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mmmmm...just connected that idea with the Earthshaker Rampage after recalling warriors doing AET + Furious on the skellies that spawn on a person's death(yes, more than one warrior did this on same raid, yeah, everybody died that didn't evac after name died, got the key and Bert flag on same raid tho).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah, the pet would take more dmg than its hp, and it might mitigate some dmg in a fight, but it's certainly not relyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also remember that you can't be sheilded when using a disc.</div></div><hr />
