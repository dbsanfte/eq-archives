I dont know anything about it.  Just recently heard about it.  I know, I'm a little behind on this.....forgive me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiluwen</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did a search and still am puzzled.  All I got was a bunch of macro commands for how to use it.  Can someone explain how it works?  When it should be used?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emeralde</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This command gives you the ability to act as a shield to your target. You get to absorb some damage intended for the person you are shielding.  I use this mostly hoping to help keep someone alive for just that leeetle bit of time it takes for the healer to get a heal cast on them.  Recycle time is 3 mins.<br />
<br />
/shield %T<br />
<br />
%t uses Emeralde as a living shield. <br />
<br />
That is the jist of it..I may not have everything exactly correct. Hope that helped :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To activate it you type in the following<br />
<br />
/shield playername<br />
<br />
You have to be fairly close to the player you are shielding at all times.  When you shield the player the following happens.<br />
<br />
Playername gets hit from the mob for 50% of the normal damage the mob would do to them.<br />
<br />
You get hit from the mob for 75% of the normal damage the mob would do to Playername.<br />
<br />
The mob does 125% of the normal damage with it being split between you and the player you are shielding.<br />
<br />
This can give a player enough time to get healed or you enough time to regain aggro before the other player dies.<br />
<br />
I have been experimenting with it in Plane of Nightmare and first impressions are that it makes the mob mad at you (although it could be coincidence that it turned back to me at that time small number of samples).  A group of RL friends and I have been trying to see if a lvl 46 shammy could slow in PON so my shield key has gotten some use.  So far it seems to be fairly useful in emergencies but it has a short duration.  Fortunately, it has a short refresh time though as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to note is that you cannot use /shield or be the target of a /shield if you are using a discipline.<br />
<br />
I always have a shield hotkey made in exp groups with the enchanter's name on it.  If they draw aggro from a slow, I taunt.  If the taunt fails, I /shield them.  I haven't lost a 'chanter in an experience group for a long time.<br />
<br />
And I have also noticed that it seems to give some aggro... I usually get aggro back after /shielding, even before taunt refreshes and without getting a weapon proc.  Purely anecdotal evidence... haven't tested it at all, but it is a fairly consistent observation.<br />
<br />
It isn't a class defining ability, and it has some shortcomings - but it is another tool in your bag of tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharvana</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silly question, what level can a tank do /shield?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good way to use /shield is setting up a macro.<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/shield %t<br />
<br />
So when you're hitting the mob, the slower lands a slow, and the mob turns around . . . you normally try to use taunt to turn him around.  If that isnt working and the shammy/ench is getting beat on fast use it.<br />
<br />
Since you target the mob, you /assist the target who it's hitting and you shield him/her.  Then hopefully taunt works and the mob faces you again.</div></div><hr />

I thought that might be a low health thing but I am not sure about that now.  Looking back on it though whenever I use shield I get agro without a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield does not add +x aggro, you can test this by walking up to someone being hit by a non-kos mob and /shielding them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I use shield (and Ive been doing it a lot lately), the mob usually turns to me even though my taunt is greyed out.  When Taunt fails I usually use /shield and the mob turns around bout halfway thru the taunt recycle time.  <br />
<br />
Not sure if its a taunt itself, but mob usually turns to me. . . <br />
<br />
Oh btw, my macro for /shield %t keeps changing when I use it.  Say shammy was named Cecil.  Before using it, macro would show /shield %t.  After using it, macro would change to /shield Cecil.  Anyone know how to change this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its right up there with my belief that you can only proc your weapon when attack is on, which is why you can't proc on a riposte with attack off. <br />
<br />
I never seem to proc with rampage when I have attack off, yet when I have my attack on I can proc pretty decently. <br />
<br />
If anyone can prove my theory wrong, I would love it cause then I might start sleeping again as the laws of eq say I am incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take out the %t<br />
<br />
My macro goes like this<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 2<br />
/shield<br />
/pause 2<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
Works great, only problem is you have to retarget if you use it on a cleric since you will probably end up with yourself targeted from the 2nd assist.  On slowers you don't have to do anything.<br />

You can't prove a negative, but Varaho's test is pretty darn conclusive if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went to a Vox raid at lvl 65, just to watch, since I never killed her... <br />
<br />
After they engaged her (and she had aggro on someone, so her banish range was lowered a bit... when I go to perma and no raid goin on she poofs me before I get in the lair)... I creeped up to watch and tried to assist /shield on her.... it actually went off and I shielded the MT for a few seconds, and did not get banished.   well, I did get banished a few seconds after when Vox moved a tad closer, but not only does /shield not generate aggro, it doesn't even put you on the aggro list.  <br />
<br />
I've also shielded folks while banking in chardok, they take damage off my damage shield, but I never take a faction hit for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hemorrhagern</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you say warr can PL now =p</div></div><hr />

That's all it would take if I were another warrior trying to shield Hulanta.  Don't type it all out if you are in a hurry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you /shield a player the person that has the /shield on theme takes NO damage.  I do not think the meatshield take any additional damage just the regular damage output from the MoB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strikingone</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing I noticed is that when someone is runed, you don't seem to take damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalp Bungabunga</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One issue i noticed with this ability was stacking bout half the time i used it .. and only really practical when yur in same group and can keep eye on fellow groupmembers lifebars usually hit it at about 40% life if i know know the recipient is normally prone to many deaths .. but the stacking thing i haven't quite narrowed completely, seems though it is &quot;technically a DI&quot; and thus won't stack with them. It doesn't produce taunt in and of itself but it propells you toward this. Most the situations I at least seem to use it in are vs. mobs that hit very quickly and drop your life bar very fast this produces low health aggro &quot;occasionally&quot; but more often its because you are actually still targeting and fighting the mob you are protecting &quot;x&quot; groupmember from this usually works to your advantage but its so rare that this celestial alignment of proportional loss vs. gain is worth the time to even make a hot key for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Living shield should increase it's range some, it's getting pathetic to be 10 feet from your group member and getting the out of range message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I've been advocating that ever since they added it.  Would change it from a nearly useless skill due to the pathetic range to a pretty cool ability to use while you wait for taunt to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like having insane range, just something within reason at rank3. Yes I know in RP sense I should be right beside them to actually shield a blow, but this game lost most of it's RP sense a couple years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding may not give you aggro,<br />
but I think it lowers the aggro of the person shielded.<br />
<br />
Usually, when taunt doesnt work and I /assist /shield, a second later the mob turns back on me.<br />
That's before I had time to retarget the mob...<br />
<br />
why would the mob start hitting me again, if I havent done anything to him since he turned to someone else?<br />
Only thing I did was /shield.<br />
<br />
So either it lowers the aggro of the person.<br />
Or if you have a DS on you, /shielding makes you hit the mob with your ds, and thus get you aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aegamin</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to write and say thank you to those who suggested making the hot key /shield usersname.  It's something sooo simple that I just never thought of.  it's helped me (and my casters) tremendously.  It's always a good feeling to receive thanks when you protect someone from dying.<br />
<br />
Shield has also helped me with my aggro as well.  I haven't any concrete evidence, but each time a mob would attack a caster, I'd rush up, do my shield thing, and *bam* mob's on me.  Pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.  This website and you posters are awesome. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would explain the discrepancy between the anecdotal evidence (mobs sure do seem to peel off the person you are shielding and get back on you as soon as you use it) and the test results (which show that you don't get added to hate list if you aren't already on it and you /shield someone that is).</div></div><hr />
