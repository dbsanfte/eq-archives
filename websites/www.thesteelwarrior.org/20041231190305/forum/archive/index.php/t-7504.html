<br />
<br />
Our Monk pulled Tormax to the engage area and called for a tag. The closest person to Tormax ( besides the monk ) was our Paladin who was going to be the RT he agroed Tormax and took several hits before I engaged during that time our Monk /q out to remove himself from the hate list. The Paladin became the RT without a problem until we did a tank switch at about 40% at that point I became Rampage. I had understood that rampage is set at engage and that list remains firm unless the RT moves out of rampage range. Am I misunderstanding this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragan</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the paladin moved to top of aggro list at the tank switch, the rampage will shift to the next person on the rampage list. Rampage won't land on the person currently on top of the aggro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I belive that Rampage is set the first time the mob rampages.<br />
<br />
So if the pally agroed, you stepped in to build up agro to take over MT and he rampaged once before you got agro that would put you at the top of the rampage list. But becouse you are now the main focus the second person on the list becouse the rampage tank...the pally as expected. <br />
<br />
But when you switched MA's the it is possible that you were the first person on the ramp list again.</div></div><hr />

But i've had times when it defied that.  When I used to do Arch Lich, who rampages like a rabbit making baby, and I was supposed to be the ramp tank.  I held ramp start of the fight, but a min into it, it started rampaging another, and bounced around afterwards, none of the tanks backed out of range, so why did I lose rampage? The main tank didn't lose aggro to AL, so did I miss something?</div></div><hr />

I personally think that some mobs reset their rampage list periodically or something.  For example, I've had Rydda'dar rampage at the start (here is a mob where you cannot blame anyone for having aggro before the fight starts, not even a puller) and then inexplicably lost it later on.  You can blame a lot of rampage quirks on range or death or memwipe, but none of those apply in that situation.  We definitely don't know the full story about how the rampage list works over longer periods of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seems to be the case, i know on some mobs, or sometimes rampage is set, and its stuck on you or another RT, and other times it seems to change spontaneously, I always felt that aggro had a part in it, like if you dropped too far down the list, then u lose rampage, or something like that</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tagged with an arrow and held rampage for whole fights with attack off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the time Rampage &quot;changes&quot; because the first person on the list doesn't get into melee range until later in the fight.  You may have thought you were on top, but later on some other melee or a caster who is higher than you on the Rampage list gets into range and gets the beat down instead.  As far as Rydda'dar is concerned, last time we did it, the Rampage was semi-AE, directional to his front.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let me see if I understand this. If one tank agro's a rampage mobs and does not get healed or anything he will be the main agro and also be rampage? So who ever is the second agro should (in theory) be the Rampage tank? If this is correct then why on the rooted mobs in SSRA that are mostly rampage bounce the rampage around. Healer....bards... anybody really. The last XTC raid we did I was the second agro.  The MT ran in I was told to give him a second then run in take agro with taunt then pass it back and taunt every once in a while to try and hold down rampage. I was never hit with Rampage. Not  but once probably. Why is it so hard to get a solid hold on the rampage of the perma-rooted mobs in SSRA? Any idea's on how to get a better hold on this would be great. The way I found to be the best on AL was have the Rampage tank be the puller of the 2 guards with him slaping an incite  on AL as he pulls the guard (s) Even with that he didnt have rampage all the time. but most of it. <br />
   My guild leader wanted us to do this new way (new to me) where you have a pally  stunning  AL at the door. Then when they have a good hold MT runs in and is suposed to take agro. Well he was not able to get the agro. He was on rampage and never had agro but for 4-5seconds.  AL would of been facing the DPS  if he had called for the engage. I am at a lost becuase I was told  bye our main monk that he must not have been taunting or he would of taken agro then monk started explaining how taunt works. Me (who is mainly incharge of all tanks and making the tank lineup) and the Main tank were &gt;&lt; frome leaving the guild over it. Because they way they wanted to do it was not working even tho they claimed EVERYBODY does it this way and get used to it becuase its how we doing it. I guess they forgot the 3  almost perfect raids we did on this mob with the way I explained  i did it.<br />
  I am at a loss with this shit guys, need some help.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">rampage list is set by the order in which people aggro the mob.  The moment you pop onto his hate list, you're on his rampage list.  Mobs that have single target rampage start with highest person on that list (first to aggro) and work down, changing targets because of one of three things-<br />
<br />
1.  the highest person on the list dies<br />
2.  the highest person on the list is out of the mobs rampage &quot;range&quot; (far enough away that rampage can't hit you)<br />
3.  the highest person on the list gets aggro<br />
<br />
If any of those happen, Rampage moves on to the next person on the list.  There is no such thing as &quot;AE rampage&quot;, it's just a mob that has enough active rampage targets that it can hit everyone in the raid within range with it's rampage.<br />
<br />
If you really wanna do AL and set ramp correctly, let paladin's and shadowknight's pull the room before AL and AL's room using harmshield/divine aura's.  The pallies/sk's that do the pulling will be at the top of AL's hate list, and will effectively be your rampage tanks for the fight.  Using the HS/DA thing is so they don't get hurt and healed, if they do get healed, the priest healing them will be high up on the rampage list as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The MT ran in I was told to give him a second then run in take agro with taunt then pass it back and taunt every once in a while to try and hold down rampage.<br />
just wondering here, did you do any melee damage (or try to disarm) before you taunted? I ask because as I've understood it rampage builds by hurting the mob, either through direct melee or debuff (bard songs, tash, slow,etc.).  So if you just taunted or incited w/o doing anything to hurt the mob dmg/debuff wise, you could have missed rampage that way.<br />
<br />
I like to have the RT plunk an arrow into the mob just before the MT whacks it and takes aggro.  so RT is actually the first to get on the rampage list (cause they do the first damage) then the MT gets the #2 spot.  So far this has worked well for me.  Seems like, in theory at least, you could order your RT's and have them all dmg the mob in the order you want them to take rampage and THEN have the MT engage.   Not sure how pratical that may be, just a thought really.<br />
<br />
Another thing I wonder about is what happens when someone heals the RT when they are the only one on the Ramp list (before the MT first hits the mob).  Would that healer get the #2 spot on the Ramp list?  Hehe and what if they cast a HoT prior to the RT plunking their arrow in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On rooted rampagers you best memblur him, make sure he is clear of agro (assist him to see if he has anyone on target or use HoTT). Then have the intended RT shoot an arrow at him and go from there. <br />
Rampage on rooted mobs is usually messed up because of pullers getting on agro list while clearing the room then being healed by clerics, getting in bards songs, etc. And always, always make sure bards have songs off while setting rampage /nod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well rampage is only confusing on rooted mob because the mob isn't running to you the moment you aggro it so people tend to be a bit closer than they should be if the mob isn't rooted.  With HoTT it's pretty easy to make sure mem blur actually worked and set up the RT appropriately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh ,most rooted mobs you can blur before setting rampage making sure your other people are outa sight/prox aggro range with songs off.Otherwise the easiest way is probably to have rt's tag for intial aggro.Pullers often end up on rampage  without doing any damage from having initial aggro before any rampages have begun.<br />
<br />
It's been awhile since i couldn't easily predict or explain why single target  rampage went to someone on our raids,but, I remember being baffled in ssra.I'm not sure it's because I wasn't as aware of the variables then or mobs there were just weird...I assume the former.If the hot lands before the receiver has any aggro(including prox) then the healer won't get rampage.Anyone who buffs,heals,sings on ,etc. the rt after he has aggro,or,gets on the hate list in anyway gets a rampage slot.You can't change your place by taunting or building aggro above your initial contact.I'm not saying I fully understand rampage and there aren't hidden factors it's just the way it seems to work for us all the time now.I remember getting blinded and knocked out of range on 1V a few time and having rampage jump even after i reengaged....<br />
<br />
Direct aggro for your ma in a prolonged fight is something else all togeather.If your ma couldn't get aggro It's because other people kept out aggroing him after he succesfully taunted(im assuming he would do this hehe) and a pally could likely do this to your ma np.If you're running the tank line up do some more research about taunt and aggro here.Other class players often have misconceptions about that stuff hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am unconvinced of that conclusion, although the logic is sound.  I have taken AE rampage while fully steathed and completely off any hatelist, but in range.  That's subject to observational bias but still, it is a very strong impression that I have.  I'll confirm it more factually next time I run Sewers 1 or something but I am fairly certain that what we call &quot;AE rampage&quot; is not based on the same rules that normal Rampage is, regardless of how much sense that would make.  Well, either that or the Ramp list is populated by different rules than the normal aggro list, and that seems unlikely.  I've never ended up on Rampage when scouting pulls, even long after the original monks/bards dropped it and despite commonly being well within the pickup range were the mob capable of 'seeing' me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience disagrees with yours, Northerner.  If you go stand under Rallos Zek's gonads without invisibility/stealth after he's already engaged, you will get hit by his AE's but not his AE rampage.  Do something to join his hate list, and presto, you'll get hit by his next rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting indeed.  Well, it's hardly critical as most AE rampages I can edge out of the area anyhow but I must admit I'd be happier to be able to show that AE rampage is behaving in a more sensible manner.  I will indeed test it out on my next outing against an AE ramping target though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of our wizards tested it (on accident) already a long time ago on Warlord Gintolaken.  She was AFK and under the MT corner for the entire duration of the fight and never got hit by AE Rampage (but Storm Comet did hit).  <br />
<br />
It's really easy to verify if for yourself, take anything that hits more than one target with AE rampage (preferably many, like Saryrn), and then stand next to it after MT has aggroed it without engaging it.  Perhaps it is better to call it hatelist rampage as opposed to AE rampage.</div></div><hr />

Was anyone else in melee range of him? Did you have him up on the table or chair or stairs or anything? AFAIK, the Overseer has a pretty short range AE rampage, and AE rampage has Z-axis problems galore.</div></div><hr />

 As for AE rampage I would have to agree with this statment. <br />
hatelist rampage as opposed to AE rampage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much like LMM's fake rampage/really flurry (notice trash in PoEarth has the same habit)<br />
<br />
I myself am torn between believing that there is an ae rampage, or that a mob just might hold more than one rampage list, but I need more parses to prove my theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK a few questions from a rampage noob: <br />
<br />
1. Does rampage range and directionality change per mob, or is it the same? IE can you avoid rampage by hiding behind some / all mobs?<br />
<br />
2. When you say &quot;AE Rampage&quot; aka &quot;Hatelist Rampage&quot;, does that mean there are an unlimited number of possible rampage targets, or is that a number n &gt; 1, and varies depending on the mob?<br />
<br />
3. Are most single group mobs single target, or AE? Is there any way to know (different message or something) or do you just have to watch to see who gets hit ? <br />
<br />
4. Is warriors rampage skill then significantly different than mobs, since it hits everybody within range, rather than using a hatelist?<br />
<br />
5. Is lmm really a fake rampage still? I did him with an open raid for the first time last week, and they set an RT with an arrow tag, and he died even with healers on him. I don't think the MT ever lost aggro, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had some odd experiences with rampage.  When Doing AL once a while back, we had an enchanter get on his hate list.  So we had the enchanter camp and while he was relogging we engaged AL.  When the Enchanter got back in, he was still ramp.<br />
<br />
On subsequent AL kills we tried things like mem-blur and zoning with no results, his Ramp list ALWAYS stayed the same for us.  Then on other mobs like Rhag 2 we would be able to change the ramp list through camping/blurring.  So I have come to the conclusion there is more then 1 type of rampage, there are probably 3 or 4 different types that are all similar, but different enough to cause the confusion we have here.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Yes, LMM is in fact still a Fake Rampager, I did him earlier this week, and through the use of HoTT I know i had aggro the whole time.  Nobody died and all healers, including druids/shamans/clerics.  Were focus'd on me.  I have also looked at my log to double check and each instance of a &quot;Rampage&quot; was another round of attacks on me.</div></div><hr />
