<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I get so pissed off when I visit SK.org and the other site.<br />
<br />
Normally I try to stay the hell away, because I only know what's going to happen, I'll go off on a rant on their board and yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
I ended up going to SK's.org today and have come to the overwhelming conclusion THAT...... people that play shadowknights and post on forums are retarded.  No doubt about it.<br />
<br />
The initial thread I was looking at was about a SK who felt like she wasn't as good of a tank as a warrior(no shit?).  Evidently she was one of her servers top SK's and just didn't think it was fair that she couldn't tank effectively in KT.  There were a few circumstances that partially accounted for this.<br />
 <br />
1) The cleric sucked, and didn't have the mana pool to heal(which really doesn't even belong in KT in the first place).<br />
2) The enchanter would wait to slow until the mob was about 60 or 70percent life.<br />
3) The SK in question has 7.4k unbuffed hitpoints.<br />
4) KT, and all of GoD is pretty much level 70 gameplay.<br />
<br />
Then they all start whining and crying and in general play their fiddle for anyone who will listen, mainly themselves.  It's like one big pitty party. <br />
<br />
I was taking that somewhere good, but now I forget just where that was, it is 6:30am and I haven't been to sleep yet.<br />
<br />
..So, I go on for some more troll action, and come to this incredibly bullshit list.  This is unlike anything I've ever seen before.  Supposedly this list will adress the gap between a Sk and a Paladin, and the gap between Knights and Warriors.  Call me stupid, but I really wasn't aware that we needed to adress the gap between a knight and a warrior.  There is SUPPOSED to be a gap, a somehwat MARGINAL gap.<br />
<br />
The whole premise of this list was to first, nerf the hell out of paladins, and then give SK's warrior abilities.  Admittedly, the new spells for OoW(Paladin) look a bit too good and should probably be beat down with the nerf bat some.<br />
<br />
But lets look at what has already happened, shall we?  In PoP/LDoN, a warrior was all but obsolete.  I distinctly remember alot of warriors being very passionate about a standown in PoK or wherever.  Why?  There was NO NEED for a warrior at all.  A paladin had tanked Quarm, and hell, a monk had tanked Fennin.  Sure, they used warriors to get where they were at, but in hindsight, it's obvious they weren't needed.  2 more clerics to the chain and another second off of the rotation time solved that.  Anyone up for holding aggro w/o even pressing attack?<br />
<br />
I seriously hope they don't give in to the knights in GoD.  I think that reaching level 70 will put things more &quot;in balance&quot;, as obviously such state has not been achieved yet.  GoD was pretty nice for warriors though, we got an extra 500hps to ourselves, and secured our role as THE main tank. <br />
<br />
I don't have a whole lot.  I have defensive and furious.  I have somewhat more mitigation/avoidance/hitpoints.  That's ALL I have.  I want to continue to KEEP what is already there, and should be.</div></div><hr />

Yes warriors should tank better but not this much better.  The gap has grown way to large basically most of your gear is VT/Pop level yet you can do time content while I have some time, elemental and ldon gear and I stilll am way behind you in hp and tanking ability.  <br />
<br />
The gap should be more like 5% as has been stated here.  Obviously you can tank here with inferior gear, still have more hp and this is single group content.  We should be close in tanking.</div></div><hr />

The sad part is it is 5 percent today.  A warrior without a disicpline active tank no more than 5 percent better today.  Most of the knights scream it should be &quot;only&quot; 5 percent, but they have no clue how close they are today.  I just don't get it.  If they get much better they will be tanking better than warriors and they will still be asking to tank &quot;better&quot; and &quot;closer&quot; to warriors.</div></div><hr />

I am using your own threads to come up with that 5% figure.  Obviously its a lot more then 5% if this warrior can outank me with inferior gear from two expansions ago.</div></div><hr />

And i'm telling you that NO, the gap SHOULD NOT be 5%.  It should not EVER be single digit, because that's a fucking mockery of the class system.<br />

Warriors are tanks, and tanks ONLY.  You have a spellbook.  Warriors do not.  Do you see the difference yet?  Obviously not, and I doubt you ever will, so I'm not sure why I'm wasting my time expecting the blind to suddenly read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem dear Inferna is that Warrior as been developped to be able to shine versus high over-cons mob, while knights were meant to shine (more than war, if same stats) agaisnt even-cons. Thus when this piece of shit called GoD was release with a tunning  meant for lvl 70 but that our lvl didn't get to that, only war got the shine while knights got the shaft.<br />
I agree with you that it's unbalance, but we won't get balance into to till OoW with its lvl 70 progress. untill then they can't retune the lvl mob because this would create an expension of PoP difficulty with PoT loot from the beginning!!!<br />
For now, all the nerf they experienced was bullshit and dodn't solve anything. they just increase frustation.<br />
So with this expention we can actually understand better the power and flaws of each tank class, and seeing all the threaks on tanking balance since GoD release, it looks like we were all misunderstanding them and thus the real chore of our respective classes.<br />
<br />
I understand that you get more anger when you see what you explained, but try to stand back and think about it. knights, with their spells, are better tanks than warrior but in return their get more lvl dependancy, creating thus a high specialised tank that shine great when they are in their battlefield, but that turn into crap when they step outside. This can be a shock to wait lvl 65+300AA to discover it with GoD but it has always been there, hidden in your shadow.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, it's your chore as a knight, and you will have to feel the burden till OoW is released.<br />
<br />
 Yoda.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : if a warrior with inferrior gear can out a knight then it's either that :<br />
1. he use his class design ability : def disc<br />
2. you know how to tank only with your spell book, living you tetraplegic when you lost it.<br />
3. you don't know how to tank at all and can effectively do it only with overpowered gears.<br />
I understand this note is really rought, and beleave me me that I didn't want to be so, but I dodn't see many option when it has been parsabily prooven that war and knight tank equally same mob when none use personnal class design (ie spell or disc) and when they have the same stat (ie same lvl, same def AA, same AC, same skills, same modifiers, same stats,...) ; this create a little advantage to war that can't turn off their innate &quot;-1 DI&quot;. So this little difference can move from 2%  to maybe 10%  against very high DI mob (like GoD). At least the difference as been parsed at 5%  agaisnt PoP mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many 8k + SKs are there on your server... you might need one or maybe two hands to count depending on your server population (8k+ hp is still by no means average for a SK doing time+ content... my guild hase only ONE knight over 8k hp unbuffed).  And a warrior certainly doesn't need 8k hp to tank EVERYTHING in KT incudling all the ikkiniz raids (yes including keeper of the altar).<br />
<br />
Why do you think a SK should need to be in the top 10 on their server to tank in a zone like KT?<br />
<br />
-EDIT, and yes it *IS* annoying when a warrior with one group GoD, one piece of EP gear and the rest from gimped velious tells a raiding SK they shouldn't even be tanking in an easily accessible zone like KT.</div></div><hr />

get a clue, we have a entire set of AA you dont, and you have a set of AAs we dont get.<br />
<br />
All of our combat abilitys and bonuses from the AA tree make us do more damage, take less, reposite more etc.<br />

perhaps that warrior had spent less time raiding to look &quot;uber&quot; and alot more time getting AA points and investing them wisely.<br />

i am going to beat my warrior bible again, defensive, duel weild, our aa's, our abilitys you dont have, are what YOU DISCARDED for a SPELLBOOK dont turn around and CRY over it, it is bullshit that you have to &quot;tank as good as warriors&quot; to be an effective class, brenlo said, quite clearly, no mater what the case we will tank better, that means better then YOU ok? that doesnt stop you from being the master of undead, that doesnt stop you from being effective, it doesnt stop you from doing anything but tanking high under-con monsters.<br />

No, his magelo just shows what has been shown over and over again... that sturdiness gave some warriors an ego trip when it bumped them over whatever uber hp level there was in PoP and they did this with doing semi-casual content.<br />

Often when I do pickup LDONs and such, some random ranger I invited might have 4000 hp more than the warrior. It happens, and it's not even that uncommon. But hey, why have that ranger tank high risk LDoN when you might offend the 'tank' who's going to get cut through like paper?<br />
<br />
Without tanking warrior has no place. Get a hybrid in the group and even if they do not tank they bring some sort of useful utility. So having discs that help on hard mobs is not unblanced since we have to be able to tank, if we dont there is no reason for us to join the group, but there is for a hybrid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but then it's not allowed for SKs to be any kind of 'dps' (I mean not an idea that allot of the warriors posing on this board will entertain). Looks at our OOW spells... they're dots and nukes. But apparently we shouldnt be out-dpsing a warrior.<br />
<br />
Basically, if a warrior can't join a group as DPS then a SK certainly can't (and we dont heal/slow etc so not much other point in taking us along). I mean we can feel like we are doing dps (nuke nuke, dot dot, sic pet etc) and it even looks like it... but take a log and look at the numbers and we don't.</div></div><hr />

I dont care if a warrior can tank a zone with less gear than you, its only 2 fucking zones that are broken because a level increase didnt go live for marketing reasons, when OoW comes out people will bitch that it is to easy!<br />
<br />
2 damned trials dont break the damned game, and we are warriors tanking insain stuff is what we do damnit, stop trying to say it is unfair that we can do our job.<br />
<br />
The warrior can have 10 percent less hp and ac then you, and still out tank you BEFORE we got the innate mitigation boost, why? because all our AAs and abilitys have been designed to make us the best tank, period.<br />
<br />
You can tell me i'm wrong, and i'm a stupid poopy head all you want, but you cant tell the devs and their spokesmen they are wrong in their statments unless they are really ass backwords, they run this game.<br />
<br />
tho i do agree it is a shame, paladins, sks, and warriors cant even do enough dps to count as marginal dps, they were going to fix that a few months back, it said they would increase melee and hybrid melee damage to be more in-line with spell damage... after about 2 months of that being up it went missing and forgotten.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough, where exactly is the tier or two of better gear for a Warrior that will let them cast as well or better than either Knight class?  What do you mean it doesn't exist?  If Knights are going to be tanking like a Warrior a tier or two lower, then it just isn't reasonable that a Warrior with a tier or two better gear isn't fearing, snaring, rooting, doting, healing, buffing, and so on, just like a Knight, now is it?<br />
<br />
Oh, hold on, I can already hear the arguement from the Knights.  We're tanks too, our primary functionality is to tank.  Well, no shit sherlock.  Knights tank fine.  If a Warrior in lesser gear is out tanking a Knight than one of a couple of things are happening.  Either the Knight has just made really crappy gear choices and has gone heavy on their caster side, or the Cleric for the Knight really sucks ass while the one for the Warrior is at least decent, or the slower for the Knight really sucks ass while the one for the Warrior is at least decent, or the Warrior is using some combination of furious/defensive.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that Warriors are tanking that much better than a Knight, because all the testing has shown that in reality that isn't true.  The problem is that the content keeps getting tougher and tougher and everyone is losing ground against it except for the most elite of the elite.  Again, the problem isn't with the classes, the problem is with the environment.   I realize that it is particularly attractive to Knights to point to Warriors and demand that they tank as well, but that would still leave you somewhat underpowered against an overpowered environment.  And it would be pattenedly unfair to the Warrior who's only significant strength is being able to tank better than a Knight.</div></div><hr />

The only reason warriors really havent gotten new disciplines is the same reason we can tank level 70 content with certainty that should be luck based at this difficulty is because defensive scales.<br />

take away defensive(which they did in these trials) and we end up less of a tank then they are for just about everything in the trial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some Knights are tanking fine.  Others are having problems.  However if a Warrior says, OMG we're so broken because I couldn't tank in X environment against Y mob, the immediate reaction from all the other Warriors is, get a better group or get better gear.  The immediate reaction from Knights to a Knight saying the exact same thing is, OMG Warriors tank so much better than us, or OMG we need defensive!</div></div><hr />

Do you really think being able to tank one mob every ten minutes using this discipline is really all that out of line considering all the other things Warriors give up on a constant basis to be able to do it?  Do you really think that a group is going to move at the speed that the refresh of defensive allows them by taking a Warrior five levels below their current situation when they have a choice of taking a Knight who can tank the content fine? Can you name the single group mobs currently in GoD which a Knight can not currently tank?<br />

Defensive honestly a tool for boss and named tanking only ... the rest of the time we are pitifully dependant on lady luck and the RNG both to hold our aggro and survive.  I never get to utilize any backup LoH's, stun locks, lifetaps, harm touches, snares, fears to help ME tank better the rest of the time .... or at least hold aggro.<br />

Stun locks may not work on named in GoD trials, but they still provide you with aggro from the getgo that warriors cant even dream of, thus allowing your cleric to heal free of risk and your slowers to land that ever so crucial slow.<br />
<br />
The problem isnt with class balance, it's with the content.  If anything, i'd say there isnt a big enough difference in warrior/knight tanking and the gap should be broadened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats when the problem happend, rather than make a delay the higher ups told the devs, split it up, sell what we have now and we will make a whole new expantion  :eek: <br />
<br />
So basically they did the content for the most part, but had not finished the level increase and had not locked down ALL the spells etc.<br />
<br />
now, they could have left out the level cap raise, but then why would anyone buy the second half of what was suppost to be one expantion? spells all by their lonesome? that wont cut it with most players, so in a marketing driven dumb idea they decide to withhold the levels, cut off some of the endgame zones, pull out some casual zones and basically gut GoD, and leave us with tribute.<br />
<br />
It is not the warrior classes fault, or defensive's fault, that this happend, it is also not our fault they refuse to bring it down to 65, frankly they can not because it would allow the GoD gear to get into the hands of to many people that they feel they are not ready for, people like me.<br />
<br />
you can wait for OoW to make it a walk in the park or you can keep yelling at us and blamming us, but trust me, it wasnt us that screwed you this time around.</div></div><hr />

who said anything about &quot;game breaking ability&quot;? The point that you guys are not getting is warriors - auttoattack/discs. While all hybrids get spellbooks with literaly hundreds of spells. Of course both paladins and shadowknights claim them ALL USELESS. SKs are one of the best solo and dueling classes out there. Pallies get stuns, res, group heals and class buffs. We can not offer an expert opinion on what spells are there to help you out in every tanking situation we do know however that anyone who says they do not have any usefull spells at 65 is full of shit. We dont have to describe your utility and usefullness to a group that you bring other then tanking. Its you who should be the ones that to educate us on that issue. Warriors have no business doing anything else in the group. There are special scenarios of course then having more then one tank works out well, but these are extremely rare.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit.  Name a single mob that is single group content a properly geared Knight can't tank.  Knights are tanking fine.  Knight hysteria generated at the beginning of GoD when Knights weren't tanking fine because of overpowered content from a half baked expansion is the only thing fueling the current fire of Knight preceived tanking woes.</div></div><hr />

Moreso the fact that only 1 tank has this game breaking ability? <br />
<br />
First off, warriors have lamented the fact that we had to use a discipline to tank for years now. <br />
<br />
Secondly, No as a matter of fact I don't see anything wrong with me using a discipline to tank level 70+mobs. That is, of course, because I'm level 65. My discipline helps to bridge that gap for 3 minutes. I'm interested in knowing what level 70 mobs you're exping on btw, because that's the only time that defensive is really overpowered - in the single group content. It allows a warrior to tough things out that they really should die to. It allows heals to stretch too far, and it trivializes a lot of content. However, the last time I used defensive with a single group, we were trying to take out a raid-mob, so I would classify those as similar enough for comparisons sake.<br />
<br />
Now you on the otherhand; You use your fears and stuns on nearly every single mob that is pulled to camp, whether it's a raid or a single group. You manipulate agro on a whim, and if you don't want it anymore you have ways to survive it (DA/Heals, Harmshield/FD).  When you're done, your mana pool isn't even touched.<br />
<br />
This begs the question of which is more game breaking. I personally don't give a damn about either. They've been woven into the game for years, and to try and change them now would not only be a waste of resources, but you would simply find something else wrong with it.<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
The reality is that there are 2 directions that this can go: All three tanks share some version of a melee mitigation ability, or that select future encounters have this ability rendered useless at a dev's whim. Which do you prefer?<br />
<br />
Your logic astounds me.  There are only 2 solutions? Both of which turn knights into a pseudo-tank mage, and completely cripple warriors? Genius, simply genius.<br />
<br />
Let me make it simple. Warriors are supposed to be the best tank, not the only tank. What makes him the best tank? Less mana to heal him, more safety buffer when shit hits the fan, basically the most efficient tank. When the second string tanks (knights) don't have the tools to fulfill their primary role (tanking, as much as warriors want to deny it) then there's a problem.<br />
<br />
Sorry to disappoint you, but knights should never have a 'primary role'. If you have a primary responsibility, you aren't playing your character to it's maximum potential. I feel for your guildmates and groupmates because they could have such a great asset  -- if only he would realize what he had, instead of being so preoccupied with what others have.</div></div><hr />

Of course there's nothing wrong with that. That is the design of the class. Warriors have been the &quot;tools&quot; with which every expansion has been beaten prior to the gearing/levelling of every class, except maybe for Luclin, which had only marginal increases in difficulty over the previous expansion.<br />
Moreso the fact that only 1 tank has this game breaking ability?<br />
Defensive is not game breaking, it's game defining.<br />
<br />
Yes, we get an infinitely scaling discipline.  In exchange for that, we never get any new disciplines from expansions.<br />
<br />
It could have been designed differently: our disciplines could have capped.  Then every expansion would have just given us newer, better disciplines to replace the old ones.  Sound familiar?  That is the model for spell progression.<br />
<br />
Yes, disciplines are different from spells.  Disciplines scale, whereas most spells do not.  Welcome to the Kunark era. :)  For more than 4 years the game has been designed to account for disciplines.<br />
<br />
Those who don't have disciplines might be disadvantaged at times... sort of like how those without spellbooks are disadvantaged at times, perhaps.</div></div><hr />

Now let us try and move away from the idiocy that is you, and realize that all SK's want is god mode.  You want furious/defensive WHILE retaining your spell book, which you seem to think is useless, apparently.<br />
<br />
We should go ahead and give into the knights complaining about how they aren't good enough tanks and see where that leaves warriors.  The second paladins/SK's get defensive discs, warriors are done.  It's also probably that warriors will becomes signifigantly less useful in GoD when OoW is released.<br />

A pallly has a useful spell book when they tank.<br />
A warrior has useful disc's when they tank.<br />
I just tank with none atm.  If my spells could be effect or even cast when I am tanking a mob, I would feel balanced.<br />
<br />
As it stands, when I tank, I have to go merely by AC/hps.  I get aggro before the fight even starts, and one of my aggro spells casts so fast, I can keep trying it and usually hold aggro fine.  If I had defensive abilities unique to my class that would work would be great.  Since warriors keep referring to my spellbook then so be it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;&lt;Well your the one saying the gap is 5%. I don't think it is. Its your own threads on this board that are saying this.<br />
<br />
Obviously its a lot more if this warrior can outank me with inferior gear.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
counting typical hp differences it may well be 10 percent but ...<br />
<br />
let me point this out to you inferna....<br />
<br />
when i first turned 65 i could be outtanked by very large numbers of wizards enchanters mages druids necros clerics shamans and so on. im not talking about their pets. im talking about THEM. indeed it was arguably by their politeness alone that i was given the opportunity to tank in many experience groups. the reasons were aa and gear which they had but i did not. not only could a fully decked out caster mitigate better than i could but he could hold agro better as well. is it any wonder warriors have an almost obsessive desire to always be upgrading their gear and aa? its not because they need the strokes of being uber. its because they want to feel useful to their groups and raids.<br />
<br />
if its like that now consider what it was like before the &quot;warrior fix&quot; late last year. it was so bad then that even well equipped warriors with many aa were simply not needed except in a small number of raid encounters. it was difficult for them to find groups and get the aa necessary to even have a chance of one day being useful in the high end content.<br />
<br />
so you are complaining that you cant tank as well as a warrior with most of his aa like you but decidely inferior gear. why didnt you make a warrior if you are in love with tanking raid mobs so much? like many others here have pointed out mitigating is the ONLY thing a warrior is capable of doing better than other classes. trying to argue that they should only mitigate say 5 percent better is extrordinarily lame. its like arguing that a druid should be able to ch for 7125 hp (5 percent less than a cleric) that a necro should be able to mez every single mob that an enchanter can mez but for 20 seconds less duration or that a mage should be able to mannaburn for 5 percent less damage than a wizard.<br />
<br />
the warrior class is unique in that they are the only class who ever had to suffer 2 long years of being only 5 percent ahead of other melees in the only thing they were ever designed to do at all, such a slim margin that any significant gear difference at all overwhelmed that advantage.<br />
<br />
i agree that the problem is not shadowknights. the problem is all of eq. ive seen whiners from almost every class. since my original main was a druid i used to read the druid boards alot and i saw probably more whining there than on any class boards ever. some of them simultaneously wanted to heal like a cleric rez like a cleric nuke like a wizard mez all animals and even have a summoned pet comparable to a necro's.<br />
<br />
on the warrior boards i saw people complain that they wanted to be able to get a group in less than 3 hours. do you see any difference here?<br />
<br />
you complain that you arent top pick as raid tank as long as there is a warrior around. guess what? druids are never top pick for the heal chain as long as there are clerics around.  get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scal</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowknights are not asking for a Full-Scale Defensive disc.  The majority of the SKs are asking for a Riposte Disc or possibly a mini Defensive.  While giving a mini defensive would not come close to taking a warrior's role as the main tank on raid mobs. Hell, Knights do not have a good method of picking up aggro - our taunt outkey has about a 1/3? chance of succeeding.  Knights dominate at building aggro and maintaining aggro, we are not very good at stealing aggro.<br />
<br />
   I am more inclined to a fast refresh Riposte Disc myself.  Currently, Shadowknights are the only melee/Hybrid that cannot push a button that provides Instant Damage Mitigation (that scales to content) without losing aggro. <br />
Lifetaps/Leechcurse/Harmshield/Feign Death do not fit this role for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
So what is an SKs role? <br />
1) Without Paci/Stonewall/Instant FD/Spell Cast Recovery bug fixed, we cannot pull GoD. <br />
2) Without Stuns we are way too inefficent to tank GoD trash. <br />
3) Without defensive/Ripo/AE taunt, we cannot even get established to Tank a raid mob.  <br />
4) DPS Tank? We barely do 80% DPS of what a warrior does.  <br />
5) Exp Group Tank? Our Zevbite (FT9ish for the entire group) cannot compare to what a paladin brings (Backup Rezzer/Group Heals/Stuns) or the safety of having a warrior tank.  Not to mention SKs have difficulty using our spell book while tanking because the spell [Fear] SKs use for aggro does nothing on mobs above level 55.<br />
<br />
Here is what an SK has going atm<br />
1) SKs can solo old Raid Mobs better than anyone else<br />
2) Time geared+ SKs are the top of the food chain in PvP<br />
3) SKs have the ability to click a button for 7200-10000 (with focus) damage once every 60 minutes<br />
4) SKs can use a Circlet of Shadows<br />
5) SKs pull well in LDoN/PoP<br />
6) Zevbite is great for Pre-PoP fights and Xegony<br />
<br />
   I really cannot think of anything else that SKs have going at the current time.  We are not asking to be right up on a warrior's ass on tanking but rather to be farther away from the DPS melee. <br />
<br />
  Do you really think the Developers would make SKs be better tanks than warriors? Giving BSTs slow did not break the shaman class, Giving druids a form of Cheal did not ruin the Cleric class. Why would giving Knights a ripo/parry disc OR a mini-defensive ruin the Warrior class?  Warriors would still be the best tank by a marginal line. (Better AC/HP/mitigation/defensive/AE taunt/Furious/DPS, not like it matters much when tanking in a raid)</div></div><hr />

No, I hope devs don't make SK (or paladin) better tanks than warriors, but the current set of spells (at least the paladin ones) make it look like they are going to make paladins the end all be all of all tanking from kunark to OoW final boss tanking.</div></div><hr />

Is bullshit.<br />
<br />
If you want to tank the biggest and baddest raid content then make a warrior I can live with, thats what I want to do and why I play a warrior, but since when has tanking single group content become a warrior *only* thing?  <br />
<br />
KT is an XP zone, type 8 augs and gear drop there so its clearly aimed at Elemental to Time geared players and a well geared elemental SK or Pally should be able to tank there.  A Knight's spellbook (SKs in particular, though Pallys cant stun most KT stuff either) is very ineffective vs our -1 DI advantage, HP advantage and discs, particularly against named.<br />
<br />
I can understand kicking up a storm when an SK comes and demands defensive, though personally I'm not against them getting a lesser mitigation ability, the same for furious, though once again I wouldn't oppose seeing knights with an auto block (sheild block?) ability as DA and HarmShield aren't tanking abilities, but as it stands Knight spellbooks haven't kept up with content while a warrior's innate advantages have scaled with it well.   I think we should support them in getting the spellbook upgrades they need rather than spouting BS that makes this community look like a bunch of shortbuss rejects.</div></div><hr />

If certain warriors would stop crying bloody murder every chance they get about Knights stealing their thunder, they'd realize that no sane Knight wants to tank boss mobs, no Knight wants to take a Warrior's raid role. What they want is one of their own. Knights were, in the past, due to their snap aggro, the masters of off-tanking. When mobs started hitting harder and Warriors got a form of snap aggro, they became the preferred off tank as well as main tank. Basically the best tank for any job save stunnable content, which Paladins own. Don't get me started about Stuns... If Defensive is broken, stuns are potentially mega broken, especially the proposed OoW stun. Anyways, SK's get the shaft tankwise, the only thing they have going for them is Aura of Pain, the AC self buff.<br />
<br />
Much is made of the vaunted Knight aggro. Well, I am reduced to using the semi- exploit of casting Fear to aggro mobs. This has one advantage: I cast it at will. Well sort of. I need to channel through the hits, while I cast I am not swinging, and if I don't pull aggro with one cast I have a fairly long recast. Warriors quad proc'ing + incite has made aggro a joke and Warriors know it. <br />
<br />
When I say Knights don't have the tools to do their job, I'm talking about popping a furious/WS/Voiddance disc on a Heartsstriker Jhiru type mob to give my group the win, or some kind of melee mitigation disc I can use tanking Forlorn Relics in Kod Taz, unless you define SK &quot;tanking&quot; kiting the mob around while my group nukes it so I don't get squished like a bug.<br />

A Knight's spellbook (SKs in particular, though Pallys cant stun most KT stuff either) is very ineffective vs our -1 DI advantage, HP advantage and discs, particularly against named.<br />
<br />
Who is claiming they can't tank there?  Seriously, are they failing in droves or is it just some of the time?  And if they're failing in droves, why is that a class balance issue and not a content issue?  Why exactly is it that whenever a Warrior struggles with content, it's that the Warrior is undgeared, under AAed, with a bad group, or the content is hosed, but with a Knight it's always they don't tank as well as a Warrior?  They're not supposed to tank as well as a Warrior.  They're supposed to tank well enough to defeat the content.  And if that's not happening, then the content needs to be adjusted.  You don't strip Warriors of the few bones they have left by handing them to the Knights.  Let's get real.<br />
<br />
Chania, again, list the one content mobs Knights that are properly geared can't tank.  Until you do, you're blowing nothing but smoke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I say Knights don't have the tools to do their job, I'm talking about popping a furious/WS/Voiddance disc on a Heartsstriker Jhiru type mob to give my group the win, or some kind of melee mitigation disc I can use tanking Forlorn Relics in Kod Taz, unless you define SK &quot;tanking&quot; kiting the mob around while my group nukes it so I don't get squished like a bug<br />
<br />
There are plenty of single groupable named GoD mobs where it is simply not practical to take a knight when you could take a warrior, even a much lesser geared warrior.  For example, when I got my chanter through Vxed we had an SK tank who pretty much spent the whole time FD while a CoD pet tanked.  We had a few named and the Pet wouldnt last through them so we tried to have the SK tank.  With a cleric and a druid healing and a CoD pet for DPS there were some mobs we simply couldnt keep the SK alive long enough to kill.<br />
<br />
That SK was around 6.8k hps / 1800 AC unbuffed, elemental or VT in every slot, that was single group content that he should have been able to tank successfully, and with a VT geared warrior or even an equally geared ranger with WS/spam heals we would have been able to beat those named with that group composition.  Take away the CoD pet and sure the ranger wouldnt have lasted, but a lesser geared warrior could have tanked it while it would have been exactly the same with the SK - destroyed by spike damage in less than 30secs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights -  You get spells. You get utility. You aren't meant to be as good at tanking as a warrior. Sorry, end of story. IF you wanted to be able to tank the big bosses, sorry you picked the wrong class. Want spells and warrior abilities without giving something up in return, you need a reality check.<br />
Warriors - we tank. End of story. We do it in groups, we do it in raids. We are THE best tank. We don't get spells, we don't get utility. <br />
<br />
Why don't we all wait until OoW comes out and we get 5 more levels? Then address the situation IF it remains the same. Cause right at the moment, all I see is 2 classes trying to get more power than they deserve, and one class prepared to quit EQ if the other 2 get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is bullshit.<br />
<br />
If you want to tank the biggest and baddest raid content then make a warrior I can live with, thats what I want to do and why I play a warrior, but since when has tanking single group content become a warrior *only* thing?  <br />
<br />
<br />
its funny you call bullshit, being so full of it helps you pick it out of a crowd i guess, your very statment shows how much bias and hearsay you go off of.<br />
<br />
Lets make it clear, there is a differance between &quot;raid monsters&quot; &quot;single group monster&quot; and &quot;single group xp monsters&quot;<br />
<br />
You are not ment to tank raid mobs, the single group content tag is miss-leading so you feel no problem with spreading it about liberaly to suit your purpose.<br />
<br />
You are ment to be just as viable for &quot;single group xp monsters&quot; as a warrior, and you are.<br />
<br />
As for single group encounters, I know how it feels, warriors were a pull thru class in the PoJ trials up until the changes because we couldnt hold the aggro needed so people couldnt go full burn soon enough, just like pets are now preferd for the trials.<br />
<br />
&quot;single group monsters&quot; needed for progression is a stupid thing that needs to burn in hell and die, it will always leave someone out when there are 16 classes and 6 group spots, more so when it is fucking insain level 70 monsters none of us have any bases for killing.<br />
<br />
when you have problems with getting an xp group, ya I will agree you need a buff up in your abilitys, but until then your just complaining about 2 trials that people dont even do for xp, trials most would prefer not to repeat unless it is to help out a friend or they are extreme loot hunters.<br />
<br />
This is 2 ruddy little trials, not xp monster so dont say &quot;its one group so i should be able to do it *giggle*&quot; xp and progression are DIFFERNT you can not apply the same rules to both because of the differnt settings they are in.<br />
<br />
btw, a shadowknight and a paladin have made it past this trial, it is not impossible as you say, and so what if a warrior with less gear can tank better? no amount of gear will allow us to cast better than you, and we only tank better for the short duration of defensive.<br />
if you can not see the simple truth in this, you need to reflect on it a bit more</div></div><hr />

 you complain that you arent top pick as raid tank as long as there is a warrior around. guess what? druids are never top pick for the heal chain as long as there are clerics around.  get used to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol thats so funny I dare anyone to find that i posted that on any board ever!  All I have been talking about is single group content and I didnt even mention defensive in my post.  If you read my post all I talk about is a DI bump (and I recommend giving warriors one too and a riposte disk).  I never recommended defensive in my post.  And I am talking about single group content not raids.  I don't want to tank raid bosses personally.  And things have changed in the game since I made my sk (almost over night).<br />

Going from being to easily tank single group content to getting almost one rounded.<br />

Do any other hybrids get a defensive ability? no<br />
Do the others get a autoparry/avoid type of discpline? yes<br />

so if we give knights both.... how long will it be until everyone wants one that is a hybrid.... and then casters want disciplines to.... where does the buck stop here, or at the end of that class blurring ?<br />
<br />
I am not agenst doing what should have been there from day 1, which is a autoparry for knights, but no one but us should have any form of defensive, I bet the majority of the knights trying this have not had vie casted on them.<br />

I wish you would all go and read what I posted on SK.org.  Its not so much that I am failing as much as I am not tanking well and yes its very difficult to tank any melee type single gorup named as often I am one or two rounded.  If I had some type of riposte disc this could be avoided.<br />

Best tank meaning most mana efficient to heal, beefiest giving the biggest margin for error in case of a missed heal or an overpull. What people had an issue with was Warriors being the ONLY viable tank for many GoD single group encounters. Or  Rangers/Monks with avoidance discs being better at tanking the low HP boss mobs that we see in the trials like Jhiru, and any mobs in the future like him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most Warriors haven't objected to that in concept, as long as it isn't say something to be used for every single mob and doesn't turn into something where Knights become clearly the best group tank as a result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chania see it from this prospective...<br />
<br />
lets say we have 2 runners, and they do a 9k run and they tie for first, they are, for all purposes in this setting, just as viable as the other.... lets step it up to a 10k run, one of the runners comes in first, the other in second.<br />
<br />
does that mean the second man is useless? far from it but he just wasnt able to keep up when things got to extreme.<br />
<br />
that is what we see here, if we are better by any noticeable amount, people will notice it only when things get the most extreme, and any time things get to extreme people stop seeing you as valid tanks, its not that you are not good tanks, it is that the encounter is to extreme.<br />
<br />
when OoW comes out i am certain it will take off alot of the pressure and make GoD not as bad as it is made out to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quickly going back to the Vxed example, <br />
<br />
This is 2 ruddy little trials, not xp monster so dont say &quot;its one group so i should be able to do it *giggle*&quot; xp and progression are DIFFERNT you can not apply the same rules to both because of the differnt settings they are in.<br />
<br />
there are no named in Vxed that you need to kill for progression, they are single group mobs that are killed for loot.  For Tipt you are right, you dont change a class because of a single mob, the content is the problem more so than the class. (which is not to say the class doesnt have problems, simply that Tipt isnt the reason those problems need to be fixed).<br />
<br />
I am not agenst doing what should have been there from day 1, which is a autoparry for knights,<br />
<br />
holy shit, I think thats 3 things we're agreeing on !!<br />
<br />
&quot;if you want to tank, make a warrior&quot; though? I still say thats BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd advise you to reread my post, its focused on SKs, not so much paladins.  I'd also advise you to support your opinions with information.<br />
<br />
So are you to tell me that you want changes for SK only?  No improvements to paladins?  Most of the &quot;knights&quot; ask for changes for both knights.<br />
<br />
What did I say that was opinion?  What information would you like for anything I have said?<br />
<br />
It is fact warriors have a multiplier to DI of 0.95 that results in 1 to 4 percent less damage on each hit depending on DI value of mob.<br />
<br />
It is fact warriors have higher P/R/D skill caps and this results in between 1 to 2 percent less hits on the warrior.  This results in 1 to 2 percent less damage in the end.<br />
<br />
it is fact warriors have the same AC as both knights based off gear with the exception of the BP slot if using class specific gear.  Most &quot;average&quot; players don't have a lot of class gear.  Ornate costs a lot to get and is easily replaced if you can obtain it.  Elemental gear is rare and is easily replaced by better gear.  I don't know of anyone with more than 2 ornate/elemental items.  It is just too easy to get better.  Now add to this knights can get &quot;easy&quot; 40/28 with stun proc so their &quot;hate per second&quot; will be about where a warrior is with two 1h plus they get a shield.  The net result, most knights can have equal agro for slowing/nuking and better ac.<br />
<br />
It is fact warriors have 3 percent more HP from gear and 4 percent more HP from 60 AA (at high end.)  That is a total of about 7 percent more HP, but having 12k HP doesn't make you a better tank in an exp group.  It makes you a better raid tank.<br />
<br />
it is a fact warriors don't get a 100 to 200 AC self buff (AC tap), a self buff that stacks with everything that gives 13 to 46 AC and 150 to 585 HP, or stuns which do a minimum of 30 percent avoidance on any mob that isn't stun immune.<br />
<br />
Basically the difference is around 2 to 6 percent in tanking mitigation and avoidance not counting spells.  If that isn't the definition of &quot;on my ass&quot; I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
Oh and Chania, we are still waiting on where you can't tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shit! All this time the tanking difference between SK's and Warriors is only 2%! And thats not counting spells! So, I figger, if I cast my AC self buff, surely thats worth 2-3%? So I IN FACT tank better than a Warrior! Man, all this time I guess I've been wearing my armour inside out. Well, I'm gonna log right in and turn that shit around! Thank you Lokkak! And I already mentioned Jhiru, where Wars/Rangers/Monks and even goddamn Rogues can Furious/WS/Whatever to tank him, while Knights can hope the RNG is kind to them. And the Forlorn Relic guys in the KT pit are not tankable by Knights, especially the yellow summoning bastard. <br />
<br />
Oh, and Gerick thats a pretty good analogy about the runners. This is where I can agree that the content is at fault.  The trouble here is that I am at the mercy of the devs to appropriately tune content more towards 9k runs and only a few 10k runs, where my shortcomings would be more evident. Unfortunately, with their track record, I am loath to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change to defensive just re-aferms that the devs still play casting classes to much(first made known because they said what they played in the gamespy and irc chat)<br />
<br />
They dont have their ear to the ground when it comes to inter-tank balance Vs. content (not Vs. each other, I think paladins and warriors are balanced by content more than they are each other)<br />
<br />
I trust them to keep tinkering with it because sooner or later they may come up with something to make everyone happy, but only if we let them keep casting out the fishing line.</div></div><hr />

I have had vie casted on me in KT and it does help a bit.  The problem with this is two fold.  One not every cleric has it and two it has to be recast after every fight and most clerics cant keep up doing this.<br />
<br />
 I'm going to interject a couple of thoughts right here.<br />
<br />
 You're a level 65 Shadowknight, tanking mobs built for level 70 progression. Of COURSE it's not going to be easy, a walk in the park. I'm frankly amazed that ANY Knight can do it, period.<br />
<br />
 Secondly - someone made mention of the fact that the SK who started the post (which I haven't read, btw) has 7.4k hp, and the Warrior who started THIS post has 8k in lower tier gear.<br />
<br />
 Why is that? Is it a reflection of gear choices? I haven't examined Magelos, but I can't figure a solid geared Time+ Knight being LOWER in hp than an Elemental Warrior, unless he had all five ranks of Sturdiness, and if you're Elemental, you don't have AA to waste on all five ranks of Sturdiness.<br />
<br />
 Thirdly - I'd HOPE Knights had Vie casted on them before they did named, and I'd HOPE their Clerics have Vie in the spellbooks. I can't go into trials without needing the gear to survive, I'd hope that some of the same burden would go into the healers and DPS classes who went with.<br />
<br />
 Fourth - Knights love to talk about the 'massive' Warrior tanking advantage undisced. It's not there. It really isn't. When they took away /defensive from the trials and placed all three tank classes on relatively equal footing - the well geared tanks passed. The undergeared failed. And they will keep failing. There is NO 'magic bullet' for Warriors that makes them a lock for this stuff, seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I posted that as a reason why Knights will never replace Warriors as a tank on Raids (and should never).  In an exp group, building aggro can = stealing aggro due to the mob being engaged at the same time and it really does not matter if aggro is stolen.  Not to mention if the SK is throwing up all his spells and snaring, it would be easy to steal in an exp group.  Enter a raid mob, most of our spells will not land or actually hurt the raid if I do land them.  Sure, I could steal aggro if from the start of the fight I chain fear and click taunt, by why would I do that? To get one (possibly 2) rounded and die?  You cannot predict how much aggro the MT has or when the MT dies.  Thats one great thing about a warrior tank, AE taunt cannot fail, which makes picking up aggro doable.  Now to wait and see someone take this completely out of context and think knights want AEtaunt.<br />
Knight aggro is great at the moment, so is warrior, its not the issue.  <br />
<br />
I still do not see why giving Paladins a 24 (or 18) second parry disc and SKs a 18 (or 12) second Ripo discipline would destroy the warrior class.</div></div><hr />

You clearly do not understand aggro if thats your statement.  I'm not going to explain to you how aggro works, or how to make aggro as a SK, but that is a completely retarded statement, because its irrelevant.<br />

<br />
In a week or so I expect to hit 10K HP's unbuffed. I'm more than 1K HP's short of the top on my server. I'm barely on the radar server-wide. A Knight simularly equipped can hit 9K HP's unbuffed, and he's going to find some mobs in GoD are too tough for him just like some are too tough for me.<br />
<br />
As I recall, I used to get around 200HP's a level. That 1K HP's I'm short represents almost 5 levels!!! If I'm at 10K and you are at 8K you're about 10 levels behind!!<br />
<br />
7K HP's is what I had when I was tanking in BoT and hoping to MT to break into the EP's BEFORE Sturdyness.<br />
<br />
Look at the Magelos of most Knight posters that complain they can't tank like a Warrior. Does it look like they're in end expansion equipment? Heck no. If ya can't MT CT or Inny in PoTime, how in the world can you expect to Tank in ADVANCED content without a whole guild keeping you on your feet?<br />
<br />
Yes, Knights don't have Defensive and Warriors don't have spellbooks. We are three DIFFERENT classes. Just because y'all wear plate armor doesn't make you a Tank, being equipped to the hilt makes you a tank. Heck some of y'all barely hit 7500HP unbuffed. You haven't finished previous content, what makes you think you're ready to take on something harder?<br />
<br />
Not being Warriors and having Defensive to fall back on for three minutes means you have to be GEARED to fight non-trivial mobs. That's how it's been for four years. Farming Q'Vic is going to make getting the rest of the guild I'm in through Uqua and Ikkinz4 a lot easier. The gear IS out there, it DOES exist and it makes a difference - a big difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted that as a reason why Knights will never replace Warriors as a tank on Raids (and should never). <br />
<br />
So let me see if I understand your thought process here, correct me if I'm way off the mark.  But you feel that Shadow Knights and Paladins should tank just like an undisciplined Warrior or should even share defensive with Warriors, because Warriors will still be the raid tank of choice because they have AE taunt?  Is that really what you're trying to say, really?<br />
<br />
So there should be absolutely no difference between Warriors and the two Knight classes in their ability to tank anything anywhere anytime because AE taunt is the great evening device for the Warriors' complete lack of a spell book?  Is that your theory?  Please tell me I'm misunderstanding you.  <br />
<br />
Or is this just your justification for needing a parry or riposte discipline for the the Knights?  Because if that's the case, like I said before, most Warriors don't really object to that as long as A) its refresh is long enough that it isn't usable on every single pull or even every other pull, and B) that it isn't obscenely longer than other riposte/parry disciplines of other classes, in fact it should probably be of a shorter duration than a Ranger's or a Monk's, due to the differences in durability, and certainly not longer by any means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I am talking about single group content not raids.  I don't want to tank raid bosses personally....<br />
<br />
Going from being to easily tank single group content to getting almost one rounded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if you are talking about GoD trials and the like you are talking about raid content where they limit the raid size to 6.<br />
<br />
i agree with the statement that requiring a group of 6 to kill a mob for progression when there are 16 classes in the game (i guess 16 i never counted) was bound to cause huge problems because classes are balanced only in the grand scheme and not in the individual encounter. some classes shine in outdoor areas. some shine where mobs can be fear kited. some shine when charmable mobs are available. tanking classes in particular shine when mobs either are &quot;immune to changes in run speed&quot; or there is no space to safely move around or the mobs summon. kiting classes shine when mobs are snarable and dont summon and there is plenty of space to move around.<br />
<br />
which gets us to your mini raids which you prefer to describe as &quot;single group content&quot; as if to imply this is some sort of experience group. they are built in a very specific manner that paladins and shadowknights dont shine in. and none of that would matter except for their limit of 6 members.<br />
<br />
hence the problem is the content not the class.<br />
<br />
on a side note its about time warriors can be used to offtank in raids. it was getting very old having 3 or 4 or 5 warriors on a raid and none of them had any purpose for being there except the one who was mt'ing. or we could hope the mt dies so that we can prove that we were useful after all (except in my raids the heal chain never made hotkeys to find the secondary tank so we never got healed on time). thats a rant for a different day.</div></div><hr />

Battleblade, I just clicked your magelo and I think maybe you don't realise how overgeared you are for earlier GoD content.<br />
<br />
For example, my guild finished all 4 ikkiniz raids first time with 8k hp warriors.</div></div><hr />

There are many Warriors that broke 10K HP's unbuffed before GoD. Heck there are some Knights that broke 10K HP pre-GoD.<br />
<br />
When I tank a mob and it owns me, it's because I'm gimp if I don't have near the very top level gear for my progression level.<br />
<br />
If you want to lament that Knights are generally undergeared compared to what is possible at their progression level, then I'll agree. But if Knights that ARE undergeared for their progression level want to complain they can't tank a single-group mob at that level, then the problem starts and likely ends with gear. Other Knights succeed.<br />
<br />
Comparing your class with another is sometimes a tricky business. But it's not tricky at all to compare yourself to others in your same class.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not there are Warriors that don't often MT hard hitting mobs in raids. It's because the mobs maul them. Defensive does not last forever.<br />
<br />
All the mandatory individual flag six-person maximum expedition content has been adjusted. Most players think it's relatively balanced. In open zone grouping or in raids players are left to their own devices. Mobs don't have a sign painted on them saying if a 7800HP SK can't tank me then the plate tank classes are out of balance. They are fight me if you dare challanges. Gear-up and dare more.<br />

BTW, I'm NOT picking on Knights. Gear-up and dare more equally applies to Warriors.<br />

My server has *4* warriors over 10k hp (they are all in Raaj's guild). And like maybe 15 over 9k.<br />
<br />
-edit, nm i looked on eqrankigs and it's not that different from my server.<br />
<br />
Anyway, according to it your server has only 1 SK over 8k hp... are you really saying only that one toon should be thinking they might offtank decently in GoD and perhaps ma the one group progression stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Naubi, it's equally true that your view might be skewed by your server.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that gear counts and is supposed to count for Tanks. Warriors get Defensive/Evasive/Stonewall/Furious. But these abilties are very seldom used for add tanking or plow tanking. Yes, Warriors have unmatched survivabilty vs. brutal mobs. But those are generally named mobs, that's consistant with the traditional Warrior role and Class Description. When SoE puts such mobs in single-group flag content, it's an obvious mistake.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Actually Naubi what I'm saying is that to run with the big dogs you have to be a big dog. I didn't check to see who the SK was, but I will say if they are in PoTime or post-PoTime 9K HP's unbuffed is possible and 8500HP's is surely reasonable. Warriors if they want to MT tend to have very high raid attendance (I'm 100% for 439 days played for example) and pay very strict attention to gear.<br />
<br />
The single group flag content has been adjusted. In the two hardest trials Warriors can't use D/S/E. Are you insisting that it is still unfair to Knights?<br />
<br />
And yes, If you want to tank a red trap mob in Uqua, you best be up for the challange. Death adds are a rather stiff punishment for anyone that insists they are ready for the content but aren't. Stuff generally gets harder not easier as you progress and there aren't many upgrades until Q'Vic. Best gear up, it gets nasty.<br />

<br />
Let me break something to you Knights.  Lots, and I do mean lots, of Warriors are also struggling in GoD.  If the group they're with can make sure they only have to tank one tough mob every ten minutes, then they're in better shape than a Knight.  If not, they're just as hosed.  This isn't a Knight &quot;only&quot; problem which needs a drastic fix to keep Knights viable.  This is a content has been made too damn hard for the majority of the player base problem.  And Knights are included.  The major difference when a Knight goes splat in one round versus a Warrior that goes splat in one round is that the Knight points to the Warrior and cries foul because the Warrior tanks better.  Briefly.  Once every ten minutes.  And then goes splat just like the Knight.   The Warrior has to suck it up and accept that maybe he's just not geared well enough.  Maybe he just doesn't have enough AA for the content.  Maybe, just maybe, SoE has made the content more difficult than he can reasonably deal with.  And then he has a choice of either sticking in there and accepting the deaths, maybe the many deaths, he'll have to suck up to keep going forward, or he backs off and goes back to gaining gear and AAs. <br />
<br />
Nothing I've read points to Knights being unfairly and unreasonably prone to failure in GoD any more than a Warrior.  Both appear to be struggling unless they have so much gear and AA that it's pretty obscene.  This is a SoE screwed the pooch on the content and it's still pretty damn tough even after the adjustments, and maybe they intend it to be, problem.  Not a Knights tank like paper bags while Warriors tank like an indestructible brick wall problem.  Because the second just isn't true.</div></div><hr />

  Her obvious point is that she spends a heck of a lot of time increasing her character in every manner possible. Raid gear comes in at a fairly set rate, and otherwise she has everything she can get. How would YOU suggest she improve her gear, OUTSIDE of a raid? She has an ungodly amount of LDoN points, as evidenced by virtually every piece of her gear being augmented, and having several Tak armor pieces, maxed. She's out of options until the raids bring in more gear. <br />
<br />
  Is this an excessive amount of effort compared to a warrior able to do the same content? Dunno. I could certainly see that being possible. I'm not sure it's still not just the content though, personally *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

But the dork who started this thread thinks that her gear is so poor that she shouldn't even expect to do anything in GoD (not even tank for an exp group in kod'taz).<br />
<br />
Basically all I've been trying to say is that sturdiness and GoD one group drops kicked the 'you've made it'  to 8k hps for warriors... and only a tiny % of SKs get this and it takes vastly superior gear (i.e. time level gear in every slot). So it's majorly annoying when someone says you shouldn't be there with 7k something hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get a list of the augments that drop in Ferubi and the single group trials. Farm them focusing on AC followed by HP's - no other stat or effect matters, not even FT III.<br />
<br />
For every remaining slot possible add a 10 AC augment from LDoN. In every slot still remaining add a 40HP augment from LDoN. In every slot still remaining add a 20HP/20Mana aug. Remember to complete your Adventurer's Charm. Become a Grandmaster baker and make Brisltebane's Party Platters or if that's too much, make or buy Tormentor Stir Fry. Get Teolsian Black Mountain Mint Tea.<br />
<br />
Then, as you observed, earn DKP and farm PoTime extensively.<br />
<br />
Even following the advice in all but the previous sentence I'm pretty sure you might add 50AC and 200HP's or more.<br />
<br />
EQ is a game of accumulated small advantages. In a month you could be at 8K HP's (and everything that goes along with that). It will make a difference.<br />
<br />
Look at the top 10 Warriors on several servers. They have done pretty much everything I've listed. Are top SK's or Knights exempt from doing these things?<br />
<br />
Shortly OoW will be coming out. I would expect with the level cap being raised and new AA abilities those of us that want to be at or near the top of the game may have to make effort - in every way that our initiative can improve our characters.<br />

<br />
The evidence presented so far does not indicate that a Warrior can get by with significantly less time and effort invested to tank the same content.  I see Knights attempting to make a case that this is true.  I don't see much more then them attempting to claim it's true.  When I go in to the other forums and read what Warriors are suggesting to other Warriors as a minimum to go forward, it doesn't read as though it's easy peasy for Warriors either.  8K+ unbuffed seems to be the starting point for the more difficult one group content in GoD and even that isn't any guarantee of success.</div></div><hr />

Why does she need to improve character more outside raid? I am no expert at GoD but experts here point that 8-9k plus hp for warrior is good for the content knights posting here would like to tank. Also I point that everyone agrees that warrior is best tank.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up while both of you Inferna and Naubi are sitting at 7.5 k hp you are expecting to perform as 8k warrior who as you agree should tank better then you at same level of hp... So here is the question then....Why do you expect to tank content that 8k hp warrior has trouble tanking? Also why do you think its unreasonable that EQ requires you both to put in more raid pharming in top end PoP zones before progressing some more in GoD? I am not bashing here I'd like to understand your point.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to point out I am against giving any mele discs to knights. If any upgrade is in order it should be in terms of spell book type of ability or knight type of disc like unholy aura (I dont meant it has to do damage just that it should be unique for the class). Defensive and whatnot is warrior ability.</div></div><hr />

At this point in the game:<br />
<br />
9500 hp warrior = average GoD tanking Warrior beyond the trials. Attainable with PoP gear and LDoN/GoD augments (mostly previous content).<br />
<br />
8500 hp knight = equally well equipped Knight able to do some tanking beyond the trials. Attainable with PoP gear and LDoN/GoD augments (mostly previous content).<br />
<br />
The Warrior semi-innate advantages are ~386HP plus 500HP from Sturdyness. There's really no reason a Knight can't get within ~1K HP's of a Wariror at the same progression level.<br />
<br />
You cleverly dodge my previous post. With most of your augment slots unoccupied by AC/HP augs you aren't showing much drive toward maximizing your character - a not uncommon situation with Knights. You (or any member of the 3 plate tank classes) can't realistically insist on a significant raid tanking role, observe that you get beaten down by mobs, and not do simple things that will improve yourself as a tank. SoE is not likely at this point to give you a Spell or Discipline that can substitute for effort.<br />

<br />
If I were you, in 30 days I would add:<br />
Signet of Might (or arcane)<br />
Glyphed Prayer Ring<br />
Both AC15 from Ferubi<br />
The second hp25/mana25 from Ferubi<br />
Marked Runed Signet or Resonating Earring of Battle<br />
A Green Hued Gemstone to replace str5 on helm<br />
HP30/END30 to replace an attack aug on arms<br />
Move bauble of rej to primary<br />
Put Hp20/mana20 in open slots.<br />
<br />
That is a raw +56 AC +195 HP in 30 days.  About 89 AC and 237 HP.  Your new total would be 2080 AC with 7689.<br />
<br />
I would also look at replacing one of the ldon items with a better item.  Arms would probably be the easiest to replace.  I would also finish out the adventure stone, you are so close.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is, you have a lot of easy work that can be done to improve.  AA's are not the only way to improve.  In fact, beyond 100 to 200 AA, it is almost pointless for improvements.<br />

I am sincerely trying to help by this post.</div></div><hr />

At this point in the game:<br />
<br />
9500 hp warrior = average GoD tanking Warrior beyond the trials. Attainable with PoP gear and LDoN/GoD augments (mostly previous content).<br />
<br />
 You cleverly dodge my previous post. With most of your augment slots unoccupied by AC/HP augs you aren't showing much drive toward maximizing your character - a not uncommon situation with Knights. You can't realisticly insist on a significant raid tanking role, observe that you get beaten down by mobs, and not do simple things that will improve yourself as a tank. SoE is not likely at this point to give you a Spell or Discipline that can substitute for effort.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately LDoN is not a viable substitute for farming PoTime. Until you reach Q'Vic there are not sufficient upgrades for you in GoD. As an exercise, make an alternate profile putting Grimror's armor in place of the LDoN armor and Greaves of Furious Might in the leg slots. Aug the armor with equivalent augs to what you are using. The improvement will be dramatic.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in these forums Warriors recognized that while LDoN can easily substitute for Ornate mold armor, it doesn't approach EP/PoTime gear. During these discussions it was opined a better set of gear is needed and some suggested SoE should allow turning in Royal Attendent for at least partial credit.<br />
<br />
Some have argued SoE  violated the spirit of a &quot;previous content beyond the initial release&quot; tradition. Clearly for some time now progression through previous content has been required. In some cases content may be skipped or there's substitute content. In others cases there isn't.<br />
<br />
In your case, one can't argue you didn't make the effort. You just did not make the effort in a way that would give you the reults needed to make you into a post-PoTime/post-GoD trials raid tank.<br />
<br />
If you are concerned that a lesser or equal but still well undergeared Warrior can tank better for 3 minutes out of every 13, that's what Warriors do. I assure you a Wariror wearing gear like yours will have a very rough time MTing, MAing yard trash, or add tanking in Ikkinz4 and Ugua.<br />
<br />
SoE hasn't provided a guide on what quality of gear is required to prgress through GoD (which might vary by class btw). The mobs perform that function. If they kill you, you need to look at previous content to see if there are upgrades available.<br />

I think the heart of the problem is not a class issue between Warriors and Knights.  I believe the heart of the problem is that SoE has gone astray by making an entire expansion, again, that caters more to raiders over non-raiders.  If you're not raiding the top end of PoP for a fairly extended period of time, you just can't expect to go very far into GoD.  Warriors can get away with elemental gear, mostly because the shift from elemental to PoTime gear isn't as dramatic for them as it is for Knights.  But Knights need PoTime gear and a fair amount of it.  If you're claiming that sub-elemental geared Warriors are marching through GoD content like a hot knife through butter without being defensive every mob, then I challenge you to prove that with something more than, I know a guy who had a group that used a charmed pet through most of trial until it came to the boss, stories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll need a set of raex from EP's and a smattering of other mid/high PoP gear.  At 7200 unbuffed hps some of the only viable upgrades come from KT/EP.<br />
<br />
I'm your posterchild for the sup-EP warrior who marched into Kod`Taz without too many problems.  I've made several vxed tipt runs .. and have even beaten tipt since the changes to defensive.  Granted, this all would have been much harder without an enchanter pet hasted at ~1300+ dps, but its been done.  The tipt boss was a bit of a pain but with a ranger on hand, weaponshield + ae-taunt/furious = heartstriker dead 10 seconds ago.<br />
<br />
The 500hps from GoD was godly, but i've done vxed when i buffed to fully 1k less.  Aside from named, my paladin friends have done significaly better tanking with comparable gear and relatively = hps/ac due to being able to stun lock trash to help mitigate some of the dmg.<br />
<br />
GoD is a bitch .. but i personally love the challenge.  There really is nothing like having your cleric start a cheal at 80% and seeing it land just in time to save your neck.  Some fights are worse than others, but as a general rule, most people get their asses handed to them.<br />
<br />
A previous poster hit the nail on the head:<br />
When a knight get his/her ass handed to them, it's an instant bitch that they dont get all the same fluffy perks a warrior gets.  When a warrior gets his ass handed to him he simply bends down, picks of the pieces, and tries to figure out how he can better himself to better next time. <br />
<br />
 All in all knights are overpowered, but i could honestly give a flying fuck.  I gave up all the neatness of special abilities and spells that go with being a knight so that i could do one job and one only ... take the hits.  I wanted to be the best at it, therefore i sucked it up and rolled the one class which surpasses all others in one field and one field alone.<br />

<br />
He has 8k hp and only one EP item (raex arms)... he could make the hp on that up in other slots with augs or better than bazaar gloves etc from old expansions.<br />
<br />
Basically, 100hp in every slot is doable from Dozekar/Aow/seru/GoD one group stuff... no real raid content at all (I don't count seru as a raid anymore).<br />
<br />
100hp + in every slot together with ldon/KT augs + sturdiness = 8k hp for a warrior. Entirely doable for a non-raiding (not casual just not raiding) player.<br />
<br />
For a knight 8k hp takes raiding current content (and yes time is current content, noone is 3 grouping time gods).</div></div><hr />

Reread the post, I was referring to our useless spellbook not that resisted spells don't give aggro.  Knights will never replace warriors as the raid-tank for that one reason, We have no sure fire way of instant aggro.

<br />
So in conclusion we can see that a non-raiding, but very dedicated Warrior can have a small edge in tanking over a non-raiding, but very dedicated Knight.  I mean come on, we're talking about a 500-600HP difference between this guy and someone like Inferna.  Enough of an edge that some of the tougher cutting edge one group content is just barely within their grasp, while for the Knight it's just at the edge of their grasp.  And this proves what, exactly?  Warriors tank a little better than Knights?  Is this a surprise?<br />
<br />
Wait until OoW and 5 more levels and I believe most of this issue will disappear.</div></div><hr />

Why don't you stop BSing about what you said? First you say knights can't steal aggro, I say they can, you say sure in XP groups we can but... take a raid mob... they resist most our spells, &quot;sure i can chain fear and hit taunt&quot; referring to your way of taking aggro, its pretty clear what you said, i'm not going to go quote everything you said, but thats the breakdown.

<br />
Resisted spells do indeed give aggro.  A whole boat load of it.  Which is one of the reasons that Paladins will sometimes use their piddly level 9 stun to help hold aggro, because it uses almost no mana and still produces a ton of aggro.  If you're trying to say that your spells are resisted and that's why AE taunt is what will keep Warriors raid MTing over Knights, that's just weird logic.  It doesn't hold together at all.  AE taunt has nothing to do with resisted spells.  Resisted spells give aggro.  AE taunt immediately puts you to the top of the hate list.   If a Knight casts any spell against a mob that had just been AE taunted, resisted or not, they very likely will then have aggro.<br />
<br />
What is it you're trying to say anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No... we have a non-raiding, but very dedicated warrior posting that a *RAIDING* knight shouldn't even be tanking in the same zones he is. <br />
<br />
My problem is not that he has marginally more hp than me but that he thinks I suck and am not 'ready' to tank in places like KT. And that I will only be ready when I'm in the top 5 or 10 (depending on server) for my class. <br />
<br />
It's his whole attitude that a non-raiding warrior is superior to the very best geared knights on his server... but then of course we being so much else to the table so he can't really be as f*cking smug as his stupid post appears (wait actually he knows that we don't and that makes it even more enjoyable).<br />
<br />
GoD has brought out some nasty attitude problems in some warriors and some justified resntement on the parts of knights. This stems from sturdiness + something of a warrior monopoly on ikkinz one group loot bumping warriors up and then those warriors seeing they now have more hp than raiding knights with decent (not the best but still respectable gear) and those warriors feeling very smug about it. <br />
<br />
It's about as pleasant as those knights who would take the piss out of warrior aggro problems back in PoP... weren't many but they were v annoying.<br />
<br />
Look at it like this... SKs did not get sturdiness, probably they didn't get groups for ikkiniz trial loot. And then on this board it's just decided that if you don't get the benefit of these you don't even belong in the content? You say it's only hp and it is... it's just unfortunate that the numbers are around a nice round number so you see it as a before and after.</div></div><hr />

Warriors had problems everywhere, you have problems in what, two zones ? two zones most people dont do for xp ? two zones ment for level 70 players ?<br />

what is so hard about waiting one, ONE month for OoW to come out? its july, august is freaking next month guys! we had to wait 13 months from the first time we all decided aggro was the root of our problem, to it being fixed.... we had a reason to be upset because we had been completly ignored.<br />
<br />
you on the other hand, or should i say your classes, have caused no less than 3 reworks of the monsters, the dps on the monsters changing twice, and defensive being totally fucked even tho it was furious+pooka causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Your plight, if you want to call it that, has had alot more attention, alot faster than ours did, it took us over a years to make them do something about aggro procs being just about the only way to increase our aggro, when they had told us in velius that was a temporary fix, took us about 7 months of PoP to get them to admit &quot;there is a problem&quot; but even then absor said &quot;classes are not that out of balance&quot;<br />

I tried an SK but being able to fear kite continuously for experiance with a pet beating the mob to death got boring real fast. At least quad kiting with a Druid is somewhat challanging.

Basically, 100hp in every slot is doable from Dozekar/Aow/seru/GoD one group stuff... no real raid content at all (I don't count seru as a raid anymore).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything he is wearing is &quot;1 group&quot; as you say except for his arms.  You could wear everything he has except for arms + head.  If you invested in the time for some of the augments, you could add 8 more HP augs to his profile.  That would bring you within 500 of him.  Your ac would probably be the same.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think dozekar is all that easy to one group.  I think GoD trials are easier to do than dozekar.  But if you can do GoD trials, you can do dozekar for the quests.  He has several quest drops from dozekar, and several of them would be upgrades for me now.  In fact, I am trailing him by 500 hp, and I farmed GoD like mad for a month (to help upgrade 2 druids, 2 clerics, 1 ranger, and 1 enchanter), so it represents a great deal of work.<br />
<br />
Edit: on the better gloves.  What is better that isn't a raid drop?  I mean warlord gaunts are like number 7 gloves in game, at least to me.</div></div><hr />

I'm not the one posting &quot;the knights are only 7500hp&quot;... I was just trying to point out that this is the normal hp for a raiding knight, 8k is still exceptional... and so telling knights to go get 8k hp then you can tank KT is a bit silly. <br />

<br />
With all of the nerfs to content and other changes to GoD though it's pretty difficult to be too sympathetic when a Warrior or Knight complains experiance mobs hit too hard. In every case where I've seen this said since the many changes it's been players that have not geared up in previous content. Y'all (Warriors and Knights alike) can not gear up in GoD until your guild makes it to Q'Vic. In the meantime, if you expect to contribute in the tanking on the way to that goal you have to be geared appropriately.<br />

If you can't be improved by farming previous content, then you have a reason to gripe.<br />

You know the first comment I ignored, but after the second, I figured I would reply.<br />
<br />
I know a knight (a friend)  that had less hp and less ac than me that could do vxed and tipt when I could not around the time of GoD release.  That knight could not do any of the ikkinz trials.  I felt sorry for him and hoped for changes.  Then I find a lot of knights asking for changes, but the majority of the changes ask for every ability my class has.  They ask for defensive, Brenlo says no &quot;never going to happen&quot;, they ask for mini defensive, they ask for sturdiness, they ask for weapon shield, they ask for a bulwark of vie self buff that is always better than defensive, they ask for heals better than druids when someone showed the current paladin heals are very close to shaman heals power.<br />
<br />
This constant month by month demand for all things warrior like makes me wish they never get anything.  It is wrong of me, but I do it.  I look at a few on eqforums that get slammed for saying what looks like proven fact.  I see them get 1 star to death.  It isn't worth posting since no one will listen.<br />
<br />
The nasty &quot;attitude&quot; as you say didn't come from no where.  The more I hear the knights piss and moan the more nasty the attitude can grow in a warrior.<br />
<br />
What is totally ironic is the more the knights cry about how they suck the more it makes me want to level my paladin.  The more I see all the things my friend's paladin can do (get groups in 1 minute or less, stun hard hitting mobs to near zero dps) the more I want what he has.  The more I see the gear I have can be worn by a paladin also.  Will 500 hp matter to me?  Probably not.  Especially when I will have more AC by being a knight.<br />

The more I see knights (and there were a lot of them) say &quot;ha ha you complained now look what it got you, defensive nerfed, you deserve it&quot;  the more it makes me dislike the knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tank better yes... marginally to the point where a truely 'uber' (dont like that word) raiding knight will blur things on trash and without discs. And vastly better on nameds (to make them as much as possible a sure thing if ppl do their jobs... I tihnk every knight is ok with the idea that while a knight can tank lesser nameds, ikkiniz one group stuff, it's not going to be by choice if you can take a warrior). For example I die quite a bit on KT nameds (the nasty ones)... a warrrior never does. This seems about the right balance to me.<br />
<br />
The cleric/druid analogy is a false one. If our tanking side were really so inferior to a warriors as a druids healing is to a clerics... I'd kinda like druid level upgrades. Ever notice that druids do insanely more dps than a cleric for example (in adition to that &quot;utility&quot; that's warriors favourite thing to beat us with).<br />
<br />
I see it more like monk vs ranger (but change dps for tanking). But then of course we see how screwed up things are for both these classes too. I mean we can see that monks realy really ought to do a ton more dps than rangers...<br />
<br />
sigh, balancing pure melee vs hybrids is a total mess atm.</div></div><hr />

Paladins get stuns and targetable heals as their bread and butter tanking spells. SKs get lifetaps. And the lifetaps simply aren't good enough to mitigate almost any of the damage in GoD. Here's my question... If you took a paladin, and put her in Naubi's gear, what would the experience be like? Would the paladin be more successful than Naubi is? It seems like the knights are distinct enough to refer to individually now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
saying your class sucks makes people beleave it, the necromancers did the same thing back in the day, so they gave them a nice increase in power, they are an excellent DPS class with utility to spare and i love them in groups but they never get invited by most people, why? because the public preception for the longest time has been they are worthless, dont do the same to your class.<br />
<br />
naubi dont try to kill the named unless it is required to win, how is that for a start? so you miss out on some loot, you still get AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess these are the main things as I see it:<br />
<br />
1) Knights are tanks... their other abilities are not in the same league as pure casters (for sure for SKs) to let them not be.<br />
<br />
2) In new content a knight should at least be a viable single group and raid trash tank as long as they have a decent amount of end game gear from the last expansion. A warrior should probably tank trash with ease in this content unless it is specfically meant to be hard for that event.<br />
<br />
3) For raid named stuff in a new expansion a warrior is the only choice and maybe there is some bluring where a knight can be a viable tank if and only if you have no warrior around. This is all the knights that wannabe warriors are asking for... to be a bit more than a speed bump if things go to crap and you're out of warriors. If this breaks balance then sure can do without it I guess. I know rangers would be upset if we got their WS abilitiy (my guild has 12 active rangers so...).<br />
<br />
4) Can we not talk as if 'utility' balances other areas of the game. This is not how other classes are balanced (take a look at druids and clerics, wizards and rogues etc). It has some weight but I think most knights would rather warriors got some good utility (like those warsongs you were meant to be getting) than this always being thrown in the scale against tanking/dps.<br />
<br />
-edit, <br />
<br />
The SK 'community' (can there be such a thing   :rolleyes: ) is divided between the min-maxers (the hardest of hardcore raiders) who want our tanking buffed and abilities that compliment that (and to their credit abilities that complement rather than try and replace a warrior). Brael our new representitive is in this camp I think?<br />
<br />
And the rest who look at our spell line ups (nukes, dots, pet etc) and think our tanking is ok where it is and think maybe we ought to do some real dps seeing as that's what we are clicking every few seconds (SKs must be the most key press  intsnsive class after bards). Of course this puts us on collision course with rangers... should we tank better than them AND do more dps than them (their DPS isn't that much over a warriors as it is)... one ranger in my guild thinks that SKs are the class that shouldnt really be in the game.<br />
<br />
SK are an odd class I think, we have about as much of a place as beastlords. Needing something but always in danger of treading on other ppls toes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That will never happen, like it or not, utility effects balance. if we discounted utility it wouldnt be too long before you start arguing what you want to count as a spell that helps tanking, and what is utility.<br />
<br />
If we start chopping all of that off, and not counting it as balance then you will beat and exceed warriors.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if you know it or not, but everything you suggest would lead up to knights being better tanks than warrior unless it is a raid monster, let me remind you 1 warrior is a main tank in each guild, maybe 2, so your telling me my fuction should be limited to being useful if i am the best of the best? thats bullshit, if your trying to tell me we should be = in tanking single group monster, that is also bullshit, you can tank exp monsters and thats what you should do, just because 6 people do it doesnt mean it should apply to the same rules as xp group balance, this should be evident to anyone who looks at who is doing these, a bard isnt handling mes's, an enchanter is, a druid is not healing a cleric is, and a warrior is tanking, a knight is not.<br />
<br />
your a pull thru class on these 2 trials and on 1 or 2 named in an xp zone, we were pull thru on several things in PoP, dont tell me your entire class, level 1 to 65 with 500 AAs is busted just because of 2 damn trials<br />
<br />
Mountain out of a mole hill, if i am a warrior with an attuide problem then so be it, i am sick of all the drama that is going on over a handful of monsters most of us dont even give 2 shits over.<br />
<br />
wait until omens of war, it is 1 month away and i dont want to hear this crap until we see level 70's in the game, heck, complain all you want but dont do it on the warrior forums and say we have an attuide, you dont go to someones house and tell them what is what.<br />
<br />
After seeing what happend to the ownership of the SK.org forum tho... perhaps we should make room for the shadowknights /shrug<br />

Now there are some Knights that can in fact MT just about anything wtih the best of them. For the most part they don't agitate for Tank Parity or &quot;burst mitigation&quot; - they don't need to.<br />

<br />
You know, I can kind of see where you're coming from.  Except that I've seen so much attitude from raiders, of all classes, towards non-raiders for so long, that you getting a little attitude from a non-raider when you're a raider doesn't really give me great pause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, he's not cutting edge, but with a BoWar and raex arms perhaps he's in a relatively new elemental guild and has just happened to land himself in KT where lots of augment type 8 gear drops.<br />
<br />
So yeah ... i'll call BULLSHIT even referring to him as a dedicated but non raiding warrior.  Aside from raex i'm not very impressed with EP gear for warriors.  So for you knights here whining how he has more hps than you with your time gear ... take a closer look at his magelo.  A lot of the shit he is wearing rivals some of the early phase 1 shit that drops in time.  Sure, its not quarm loot or massively amazing such as a DBoTW ... but its pretty damn good gear.<br />
<br />
His magelo + him being a warrior = better than you at tanking (as it should be).<br />
<br />
'nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8k unbuffed as a warrior isnt as fucking easy as some of you make it out to be.  I think i have pretty respectful gear but i'm still 800hps short of it.  A full set of Raex (minus the bp) would put me 3-400 hps closer but still not at 8k (and this is with sturdiness 5).<br />
<br />
So yes, an 8k unbuffed warrior should be able to run circles around fully time equipped knights on Named and boss mobs.  You guys should all know that once you break 9/10k your hp count is SHIT-ALL compared to high ac, shielding, and innate mitigation when tanking most raid encounters as well as average groups.  It's the same reason a warrior with no defensives aa's and 10k unbuffed hps is a lesser tank next to a 7k warrior with all defensive aa's.  Both will run with pretty decent healing efficiency (% of the heal landed), but the lesser geared warrior with more defensive aa's will roll with the punches and take far fewer nasty dmg spikes and an overall less dmg intake.<br />
<br />
Warriors have and will always mitigate dmg better even at lower ac and shielding levels ... therefore its safe to say that yeah a warrior will take the hits better even w/out his mitigation disciplines.<br />
<br />
/shrug ... i'm honestly tired of these arguments because nothing gets fixed and nobody's mind is ever changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When PoP came out i remember people gawking how trash mobs for xp were hitting for up to 600/700 (PoStorms giants?).  These new &quot;nasty zones&quot; really sucked for your average lv 60 with none of the new PoP aa's.  Now ... imagine if those zones had been opened and the level cap not raised to 65 with the new line of aa's .... get the picture?<br />
<br />
GoD is an incomplete product.  You're trying to run through a world intended for a lv cap of 70 with new aa's which havent been released yet.  Just as PoP became trivial, so too will GoD once the level caps are raised and new aa/spells are introduced.  You might as well treat trash mobs in KT as semi-raid mobs rather than as &quot;normal xp groups&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Uh, not really(disagreeing only with the bolded part).  Any defense-oriented aa's that knights get will almost certainly go to warriors as well, so they(the aa's) shouldn't do anything to affect balance between the tanks in favor of either side.  Knights and warriors would both become better by the same amount, unless Sony gets exceptionally stupid and gives knights better defense aa's than they give warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights as viable tank alternatives to warriors didnt really start to appear on a broad scale until Luclin and PoP when other classes were now given a piece of the mitigation pie.  Granted, warriors got these too, but it let knights fill a role that they couldnt otherwise fill very well before.<br />
<br />
IE- it will get easier for both equally ... but it will lower the bar and thus let more knights get in there and tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this is an incorrect asumption, any increase in knight tanking will make them more able to tank, such as there is a big differance between being able to do this trial and not able.<br />
<br />
With warriors tho, I think it is like putting an extra engine on a jet.... so much power can become wasteful, but it will still help us warriors who are farting around at 5 or 6k unbuffed, it will make everything easyer and lower the bar somewhat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathas</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it just depends on how you look at it.<br />
<br />
Let's say that I mitigate 15% of all incoming melee damage via aa's and gear.  A warrior with comparable gear might mitigate 20%.  If you give us each an additional 5% mitigation, I'm not any closer to the warrior in day-to-day(read: not using /discs, not tanking raid mobs) tanking.  I'm still the exact same amount behind, and therefore not &quot;performing more like a warrior in day-to-day roles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Numbers are hypothetical, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you mesuring percentages yes, but you have to remember everything in this game is relative, relative to what you are fighting that is, you can not balance things on warriors and knights alone because what the monster does can cut their effective abilitys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main point being the difficulty bar will be lowered for all individuals when level 70 and the new aa's come out, thus allowing more tanks to hop in there.<br />
<br />
Luclin witnessed a 24% increase in average mitigation via CS3, CA3, and PE ... add in the 12% extra baseline hps and youre looking at tanks who are, on average 36% better.<br />
<br />
With PoP and all its little goodies (not counting levels) tanks got on average yet another 7.5% to mitigatin and 7.5% to avoidance via LR5 and ID5.  PD3 and PP5 allowed tanks to even further increase via aa their tankability through raising hps.<br />
<br />
In the end we've seen tanks effectiveness increased on average 50-60% in two expansions from aa paths alone, completely independant of gear .... now hang with me.  The GoD hps for warriors (500) can be looked at on average as yet another 3-10% in baseline hps, depending on just how fat the tank was to start.  Knights didnt get it, but this is the first real tanking/hp aa lineup exclusively available to warriors and not to the other classes.  This is really the first unique useful tanking bone we have been thrown via aa's, and at a staggering 60aas start to finish ... those of us that have stuck through it to the end have earned it w/ our sweat and blood.<br />
<br />
If OOW is in line with past trends, we will see another tanking aa lineup which will add yet another 10-20% to baseline avoidance/mitigation, thus lowering the bar for everyone.  I honestly hope warriors will get an extended version available only to us as it is rather class defining for us.  <br />
<br />
None of this even includes the new lv 70 cap which will be, in and of itself, huge for everyone as far as GoD and all previous expansions.<br />
<br />
To the knights out there:  be patient.  The next month has some rather large changes on the horizon, and if your future state is still as shitty as you claim it to be now then by all means resume your rant.  I think you guys all have tunnel vision as per warrior jealousy atm, though, and youre not realizing that the problem isnt with class balance or imbalance, but rather with unfinished and broken content.  Consider yourselves leet to even be toying with an expansion which was intended for lv 70 EP/Time equipped players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps you need to re-read my post, in its entirety, instead of taking things out of context.  My comment about the SK in question having 7.4k hitpoints, in no way, was referring to my 8k hitpoints, or even that 7.4k wasn't respectable.  Now dimwit, the previous line(the one right above it) stated that the mobs weren't being slowed until 60 to 70 percent.  Since I'm 100percent aware you can't draw a conclusion to the point I was trying to make, I'll spell it out for you: They didn't have the hitpoints to tank UNSLOWED MOBS, and for that matter I REALLY DON'T EITHER.  In fact, on the kyv nameds, while defensive, I still get raped.  Occasionally, on the normal mobs, I am victim of the RNG and die to those as well.  Do you know why?  Probably because this content is a little ahead of me, but me and my groupmembers skill are greater than our equipment.<br />
<br />
So now that you have a(hopefully) limited grasp on my orignal post, you can see that I was complaining about SK's playing their fiddle and asking to be super tanks.  Any time something doesn't go their way, they bitch and moan.<br />
<br />
And just because I'm posting, yes, I've recently returned to raiding status.  As you can clearly see, and what has already been mentioned, most all of my gear is one groupable.  I never bought any of it(commenting on &quot;bazaar gloves&quot;).  The guild I used to be in was one of the top guilds on our server, then they all moved to DAOC when it came out.  I however wanted to stay in EQ, and just took some time off, helping out friends and family guilds.  Then I decided I was ready to play again.. only to take the winter off to move to CO for the snowboarding.  Upon my return, I decided to apply to THE best guild on my server, and was accepted.  Unfortunately, WoW came out and gave them 30some beta accounts... So the remaining members reformed and we're back to raiding status.<br />
<br />
I will say that I do have an unusually high amount of hitpoints for not having time/more elemental gear.  I've looked at warriors magelos that are near me, and are in full EP(minus bp) and I'm still ahead of them.  I can only attribute that to my personal dedication for advancement.<br />
<br />
Just so you don't have to say it again, yes, I have 8k unbuffed hitpoints.. go me.<br />
<br />
Edit-  I just thought i'd post a magelo of a rogue in my guild. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=411467<br />

Not even 8k hitpoints on a knight seems kinda... weak /laughs maniacally.<br />

If you are in a guild, then of course an undergeared plate tank can perform their secondary role until the guild is in Q'Vic.

Better gears for me is not going to the bazaar and buying it.  Better gear for me means either I go to Ikkniz trials which I can't get anyone to do with a knight tank or more dkp and time gear.<br />
Which I am working on as always.  At the same time my original points stand and I have made them all at this point there is nothing I am doing here then correcting misinformation that continues to be posted like calling KT exp groups trials.</div></div><hr />

I currently have the most hp on my BP that u can have unless I can get the augment that drops in tipt thats 30/30 endurance forgot the name.  If I did get that I have done that trial 20 times and have yet to see it drop, I would put it on my LDON BP.  As far as other gear I have no control over what drops and what dkp I have but I do look at HP and AC over any focus effects. <br />
<br />
But you can only get so many drops and sometimes you have to take what is available.  An example would be the face mask I was wearing was going to rot and at the time I was wearing a bazaar chain mask so it was a good upgrade and it was easy to get it will be replaced at some point with the time face guard of frenzy but I need it to drop and i need to have the most dkp to win it when it does.<br />

Its more then one zone its the whole KT and beyond in GoD.<br />
<br />
I was playing during the time warriors were so called useless?  They still tanked every raid I was on.  They very rarely lost aggro and if they did it was cause of some numb nutz engaged early or someone was not max melee or a over nuking caster. I grouped with many warriors during this time that held aggro fine.  In fact my regular exp group at this time was with a warrior and he tanked, and I off tanked. <br />
The good warriors  had the weapons to do the job and they knew about aggro.  If you go back and look at my posts during this time  you will see that I supported warriors on this issues.  Some of the posts are on this board if you want to search for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raids are not casual groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors didnt get groups because we have been on a crutch of aggro weapons and taunt since velius, only 3 or 4 elite warriors got groups all the time because of their reputation and their rare weapons.<br />
<br />
On the other end of the scale, today you may get groups everywhere and the elite are only called on to tank these places, at least you can go back to BoT, elementals, etc and get exp when it was the other way around for warriors, we couldnt just walk into zones and start tanking.<br />
<br />
here we see only the elite paladins winning these trials, and i mean the elite 1% of paladins, in our day the only warriors that got groups at a decent rate(not 4 hours lfg) were those with reputations, meaning the common warrior couldnt get groups... to be honest i'd rather see you have problems doing 1 or 2 zones than not any at all like we had to put up with<br />
<br />
They fixed it, turning a blind eye to these facts doesnt change them, and wording them funny does re-write history deary.<br />
<br />
Frankly I dont give a rats ass if you supported our changes or not, it doesnt effect THIS problem, if you want to call it that; simply because your problem applys to those &quot;almost&quot; best of the best paladins and shadowknights.... the rest of us are happy to get groups, this isnt a class balance thing because it applys to the smallest percentage of the game, hardcore people doing single group content, get your asses back to raiding :P</div></div><hr />

I gave you several examples of items you could upgrade with just the help of a couple friends.  I don't believe you can't get a group together to help you get items (You didn't say you couldn't) so why don't you do that while at the same time gaining DKP to buy better gear via raids?</div></div><hr />

I have a couple thoughts that might be of some help.  First it is content not class balance.  First of all Kod Taz and above is rough.  The thing that hurts Knights is spike in damage.  My suggestion for a knight that wants to be successfull there would be the following. <br />
<br />
1.  Get agro fast.  Slower needs to get mobs slowed fast.<br />
2.  Look for gear with shielding. (Without parse to back it up a few points of shielding   seems to help alot more then additional ac)<br />
3.  Use spells to keep agro and turn attack off if your playing catch up on hit points. (a couple reposites at the wrong time can mean 2k to 3k additional damage.  This prolly applies more to named then it does trash)<br />
4.  Find additional value you can bring to your group (SK can pull do nice burst dps provide additional mana Paladins can provide additional Healing and curing)<br />
<br />
Personally I would love to have a warrior in every exp group I am in.  Add an enchanter to charm something and I am perfectly content to help keep the pet off the enchanter when charm breaks and  adds under control.  The problem is there isnt enough warriors and enchanters for that to be an option in every group.  So I have to be able to tank.  I think that it is not a question of being able to do it better then a warrior as much as a question of being able to tank at all.<br />
<br />
I really hope that SOE will tune content that allowes knights to be desireable in single group content as a tank.  But I think it is in everyones best intrest if Knights bring something different to the table then Warriors do.  I get chills when every I see Knights wanting to have more Warrior type ablities.  I want content that will make the ablitlies I have attractive to a group.  Knights may have began as hybrids but they are seperate classes now.  The more people push to make Knights like warriors the more of the individual class identiy we loose. <br />

<br />
Well, if you really aren't a viable tank, I can understand your motivation and don't fault you for it.  But I don't think we're talking about a game wide issue, only one that shows up in a couple of zones in GoD.  And one that should be greatly mitigated by the addition of more levels and new spells when OoW comes out.  So I think you may be putting the cart before the horse.  And given that I have seen more Knights, Paladins in particular, but some Shadow Knights as well, going on about how their class was broken even when they were clearly the group tank of choice in PoP, I have a hard time giving the current doom sayers about the viability of Knights in GoD much credibility.<br />
<br />
GoD came out and all the Knights screamed they needed defensive.  What people like me said was that SoE screwed up the content and that it was clearly misdesigned.  Eventually SoE comes out and admits that it is misdesigned, it was intended for level 70s players.  Knights still screamed they needed defensive even after adjustments were made to bring the content more into line with what level 65 players should be able to take on.  Now, given that we already know that SoE screwed up the initial release of GoD, why should we believe that Knights are out of balance and not a viable tank in GoD rather than there may still be some instances where the content isn't really properly tuned?  Which is really more credible?</div></div><hr />

It all goes back to what Ive been saying all along, every other melee hybrid gets a riposite or avoidance disc.

From what I've read it's not going to be as much a &quot;redefinition&quot; as a clarification. Those classes with traditional roles will retain them. SoE will be paying attention to all classes having a role/s and viability in all party sizes and environments.<br />
<br />
I don't take this as indicating there will be three equal tanks - two with spellbooks. If anything those with spellbooks have an easier time performing a variety of non-specialized roles.<br />
<br />
I don't take this as indicating Druids will heal like Clerics, but rather that the traditional Cleric role of Prime Healer will continue and Druids may be the main healer in some parties, backup healer in others and snare/DD/DoT in still others - multiple roles and all viable.

<br />
But again your anti riposite anti avoidance disc argument has no merit, it hasnt since the beginning.  If its anything less than 30 seconds I wont accept it, its silly to think that a medium tank recieving ONE, UNO, SINGLE damage mitigation disclipline should have its duration turned down to under a light tanks, simple BS.  <br />
Its already been stated that any ability that does not scale is not going to work, but Im willing to fight for this because its the only thing I can see us getting with your constant pigheadedness and unyielding ability to bitch louder and longer than any other class in EQ.<br />
<br />
Isn't versatility wonderful!!? <br />
<br />
Not when it doesnt give me a solid role in all situations that deal with my primary function in EQ, and that my friend is to tank.  <br />
<br />
And really BB, if you want to push for more utility as a tradeoff I dont really see a problem, your class is piss ass boring to play and could really use a facelift in the utility department.Halfassed utility for halfassed discs sounds like a good trade to me.</div></div><hr />

Ir may be like the othe Warrior hybrid, Knights will get something on the order of Weapon Shield, Concidering how much better Paladins heal than Rangers and concidering Paladins have DA and SK's already have 100% protection from melee damage with FD - that's a whole lot.<br />

It may be SoE will make Knights viable as Knights, not Warriors with spellbooks for added power. Just like Rangers are defined as Rangers.

Yeah the bad part about not having a primary role, yet not being as powerful as oh lets say a bard, is that no one cares what you can do, because you do it worse than everyone else, and that makes you useless.<br />

There is NO reason to guild a shadowknight over a paladin or a warrior, simply none.  LoH saves lives, and defensive makes or breaks events every day, HT dosent do shit for a raid that failed without it.<br />

Your argument is bogus except in those situations where a Warrior uses his disciplines to obtain unmatched survivability while fighting a brutal mob - that's the Warrior Class Description, not your's.<br />
<br />
Having secured and used your spells for 65 levels, you suddenly insist it was all a mistake - you should be interchangable with all Warriors in all situations except 1 Warrior MTing a boss raid mob for 12 minutes on raid day? SK's should petition to be converted to Warriors if they are convinced their spellbooks are useless.<br />

I've played an SK and pulled just as effecitvely as a Monk (better really, there's a trick for pulling a deeply buried named Monks can't duplicate), I've out damaged a Warrior on a named, I've Tanked for groups and I've soloed - who are you kidding?<br />

You can exchange a shadowknight for any other class thats more efficent in any of our roles and get twice the experience in half the time.  Groups and raids arent built around what a class can do, its built around what class does what best and how efficent they can make the useage of their time.  <br />
<br />
Another one of my famous examples.  Four shadowknights on a magmatron raid this afternoon, healings off and we have warriors down all over the place, magmatron turns and promply eats through me, and the other three like candy, not even trying.  Rangers step up, and tank him until we get a hotrezed warrior back in position to take him from 40% to 0.  Three rangers, light tanks, a primary dps class, patch a hole between warriors and a wipe where knights are torn to bits.<br />
<br />
Now tell me, whats wrong with this picture?  Rangers are now the preffered 'ohshit tank' even though we both rate them as the light tank out of the four or us?  (Rangers are a dps class btw, not a primary tanking class.)  Why does the chain go Heavy tank &gt; light tank &gt; supposedly medium tank?  That strike you as a bit odd BB?  Oh wait, I should have mitigated his incoming damage with my super powerful 60 disc and lifetaps imbetween swings right?  :p</div></div><hr />

You think that you need more than the 12 seconds we get wtih furious for our riposte discipline?  Fine, since you're not as durable, I can see that.  But why do you need one that is longer than those for Monks or Rangers, or are you claiming you're less durable then they are?</div></div><hr />

And the &quot;not being a speed bump&quot; thing jsut meant maybe knights should be able to step in for the min or so it takes to battle rez one of your warriors. Maybe we won't see encounters that work like this so much anymore... if so it's a moot point anyway.</div></div><hr />

/evade spindoctor_107<br />
<br />
<br />
Look, their disc is greater than 12 seconds, they are a light tank or a non tank.  You pop furious, then defensive for another 3 minutes, or you pop stonewall, or you pop evasive, my point being is that your going for alot longer than 30 seconds, and your a heavy tank.  Now, I could give two shits about other classes melee durability in respect to this disc.<br />
<br />
Lets run alittle math:<br />
<br />
Warriors &gt; heavy tank &gt; greater than 3 minutes damage reduction/evasion<br />
Knights &gt; medium tank &gt; no damage reduction disc <br />
Rangers&gt; light tank&gt; 18 second avoidance disc<br />
Other melee &gt; dont tank &gt; 12 second avoidance disc<br />
<br />
Now lets look here, what does my little chart show?<br />
<br />
1. Knights are the speedbump on raid mobs between the heavy tanks and the light tanks/rest of the freaking classes.<br />
<br />
2. That the discs scale downwards in duration though the tanks, 12 or 6 seconds would put us effectively behind or below the light tank.  30 seconds, is a good medium between 2 ticks of melee immunity (other than flurry) plus 3 minutes of increased mitigation, and 18 seconds of front arc total melee avoidance of the light tanks.<br />

Whoa! Warrior hybrids get 18 second disciplines with a lengthy refresh and they don't have FD or DA.<br />

And as soon as you wrote groups pick you for what you are best at, you lost any credibility you might have had. Want a near perfect group?

It seems that no matter what you have to have it your own way, that your perception of what your class needs is the only factor you'll consider.  You won't consider the impact to other classes or the potential for things to slip into severe out of balance given that 5 levels and a whole new level of spells are just around the corner.   Even with this, you want, nay, demand a riposte discipline that outlasts every other other class in the game with no further justification than you want it.  Get real.<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way, you're not going to get a defensive substitute in the form of a riposte discipline.  Why you might ask?  Because you already have a defensive substitute.  It's called a spellbook.   And if that's not adequate then you're in the wrong game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">.....<br />
<br />
Ok, seems I managed to ruffle a few feathers there.  So I suppose the logic of my spellbook being the substitute for defensive doesnt apply to rangers also hum?  Guess Im not the only one writing things out with only my class needs (and wants) in mind.  Somehow I come up with a creditable chart and you throw the &quot;oh he dosent know shit or consider anything else&quot; card on the table, sounds like you needed to fold to me.   Rangers are going to go to 70 too, new spells, same disc, more power, still the ohshit tank after the speedbump knights.  If your so serious about keeping this out of our hands, just ask them to remove evasive, autoriposite discs, since you know, they are so overpowering.  So I stand there for 30 seconds, possibly do massave damage (prolly not) through a disc, and then what? FD? Go splat?  Or turn the fight back over to the newly rezzed and buffed warrior to continue?  I think its option 3, because Ive seen it work that way with rangers more times than I can count.<br />
<br />
Oh and BB I lose groups to the more efficent tank, namely warriors, everyday, so I dont think my line of thinking is wrong, merely that youll throw everything and the kitchen sink at a knight to try and hold your opinion in a better light with any dev or SoE employee who might read this or any other of the 14 million knight vs warrior threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've also somewhat crippled Rangers as tanks in the loooong ago past.<br />
<br />
Now Paladins have droped a sign around the necks of SK's that says Offensive Knights and one around their own necks that says Defensive Knights. They actually have an argument that SK's have never had the healing ability, etc. to stand up to harder hitting mobs and insted you can turn on the DPS provided you are NOT tanking.<br />
<br />
The answer is NOT to be a lesser Warrior - it's to be an effective SK. Your Class Description says you cripple mobs - whats your best debuff? Says you got a pet. When was the last time you used one in a raid?<br />
<br />
Do your lifetaps seem all that good to you?<br />
<br />
When was the last time yas stuck a Fear on a mob in GoD after snaring it. Do you suppose a new Fear that mimic'd a stun would help?<br />
<br />
The problem is not that SK's don't measure up when compared to Warriors sir. The problem is that they don't measure up when compared to a viable SK class in hard content.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't use a mitigation discipline for add tanking and in normal experiance groups. We get one that we use on brutal mobs. The innate differences between a Warrior and a Knight are not so great that the spellbook shouldn't make up the difference. The spellbook should also be the reason a guild would want an SK rather than another Warrior, who will almost always (equpment being equal) out tank a Knight.<br />

I mean in raids that is a defined role for rangers grabing agro an ws tanking till the Next Tank can ae taunt.  In the content we are currently working through, Txevu mainly, I dont see a need to rebalance class roles on raids.  Where knights would get the most out of such a disc would be tanking single group Names in Kod Taz, Qvic, Yxatta and Innkiz trials.  Personally I would rather see these type of named be tuned to be knight tankable without a disc.  (note here: I cant speak for the Innkiz trials since the recent changes but named in KoD Taz and Yxatta are tankable by knights....  Sometimes.)  Dont get me wrong I dont want them to be easier just tuned differently.<br />
<br />
That being said I do see merit in a knights getting a weaponshield type disc.  I dont think you could argue that DA or Feign are the same thing.  Mainly since they drop you to the bottom of the agro list.  I think that LoH or HT would be more of the orginal concept of balancing things out.  But as far as LoH goes it doesnt really have the same impact on mobs that can blow through 11k hit points or more in less then 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And most Warriors don't see a horrible problem with it either, as long as its duration and refresh is in line with similar disciplines already in the game for other classes.   It's not reasonable to expect, as an example, a furious like auto riposte discipline that lasts for 30 seconds and refreshes in 72 seconds.  It's horribly overpowered.  But asking for a furious like auto riposte discipline that lasted for 16 seconds and refreshed in 30 minutes wouldn't be that horribly out of line.<br />
<br />
But you can't argue from two sides of the coin.  You can't say you need an auto riposte discipline to help you emergency tank like Warriors can do using it and then claim that you need it to refresh as frequently as defensive.   It's either an auto riposte or it's a defensive substitute.   If it's an auto riposte, then the Knights need to accept that it is going to have a fairly long refresh.  If it's a defensive substitute, don't expect to get it.</div></div><hr />

It's a matter of tanking well enough and when it comes to the gap that Knights/Wars have its a bit too high in some places and alittle to high in others.  Atleast Kod'Taz+, I'm too far removed from the earlier game now to comment appropriatley on that but I don't believe it's a problem now since it was fine in PoP and Knights haven't gotten worse and Warriors only got mediocre aggro in that situation.  Pal vs SK though... now you get a nice argument since well as much as I hate saying it, SK's flat out suck at their primary job right now.<br />
<br />
Glatius, SK's don't need a defensive substitute.  Theres zero need now.  There is however a need to compete with Paladins in groups and a slight pulling increase, plus well... what I said above about both Knights vs War.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear what you're saying.  And I don't disagree that it seems a little lopsided in the Paladin's favor versus the Shadow Knight.  I don't begrudge Shadow Knights some reasonable additions to level that out.  However, many of the suggestions strenuously endorsed and campaigned for by some Shadow Knights seem to not be well considered in the full light of how they could be used, rather than how it is presumed they would be used.  Feign Death is a prime example of an ability which was not designed for how it eventually came to be used.  If people were to say, Feign Death is designed to allow a character to avoid certain death and no other reason, this wouldn't stop the players from using it for pulling.   The same could hold true with whatever kind of discipline Shadow Knights are granted, if they are granted one.  It needs to be considered from every direction as to how it could be used, not just how it's expected to be used.  Which means that it can't be long and it can't be frequent, or it will get used a lot for situations for which it isn't intended.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I've seen BB ask a couple of times why SKs don't have a fear that simulates a stun effect.  It seems to me that the Necro screaming terror line, which really simulates a mezz, is very close to that concept.  The mob is so horrified that it stands locked in place, unable to move.   Why a Shadow Knight version that rather than mezzing the mob, so terrified them that the shock momentarily stunned them, couldn't be implimented is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Its a bug as I see and onethat need to be fix real quick like. Those classes depend on FD, and as it is, if there is a caster mob around the can't depend on it. I can't see why the spell isn't instant cast anyways, or a hotkey ability like monks. I see no reason why monks would be upset about that change. Besides, they got plenty of other things to worry about, I find is suprising that rogues out damage monks, to me they should be on the same level. Rogues get better mitigation, sneak and hide, and they keep there situational damage thats not reallt situational considering all mobs have backs.<br />

Wizzys, monks and rogues should all do very comparable damage, with maybe wizards coming out ahead if agro isn't a factor (Pally tanking for instance).<br />

The big problem with Monks getting support from the community is the very first thing out of their mouths, without fail, is a demand to have their old mitigation returned to them.  Until they're willing to let that go and consider other options, it's going to be difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues take damage worse than monks over time actually.  Seeing as we simply don't act as main tanks for anything of note (and hence don't have a CH chain behind us), I'd swap my chain mitigation in a heartbeat for better avoidance and Mend.  In exp groups against GoD content our mitigation is pathetic anyhow.  You mention Stealth and I'll give you that one; it's our big perk right now, even if useless in many, many areas.  Then you go on to call backstab non-situational though and I want to make you circle-strafe and jiggle around mobs for a few hundred days /played.  <br />
<br />
Should Monks do more damage than they do?  Sure, I can get on board with that although I'd need some parses from the latest GoD weapons to be honest.  Should they approach even Rogue (nevermind competant and attentive Wizard) damage?  Yeah, I am going to have to say no, not until Rogues get Escape on a 10 second timer, Monk AA/equipment choices and Mend thanks.  Of course, I'm a little biased ;)<br />

Yet, DPS is more or less what SoE has been giving SK's along with some backdoor improvement to their pulling ability.<br />
<br />
I've suggested that SK's need (with careful concideration of how overpowered it works out in combination):<br />
<br />
Their own, not overwritten by anything, major debuf that operates on a mob's AC, ATK, and resists to make them more succeptable to spears.<br />
<br />
A pet that can reasonably be summoned in raids ocassionally.<br />
<br />
A change to lifetaps. A lifetap only heals the caster. There's an argument that they should heal MORE than an equivilant Paladin heal, not less. Not half damage (like a mob is going to be impressed by lifetap damage) and half heal.<br />
<br />
An energency auto-repost/auto-parry disc with a short duration and reasonable refresh to be used to get healing in synch or in an emergency vs. a mob that's hitting harder/getting luckier than expected. I tend to think that because SK's really are more offensive than Paladin's this should be an exact copy of Furious perhaps with a shorter refresh (maybe 15 minutes).<br />
<br />
A cast on anyone brief duration hate multiplier. EQ does not have a well-fleshed out aggro assignment on others (or self to increase an SK's aggro capability) sub-role. This is a feature of Rogues in FFXI and it's very very nice.<br />
<br />
Fear II stun. Use a recourse on the mob to avoid stun locking, I don't care. <br />
<br />
SK's are rapidly getting to a point that they are not doing things TO mobs and merely whacking them with weapons. I want a mob to scream in anquish when an SK focuses on it.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see SK's be viable add tanks/plow tanks and ADD value to raids because they are SK's and not just another Wariror.<br />

If rangers are ment to tank better than me with their autoriposite disc, then why arent you arguing with rangers?  Oh thats right, they arent taking your spots in groups....must be because they arent a tanking class, they are a light tank with above average dps to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Im not arguing for defensive, Im not arguing for any of your discs, Im arguing for the right to be tied for the second best tank, not be behind light tanks in my ability to take punishment because of a fucking disc and mitigation advantage.   <br />
<br />
We have put our resolutions on the table, and youve spit on them, guess its up to SoE to &quot;balance&quot; their game now, and if they dont, well you wont have to worry about me bitching anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Warriors have said, sure, we see no problem with Knights getting a discipline that mirrors the exact same one they're bitching Rangers use to salvage a bad situation, and that isn't enough.  And what mitigation advantage are you talking about light tanks having?  Better substantiate that in a meaningful way to have it believed.  Because no one believes that Rangers mitigate better than Knights except Knights.  And the Knights haven't backed that belief up with bubkas.<br />
<br />
And your resolutions for the  most part have been overpowering.  If my choice is between endorsing a resolution I know just from looking at to be overpowered or letting SoE come up with something on their own that may or may not be overpowered I'll go with SoE.  At least then I can bitch about their not knowing what the hell they're doing in good conscious.</div></div><hr />

You just have to laugh about all these posts. It never ends here or on PoN, etc. My 2cp (as someone who boxes pally and warrior at same time as part of 6box):<br />
<br />
1) Warriors highly overrate pally spell book (fizzle/cast during attack/utility, etc.), most of it is non-combat (cause it wont go off in combat unless u get lucky, at least other than short stuns and fast heals) which is better than nothing but I dont write home about a 90% rez or most of the other spells (I use the 2 grp heals and would stun if the pally was the pulller, that is it, oh and BSS. Guess he is destined to be BSS bot).<br />
2) Pallys tend to want to aspire to more than they admit here. Lets start with the aforementioned WS-like disc and see if that is enough. It's scalable and along with other possible spells could get you like 30secs of tanking against just about anything most would encounter<br />
3) No more new classes please SoE, its bad enough already<br />

Spells are incredibly overpowering.  Anyone who says otherwise hasn't spent a significant amount of time playing a casting class ... and especially a hybrid.

<br />
99% of the knights bitching for defensive have an identity problem.  You see, the class they all really want to play is a warrior because the only thing they really want to do is be the supreme champ at tanking shit.<br />
<br />
One of Brenlo's recent remarks hit the nail on the head.  In short he said something to the effect of <br />
<br />
&quot;As to comments that rangers are worthless, if you feel that way then I suggest you try another class.  There are thousands of rangers who feel that they are useful and fun.  They have a great time playing each night.  If you find that you cannot do that with your current class, then try another, perhaps one that is more suited to your expectations.  And I stand by my statement folks, if the only joy you get from your class is lamenting how worthless they are, try another class.  I am not telling you to quit the game and I do understand character attachment, however it may be that the class is not what you thought it would be.  Now this does not mean that I think Rangers have no issues.  I think they need some adjustments but are not so broken that all you can do is sit around on the forums and talk about how broken they are.  Now I am going to close this thread until the gnashing of teeth and frothing dies down.  If you would like to continue relevant discourse on Ranger woes, the top concern being overall DPS, then please do so in another thread but without the added drama of &quot;My class is worthless&quot;<br />
<br />
This statement was referring to certain rangers feeling useless as they are neither the strongest dps, nukers, healers, tanks ... and thus feel they have no place in eq.  These statements are prety true of most classes in eq and the players who have gripes.  Most everything is working as intended, and if you find yourself unhappy with what you are, maybe that just means that you should have been something else.  <br />
<br />
Wanna tank big shit?  Play a warrior.  Wanna blow shit up?  Play a wizard.  Wanna be the prime healer?  Play a cleric.<br />
<br />
 Wanna have a fuckton of fun playing eq?  Play a hybrid or any other class of your choice ... because good lord they really are fun to play (not even a hint of sarcasm here).  Play something that makes you happy .. otherwise this game is nothing but a job.<br />
<br />
This game is too big for this petty nonesense.  It really does take all the fun out of the game.  EQ is no longer a roleplaying fantasy game ... it has degenerated into this quake-nukem blow shit up and get uber leet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Warrior wish list was actually quite modest - Warriors don't want to be given stuff, we're content to earn it. We understand a 9K HP fighter is not going to perform like a 12K HP fighter except on trivial content and are willing to work our way up so long as the gear is out there ripe for the taking. For players that raid, it is.<br />

I know you are not talking about me, as I have a 65 Shaman (325AA+), 65 wizard (330AA+), Cleric (225AA+), and enchanter (500AA+) along with my 65 pally (230AA+) and warrior (200AA+). Although I dont raid at the high-end today, I spend time in hard LDoNs, Tier 4 PoP, and God amongst other places.<br />
<br />
Spells can be a useful tool but warriors make you think that they can save the day consistently in high end content and that is not likely. Warriors, somewhat rightfully so, are too quick to defend &quot;their turf&quot; whereas paladins are imho too quick to whine about not being an equal tank.<br />
<br />
In the end far too many people (and this is a function of the raid game) play one 65 main and they lobby strictly for this class to the detriment of all others. Its natural but those of you who dont realize this happens are kidding yourself. This is in the end why all these discussions/debates/arguments are doomed to make no one happy and to forever be the bane of SoE.<br />
<br />
Probably not adding much to the discussion pointing this out, but sick and tired of people saying they want a balanced game when very few actually do. And to your point my pally is a hell of alot more fun but my warrior is far better at getting the job done in many situations.<br />

BULLSHIT we have. What we've 'spit on' is lamebrain attempts by Brael and others to get a clone of /defensive all their very own. I have YET to see the SK stick his head out here besides Shadowedspawn and have an honest discussion about SK's, or even try to educate non-SK's. What I HAVE seen are lame powergrabs and pointless trolls.<br />
<br />
Any post that begins, ends, or contains in a single sentence the words 'The problem is that we can't tank', I will stop reading right there. ANY content in game there is that a Warrior can tank without discs, you can too with similar gear. Period. There was a brief time in GoD where that wasn't so, and that's been fixed. Now, if you want to tank like a DISCED Warrior, you're gonna need to bring that spellbook, and that spellbook better have something in it that's not titled 'SK's mini-defensive'. If it doesn't measure up, then get that fixed.<br />
<br />
 Bring over data. Bring over fewer outright trolls like Mr. Newtank. Bring over fewer power whores who won't play without /defensive and bitch because Knights don't have it. And bring over less of your attitude because you haven't made an honest effort to persuade Warriors to help you.</div></div><hr />

It is a knight problem because it will reinstate the old pop/ldon imbalance that SoE had to fix.  I am sure they don't want to go back to imbalanced classes.  That is the prime reason they have rejected most of the power grab balance busting requests.  This isn't about the low end shit as you say.  I couldn't give a damn about anything under level 65 right now.  All we asked for at the time was agro control.  SoE INVENTED the -1DI and Sturdiness 500 HP all on their OWN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;How about - if you want to tank, make a warrior. Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
While, you personally may not have meant this how I'm going to portray it, I just wanted to point it out again because I know some warriors do actually believe it.  Knights are not some mystery class that can cast and melee.  They are tanks who make up for their lesser straight melee abilities, compared to warriors, through their spells.  They are tanks, first and foremost.  Can they do other things?  Sure.  I'd not even consider denying that.  But, the main thrust of all three classes is to tank.  They go about it somewhat differently, but its all to the same point.  Many warriors accept that there are 3 (perhaps 4 depending on who you ask) tank classes, some refuse to see more then one. <br />
<br />
 However, you cannot, ever, let one class monopolize a spot in single group encounters (raids are more flexible, so you can go either way on that).  Clerics shouldn't be the only healers, warriors shouldn't be the only tanks, enchanters shouldn't be the only cc, etc etc.  Now, to be completely honest, there doesn't seem to be the problems now that there were at the beginning of the expansion.  As long as all three can get through single group content with the appropriate gear (that level being roughly the same for all classes, though a little variance isn't inappropriate), all is well.  And, it seems that that is true for the most part.  <br />
<br />
My only complaint, as a knight, is that my spells become marginalized.  This is something most warriors don't pick up on, though some do.  Sure, a knight can walk into BoT and use all his spells fine, maybe.  Now put him in Vxed, Tipt, Kod or anything higher.  Hell, put him in the harder elemental xp groups like Field 2 in fire or the Regruas in water and you'll see his spells get marginalized.  So, what winds up happening is, the spells stop bridgeing the tanking gap like they are supposed to.  And by default, they are worth less and less.  Note, I didn't say worthless, just that they get eaten away at, which is wrong.  Don't forget that type of thing when you hear about knights saying their spell books arent' worth much.  In many instances, it may very well be true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trilith,<br />
Reading a post from a Knight that isn't full of BS is like a breath of fresh air, thank you.<br />
<br />
We can argue wether or not single group content is all equally difficult for Warriors and Knights to MT in GoD atm and not really get anywhere. Let's assume it's balanced or at least as balanced as it's going to get.<br />
<br />
The only relevent issue left at this time is &quot;raid role&quot;. Wheee! We went from all &quot;Tanks&quot; able to do single group content is The Central Issue and now that this is solved, we went straight into &quot;raid role&quot; as if nothing was established in the previous debate.<br />
<br />
A few, not all by any means, Warirors agree with you that the power of Knight spells drops as the content gets more difficult. Here's the difference of opinion in a nutshell:<br />
<br />
Your spells are supposed to trail off in power. Put a Knight up against a brutal hard hitting red raid mob and every single spell in their arsenal is not enough. Their base level tanking plus their spellbook is not enough. The ONLY thing that suffices is a Warrior with their base level tanking plus the additional tanking they get because they are only a tank and a specialist at it.<br />
<br />
So there's the wall. Until you as a Knight are geared up in Qvic armor and have a full set of GoD accessories and augments some of the preceeding content will be impossible.<br />
<br />
This should NOT include yellow mobs, normal adds, or normal pulls. You should if geared up to snuff in pre-GoD content top of the line equipment be able to handle add tanking or plow tanking. However, just like when players first encountered named Sand Giants or Kriegers, any tank not sufficiently equipped should get squished.Warriors have had since Kunark an exemption from the strict application of this rule - Defensive. The most compelling reason for this is when guilds first encounter a boss mob they are NOT really equipped to handle it comfortably and often can't farm that content without many failures and the ocassional success and eventual gearing up.<br />
<br />
But Knight tanking should never be entirely useless in raids - and it's not. Knights at my progress level can tank yellow adds and pulls. With better gear they can do it easier. They may not be preferred to do it - a Warriors greater HP's and &quot;-1 DI&quot; does make a difference, but they can be assigned to tank mobs within their capability.<br />
<br />
But Knight spellbooks shouldn't ever be entirely useless in raids - and Paladin spellbooks at least are not. A group heal after DArb is awesome. Paladins can usefully spot heal. GRC is nice. But there is a limit to how much a spellbook can assist them in tanking difficult mobs - that's where Knight tanking leaves off and Warrior tanking continues.<br />
<br />
SK's have many reasons to complain. Paladins have some reason to complain. But neither should use this as an excuse to ask for a Discipline or spell that allows them to try to evade the traditional need to gear up to tank cutting edge content. Neither should use it as an excuse to deny that their spellbooks should give them a raid role in cutting edge content when focused 100% Tanking is an advantage as a tank and they are limited to yard trash and some but not all adds.<br />
<br />
I'm morally certain a Knight that is in fact geared up to 10K HP's buffed can contribute in a raid tanking role. That's still 1K HP's short of what is achieveable in content even BEFORE GoD. This will not necessarily happen if they are in a guild filled with 12500HP buffed Warriors, but it surely will not happen if they raid buff to 9K HP's in a game where everybody and their dog is level 65 and there are literally hundreds of Warriors that raid buff to 12K HP's.<br />
<br />
However, 9K HP raid buffed Knights can and do raid and contribute in content beyond Kod'Taz. That's the advantage of having a spellbook. If I were 9K HP raid buffed, I'd be outside the zone in hoping someone had to leave because my best &quot;buff&quot;, Shrink, doesn't give me a role anywhere.<br />

That said, my good friend Jasonx .... 9.3k hps max buffed without any EP or beyond gear tanks just fucking peachy in tipt/vxed/EP ... and often times better than myself due to the fact that the RNG never fucks him over and lets a caster get eaten due to aggro problems.

The tank classes are balanced just fine.

This isnt a derail you twat, its a simple point that you guys seem to want the fucking earth and have no care in the world about anything else.<br />

Knights have the game in the single group content, they are the preferred choice of class for single group stuff due to their agro control. You also want to have the equal cover in the raid content. An area which is currently required for warriors. The point is a simple one, You cant have it all with out some comprimise. So while you all whinge and fucking bitch about what is soooo unfair at raid level you seem to ignore the rest of the whole game (which i might add there is quite a bit off if you did anything other than BoT or Raid).<br />
<br />
Your on a narrow minded view in which you want class balances in one area which would totally unbalance the game in another area, the so called low end shit to you (btw there were 64 levels of work before you became so fuck uber which i dont doubt you had alot less hassle hitting than you average lvl65 warrior because of you character being so &quot;unfairly&quot; balanced) . If you had been so fucking bothered about making the ultimate tank you should have prehaps read the fucking blurb at the character select screen and gone for the warrior.</div></div><hr />

News flash for you dude, its not PoP anymore and Warriors get groups now.  We now have Incite, anger augs, we can chain our discs, a -1DI mod, 500hps available to us via AAs that arent available to knights, and a much larger selection of hate and stun procing weapons than 12 months ago.  For an XP group in BoT or an LDoN warriors and knights are the most balanced they have ever been.<br />
<br />
This discussion has been about XP group tanking in GoD, particularly the mountain trials and KT.  These are single group XP camps / trials and Knights totally don't &quot;have the game&quot; at this level, actually warriors are the &quot;prefered choice&quot; by far in this content though your lvl51 warrior twink probably has absolutely no clue about it.<br />
<br />
you want class balances in one area which would totally unbalance the game in another area, the so called low end shit to you<br />
<br />
Unless ofcourse the fixes are implemented as GoD spell drops / runes so the balance between knights and warriors doing the &quot;low end shit&quot; won't be effected?</div></div><hr />

Out of curiosity, how many Warriors have you leveled to 65 Crimson?  Yet you presume to not only know all the strengths of the class but also the weaknesses and speak with confidence about the advantages you presume all Warriors to have.  Perhaps we have a bit of the pot calling the kettle black?</div></div><hr />

Some Warriors that post on this board are more than a little tense about what Knights have been publicly asking for probably 6 months.<br />
<br />
Knights looked at the Phase 1 Melee Update and some immediately objected to every single change and since then have proposed undoing every single change by making an offsetting change to Knights.<br />
<br />
Brenlo recently stated:<br />
What we want to do is make sure that each class has a role at all levels of play AND that each class is fun at all levels of play. So while it may be that certain classes still are defined as a DPS class, they would each also have other things to contribute and keep them distinct. Now please understand that this does not mean we are going to overhaul each class. We are not sure yet what changes this will mean, if any. It will mean that we have a new viable framework for moving forward that does not try to maintain a balance by comparing one class with another.<br />
There's no effort by most of the SK posters here to discuss making your class fun at all levels of play and keeping it distinct. Y'all have consistantly compared your class to Warriors looking only at Tanking (/em hides spellbook).<br />
<br />
I've consistantly stated I support Knights being capable of performing a raid add tanking role and just as importantly having spells that make them much more of an asset in raids than yet another Warrior. Not mini-Warriors with useless spellbooks. Did you even read the improvements I suggested and concider if they would benefit SK's and are consistant with the goals enumerated by Brenlo?<br />
<br />
Warriors get tense when Knights consistantly strive to rollback the Phase 1 Melee Update and either arrive at Tank Parity (and spellbook superiority) (Iustus) or confine Warriors to raid boss mob MTing and abject inferiority in every other tanking task in the entire game yet again (Brael's suggestion).<br />
<br />
Try thinking a little more PvE and not quite so much KvW.<br />

<br />
Lets think here, mature and civil manner? I reply to a post in which some one is asking for improvements to SKs at lvl55 and lvl30 and ask what they think should be given to warriors at this lvl to make them more desireable in single group content. You then come on saying im whining cos i cant snare and that im trying to derail the thread talking about low end shit? Wouldnt lvl55 and lvl30 be low end shit? Yeah seems like you where discussing things maturly there!. <br />
<br />
Next time you come on and insult someone dont expect them to reply all happy and nice. And why do i class you in the uber group that i hate, because straight away you classed grouping as low end shit, therefore coming across to me with the attitude that if your not raiding 24/7 then your just doing the &quot;shit&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im telling you, that the simple example I put across in an earlier post proves that there is a problem here, rangers should not be saving raids after knights hit the floor, thats not balance.  If rangers are ment to tank better than me with their autoriposite disc, then why arent you arguing with rangers?  Oh thats right, they arent taking your spots in groups....must be because they arent a tanking class, they are a light tank with above average dps to make up for it.<br />
<br />
yes, you're right.<br />
but as you said the ranger gets in when the rightfull tank has fallen. He knows that at this time the mob will probably head to the healers and starts a total wipe of the intire raid force. thus is 24s disc is the time needed to let a better tank gets in line (the the healer crew on his back ready to heal him) so that at the end of the disc when the ranger gonna die (yes he will for sure, because the only way to save his ass is a successfull taunt followed by a hate burst).<br />
So in this situation, the ranger use his disc to tank, but not in a tanking view. It's more a &quot;saving time till a true tank comes&quot; view.<br />
<br />
So the question is : is it possible for other classes to take his role?<br />
 * all classes with their 12s autoriposte can do that, but it isn't that great because it leave less time for reorganisation, thus the raid force needs more reactivity.<br />
 * a warrior ready for a full boss tanking mode (ie furious and def ready) can do it fine. the healers have just to get ready on him before the 12s timeout.<br />
 * kinghts can't do anything in tis sitation, except getting in landing a burst hate spell calling for help/assit/heal and pray he has both the top hate on the mob and his healing crew ready asap.<br />
<br />
 Should a knight take this role ?<br />
In this ranger role, yes absolutly. they are better tank, they should be able to tank in emergency. But remember that the ranger is gonna die at the end of the disc. <br />
So the true question now is : Should the knight, in emergency tanking situation, die at the end of a short period of time ?<br />
If Yes, how to implement it. maybe a combinaison of spell/melee imunity. ie a disc that gives autoriposte for x secondes (melee immunity) and a spell immunity for 2x secondes (thus at the end of the autoripost, no heal would help him staying alive).<br />
if No, in what extent do we want them to tank and how to give them the requiered survability and how to not create an unbalance situation in short fight content (exp, trash, ...) ? all the idees I get here don't pass the last step (balance). but I will expose them just to let the discussion follow up.<br />
again, a disc combinaison might be very powerfull (too damn overpowerfull). for exemple a x secondes autoripost/liftap for the SK and a x secondes autoripost/group heal for the Paladin. this would assure they start tanking at the end of the disc at their best rest state. but to not permit them to use it in exp content it should have a monstruous cooldown (more than 2hours, because we can chain hard LoDN boss fight every 1.5hours), or better a limiter that hasn't been implemented yet but that would create a new way of balancing special ability : scaling its power (or just let it be available or not) depending on the number of people in the zone or on the number of tanking people in the zone (ie if there isn't 50 people it's impossible, if there more than 10 other tank then &quot;you are not the last tank standing&quot; so it's impossible, etc ...).<br />
<br />
in fact creating this kid of situation would balance much more the game because it would be possible to create skills for each content without allowing their use outside. Moreover I think it's possible to implement it because it already exist a charm that increses in power when there is nobody in the zone).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wince when I catch a whiff of a suggestion that classes besides warriors should get defensive in some form or other.<br />
But other things make me wince even worse (mainly because I just don't think the defensive thing is going to happen): the word &quot;knights&quot; is starting to make me cringe. SKs and Paladins are not the same thing. It's not that the category &quot;knights&quot; has no validity, but bleh, warriors need to be careful starting sentences like &quot;Knights want....&quot; It's an odd combination of posturing and whining that is singularly unproductive.<br />
Poorly defined problems are also starting to really bother me. If you fail to define a problem precisely, your chances of proposing an optimal solution trend rapidly to zero. <br />
Look over these threads. Hardly any space in the discussion is given over to a description of any given problem, its scope, its severity, its range/situationality, etc. A problem is gestured at, then IMMEDIATELY a bunch of solutions are presented at length, then people start flaming each other at even greater length.<br />
BB's suggestions are weighty precisely because he is precise.<br />
My own view is that SKs are getting the short end of two sticks: they are not a heavy tank, but in some significant situations it's hard to see how they make up for that with their damage or utility. A rational discussion of what the range of these situations are must come before a tidal wave of solutions.<br />
Let me give a couple of examples of things that look like possible problems but which, in my view, are not.<br />
<br />
The other day my SK was soloing a dark blue mob. I started the fight at 80% health. When I killed the mob, I was at 100% health, mwuhahahahahaha. My warrior would have been hard pressed to solo that mob at all under those circumstances. Other posts on this board have pointed out situations where in normal LDoNs the cleric goes LD and the SKs keep fighting single pulls for a while without a healer with little problem. Can that be done? Sure, sometimes. Does this mean that SKs are overpowered? Heh, nope.<br />
<br />
The other day my warrior was in a normal LDoN pick-up group. Cleric pacified a crowd of mobs, I tagged one. Pac failed, the whole roomful of mobs came to me. I told the group we had four adds, and headed back to camp. Positioned mobs so that enchanter could see them, and of course told group which one I was on. Enchanter worked her way through the adds, icing them. CH landed on me at 5% health as last add was iced. Then we tidied up. Then the enchanter told me there had in fact been five adds. Suggested I learn to count. Pffft. My SK would not have survived--he simply would not have been able to stand the pounding long enough for the enchanter to do her thing. Do I conclude warriors are overpowered? Well, no.<br />
<br />
I would conclude that these classes have different strengths, and that under certain circumstances, different weaknesses, and sometimes those weaknesses can get you a free gate to an all-too-familiar zone. That's not the same thing as balance, though. <br />
This game is about groups of characters working together. SKs, it seems to me, have a potential set of problems that mostly stem from poorly tuned scalability in their spell books rather than lack of /disc defensive. But again, such circumstances have to be precisely defined if a sufficient solution set is going to be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.<br />
the pb of the outhause is that when we try to have a proper discussion we just and up with more flamers. and unfortunatly when a good proposition is made in the war room, everybody thinks it's just another outhouse thread that is missplaced and we end up with a flamer war.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I red again at the first post on this forum, I just think that Holywrath is not flaming nor insulting the SK that failed in KT. But it doen't matter a bunch a flamers came talking trash and even the concerned SK came to defend herself and starting whining all over the thread. But as I said, there were ne offence, and even some excuse to the poor SK that had a poor group.<br />
<br />
very often Paladin forget this ineresting stun mitigation in GoD (http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=2736.topic)<br />
and SK forget what brabble just said with ending a fight with more HP than on its beginning.<br />

<br />
So far we've talked about:<br />
1) XP group tanking - knights didnt come up with any examples to back up that they do not compare to similar equipped warrior here.<br />
<br />
2) Gear is more accessible to warriors and knights cant reach 8k+ as easy - errrr we called bullshit here.<br />
<br />
3) Ranjars better tanks then knights because they have riposte disc... - I mean come on they better tank for 18 seconds because they are invulnerable. Its a distinct ranjar role. Always has been. You dont see warriors filling in there do you? Not in my guild. No sir.<br />
<br />
4) A nice juicy portion of flames and name calling from both sides.<br />
<br />
I mean come on someone come out and say what is the knights can not currentley do, but should be able to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep, I agree, as I said : <br />
 thus 24s disc is the time needed to let a better tank gets in line<br />
 ... <br />
But remember that the ranger gonna die at the end of the disc. <br />
...<br />
Ranger are &quot;emergency tanker&quot;<br />
...<br />
 So in this situation, the ranger use his disc to tank, but not in a tanking view. It's more a &quot;saving time till a true tank comes&quot; view.</div></div><hr />
