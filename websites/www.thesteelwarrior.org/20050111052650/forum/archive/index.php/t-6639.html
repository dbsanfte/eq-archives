<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other day, I made a realization while raiding in EarthB: our raid leader at the time (a ranger) put a cleric in charge of healing, and put a monk in charge of pulls...but decided to make the call himself on who tanks what, what the tank order is, etc.<br />
<br />
Later, I sent a tell to another raid leader (a warrior), requesting that if the ranger is leading the raid, perhaps he could go to a warrior to make the tanking lists.  After all, an active warrior knows more about tanking than a ranger would, right?  (for example: once I was told by my raid leader to use evasive on Reparm instead of defensive.  I protested, was told to just do it, did it, and died within the first 10 seconds.  His motivation was sound, but he just didn't understand that theres more to being a warrior than you can read in a single post on steelwarrior)<br />
<br />
The response I got startled me:<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no point in doing that.  A warrior could be played by a trained monkey, all there is to do is press A, taunt, and defensive.  Anybody can pick up a warrior and do a good job, given his ac/hp.&quot;<br />
<br />
*blink*<br />
<br />
I stared at the screen for a minute, hoping he would give me a &quot;j/k, gotcha!&quot; (he's been known to mess with me in the past).  But no, he stood by his word that when he makes a tank list, he just goes in order of the HP/AC.<br />
<br />
I argued with him for a minute about the importance of aggro control, the ability to get snap aggro (ie, Weapon Affinity playing into effect), the weapons the warrior has (a 2hs warrior &gt; a slow 1hs warrior &gt; a fast 1hs warrior for General Reparm, but the order is switched for lower dps fights like Xegony, or memblur fights like the Avatar of Wind in poair), how much attention the tank pays / how alert he is (this is more important for the 2nd tank than the main tank), etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
No, he maintains, there is nothing more to consider but the HP/AC.  the 2.2kac 11k tank goes before the 1.9k ac 10.5k who goes before the 1.9ac 10.4k, etc etc.  No if's, and's, or but's.<br />
<br />
So I tried to ask about us checking the competence of a warrior applying to the guild.  We get apps with 8.5khp and 1500ac, and the ranger raid leader is afraid to put him on first against an air avatar (sure he may die, but I want to see how he reacts, how he acts, and how he tries to tank...and he *does* stand a chance there, easily.  If he dies, its no big deal, we can pick it up no problem with the senior warriors).  His only response to that was &quot;The raid leader always picks the tanks.  That's the way it always has been, and that's the way its going to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
I commented about this on our guild boards, and he challenged me to find anybody or anything that says otherwise....so here I am.<br />
<br />
So tell me, guys --<br />
<br />
- Is there ever a time when you would NOT want to build the tank list from a &quot;highest hp/ac to lowest hp/ac&quot; formula?<br />
- Do you think that anybody can pick up a time-equipped 65warrior off ebay and be a better tank than someone playing for 3 years who is only elementally equipped?<br />
<br />
I'm really curious to know...</div></div><hr />

We try to one-tank things, and when one tank goes down the second in the list steps up with an AETaunt to take over.<br />

Just to avoid confusion.</div></div><hr />

Better aggro weapons&gt;hp/ac<br />
Less lag&gt;hp/ac<br />
Not going to go LD on you&gt;hp/ac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well first off, all our tanks are pretty close in terms of AC and HP, and secondly, we make everyone tank.  There isnt a raid that goes by that one of the warriors doesnt tank something.  <br />
<br />
And we do use different people for different circumstances sometimes, but usually its by whos disc is up and who doenst have rezz effects more then whos got the most AC and HP hehe<br />
<br />
One thing though, the warriors always make the MT orders, we wouldnt stand for it any either way, and your warriors really shouldnt either heh<br />
<br />
This ranger sounds like a real asshole /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hp/ac &gt; all that the raid leader sees shouldn't apply to all fights.  On fights where there's going to be aggro loss due to  a slow / stun / fd, you're probably better off with someone who has the best snap aggro via procs / aa / gear.  Then you have the fights where the mobs are assbeaters, so you take into account aa / gear.  Etc etc.. too many variables to take into account but if all the warriors have relatively the same AA, it makes things easier to base it upon hp/ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We make everyone tank. Warriors make the orders. All of our warriors can tank 99% of any encounter we have ever fought, so it's not a big deal. Yes other things come into play other than AC/HP, some fights require smart tanks for positioning and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I dunno why you aren't using evasive on Reparm. We use it and, despite not being so uber, often kill him with 2 tanks. You get spikes from procs on him via defensive, just like you do with evasive, so don't tell me defensive is less spiky.<br />
<br />
Secondly, in a high-end raiding guild, I would expect all the MT candidates to have the important tanking AA. I would expect them all to have adequate weapons for keeping agro off clerics and the like. If they don't have that, they really shouldn't be in the MT rotation other than as emergency tanks.  Once you assume that, yeah, the people in the MT rotation could be arranged by HP/AC. If you can't assume that, then AA/agro &gt;&gt; HP/AC.<br />
<br />
If I think we can single tank something, I put the highest HP/AC person on it, no question. If I think we're going to go lose a tank, I adjust for who has AE Taunt, furious, and of course defensive/evasive up. A smooth tank transition is more important than putting the transition off for a bit longer and then having it go to shit if the next tank up doesn't have AE Taunt. The 12s of riposte agro and time for CH to get going is usually more important than having someone with 500 more HP tank it if they don't have furious up. That said, I usually try and make sure that people who are going to start the rotation don't have to use their discs early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, his advice was sound in that case. Evasive IS a better choice on reparm, because that's the disc that will help you avoid his massive procs as well as reduce melee damage taken. My guild uses evasive instead of defensive on reparm.<br />
<br />
The fact that you died wasn't due to bad advice... it was more likely either A: the healing wasn't up to snuff, or B: he got a lucky round on you. Reparm can one round most any tank in the game, discs or not.<br />
<br />
HP and AC are important. So is having certain weapons. So is having the right AA's... it's just not as simple as straight HP/AC. I'd take a warrior with less HP/AC but has a BoWar over a warrior with more HP and AC and a BF/BoC on hard hitting mobs, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the non ebay tanks should decide who's doing what.<br />
<br />
prolly on first encounter you would want most hp/ac upfront for larger margin of error.<br />
<br />
9/10 times this guy will say use defincive on everything. i swear 90% don't even know what evasive is, or what it does.<br />
<br />
easyest thing to do is get the warriors together decide who wants to tank in what order and tell the rl hp/ac in the order you all decided. then you decide tank order, and gl still feels important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CorayAV</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So tell me, guys --<br />
<br />
- Is there ever a time when you would NOT want to build the tank list from a &quot;highest hp/ac to lowest hp/ac&quot; formula?<br />
- Do you think that anybody can pick up a time-equipped 65warrior off ebay and be a better tank than someone playing for 3 years who is only elementally equipped?<br />
<br />
<br />
I regularly make our tank list, and I do not just stack the front with the best tanks over and over, just about every warrior gets a chance to tank once they're familiar with how things work.   I expect everyone to be able to hold aggro and know what to do, and the only way to do that is to throw everyone in at one point or another.  <br />
<br />
I do think that in general, there is a lot of skill involved with being a good warrior, but specifically on raids, it isn't generally something that requires any great ability, and is generally gear dependant.  <br />
<br />
If I put a 1900 AC warrior up instead of a 2300 AC warrior, the first will obviously take more damage, which could affect the raid.  For me and my guild, it's just life, if someone takes a bit more DPS, we have to adapt and I don't necessarily try to make things we've done before, easy to keep us on the top of our game.<br />
<br />
For something that we haven't done before or special cases in complex fights, I do tend to put the most experienced warriors first (who also tend to have the best gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why you would ever not put your warrior with best HP/AC first.  My guild doesn't do it this way either but that's because everyone in the first 4 tank order can tank anything in the game atm.<br />
<br />
Stop believing your skill really matters to this game and you'll be a better player.  All you need is auto attack to MT something.  If you think it involves more than that, then you need rethink how you approach this game.  That is not to say our job is trivial, but it is really not that complicated.  If you're having trouble with an encounter it's time to sit down and realize that your skill don't matter and go with the best HP/AC that will produce a win.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Reparm, Fiery Strike isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  People tend to conveniently forget that he also melees for 3K and that happens a lot more often than his proc.  If you can't even survive during the duration of your disc, I'm willing to bet it's more likely due to you don't have enough AC, not because you were unlucky enough to get proced 3 times in a round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For warriors, I truly believe that knowledge of the encounter and the flow of battle is far more important that knowledge of your class.  As long as you aren't using the mouse to click your hotkeys/discs you will be fine.  <br />
<br />
What is important is knowing when and how to act.  Most of which is completley trivialized when you are talking about single mob encounters.  In which case, it would be a clear cut case of hp/ac.  <br />
<br />
I would expect these type of decisions to be made by skilled and knowledgeable people, not based on classes.  For instance, if I had a warrior who was really well equipped but dumb as a rock, I would probably put him first on tank order.  That way, if he went down I would have people left that would be able to quickly react to the changing situation instead of someone scratching their ass and going, &quot;errrr...&quot;.  So yes, there are definately varying degrees of skill to warriors, but this has little to do with warrior experience and more to do with the skill and knowledge of the player.<br />
<br />
In this game there are skilled players and they can pretty much play EVERY class to the full extent of their abilities given some small time to get used to spells/discs/hotkeys.  WHile other players will always suck no matter how much time they rack up playing a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've used defensive and evasive on reparm and tanks die jsut the same.  Reparm is more about tank switches than it is about how long a tank can last.  <br />
<br />
Tanks should be making a tank list.  i do my guild's most of the time and i rotate who tanks what so that all tanks get a chance and a feel at what its like to tank a big mob.  Ranger's should stick to pressing the range button like a monkey and leave the important aspects of a raid to the classes that matter (oops =p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the non ebay tanks should decide who's doing what.<br />
<br />
I doubt any high end guild have ebayed tanks amongst their ranks.  Most guilds have extensive background checks / invitee processes to weed out those types.  <br />
<br />
that's because everyone in the first 4 tank order can tank anything in the game atm.<br />
<br />
Good thing to point out.  One of the biggest downsides / upsides to most guilds that have been farming time now for nearly a year, is that all the tanks are almost geared identically.  This is good in terms of raid security, but i very strongly disagree with you when you say that all you need is auto attack to MT something.  There are a lot more things that factor into that, BUT i do think i see what your getting at.  With attrition and the gear most warriors in high level guilds have now, it really has come down to the point of hitting auto attack in a lot of cases.  <br />
<br />
Most warriors after 10 months in time ( using my own time as an example ) are geared to the teeth and the game gets dumbed down with each expansion, making it to a point where id almost waver in my stance disagreeing with you when you say we just hit auto attack.  Granted its a bit of an exaggeration, but an interesting point nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Feign Death procs are about the only thing that requires a Warrior paying attention.<br />
<br />
If you're failing to an encounter and you're looking for a magic fix, especially in forms of 'skill', you're looking at the wrong place.  Reparm more than anything is a test of how good your HP/AC/resist are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We'll i'm gonna agree most of the Time MTing is reduced to 3 things :<br />
1) ATK on<br />
2) AFK<br />
3) Pray<br />
<br />
When people start dying, mobs get all funky etc etc.<br />
Then you are asked for some Action/Intelligence.<br />
Same as to when you get to a new encounter.<br />
<br />
Now as to who should tank 1st 2nd 3rd etc etc....<br />
Well if tank switches are easy, the order is not important.<br />
If tank switches are very hard then it depends on what you want :  HP/AC vs Agro<br />
<br />
On new encounters, we usually put the biggest tanks up first.<br />
Because well, if you loose the MT, things usually go really bad.<br />
On encounters that are &quot;Mastered&quot; everyone gets to tank.<br />
<br />
Overall, everyone should tank as long as it doesnt put the raid at risk.<br />
<br />
Of course the 2300ac 12khp 10% shielding will do fine on Time Saryn.<br />
Same applies to the 1800ac 10khp recruit.<br />
So why not let the recruit tank ? <br />
Its not like there isnt anyone to pick up if he dies :)<br />
<br />
Most of the time its like Injektilo said /1 Who's got Disc ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread is funny.<br />
<br />
Anyone who claims that a warrior's job can be done just as well by anyone is either a fool or has never seen a great warrior play.<br />
<br />
The MT by far has the most control over an encounter than any other player in the raid.  A good MT can turn Tallon Zek into an easier fight than Saryrn, for a good example.<br />
<br />
And I used to use defensive on Reparm.  Why?  because there are other ways to mitigate his proc damage.  Especialy after LDoN.  Defensive is guaranteed to reduce spike damage, while evasive might not do anything for the round that kills you.</div></div><hr />

Well VZ/TZ &amp; Inkkiz Trials need you to actually do something.<br />

If you are raiding with skilled players, when something goes wrong you'll still be ok and kill your mob, with trained monkeys you'll wipe.<br />
It's all about time, and playing with skilled players will save you a lot of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Debbin</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the way we do it, is that we have the tanks with the highest AC/HPs as MT and ST, it just so happens, that they have very good agro weapons.  the MT has the dreamers dispair from time, and the ST has BoC w/anger 3 and CHSD with anger on it too.  as for off tanking, it depends on how the raid leader wants them handled.  if they are to be mezzed, i have the pally's off tank, as they can do so without causing damage.  if not, then i stick myself, and another warrior on the duty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodoku</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We normally call for volunteer's when picking the MT and SA, and only go by AC/HP on the heavy hitters.

<br />
I don't understand how a warrior that in theory should be in Uqua could think that. You can't put just any moron with 11k hp on the field in Discord and expect good things to come your way, especially with all the fun new warp bugs positioning is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree its not very hard to play a warrior and that ac hp has to say, but its not just as simple as that, there is alot more stuff in there that also make difference. For example as said aggro control is very imporant as well, imo one of the most important as long as you got ok ac hp for the fight, then you have placeing of the mob, how good are you to use the tiny corners and place him so that your raid can get max dps to him, taking atk off when di fails and your undisced, switch to 1h shield when disc down and you have sufficient aggro etc etc, not hard no, but there certainly is more than just atk on and afk. Its many little things which you can do like that, which together do play a role in your tankability, so why not use them.  Ofcourse when the encounters are very trivial this is less nesseccary and the mt's can slack more, but that doesnt mean it isnt more to it.<br />
<br />
About tank lines, we have both raidleader non war and war officer make the lines, both work fine, and we use all our tanks to tank. This is good imo, because then all get more skilled in it and learn the encounters from that view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the most important aspects of tanking do NOT involve hit points or armor class:<br />
<br />
1- BEING AT THE FUCKING KEYBOARD. (sorry, it has to be said).<br />
2- BEING AWAKE! (again, sorry, but it does have to said. You've all been on them raids, at 4 a.m. ... stuff goes wrong ... the sleeping beauty, I mean &quot;tank,&quot; is still back in the last room where you left him. The main assist is barely awake and hasn't realized this and is calling out the sleeping beauty's name to assist, half the people in the raid are assisting an asleep person who last had himself targeted ... oh yeah, you know you've been there).<br />
3- GIVING THE MELEES THE BACK OF THE FUCKING MOB! (I know this can be hard sometimes and damn near implausible with some mobs or raiding parties who like to get push happy. But hey, you wanted the tank job to require some skill, well here it is, your chance to shine. BACK OF THE MOB ... no defenses ... no dodge ... no riposte ... and something for the rogues to actually backstab!)<br />
<br />
Give me those three things FIRST ... before hit points ... before armor class ... before AA abilities. All that shit can come in time. But give me someone who's awake ... at keyboard ... and taking shit seriously enough as to not GIMP the melee portion of the raid ... and I'll be a happy monk.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reparm:  <br />
I've single-tanked him using Defensive.  I die everytime time I've used Evasive (while the disc is up).  Granted, I end up tanking him without any disc at all so there's no reason to die with Evasive up, but Defensive controls his DPS better because it works on every hit.<br />
<br />
Warrior Skill:<br />
If you believe that there's no skill to playing a warrior, take a warrior applicant and have him tank the Warlord in PoEarth B.  Give him oh, let's say 8 clerics to compensate for his low hp's/ac.  I bet you will be unpleasantly surprised. heh  I've single tanked him more than once (even two flawless kills w/o using snare items).<br />
<br />
Hitting the attack key is the &gt;least&lt; involved thing a warrior does.  Positioning the MOB is critical.  Calling AE's when your chat window is being spammed is vital on many raids.  MT switching, when you have to react in seconds, after a tank dies is a skill.  The next tank has to react quicker than anyone else on the entire raid.<br />

I've seen warriors who couldn't position MOBs at all.  I've seen warriors forget to use a disc on named.  Some warriors didn't even use Incite when a MOB enrages.  Some warriors don't even know how to use sit aggro in exp groups to move a MOB.  Some warriors don't have hotkeys for using AE Taunt and their disc's so it's not communicated when they use these abilities.  Some warriors don't know what MOB enraged is (auto-riposte) so they don't know how to attack from the rear. lol  Ever seen a warrior tank 2 MOBs at once in an exp group in the EP's?  If so, great!  Do you realize that 60% of warriors can't effectively aggro two MOBs at once to do that?  Do you realize that some warriors push Taunt ALL the time -- even when they are all ready on the top of the aggro list?  This sucks when tanking named because on the off-time that you lose aggro, Taunt could be down when you need it most. heh<br />

A lot of people that post here aren't in touch with the majority EQ population -- most EQ players don't even read forums.  ;) <br />

We have 4-5 tanks who can tank any mob we are fighting, and like to rotate tanks to keep them interested and active.  Its no fun being a warrior and just &quot;sitting on the sidelines&quot; being a dps person on every mob.   The fiends in fire are a good training ground for newer or lesser geared tanks.  In our guild a warrior makes the tank line and discusses it with the raid leader to see if a particular tank is preferred for a particular mob. <br />

You need a new guild. Thats insulting and moronic. I am not even a warrior (my gf plays one of my guilds war's), and I know damn well there is a lot to it. Hardest job in EQ? No of course not. Raiding with skilled warriors vs unskilled ones is very noticable though, thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is truly one of the silliest, most moronic thing I have ever heard.  There's a heck of a lot more to a warrior than having the most hp/ac, hitting autoattack, and laying down for a few seconds in your bed to dose off while your raid kills the mob.  A great warrior is attentive, knowledgeable, adaptable, and open-minded, not necessarily the most well equipped.</div></div><hr />

Your healing chain does NOT change because the tank has 300hp's less than someone else.    I used to play with a tank in my old guild that did not know how to back up and keep position on nameds when getting him into a corner.   Next thing you know the mob is pushed past him and the mob turns around riposting/procing or enraging on the raid.     There is way more to being a tank than a few hundred hp's and ac.   <br />

Mobs warping through walls has nothing to do with a warrior's skill... unless you know ahead of a time where a mob will warp through.  Besides it doesn't happen as often as people say it does, and being able to move on a wall back and forth isn't really much of a skill either.<br />
<br />
You're acting skill matters because you're talking about encounters that are both trivial to tank AND actually have tricks to them, like TZ/VZ/Warlord (which requires err, someone to chain RGC on you nonstop).  Take an encounter that's actually not trivial to tank (which really don't exist at this point at least up to pre Uqua trials) and see how much of your skill matters...<br />
<br />
Of course on an encounter that is trivial to tank for anyone at that level, HP/AC doesn't matter, because it's trivial.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are far more issues here than people are posting.<br />
<br />
Point 1.  A wipe will hurt your guild morale and make people want to log.  Not using your best tank on something borderline(tier 5 time) or fairly new (ikkinz uqua) is idiotic.<br />
<br />
Point 2.  There are many many mobs to have lesser tanks practice on, for example any elemental mobs + tier 1-4 times.  Often times its also good to start a lesser warrior when you need to buy time on an encounter and you know he is good for 3 minutes, put your mt second and have him ae taunt + furious once main tank dies.  Instant 3 mins of risk free fight.<br />
<br />
Point 3.  Your tank is the most important person on your raids.  A good mt can make your raid a breeze, and lack of can make your raid a clusterfuck nightmare from hell.  A good warrior has his buffs set, has control of the situation, knows the encounter + aes + cures he will need during it.  He knows the capacity of his rot + patch healers, if he needs vie + spellshield + clarena.  He knows what buffs to drop if you need an emergency quiescense chain during a fight.  He sees when di goes off and immediately calls for a new, using furious to fill in the skip slot in the rot if needed.  He calls aes, knows ranges, knows if ae heals will be needed or not, knows the mana requirements of the rotation given a certain fight time on a given mob.  Knowing what mobs to off tank, what is mezzable, what is immune, what mobs your chanters are going to target first, how much they hit for, who are they going to target first, and how fast will it take you to gain aggro off them, will you have to shield to save them if they dont get heals spammed.<br />
<br />
Point 4.  A tank going afk and doing the minimum is a piss poor player.  People i want in my guild are people who recognize opportunities to rescue raids from near wipes.  For example a 4th or 5th warrior who ae taunts and furious's during a tank switch to help save the second tank while rot gets on him, or a tank who ae taunts and fortitudes to eat adds on a mob such as keeper of the altar.  A good warrior has a handle on his gear, he upgrades weaker items first, but has an eye for an important item, such as something with shielding or spellshield that is only a slight upgrade, but may make a world of difference on a certain mob.<br />
<br />
There are many other things that make a good warrior, but those are the basics and its far far away from hitting autoattack and taunt.  A good warrior has the capacity to make everyones life 100 times easier.</div></div><hr />

On harder stuff I go with the highest HP/AC and most experienced tanks.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Most those variables are not in control by the tank.  There are many times I know heals aren't enough but I can't conjure extra heals out of thin air to make up for that.  Using furious is, at best, an exercise in getting lucky via eyeballing.<br />
<br />
Buff slots are at a premium on tanks so anything like Vie/Spellshield/etc tends to get skipped.<br />
<br />
Most AEs aren't really avoidable anymore, and hitting a macro after an AE doesn't really constitute skill.  Also anyone else can do it (there has to be some people who are still in the AE range, otherwise if tank dies during the AE you're screwed).<br />
<br />
The other things you mentioned aren't limited to the domain of the MT.  Any warrior can do that.<br />
<br />
For any encounter that's prodominently versus 1 mob (even stuff with adds), the MT does very little.  Anytime you're tanking you already removed a large part of your *skill*.  Once the mob is on you there is nothing further to be done.  The only time a Warrior's skill comes into play is in chaotic situations, but these situations are better to be avoided than salvaged.  Maybe the first time you beat (whatever) it requires some miracle save from (someone) but after the first kill, no one will want you to pull any more miracle saves if it can be avoided (and it usually is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've seen, the true &quot;skill&quot; in tanking revolves around experience in handling new encounters, and being able to react/make changes in a fight on the fly.  I know specifically for the guild I'm in, we go into a lot of encounters with absolutely no idea what to expect, nothing.  So far in GoD, we generally, at most, wipe once to an encounter, and then beat it on the second try, if we don't win on the first try (save uqua, fuck that buggy ass zone).  While our gear is spread out a bit, ranging from 11.5k/2100ac to 13.1k/2500ac for tanks, the one thing that we all stress the most is being prepared for anything.  Be it controlling adds, MT switches, shielding casters, maintaining mob position, or just general DPS, we put a lot of effort in to making sure that the damage being dealt in the encounter is being dealt to us, and no one else.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, while awareness/experience are what will take a great tank to an extrordinary level, the general statistics of your gear make a big difference in how a fight goes as well.  Failing a new encounter because you used your weakest tank will probably not build confidence in your raid leaders decision making ability  :D <br />
<br />
One last thing of note.  You can have the most intuitive raid leader in the world, with the fastest reaction time tanks on the planet, but if the rest of the raid isn't using their brain, assist healing, and maintaining their aggro, it will make absolutely shit of a difference how good your tanks/leaders are.  People must be able to follow directions without hesitation, and have 100% confidence in the leaderships ability to recognize and direct the raid, especially mid-fight during new encounters, or you're guranteed to have some long, frustrating nights.</div></div><hr />

While some of this is true calling aes still helps to trigger cures/ae heals/when to zone in and loot ala quarm ect.  Many of the items i listed you are correct, are not confined to the mt, however the MT is who he is because he has excelled at those things int he past and has proven he is the best at it + has adequate play time.  Competence is key, with an incompetent warrior you are going to struggle regardless of how much gear he gets.  As for the spellshield areas you are dead wrong.  Buff slots are at a premium on some mobs, but not all.  All end game warriors have max resists with veeshan + debuffs lesser than tzs.  This eliminates the need to buff any resists when tanking.  Add in a random spellshield or calrena ect and it can make the difference in the fight assuming the dd is single target.  If its ae it does no good.  To maximize the usefullness of furious you need to have a feel for your rotation and when the person who was skippied to cast DIs slot is going to fall, so that you can time it to make sure you are furious between the cheal before and after him.  The slot should be filled in, but it is not always.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is something that does irk me. People who say &quot;EQ does not take skill&quot;. Yes, it does. The problem is that people who make that statement have no idea what &quot;skill&quot; means. Let me show you what Websters defines skills as:<br />
<br />
\Skill\, n. [Icel. skil a distinction, discernment; akin<br />
to skilja to separate, divide, distinguish, Sw. skilja,.<br />
skille to separate, skiel reason, right, justice, Sw. sk[&quot;a]l<br />

   with good reason he should test what he created.]<br />
                                               --Chaucer.<br />
<br />
2. Knowledge; understanding. [Obsoles.]<br />
<br />
         That by his fellowship he color might Both his<br />
         estate and love from skill of any wight. --Spenser.<br />
<br />
         Nor want we skill or art.             --Milton.<br />
<br />
3. The familiar knowledge of any art or science, united with<br />
   readiness and dexterity in execution or performance, or in<br />
   the application of the art or science to practical<br />
   purposes; power to discern and execute; ability to<br />

         negotiations, diverted Alexander from the conquest<br />
         of Athens.                            --Swift.<br />
<br />
         Where patience her sweet skill imparts. --Keble.<br />
<br />
4. Display of art; exercise of ability; contrivance; address.<br />
   [Obs.]<br />
<br />
         Richard . . . by a thousand princely skills,<br />
         gathering so much corn as if he meant not to return.<br />

<br />
5. Any particular art. [Obs.]<br />
<br />
         Learned in one skill, and in another kind of<br />
         learning unskillful.                  --Hooker.<br />
<br />
Syn: Dexterity; adroitness; expertness; art; aptitude;<br />
     ability.<br />
<br />
Usage: {Skill}, {Dexterity}, {Adroitness}. Skill is more<br />
       intelligent, denoting familiar knowledge united to<br />
       readiness of performance. Dexterity, when applied to<br />
       the body, is more mechanical, and refers to habitual<br />
       ease of execution. Adroitness involves the same image<br />
       with dexterity, and differs from it as implaying a<br />
       general facility of movement (especially in avoidance<br />
       of danger or in escaping from a difficalty). The same<br />
       distinctions apply to the figurative sense of the<br />
       words. A man is skillful in any employment when he<br />
       understands both its theory and its practice. He is<br />
       dexterous when he maneuvers with great lightness. He<br />
       is adroit in the use od quick, sudden, and<br />
       well-directed movements of the body or the mind, so as<br />
       to effect the object he has in view.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now if you actually take the time to learn what skill actually is, then you will see that being successfull at EQ does indeed require &quot;skill&quot;. And that the more you have of it, the better you will be. Is EQ rocketscience? Of course not, but it does require a certain skill level to perform, and it requires a much higher level of skill to advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no skill is an exagerration, but still, we arent talking rocket science. tanking isnt that hard, i certainly dont get an ego trip from it. typically i would say the CC who handle non mezzable mobs require the most skill sorting mobs out so everything is tanked.<br />
<br />
and the ego trip about who makes the tank list, i dont care if its a beastlord if he has half a clue whats going on. hopefully most your tanks are of at least avg intelligence with decent gear to do it. obviously some new guy with no gear shouldnt tank potime gods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, a few things I wanted to toss out there (as the original poster)<br />
<br />
1) I'm not simply talking about the first tank.  There's more to tanking than being first.<br />
Being the second tank is just as important, if not more important -- and requires a great judgement as well.<br />
<br />
Of course gear makes a difference.  Someone with 500ac and 1k hp over another tank will obviously perform better.  And yes, when learning something new, you want to stick your tank that will ensure the best chance of success.<br />
<br />
The point I'm making is that &quot;best chance of success&quot; doesn't necessarily mean first tank is the biggest hp/ac, second tank is the second biggest hp/ac, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Consider Reparme (I use him as an example a lot because he's a popular encounter that anyone in EP/beyond can relate to, and because he's got the ability to 1-round, putting him on par with potential difficulty of more advanced encounters).<br />
<br />
If we assume exact weapons, and two tanks with similar gear (say one has 100ac 400hp more than the other, all other things are the same), but one tank has WA1 and the other has WA5, what order do you want them to tank?<br />
<br />
I say I'd want the lower ac/hp tank in there before the higher.  Why?  Because the aggro increase of WA5 gives the higher ac/hp/WA tank a better chance of picking up after the first tank dies, than the other way around.<br />
<br />
Now consider again, the same scenario, only this time you're fighting Avatar of Wind (the one that mem blurs himself; I havent gotten into the GoD raiding scene, but I have heard of encounters that memblur/aggroreduce).  Again, you want the one with bigger snap aggro to go SECOND, even though he has more hp/ac.<br />
<br />
Now consider two tanks, one whos reaction time is faster than the others.  Again, you want him to go second to pick up in the event of a death...because a death and him getting aggro is a lot better than a death and two clerics dying before aggro is maintained on the second tank.<br />
<br />
Now consider typing speed in a new encounter.  Two tanks with very similar gear, neck and neck (one has maybe 2200ac/12khp, the other is 2150ac/12.3khp).  Both are excellent tanks, experienced in their field.  Do you want the one who types slower, makes a lot of typos that sometimes makes his text illegible, even if he has 300 more hp than the other tank?<br />
<br />
Yes, if you're putting in a very skilled 10k tank over a just-somewhat-skilled 12k tank, you need to be smacked in the head.  But when the hp/ac/shielding/avoidance/resists are all sitting around the same sort of deal, theres a lot more to it than the tanks hp.<br />
<br />
Another situation: consider a mob that's all DB...you have two tanks, one with shielding 5 and one with avoidance 10.  Who do you go with?  Now consider a mob in GoD who's all DI...now who do you pick?  Throw in spell shielding accounting with a mob that has proccing as a major form of dps, now who do you pick?  What about a tank dual wielding dbotw/eoe vs anger3 bow.  Both hold aggro well, neither have trouble losing aggro (theres no mem blurring, no aggro reducers), but the mob hits like a truck.  If they're pretty close, I'm going with the 2hs over the 1hs.<br />

<br />
It's not an ego trip.  Its as simple that a competent can make the judgement call better than a raid leader who goes by hp/ac.  Not that going by hp/ac isn't *good*, but there are ways to make it *better*.  Me spamming the raid leader with suggestions on tanking, while possible, doesnt seem nearly as efficient as me or someone else who knows more about the situation making the list.</div></div><hr />

He knows the capacity of his rot + patch healers, if he needs vie + spellshield + clarena. He knows what buffs to drop if you need an emergency quiescense chain during a fight. He sees when di goes off and immediately calls for a new, using furious to fill in the skip slot in the rot if needed. He calls aes, knows ranges, knows if ae heals will be needed or not, knows the mana requirements of the rotation given a certain fight time on a given mob. Knowing what mobs to off tank, what is mezzable, what is immune, what mobs your chanters are going to target first, how much they hit for, who are they going to target first, and how fast will it take you to gain aggro off them, will you have to shield to save them if they dont get heals spammed.<br />
<br />
What you describe is a good player.  There really isn't much to a warrior.  If you are a good player you can log in as a warrior, set up your hotkeys (shield, taunt, aetaunt, incite (or whatever), couple macros, discs) and in a short amount of time you will be excelling at a warrior.  We have multiple people that have played our tanks when they couldn't make a raid and other than awkward communication they did very good.  I still preferred the actually players of course, but it made very little difference, because both people were good players regardless of the class they played.<br />
<br />
Then again there are very few classes that a good player couldn't step in and excel at right away.  At most, any single class would take less than 20 hours played to master by a good player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;There is no point in doing that.  A warrior could be played by a trained monkey, all there is to do is press A, taunt, and defensive.  Anybody can pick up a warrior and do a good job, given his ac/hp.&quot;<br />
<br />
He needs to STFU, get to max range, press autofire on his programmable gamepad, and get to bitching about line of sight like the rest of the trained monkeys playing rangers (/duck).<br />
<br />
As long as you're in the ballpark in terms of AC/HP, I'll take the proven warrior with more brains and ability to react to the situation, over the one with more attendance (and hence loot in a DKP guild like us) but no SMRTs every damn time. BTW, I'm the one who usually makes the lists in our guild.<br />
<br />
Next time he's bitching the mob is in a wall and he can't hit it, remind him it's NOT YOUR PROBLEM since all you do is &quot;press A, taunt, and defensive&quot;.<br />
<br />
Although he's right in a way, he just didn't realise it. A warrior COULD be played by a trained monkey. So could most classes. A good TANK however needs to brains to take it to the next level and implement the various nuances at his disposal</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is something that does irk me. People who say &quot;EQ does not take skill&quot;. Yes, it does. The problem is that people who make that statement have no idea what &quot;skill&quot; means.  ...<br />
<br />
Now if you actually take the time to learn what skill actually is, then you will see that being successfull at EQ does indeed require &quot;skill&quot;. And that the more you have of it, the better you will be. Is EQ rocketscience? Of course not, but it does require a certain skill level to perform, and it requires a much higher level of skill to advance.<br />
<br />
Well, go ahead and be irked because you didn't even read my entire sentence and neglect the fact that I put the word skill in quotes.  Words have definitions and connotations.  To &quot;have skill&quot; is different than having &quot;a skill.&quot;  I can bounce a golf ball off the face of my lob wedge like Tiger Woods, but there's no way in hell I can play golf like him.  He has skill, I have *a* skill.  If you choose to define skill as the act of mastering a certain pattern of responses to different situations like I said, then yes, EQ takes skill.  However, only the second definition remotely resembles that, and the rest go against your argument.  <br />
<br />
EQ is a computer program, and an unsophisticated one at that.  The AI is the bare minimum to be found in a computer game.  At least in some shooters, the NPCs will try to work together and flank you and kill you that way.  In EQ, the mob comes right for you if it's aggroed, then it hits you and maybe casts spells.  That's it.  You only need to figure an encounter out once, and for very high end things that's usually done in beta and spread around by the time of release, so the only real obstacle is a numbers game.  You have to get the hps to survive, the mana to heal and the dps to kill.  <br />
<br />
The rest is simple rote memorization.  Mob X should be tanked with defensive.  Mob Y should be tanked with evasive.  If you're snared and need to move a mob, you strafe.  Position yourself so the raid can hit the mobs back.  Stay in heal range.  Know when to use your abilities.  <br />
<br />
There are only a finitely small number of scenarios in EQ that need to be learned.  Once they are learned, no judgment or discrimination is needed.  Something like a surgeon or mathematician, which were listed in definition three, deal with finitely large variable scenarios.  That's skill.  People like certain types of athletes or competitors and research scientists deal with virtually infinite variable scenarios.  That's skill.<br />
<br />
Are there people who aren't able to learn these things and execute them?  Yes there are.  There are good players and there are bad players, but usually the only difference between them is an inability to learn easily or remember well.</div></div><hr />

I know who your warrior raid leader is and I'm fairly certain he doesn't read The Steel Warrior forums.  I don't think he ever has and he's been playing for over 4 years. heh  I certainly haven't seen a post by him.  He means well, but he doesn't interact with the general warrior community.  With comments like &quot;a trained monkey can play a warrior&quot;, it sounds like he is a little tired of the class or perhaps the game in general (WoW is on a lot of people's mind).<br />
<br />
The main differences I see between warriors, that I equate to skill, are: (1) situational awareness, (2) reaction time, (3) knowledge of the class abilities, and (4) knowledge of the mechanics of the game.  This applies to all classes.  Given the right gear, any &quot;monkey&quot; can get hp/ac.  The items I listed require skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That does not mean that every encounter is exactly the same, that it will run the same way every time (ever get unexpected adds? Have a mob warp out of position? Ever do it once with 6 clerics, then try it with 4? its different, and it requires the tank to act just as different as a cleric or an enchanter), and it doesnt mean that the person with the highest AC/HP is the best choice to tank every mob, and the person with the second highest AC/HP is the best person to be second on a list, EVEN on a mob your guild hasnt successfully killed yet.<br />
<br />
The ability to react and give instructions, to adapt to unexpected circumstances, etc...makes a good player for every main role in a raid, INCLUDING the tank.<br />
<br />
It's NOT just rote things like who to defensive on, where to stand, and to not mash taunt and turn off autoattack when needed (although knowledge of this is crucial as well).  There *is* a difference between a good tank and a mediocre tank.</div></div><hr />

You couldn't be more wrong about this :)  I don't know about your server, but I guarantee e-bayed mains can be found among the ranks of pretty much all of the top guilds on Tarew Marr.  Some of them are damn good players, but when you have to maintain a 100+ man roster, you're not doing extensive background checks on people, you're letting them raid with you for a few weeks, checking to see if they have any major personality conflicts with the people in your guild, and that they aren't disasterously bad at their class and they get in.  I know of many people who have gotten into high end guilds on ebayed characters that everyone knew were ebayed.<br />

 Well, I can only talk about Tarew Marr, and although I haven't played there for a year, looking at the #1 guild's roster I see at least 2 people that I know are Ebay.  When I was in the #2 guild there we had at least 2 or 3 ebayed mains as well.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.  They were not rank newbies that bought a level 65 toon, and in neither case were they the worst players of their class in the guild hehe.<br />
<br />
Maybe some guilds are very strict, but I would be willing to bet it wouldn't be too tough to get into a high end guild as an ebay assuming you had been playing the game for a while on another character.  Buy the toon, change the name, change the server, hang out in the high end exp zones doing pickup groups, tell people that ask you are a server transfer, and most guilds wouldn't turn you down or go to the effort to trace your history.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't call tanking hard, more a matter of doing a number of fairly straightforward things properly and at the right time.  Yeah, I have had a couple of mobs where I could have put Homer's Key Pecking bird on my taunt key and gone for a snack, but to do most mobs properly, you can't be at it.  <br />
<br />
If you think that its auto-attack and /nap on, then hey:  rock on.  You've probably never actually played a warrior or played it well.  Which is fine.  The more dingbats there are out there screwing it up then the more mobs there are for the rest of us who know what they're doing. <br />

My main is a Druid and I know yall do not care about Druids but I will tell you it is not heal, pause, heal , pause nor is it snare, pause, dot, pause nuke. You have to know what is going on or you will wind up a hobbit pancake druid. '<br />
<br />
A warrior is the same unless you have the exact same people and do the same fights all the time being a good warrior is a learning experiance. I am not a raid tank but I think I am a good tank even at low level 56. I can do pickup LDoN's with just about any mix and within a couple of mobs we all rock. My normal group is me and my wife's cleric and then what ever we can find to fill the group. I have to adjust how I play depending on who we add to the group. <br />
<br />
In my mind there is a ton more than HP/AC to being a good tank. and as a Druid healer in BoT and other zones I can tell you I have had some high HP tanks that sucked and some low HP tanks that rocked.</div></div><hr />

It's everyone else but you.<br />
<br />
The entire point of a good raid is to minimize the effort of what a Warrior has to do because that way it also minimizes what is likely to go wrong.  If your raid requires warrior constantly going through loops, then you're already having too much problems.  It's far more preferable to just have a warrior with auto attack on with solid aggro (and this is what happens in 99% of encounters anyway) until either the mob or the warrior dies.<br />
<br />
Outside of TZ I can think of no bosses where a Warrior needs to actually pay attention to what's happening (aside from calling DI falling, but anyone can do that).  FD procs are just a wakeup call and hitting /stand after it happens isn't exactly rocket science.  Hitting Furious when you're low is, at best, just a reflex test.  Last night I tanked Tqiv Araxt the Enraged who seems to be the first mob in GoD that actually does good DPS and I died before I can hit defensive after Furious runs out.  I'd rather trust my clerics (obviously they messed up this time) to keep me alive then counting on hitting a hotkey on a mob that kills an undisced warrior in 3-4 seconds.  Anything else I've ran into GoD so far (and from before) can be tanked undisced so while it'll be cool I can make up for clerics' mistakes, seeing my guild has 5 tanks that can tank just about anything up to Tqiv Araxt I'm not going to lose sleep trying to save myself.<br />
<br />
For a warrior that's tanking, doing less is doing more.  The less you have to do, the less likely anything will go wrong at all, and the more everyone else can do.  A DBoW + EoE with 2 Anger 3 warrior can easily hold aggro the entire time on any uber that doesn't have significant anti-aggro issues, and needs to do nothing more than hitting auto attack and call out DI falls.  And that's the kind of fight your raid wants.  The only way that will ever change is if they put mobs with many crippling debuffs that are not curable but the current EQ fights simply do not go like that, minus TZ (who has 3 strong debuffs which is why it helps to know what to dispel).<br />
<br />
Playing a good Warrior requires skill, but being a good tank does not.  There's a subtle difference between the two but the distinction is important.  A Warrior does a lot when not tanking, but once you get the aggro from a mob, it's just auto-attack and afk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are times when highest hp/ac isn't the best choice, if one of the lower hp/ac tanks has more shielding, better reflexes, better aggro weapons, uses 2h instead of 1h, has different/better AAs for tanking said encounter, has better resists, pays attention more (it may not be rocket science, but there is definately something to how fast you can react when you're tanking).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typically the tanks with the highest hp/ac have weapon combinations for all occasions, the highest shielding/avoidance, the highest resistance, and the most AA (unless your loot system rewards lazy players).<br />
<br />
This is a function of high end loot having all of the above and a result of every warrior wanting a good weapon combination for different occasions. At least in my guild, all of the warriors with Darkblade dual wield combinations have a Blade of War and the top geared warriors are top in every category.</div></div><hr />

Some augged for ac, some aug for hp, some go down the middle.  Some will choose a shielding armor over a slightly-better-but-without-shielding armor.  Not everyone has the same shielding, not everyone has the same weapon combination.  Your guild has been farming time already, so you guys all have about the same in those fields, but I'd bet that once you start getting GoD weapon drops, who has what weapon will mean something.<br />

For the record, (and you also know this...), we're on DKP...it rewards attendance...so the people with the most loot are not necessarily the best tanks.</div></div><hr />

I was the MT.  Honestly, Reparm relies more on healing skill than tanking skill, but I will recap what I did:<br />
<br />
1. Positioned myself in the pull spot so I will be closer to the MOB than the clerics.<br />
2. Tagged him on incoming with a long range bow/arrow combination.  I fletch my own  magic arrows btw.<br />
3. Hit Furious right before he gets in melee range.  It's only a 12 second window so timing has to be pretty good.<br />
4. Used Incite while Furious is up.<br />
5. Hit auto attack. weeeee~<br />
6. Started backing him up slowly.<br />
7. Hit Defensive as soon as Furious dropped.<br />
8. Called for ATTACK/ASSIST<br />
9. Now the fun begins because of his knockback, but I got him in the corner.<br />
10. Switched to external view (do this for all corner MOBs).<br />
11. Announced when/if DI has fired.<br />
12. Oh, I hit slam as it popped just to get that extra 0.5 DPS in. heh<br />
13. Announced when Defensive drops to prepare the guild for a MT switch (didn't need one this fight tho).<br />
14. As Reparm approaches 10%, I stopped auto-attacking and saved endurance for an Incite.<br />
15. Incite on ENRAGED and as many times as I can after that.<br />
16. Auto-attack and Slam when ENRAGED drops.<br />
<br />
Any monkey can do this, np~<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's room for improvement, but tanking isn't as trivial as some people think it is.  This worked for me and I maintained aggro the whole fight.</div></div><hr />

The reason I use external view is once the MOB is cornered, it's hard to tell if he is facing you or out to the raid.  It takes a few seconds to notice when he isn't hitting you anymore, but if you can see him turn, you can react quicker (Taunt, Incite, AE Taunt, Snare Item, etc.).</div></div><hr />

If I had a monkey smart enough to be a good warrior/tank, then<br />
1. I'd be rich.<br />
2. I wouldn't let him fiddle away his time playing EQ, heh.<br />
<br />
Finally, tanking is not rocket science, and it's not brain surgery. But it is sort of like rocket surgery.</div></div><hr />

Not meaning to criticize, but bashing/kicking is a horrible proposition in high DPS mobs.<br />
<br />
The aggro increase is minimal, but the increased % of riposte is not worth it.<br />
<br />
I personally mostly agree with Brodda, in that there are a fair few good players that can be great at any class in game within a few minutes of playing, and some players that are utterly hopeless but you have along as warm bodies.<br />
<br />
I never met someone who I would consider amazing at their class yet could not play another class in a raid setting at a very good level.</div></div><hr />

My Buffed hp is around 9700 and my buffed ac is around 1600. We are elemental guild.<br />
I find that while it is necessary to have High HP/AC, it's critical to have the experience.<br />
Most folks, non-warrior, seem to think that tanking is mindless work, well they are full of crap! Ya gotta know when to engage, when to arrow the incoming boss, when to fire off yer taunts and incite, based on mob and gear yer usin, ya gotta be able to dearg that badass into the corner or the battle spot when he gets loose. There are myriad things a warrior must know to tank effectively.<br />
You will see many warriors with high HP/AC that suck when tanking simply because they don't know the intracacies of Boss Mob tanking.</div></div><hr />

I am not in a Raiding guild therefore, I am a pickup tank (sucks but someone has to do it) I have gotten so many compliments about how I break mez correctly how I hold aggro. Heck I had a rogue fall over the other night because i was turning the mob and told her to stand with the pets that the mob would be there after pull and facing me not her.<br />
<br />
NO our job is not overly hard but then again none of the jobs in EQ are overly hard. <br />
<br />
YES there is a difference between someone who knows their class and does the research and spends the time and energy learning how to play correctly and the shmuck that rolls up a toon or e-bays it and thinks they can play.</div></div><hr />

HP/AC isnt all you need <br />
heres the order it should be IMO<br />
(1)awareness. Most Guild have a MA who is Always MA becouse thay Geard there MA to do his job but if not then thay look at there differnt SA's witch your gonna pick the guy who is waiting for assist call but on every mob and knows wth hes doin =)<br />
(2)AA. If the person has all of his offenive and defenive ablitys hes gonna have more hps get hit for less and less offten and hold argo decent just from aa points<br />
(3)Argo Weapons. a war with lets say BoC/BF would hold argo better then the guy with 1 BoC and a Furious Bash Sheild<br />
(4)AC/HP. Reason i say its AC befor HP is becouse some warriors Cheat thay get tons of HP gear neglecting there ac totly, so the war with 8.5k hps with 2kish ac would be better then the war with 8.5khp and only 1500 ac</div></div><hr />

<br />
the leader can only talk so fast and give so many instructions to the guild. to a large extent he is relying on the fact that most of the raid party is already familar with the encounter and doesnt need any instruction at all. but there are usually exceptions often many especially if its a relatively new encounter. does the mob ae? is it frontal only or all around? is the ae a powerful dd? is it a manna tap? what is the range of the manna tap? is the proc a long acting stun or worse yet a fear? if there are many of these things going on it will be difficult to educate the entire raid to compensate for these things. the leader should be aware of these things and be explaining to the guild everything they need to know and answering their questions.<br />
<br />
but he doesnt sufficiently explain these things to the raid and the healing chain gets dispersed by a fear or a manna tap because they are standing too close to the mob. maybe the tank switch splats a few people because the secondary tank gets stunned right on the tank switch and cannot move or use a /disc until the stun wears off. result is the raid is forced to use their heads to recover from a few unexpected dead raidmembers. and how come the leader didnt fully explain all this before the encounter? because he was too busy discussing tanking order and healing chain order which could have just as easily if not better been done by the tanks and healers in their own chat channels that dont spam the raid channel.<br />
<br />
talking is a skill. a good guild knows how in a reasonable amount of time to explain everything to the raid they need to know. a poor guild does not. similarly a skilled mt makes good use of /rsay hotkeys. a poor one does not. a skilled healing chain makes good use of the  healer channel communication and hotkeys. a poor one does not. a skilled raid allows the tanks to speak into the healing chain channel to let them know quickly who is getting agrod. a poor one password protects the healing channel (like my old guild) so that the clerics never know when defensive goes down or when mister mt just got debuffed. (dont tell me they would know if they only turned off their crit hits so they arent spammed so much. a good guild trains them on such matters but a poor leader is so hung up on micromanaging tank order he has no time to teach his guild such things.)<br />
<br />
to sum it up. the word is &quot;delegate&quot; .. as in &quot;delegate authority to as many as possible&quot;. it makes for a happier guild too where eveyone feels involved in at least something.<br />
<br />
i come from a guild where responsibilties were always given to those with the best stats or the most seniority. new members or less equipped members never got a chance to learn their skills even on the trash mobs leading up to the raid target. if the two bards in the guild couldnt be at the raid then no one had a clue how to pull. if the two top warriors were absent then the ch chain had absolutely no experience in the capabilities of the third tank. they stunk at tank switches too. we had deaths to common trash mobs in bot because the guild didnt know when they walked thru the little lighting thingie that they would agro 3 mobs at once and they walked through it piecemeal instead of all at once and werent prepared for a fight. its frustrating as fourth tank to be killed by a common trash mob add after first going defensive then fortitude at 10 percent and then dying because the healer in my group never cast a heal on me and neither did anyone else.<br />
<br />
delegate authority.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;- Is there ever a time when you would NOT want to build the tank list from a &quot;highest hp/ac to lowest hp/ac&quot; formula?<br />
- Do you think that anybody can pick up a time-equipped 65warrior off ebay and be a better tank than someone playing for 3 years who is only elementally equipped?<br />
<br />
I'm really curious to know...&quot;<br />
<br />
It all depends. There are times when I could see issues when how Raid Leaders designate tanks mainly because of misinformation and misunderstanding the value of HP's and AC - Such as if a raid leader soley looks at HP's and not AC(and sometimes this does happen) in determining a line up. This can work in pre-pop where the caps are reached but beyond that the value of AC cannot be underestimated. Exampl: I can have 200 more AC than another warrior but be side stepped because the other warrior has 100 more hps. Ofcourse not all raid leaders do this.<br />
<br />
That said I do think skill has merit in the entire scheme of things. Quick response rate to raid contingencies, knowing what to do when things do go wrong, using the appropriate discipline for the encounter, whether to use fortitude or furious, evasive or defensive, altering equipment for more AC or more HP, how and when to break mez, etc.. --- are all factors of a skilled warrior vs. a non-skilled warrior. All this assumes ofcourse that the tanks have equally stable ISP's etc(if you have a 12hp/2100AC buffed tank that goes LD every 5 min then that probably isn't going to be your MT even if they have the best AC/HP set up).<br />
<br />
I do believe a melee class is probably more suited to do a line up than someone who has no experience in melee matters(atleast on difficult encounters) -- though sometimes this doesn't always happen.<br />
<br />
I personally would choose a more skilled warrior with inferior equipment over a less skilled warrior up to a point. If the difference between the two is great then equipment will win out unless the better equipped warrior is a complete moron(which can happen). Having experience with the two warriors in the past also plays a huge part in the decision process. If you consistently find the less equipped warrior performing better than the more equipped warrior then it's either skill separating them or a case of the plastic magelo syndrome(The better equiped warrior may not in fact have the stated AC/HP values or all those wonderful augments etc.)</div></div><hr />
