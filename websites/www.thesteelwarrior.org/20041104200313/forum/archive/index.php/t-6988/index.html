<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poohjure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi yall,<br />
<br />
A couple weeks ago I bid on and won EoE for my offhand.  Paired with my BF in main hand I have pretty insane aggro.  <br />
<br />
Now, a few days ago, RZ dropped the BoWar and it was rightfully mine (We award them based on total earned dkp), It was a struggle to decide upon if I would loot the BoWar or not, considering my current 1hs.  After some discussion with my guild, I looted the BoWar and promptly bagged it.  Unfortunately, I will just not use it as much as my EoE/BF (have always been partial to 1hs).<br />
<br />
Now, the arguement is this..I have 2hs aa, and Tactical mastery aa trained so the real quesition is, Which should i use?  Which is of better use?  A few Wars in my guild are support on either side, but I am stuck in the middle, appreciate the input.<br />
<br />
--Pooh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well shit, with those weapons, id duel wield, but thats just me.  you lose like 5AC but make up for it with more HPs and such.  use the 2 1handers for most exp group type things, and the BoW for bosses who repost for shit tons of damage.  that is what i would do anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In your position, I would have passed the BoW. The only thing the BoW has on your current set up is less riposte damage. The 5ac loss is more than made up by the +130hp you get, along with the other stats. BoW will probably result in more DPS though, so you have an excellent DPS weapon that will keep you near the top of the agro list when you are not MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Man, is everyone that gets into EP/Time now a loot whore?<br />
<br />
Rightfully yours or not, fucking pass on an inferior weapon, jesus christ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have an EoE you'll be wielding a DBotW shortly; there's no reason to even bother with the BoW.  Some poor warrior below you could've used it.<br />
<br />
Stick with the dual wield combo for aggro when tanking, 2h when you're not the main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BF EoE = much better hate, more stats, slightly more dps (depending on AAs)<br />
BoW  = less ripostes, slightly more dps(if you have only PB for example)<br />
<br />
I have BF+A3 and EoE+yak right and BoW+anger right now and i use the BoW only when tanking time TZ and quarm.<br />
Also picked up a cheap SEM which is decent offhand dps and low agro in maindhand when u dont want agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have an EoE you'll be wielding a DBotW shortly<br />
<br />
I'll have to call you bullshit on that one :) DBoTW isnt &quot;COMMON&quot;<br />
<br />
If you have a BF, you would have to be crazy to settle for anything else that EoE/JoS/DBoW.<br />
Taking the BoW was a poor choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All over Norrath BoWless warriors let out a cry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there is an elite club for this. Nothing says ELITE like having a BoW bagged. At one time it was epics, but those days are long gone. <br />
<br />
Though you failed to comply with actually using your Blade of War for a short time, you will still be admitted into the club. Again, welcome sir!<br />

ps: this was sarcasm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dindarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How would a BoC/EoE setup compare to BoW? I use a BoW now and my guild is a few more coirnav attempts from Time. I guess it isn't to early to think about it. BF is in a different league than the BoC and I'm not sure if this combo would stack up to a BoW as well. I guess the EoE would be main hand in this situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your DW will provide better taunt obviously, and will rival the dps from the bow once you get aas. I won't chirp in at your character but your loot system sounds fucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stemcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They probably made him loot it because if he didn't it would have gone to the worst warrior there(me). If you guys knew more about our raiding situation, you might think differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sindael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">regardless of who it would go to, i dont see how him having it in the bank does anything for anyone, let alone the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stemcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's not a guild, it's a public raid system( http://www.ecipublic.org ). The raid leader made a guild for people that are dedicated to doing those raids. That is the guild he is talking about.<br />
Sometimes(more than me) he is MT, which would benefit the raid more if he had it than if I did.<br />
<br />
But this isn't an argument of if he should have gotten it, it's if he should use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bohkah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does he not like you or something?  I assume you are going to do Darkblade the same way.  So are you ahead of him on that list since he took BoW? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">grats on bagged BoW !<br />
(yeah, it's really just a big number toy for you now...would have better nabbing a plankton sword just for really big crits )</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's common enough that it sounds like the point system is in his favor and he'll see the first one, which is probably in the next few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This thread is pissing me off. Whoring a BoW? Did it ever occur to you that nobody ELSE wanted it?<br />
<br />
I had an extremely similar situation last night. My guild farmed RZ for 3 months to try to get me a BoW, and it never happened. Since then, we got into time, I now have EoE / BF, same setup as this guy. I'm first in line for our next Darkblade.. first one got semi ninjaed and I don't want to talk about it here.<br />
<br />
Last night while doing a backflag run, the little asshole drops 2 BoWs.<br />
<br />
I took one of them. Am I greedy? Think about that for a minute before you respond. Now, lets look at the situation.<br />
<br />
A level 62 twink wanted one! And would have gotten it if I hadn't taken it. The other one went to a Warrior who is not yet an app to my guild, he's AAing to try to make our requirements. Yes, we gave a BoW to an unguilded warrior. Now was me taking the other one greedy?<br />
<br />
Think for a moment about what someones situation is before you condemn them as a greedy loot whore simply because they are time flagged and loot a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i agree with fulorian.  everyone here is a bit triggerhappy without knowing any of the fine details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, but you're a loot whore too Fulorian :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bah, don't dog the man because he looted a Blade of War.  Just cause he won't be main tanking with it doesn't mean he can't put it to good use.  An unauged Blade of War could be put to uses for things such as Rampage tanking (50ac 175hp weapon...), dps (48/32 is nothing to scoff at), or being second MT in line (just enough hate to stay 2nd, but not overcome the MT).  <br />

We're warriors.  We have 12830283021830 fucking weapons for 12838210319231 different situations.  Don't dog the man!<br />

Can I tag along on your next guild raid?   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;you guys are acting like BoW is rare&quot;<br />
<br />
It was, Im sure they have up'd the drop rate cos we had a good number of kills under our belt before we saw our 1st, and then a few more before getting another 2 on one kill.  Theres a thread somewhere in overlords discussing BoW droprate, and it looks like it was pretty rare for alot of guilds.  Not quite bloodfrenzy rare, but still not at all common.<br />
<br />
Personally I &lt;3 my BoW and wouldn't trade it for a BF/EoE combo.  Once our non BoW'd warriors have Darkblades I might look towards getting one and then an EoE, just hope its not so rare that I have the option.</div></div><hr />
