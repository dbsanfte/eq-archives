Do you mean the Worker Sledgemallet (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=12863)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait wait, we gotta try this.<br />
<br />
Okay, it doesn't work.  Raaj, did you disable the eqitem flag you announced the other day?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nah, the code works fine. the item either isn't in the database or is misspelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aha, figured it out, no space after the first tag.  It's still not in the database apparantly tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What database is it drawing off of? For some reason I was under the impression that it was using lucy data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it comes from a quest in OT, unless you have good faction in OT your going to need a chanter and puppet strings from CT. go read what need to hand in(cant remember been a long time), have chanter tash him puppet string captain(with hand in ready)quickly hand them in while he is indiff to you---walla OT hammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">quickly hand them in while he is indiff to you <br />
<br />
Can't do it indifferent, that's why you need to do the charming.  If the enchanter charms then the Capt is indifferent too you, if you do the charming then the Capt is higher then indiff (amiable) and will take the turn in.  /boggles, no clue wtf I just said really, anyways you need better than indiff to do the turn in (amiable), hence the use of puppet strings...<br />

And its a jade</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Is there any way someone like me with fuckloads of time on my hands can help out in the database process?  I wouldn't mind adding a few items here and there when I'm just sitting around waiting for someone else to post something I can disagree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm just sitting around waiting for someone else to post something I can disagree with <br />

And as someone said, yes you need to do the charming yourself if you want the hammer, indiff (someone elses pet) isn't enough.<br />
If you can, it is best to get a few debuffers to help.  A few from my guild got together to do it, we had a shaman, bard, and tash proc.  3 of us did it and got no resists.  If you can't get that, then at least proc tash, but as someone said they had 5 resists like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Angustus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In the realm of nearly ancient history, my crew was living in HS, killing everything in sight for, erm, way too long.  At one point, we noticed that the scorps outside didn't mind us that much anymore.  Checked out the good folks in OT, and they were our buddies.  HS has an anti-OT faction hit, my guess is that some how it rolled over.  In any case, all of our light based group now has silly OT hammers, a memento of a poorly spent youth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes, it used to roll over.  It was supposed to be fixed tho, unless you did this very recently.</div></div><hr />
