<br />
You who push mobs away from the camp and into a random location away from cleric range. You who just stand still in one spot swinging away at the mob not caring where it's going. You who never learnt to circle-strafe around a mob. You who don't care that the mob is currently 50 feet in the air up on some ledge, while summoning ME and not YOU.<br />
<br />
I HATE YOU!</div></div><hr />

Warriors drowning (Luckily my roomy and I had fish bone earrings and MA and SA while others had to breath). That was exciting with healers jumping in and out of the water to heal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite is seeing a mob standing nearby while fighting a mob.  And watching the people just push it until they get an add.  Or two.  I had a group that did that multiple times in PoV.  <br />
<br />
And you guys are worried about newbs gettin into PoV...hehe already there</div></div><hr />

At least you arent the ranger......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dying from being pushed out of healers range is very annoying... first time I ever had to get angry at my guildies.<br />
<br />
And you gotta love people who push mobs into walls when rangers are your primary source of dps, then wonder why the mobs took so long to die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find pets to be more of a problem than PCs...look Goner+jobober +5 shaman pets are all pushing the mob the same way!</div></div><hr />

Last night where were pullin desert giants...pets where aligned just right to push them away from camp, cleric went out of range for heals shortly thereafter.  ARGH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing worse than pushers is when you try to reposition the mob and nobody will work with you.  You back off, they keep pounding away on it so it turns on one of them, and keeps getting pushed.  The fact that sometimes that results in one of them getting pasted is small consolation.....especially when the ultimate result of the pushing is to knock a mob over a ledge into a group of it's buddies. :)<br />
