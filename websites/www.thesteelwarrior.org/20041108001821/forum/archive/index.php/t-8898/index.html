<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, Fellow Warriorsl,<br />
<br />
I've been looking at the difference between our defensive discipline and our damage mitigation AA's, and I have a question. Do they stack?<br />
<br />
In my case, I have CS3 and PE, which total 12% of damage mitigation. When I use /disc defensive, do I get 45% + 12% mitigation? Or the higher of the two?<br />
<br />
I searched and couldn't find an answer. If there's an obvious thread, just point me there.<br />
<br />
Gracias!</div></div><hr />

Hi Lathen,<br />
<br />
AA Mitigation is a chance to cut down the damage of a hit that was incoming to you to a lower DI Standing. EI, Max hit 19DI, down to 9DI, for example. Defensive is a &quot;Hard on&quot; ability which definatly takes it down halfway, and furthermore you have the chance of mitigating it down even more, to my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To the best of my knowledge, the two abilities stack: However, CS/ID does not change the DI + DB of a mob: A mob that hits 950 will always hit 950, regardless of AA. Instead, the damage distribution of the mob is altered, such that the mob is less likely to actually hit you for 950, in such a way that the over time value is the appropriate % less.</div></div><hr />
