<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just dinged 65, got 8AA's (run3, regen3, CS1, CA1) and marginal gear (i'm workin on it =P) What do you Ubers suggest as minimum AC, Hp and AA's to tank in GoD zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, it would really depend on where in GoD are we talking about? <br />
1. Natimbi - Qinimi - Riwwi are relatively easy, the mobs hit for 400+ max (Riwwi).<br />
2. Barindu - Ferubi are a bit harder, mobs hit from 500+ to 1k+<br />
3. Vxed - Tipt - Kod`Taz mobs hit 1k+ max<br />
<br />
The recent retuning patch did lower the difficulty level of the mobs, since their ATK rating seems to have been brought down significantly.<br />
<br />
For (1), I'd guess 6 - 7k buffed hp, 1.3 - 1.4k AC is enough<br />
For (2), I'd guess 8k buffed hp, 1.5 - 1.6k AC is enough<br />
For (3), I'd recommend 9k buffed hp, 1.65 - 1.7k AC minimum.<br />
<br />
Btw, I'd advise maxing out your LR5 / ID5 asap, because although they do attack for max dmg a lot less now, you'd still want to avoid or mitigate as much dmg as possible, since Chaos Claws is pretty much almost un-resistable, unless you have very high resists to all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree <br />
<br />
for part 3 i would say i start to help trials in Tipt with 9.8 buffed and all aa maxed still got some fails about Clr's got probs to heal me engough..<br />
<br />
if you have a Chanter with you with a Pet should bee engough but witout pet you got a hig chance to fail on named in T6 about healpower.<br />
<br />
Dont know how it is now, after patch the mobs dont hit now allways with maximum dam. So maybe is easyer now )</div></div><hr />
