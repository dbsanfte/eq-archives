<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Byork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While raiding in PoW tonight, it seemed that I was moving at near bard speed while swimming to targets.<br />
<br />
I mentioned this in /GU and a lot of people seemed to notice this.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wonder if that could have anything to do with the change that removed the stamina penalty from swimming when it was converted over to the endurance system...<br />
Man, with devs trolling the boards now we're NEVER going to be able to keep any secrets from them /cry :D <br />
<br />
EDIT: fixing a smilie of all things :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theres a bug that I've gotten recently a few times - espcially when two boxxing on a single machine... everything runs in super fast mode, like models go faster and everything, everything else warps back because your client is predicitng where stuff is going, and the server is like...<br />
<br />

<br />
