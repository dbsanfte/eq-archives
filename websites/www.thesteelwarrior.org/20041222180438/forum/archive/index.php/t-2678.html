<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry if I missed it but I did do a search and couldn't find any post about this.  <br />
<br />
I am just wondering if anyone has sat down and tried to figure out how often you hit through MOB defense with TM1 TM2 and TM3.<br />
<br />
I just reciently got TM1 and I have noticed a lot more hits when previously I would see many misses from the front. I always have my misses turned on ( hits mode using &quot;miss&quot; only )and I can clearly see an increase of hits from the front but am wondering if anyone has figured out a %.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

But it was something like 3%, 6%, 10% DPS gains from TM.  It's helpful since it ups DPS and doesn't up damage taken, thus helps add aggro some, but it's nothing amazing since you still get hit on ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a 2-4-6 (12 AA) skill increase your damage by 10% is *nothing amazing*.  I wish I can get that kind of returns on Flurry and Raging Flurry, or crits.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery should be the first AA you get for offense, always, unless you're not hitting the mob from front for whatever reasons.</div></div><hr />

It's offensive, and apparently it's pretty good for what it does...but like he did say, you still get hit on ripostes.</div></div><hr />

TM is 2- 3 -4 . (9aa)  There were a few different offensive ones i did before TM.  Ambi / Fero 3 / PB3 / SE3 / TM3.   Its a very nice aa spent imo. You will notice the difference in how much you are htting instead of parry / dodge / block etc .etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synapticus</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10% is not a lot, but then you have to remember if you add up all the other offensive AA's, they really do stack up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ripo damage was lessened shortly after pop came out but I got this skill before that change.  The difference was amazing.  I went from losing aggro on pov mobs to consisently holding aggro if everyone was being reasonable.<br />
<br />
Just to reiterate.  If you take a ripo then you will not hit but you are hit.  With tm, you can hit the mob but still take damage.  The difference was being able to keep agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mbad</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just did TM3, and its great for getting/holding agro. Dunno bout the dps, but after defensive and HP AAs it seemes to be a good way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So to reiterate, tactical mastery 3 does not reduce riposte damage, thats whats commonly believed or tested?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people are reporting that it does stop Enrage ripostes sometimes...but enrage is definitely different than normal ripostes.  Only way to check would be to see how many ripostes you get over a certain amount of time, get TM3, and see if the amount lessens.</div></div><hr />

10% is not a lot, but then you have to remember if you add up all the other offensive AA's, they really do stack up.  Are you kidding me? If this is correct and you can pick up a 10% increase in DPS for 9aa, that is nothing short of amazing. Can anyone confirm that TM3 does increase DPS by 10%?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesnt seem to make a difference what I do, how many AAs I have or weapons I use...my DPS averages out at 100 or so on PoP mobs.  Im begining to wonder if Offensive AAs are worth it.  I did not notice a difference with fero3 tm3 pb3(with my 2hander) Ambi, etc.  Think I'll go back and do planar power and few others that i ignored.<br />

Maybe my parser is off, using the latest EQCompanion.</div></div><hr />
