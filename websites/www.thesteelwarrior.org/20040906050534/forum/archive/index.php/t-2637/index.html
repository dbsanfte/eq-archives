<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if this has been mentioned but I think it would be a decent thing to implement body target shots for warriors.  Similar to the engineer in final fantasy tactics, would look alittle like this.<br />
<br />
Leg Shot - 30% chance to snare target<br />
<br />
Arm Shot - 30% chance to slow target 50%<br />
<br />
Body Shot - 30% chance to decrease targets AC<br />
<br />
Head Shot - 30% chance to lower targets MR<br />
<br />
Maybe not those specificly but something close.<br />
<br />
Ok the %'s are prob way high, but you guys get the picture, something like that I would like to see.  Lemme know your thoughts and know if I'm a moron or not.<br />
<br />
Since we are &quot;supposed&quot; to be the masters of armed combat!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Add 30% to CH and you can go with an all warrior group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok lets say only 1 effect of this type can be on a target at a time, to prevent any warrior stacking.  Atleast I thought it was a good idea heh.<br />
<br />
Zan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those are good ideas, I've seen them or something like them in some of the earlier class balancing threads, and I still like them.  And they're all snares/slows/debuffs, so they'd help with aggro too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few other ideas from this thread can be merged with this idea.<br />
And give us a series of very interesting skills.<br />
<br />
Few things that are missing in the original idea, imo:<br />
<br />
- a restriction (simply having them not stack isnt a good restriction, Warrior stacking isnt something we Dont want)<br />
- a bit more complexity behind them. Simply clicking the skill you want, and hope for a success (Taunt, Kick, Disarm)... well, im sure we're all a bit tired of those.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about this sort of skill system? :<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Art of War has improved greatly since the apparition of the Plane of Knowledge.<br />
Warrior Guild Masters accross the world have been able to exchange their experiences, creating a whole new form of Art.<br />
Soon enough, these masters have started teaching the basics of the new art to their disciples. Teaching them known weak spots, and ways of exploiting them.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Weak spots are learnt through out the levels:<br />
<br />
Level 20 - Body Shot<br />
Level 35 - Arm Shot<br />
Level 45 - Leg Shot<br />
Level 55 - Head Shot<br />
<br />
Among these Weak spots, different attacks can be used to cripple the enemy. These attacks are learnt throughout levels as well.<br />
<br />
WeakSpot<br />
level - name - (action required,chance of success) [Angle from mob] --&gt; effect<br />
<br />
Body Shot<br />
Level 20 - Rib Jab - (Pierce,30%) --&gt; Double Damage + Aggro<br />
Level 30 - Chest Bruise - (Crush,30%) --&gt; Double Damage + Aggro<br />
Level 50 - Chest Impact - (Bash,50%) --&gt; Double Damage + KnockBack/Stun<br />
Level 60 - Gut Slash - (Slash,40%) --&gt; 300 Damage + DoT<br />
Level 65 - Dirty Strike - (Taunt,100%) [Back] --&gt; Taunt + Aggro<br />
<br />
Arm Shot<br />
Level 35 - Vein Slit - (Slash,70%) --&gt; DoT<br />
Level 40 - Arm Lock - (Disarm,70%) [Back] --&gt; Disarm + 100 damage + Stun<br />
Level 59 - Hand Crush (Crush,30%) --&gt; Attk Reduction<br />
Level 62 - Arm Sprain (Taunt,40%) --&gt; Slow<br />
<br />
Leg Shot<br />
level 45 - Trip - (Kick,90%) --&gt; Feign Death + Stun, on fleeing mob<br />
level 52 - Tendon Slice - (Slash,30%) [Back] --&gt; Snare<br />
level 59 - Hip Shot - (Archery,30%) --&gt; Snare + DoT<br />
Level 63 - Knee Crush - (Crush,30%) --&gt; Root<br />
<br />
Head Shot<br />
level 55 - Eye Poke - (Taunt,40%) [Front] --&gt; Blind + Stun<br />
level 60 - Neck Snap - (Taunt,20%) [Back] --&gt; 30,000 damage to mobs level 45 and under.<br />
level 61 - Memory Lapse - (Bash,60%) --&gt; Blur<br />
level 64 - Skull Shatter - (Crush,30%) --&gt; Long Stun<br />
<br />
<br />
This is how it works:<br />
<br />
You can concentrate yourself upon a certain weak spot. (Press one of the 4 WeakSpot skills).<br />
During this time, you can deal certain attacks on that weak spot.<br />
Different attacks demand different actions, to be executed. And there is a chance of success for each of these actions.<br />
<br />
Each WeakSpot skill will last 3 seconds, and have a 30 second reuse.<br />
All the weakspot timers are linked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
you want to snare a mob. So you have to slice it's tendon.<br />
<br />
Equip a slashing weapon, get behind the mob, click Leg Shot.<br />
You then have a 30% chance of snaring the mob for each Slash, during 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
None of the effects would be resistable. This isnt magic ;).<br />
You literally cut the mob's tendon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That is EXACTLY what I was trying to convey somehow.  To me that would be awesome upgrade for warriors.  To powerful some may say?  Bah I say to them, we are warriors the masters of combat we should be able to literally cripple the enemy in a tactical way!<br />
<br />
Zan<br />
<br />
10pp says we get something like this, monks get same thing aka pressure points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Every upgrade warriors get, should be followed pretty closely by Monks and Rogues.<br />
<br />
Would be nice seeing monks get something like this too...<br />
<br />
and rogues already have such a thing (Poison) ;)... probably needs an upgrade though.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I don't see how people could say this is too overpowering....<br />
Knights get 3 times more, and dont have to wait 30 secs to recast.<br />
But there's always those people that believe that a change to the Warrior class, no matter what, would be overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rogue poison, not to hijack, really needs an upgrade.  I never see Rogues using it any more, and its an integral part of their storyline as a class.  <br />
<br />
Rogues are dirty little scoundrels.  They should be poisoning ppl :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree totally with the ideas posted in this thread.  Warriors were called the masters of melee combat by SOE.  We should be given abilities like these to help us keep agro.  I am a lvl 56 war and honestly sometimes have trouble keeping agro with 2 procing weapons.  I also have trouble getting groups.  Either its our abilities or the other classes are more desirable and have better taunt.  I think they need to make warriors better because other classes would not enjoy being nerfed.  If they gave us abilities like this then we would be getting agro much easier and be back on the top of the list as tanks instead of 3rd or lower.  My friend plays a monk and I get on his account sometimes and monks are much better off than warriors with their mend ability and feign death and they can also kick for 70+.  They also hit much faster with the same amount of item haste imho.  Warriors hit slower than monks and rogues, kick for around 10-30, while rogues can BS for atleast 200+ by 55+ and monks can kick for 70+ or 100+ when using thunder kick discipline with a reuse time of only 3 minutes.  The pure melee classes are out meleed by the hybrid classes, when they should be out meleed by the pure melee classes.  Its time for SOE to pay attention to us pure melees (especially warriors) and make some changes.  We pay them a good amount every month so why dont they do something with our money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rogue poisons received a substantial upgrade recently, changing them from a one-time use per shot ability to a self-buff proc.  Much better now.</div></div><hr />
