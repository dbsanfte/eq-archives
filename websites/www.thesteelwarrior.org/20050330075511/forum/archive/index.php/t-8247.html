Group was me, druid, cleric, mage, beastlord, bard and worked very well.<br />
<br />
2nd attempt was me, druid, cleric, enchaner, mage, necro and we made it to the last room in under 40 minutes. Pulled each of the 9 stonemites and had the pets take rampage while the casters stayed out of range. Got to the 9th one, med to full and I pulled it up onto the ledge, we killed it and boss popped. I immediately got agro and started tanking it w/stonewall. The problem we ran into is even with 2 pets, necro dots, and enchanter and mage nuking while the cleric and druid kept me up, it seemed like we weren't putting a dent in it? Got it down to ~70% before everyone was lom.<br />
<br />
Now I didn't have furious up to begin the fight, would that have made enough of a difference? I want to say the boss has around 75k hp? Sucks that he isn't slowable :(<br />

I haven't done the trial version, so I haven't bothered with the boss mob yet...is it possible that either it needs to be pulled with annul magic (it is possible for an unslowable mob to be hasted, afaik)?  Was it crippled?  How much damage were you taking on average hit?  It's possible evasive might have been better.  It looks like you could use some more defensive AA, also, I believe CS3 is recommended before LR1 since I believe CA3/CS3 give a much bigger boost compared to LR5/ID5 (although I'm not 100% on that).<br />
<br />
Another suggestion, if the mob is stunnable (via cleric stun, druid stun, etc.) that can be as good (or better than) a heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll be silly and ask if there was any change their mana regen then?  As in, did kei poof or something?  I suppose haste (including pet haste), could've been an issue...but I wouldn't think a group that can get from front door to the boss in about 40 minutes should've had such a difficult time on the boss mob after medding to full.  I guess I just like to rule out the simple explanations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keizer Soze</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've killed him with just 4 people before, myself playing the warrior and cleric and a friend playing his rogue and shaman.  First time we did it I was right at 8k hp buffed up, so you are ok there.   We never went below half mana from what i can remember, so not sure why your group went OOM.   You should have had plenty of DPS though, not sure why it didn't work.  One thing you can try if you didn't already is have 2 main healers rotating their big heals on you during the fight.  Also, you probably want to start out with Furious and use evasive on him instead of stonewall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda surprising to me that the boss gave you that much trouble.  I tanked this trial not but a few days ago.  IMO the 9 stonemites are harder than the boss.  I don't believe the boss rampages and he seemed to have LESS hp than the 9 stonemites.  My group consisted of ENC MAG BRD CLR WAR BST and the boss was extremely trivial, we did have a problem with one or two of the 9 stonemites though, them things are hoss.<br />
<br />
The CLR was easily able to keep me up with little trouble and had mana to spare afterwards.  I've got full defensive AA, 6605 unbuffed hp, 1495 unbuffed ac.</div></div><hr />

Been a while since i delt with this but should have been pretty easy with the dps listed.<br />

when I did it, it was a tad long, but the hardest was keep mite out of water.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of ugly in terms of the warp the mob needs to do to make it, but it's possible, and takes a lot of the sting out of positioning. You'll need smart folks to keep him up there, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were all on the ledge, and cleric was on one of the pipes. Didn't have any issues keeping him positioned.</div></div><hr />

I did enough DPS to drop him quite abit with just stonewall on, before I had people send pets in or start nuking.<br />

I think you experienced a wierd fluke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How'd you manage that?  You invis/pac past stuff?  <br />
<br />
As for the boss, all I can figure is your nukers weren't landing their spells.  We dropped the boss in under 3 minutes if I remember right and we didn't have an uber dps group.<br />
<br />
The CLR was easily able to keep me up with little trouble and had mana to spare afterwards. I've got full defensive AA, 6605 unbuffed hp, 1495 unbuffed ac.<br />
<br />
Interesting, my cleric CH'ed but had to use holy light some as well to keep me up and i'm at about 7k unbuffed hp and 1550 or so unbuffed AC.  Some of the 9 minis were tough too as well as trash along the way near the back.  Did you switch to a 2 hander to avoid riposte dmg spikes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saniri</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trial is prety easy if you invis pacify to the NPC. Though clearing is recommended :). after that invis pass through the Nocs, they run on low HP and just suck. none of them see invis. <br />
<br />
Once in stonemites room, get everyone lev and run to the back ledge, it is tricky to get up there with laggy computers but after a bit of running around you will figure it out. have healers/casters sit way in the back at wall while tank pulls at the edge that is towards the entrance of the room. Make sure tank pulls it because mites warp and can eat your puller fast if you not too quick to grab agro. They all come single so dont need fancy pulling.<br />
<br />
Ledge has enough room to position your mob, your melees on mob's ass and your healers still out of Rampage range, just work your way through the 8 mites which are definitely harder than the boss. <br />
<br />
Before last mite, med up and than pull it, kill it and you will see boss running around crazily on the floor, pull it. Furious and than evasive and you prety much done with the trial. <br />
<br />
<br />
When i did it last time my group did not had any KEI or haste and only had a rogue for DPS and we still dropped him before Evasve wore off so i would just think you guys had bad luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fought to whatshername and hailed, invised pass some undead, killed a couple golems, pac'd the 1 undead on the sewer ledge, swam down, invised up, and ran straight to boss room. The reason we went so fast was because no named spawned on the way and we didn't feel like clearing rooms to see if any would spawn later.<br />
<br />
If the 9 stonemites are harder than the boss then I'm going to bet spells were not landing. I'll try evasive next time too, plus I should have CS3, and more LR aa's by that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">damn, the nocs are some of the hardest hitters too.  Wish we'd thought to see if we could simply invis past them.  Good to know... heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first trial was kinda dissapointing for my usual group.  We thought we'd just mow right through it, but ended up wiping twice before winning.  <br />
<br />
On the first failure, I was unable to get the named up on the ledge as I had done on all the previous mites, and he had no problem hitting me through furious since he was techinically below me.  Due to a miscommunication, the shaman tried to heal me and after I dropped, the boss ate the group. <br />
<br />
Second time was actually strange.  The cleric was sitting on the very last mite and got taken out damn quick, so we had a some downtime before we engaged the boss.  This whole time the boss is flying around the room, but eventually he buffed himself with something, I didnt catch the message and I had logging off at the time so I couldnt go back to see what it was.  Apparently it was crazy haste or something because by the time the cleric got back mana and I pulled, he stunned me in the water on the pull and slaughtered me before stun wore off.  I was surprised at how fast he was hitting, I kick myself for not catching that buff and dispelling it.  We hadnt seen the self buff thing before that attempt and havent seen it since.  I guess you shouldnt leave him up for a long time like we did hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye that has been my experience as well....Payn you had some weird mojo going on with your encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Made our second attempt at this last night. Both times we tanked the mobs in the water in corner of room with casters and healers up on the pipes. First time though the boss spawned on top of the casters and rapidly took out the chanter then cleric .<br />
<br />
   So this time I had them all get down near me when last mob was almost dead. Named still made a beeline for the chanter but I was able to grab aggro fast enough he lived and we won.<br />
<br />
   The problem was that killing the regular Stonemites I was having a terrible time holding aggro. Then on next to last one I finally realized I wasnt seeing any of my proc or rage messages. Seems like the water, which as an ogre I was up to my neck in but didnt need EB for, was actually blocking my own procs. Having such bad aggro was one of the most nerve wracking nights I have had in a long time. With WA5 and 4 aggro procs I usually dont have aggro problems but even the monk was stealing aggro late into the fights when I normally have them solidly locked.<br />
<br />
   Guess next time I will look around the room better and try to find the ledges.  Was still good to finally beat a GoD trial even if GoD does make me feel like a paper tank again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This fight has become pretty trivial for me.  I have done it quite a few times to get guildies flagged.  Basically, I pull the named up onto the ledge and start off with furious.  All Dps starts hitting as soon as I engage.  After furious fades I move to defensive.  With a lower mana cleric, I will use my shield and just hope the others do enough dps.   I haven't failed this fight yet, so it sounds in your case it may have been a fluke.   Just as a side note my normal cleric does pretty much back to back CH except if dmg spikes high one round he will toss a HL.<br />
<br />
I have seen this fight be done with an 8k ish  Paladin successfully, so I am almost positive yours was just a fluke.  Best of Luck on your next try. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pig</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used double shrunk skellie, pulled named myself, went furious, backed into<br />
thr corner on ledge, went defensive, called assist, easy win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arny</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Done this trial a few times solo (4 boxing pally, cleric, ench, necro) first for flag then for spell drops.<br />
<br />
Took me a few tries before I finally figured you could invis all the way to the boss room once out of the water! Doh!<br />
<br />
Leved up onto the shelf running around the room and took up position on the far side from the room entrance (the boss mob won't aggro you here until you pull it).<br />
<br />
Just take your time pulling the stonemites, and med up to full after each and resummon/buff pets (they got eaten most fights). As a precaution I always started each fight with the necro FD, just in case, and mob in target and sent pet in once pally had engaged so pet took the ramp dmg.<br />
<br />
Same on the boss, pull when ready but it sometimes takes a while for him to get up on the ledge and one time it went staight for ench then cleric which would have been a wipe if the nec hadn't been FD'd. Other than that once I have no real problems with him, pally just chain stuns to hold aggro, cleric spammed supernal light (didn't have the GoD fast heal at the time) necro dotted and ench crippled then nuked. Pally at the time had around 7.5khp/1600ac though fully aa'd as are the others, some of the fights were close with the cleric usually oom and a couple I needed to use the necro's lifeburn to finish him off.<br />
<br />
Did him just last week to flag 2 guildies but now with better gear (+2khp and 300ac on the pally plus all chars at ft15) and we didn't even break sweat though having a bard and rogue did help somewhat!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you get your group on the ledge near the stonemite spawn, you can get them to warp up with you, and then Rampage is all sorts of weird.<br />
<br />
I did with with a 4-box crew of ENC-PAL-DRU-ROG, a BST, and myself.<br />
<br />
We all disc'd, and it was like not even 2 minutes to kill because I still had Trueshot up when he died. Maybe 1:30?<br />
<br />
Paladin was like EP/Semi-Time flagged....</div></div><hr />

I  got this flag for that reason  around when GoD first came out. I have tanked the 9 stonemites and they dont hit that hard. You can invis all the way to them once you fight your way up to the drop down.  After you kill the see invis at this spot (if they are up in yours) you can run all the way to the last room. Set up and pull the 9 mobs and then named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinnyy</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done this way to many times!  Starting past Ansharu - When at bottom of ramp before pool, clear all see invis mobs, you may have to paci a few.  Once ghost are cleared in front of the pool, paci any non-see invis mobs that might agro, levi and invis everyone (some may need see invis).  Dive into the pool, swim down and west to the hole in the wall.  Swim up the ramp, there will be a noc there but can't see you.  I usually wait for everyone to get there.  Once there you can make it to the AK room with invis.  There will be one room with a cube and/or a ghost in the pit.  If you hug the walls you will not agro it.  <br />
<br />
Once in the AK room get everyone on the ledge.  Iv'e done it another way where I tanked them on the stairs in the corner but the ledge is more effective because if a caster accidently gets aggro it's easier to get to without worrying about an add from the passageway.  Have casters stand out of ae rampage range. F8 target the stonemites and pull 1 at a time.  I have the cleric HoT me first then I pull with an arrow.  You WILL ALWAYS get a single pull if you target smartly and F8 target the ones closest to you.  Don't pull til HoT hits, Cleric will get agro if you pull and hot lands as the stonemite is comming (that's been 100% all the time it's happened on my expeditions).  Kill all the stonemites xcept the last one.  Med to full.  Pull last stonemite and when stonemite is at 5% tell EVERYONE to stand.  They should not cast anything on you until you call an assist because when the stonemite dies the AK will spawn.  I immediately hit F8 and pop an arrow into it.  I don't bother with anything but defensive disc.  It's hit me before for 1.4k w/o disc and around 6 to 700 with it.   Have a chanter cast runes  if you have one and cleric/ druids manage their heals.  As long as you maintain control of agro and have decent dps you should win.  ALWAYS fight on the ledge (keep levi on everyone).<br />
<br />
I do this alot, normally to backflag guildmates.  I max out at 7.4 - 8.1k hp depending on buffs available and have 63 AA.  Normally balance out group with cleric,shaman,chanter, druid/dps and last spot dps type (two box with a druid).  If it were not for backflagging, I wouldn't even bother since AK has never dropped jack when I've killed it.  You will get a pre-flag though if you don't have it (zone out and go hail High Priest for perma flag) .  I am not EP and have decent gear.  It can be done my friends.<br />
<br />
Also - Waves @ Korak - thanks for all the tips and help bro.  Good to see VP being so kind to you.</div></div><hr />

We pulled all the stonemites up on the ledge, which, as I can see, seems to be the preferred method.  I was standing on the ledge to the left of the entrance at the pipe that comes out of the wall.  I was using an Obsidian Greatblade with anger 2 aug and didnt have any problem with agro.  After we killed the 9 and the Boss popped, I hit it with an arrow and it warped to ledge.  I hit Fortitude so I wouldnt take any damage until slow hit, then defensive when that wore off.  The rest of the group was behind the mob out of Rampage range.  The cleric had about 50% mana after fight.  BL died from Rampage   /shrug.   Buffed I have 8k hp and just over 1500 ac.  It was a little hairy at times, but it was fun.  This is my first post on this board, so I apologize if it is repetitious.</div></div><hr />
