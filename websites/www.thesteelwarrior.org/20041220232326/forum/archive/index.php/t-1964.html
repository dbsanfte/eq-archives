<br />
It made sense to avoid them, but it doesn't seem to be an issue with most tanks.<br />
<br />
If maintaining aggro isn't a problem are these AA's worth it?<br />
Iv'e been racking up AA's but be concerned about spending them on flurry and punishing blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the other Marshall has a point, but I think the advantages out weight the disadvantages:<br />
<br />
XPing it will only be a small rise in reposts and you are probably XPing somewhere where healing will not be a problem. <br />
<br />
Any time you are not the MT you should not be in the defensive arc of the mod, so repost should not factor in.<br />
<br />
I certantly see the point but think most of the time the extra attacks are an advantage.</div></div><hr />

Extra attacks = more agro. Riposte is a risk you take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know Gimmel, I have heard of people that do not use haste because of riposte damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who gives up 60% of their DPS to avoid what amounts to a little over 4% riposte damage is a fool. Sure the more you attack, the greater chance for a riposte, but the rate of ripostes is so low that the additional DPS gained from attacks will always be greaters than the slight increase in riposte damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard of this as well, but I was just making the point that in general the extra ripostes from haste &gt;&gt; that ripostes from offensive AAs. While there are a few people that are willing to lose haste because of riposte, I'd guess that they are the exception. I was just curious if this particular person did without haste.</div></div><hr />

If you want to dish our more DPS then buy offensive AA, follow your heart, sister Tier'dal.</div></div><hr />

Dont buy offensive AAs I am sure other marshal didnt have Amibdexterity or Flurry since that would be BAD. No Instead they spent those points on really usefull AAs like Rampage and Bandage Wound with Warcry! You should do the same!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if exp groups is the situation you're talkin about, but I use that on occasion, with some clerics that I know are infamous for making me go purple.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't really seem a big deal.  DPS adds up fast, giving up all that DPS just so you can avoid a theoretical riposte is kind of counterproductive.</div></div><hr />

But the DPS increase (thus agro increase) IS SO DAMN AMAZING<br />

Ok i may get 1% more ripostes. But i just upped my DPS by 40%<br />

<br />
This is one attack round, with a flurry:<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.nexxus.dk/images/gallery/ripostes.jpg<br />
<br />
3 ripostes, 1 dodge.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm way off, but it could be that the first hit in a flurry give the following hits a greater chance of duplicating the mob's defense checks... miss/dodge/parry/riposte.</div></div><hr />

I ususally play an MT role and be more concerned with tanking hard targets and healing effeciency. (Particulrly unslowable mobs)<br />

I WANT those AA's and was looking for more input before making a bad decision.<br />
I like ye advice Gren. Turning off attack would probably work well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I played my warrior, I never had a flurry attack riposted. Even could hit through ENRAGED mobs auto-ripostes with it (flurry). This was back way before Tactical Mastery too, so that wasn't the case.<br />
<br />
Similarly, I logged a 5 man Praetorian Myral kill during Luclin which I tanked from the beginning to the end. Not once did I riposte any one of his flurry attacks. Same with rampage btw, can't riposte a rampage from a mob at least - never bothered testing if warrior AA rampages could be riposted by mobs.<br />
<br />
I don't believe flurries can be riposted at all, neither PC nor NPC ones.</div></div><hr />

Offensive AAs are of course very much worth it. I'd still concentrate on defensive AAs first though. I'm up to nearly 100 AA points and I don't ever plan on being a marshall unless I get a blade of war soon... then I might consider training flurry after Punishing blade and ferocity. In which case if I do get a blade of war, I'll be training all of my offensive AAs before I finish off my defensive ones.</div></div><hr />

Defensive AA's are good but I got them all.<br />

If flurry does not get ripostes, it looks like a good place to start.<br />

<br />
If you show a message after you flurry (makes no sense to me) then the above text shows a mob can riposte a flurry which was just stated they can't... /screams</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would think of it as a reverse outline, where instead of the points becomming more narrowly defined as you went down the page, you start at the individual points and they all work toward the parent subject (The flurry) at the bottom<br />
<br />
 I hope that makes sense. I know what I'm trying to say in my head, but am having a lot of trouble describing it, been a loooong time since I actually had to use any knowledge I learned in school other than some geometry for layouts *LOL*<br />

<br />
The flurry message happens AFTER the flurry, we can see this by the time of the attacks and the message. Also from that log it looks like flurry IS ripostable... which I always though that a PC can NOT riposte a NPC flurry.  Anyone have any logs of you riposting a NPC flurry?<br />
<br />
If it's the same then I don't care but if we CAN'T riposte NPC flurry but they CAN riposte ours then VI has pissed me of once a gain. ( Not like I have flurry just I can't believe this double standard BS on stuch something is stoopid as flurry ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wanna get really pissed off?  The best warrior ramage can only go off once every 7 minutes, and has a range of about 20.    Now go check out mob rampages.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone passing on offensive AA&quot;s due to fearing the miniscule riposte rate of mobs is silly.   Against most 1-2k hitters you will gain far more raw dps than you will take.   You will generalte more aggro, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ONLY thing I was concerned about be the miniscule riposte rate. *LOL*<br />
<br />
As long as it be miniscule its all good.<br />
I do nae care about DPS or aggro as its trivial.<br />
Mana effeciceny is all I be concerned with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it can and may kill you on mob you are trying single tank out of disc. an extra riposte on fennin ro or xegony is nothing to sneeze at but i finally broke down and got them anyways.<br />
<br />
you got to realize agro isnt trivial though, u can check out the wizard thread on this page. i see wizards summoned to mobs all the time. rogues can and do pull agro. the more dps you have the better agro you have, its more of a concern on some mobs than others. ultimately its a tradeoff of agro/more healing.<br />
<br />
most ppl seem to think punishing blade or ferocity are better dps than flurry though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the thing...<br />
<br />
In xp or non-MT situations, it's more dps (actually a decent amount if you got a lot of the aa's)... and the extra ripostes don't matter... the ripostes are VERY miniscule.<br />
<br />
In MT situations, when your DPS goes up, EVERYONE's dps goes up.  So comparing 5 or 10 of your personal dps vs the rare extra riposte is faulty, as your extra dps allows everyone else on the raid to creep their dps up a bit also... so say 5dps on the main tank, in  a fifty  man raid... can add hundreds of DPS to the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Gurunt said. I play a wizard now and the only thing that hinders my dps is the aggro of the tank and you can be sure that there's a big difference in what I can pump out depending on if we have a MT with offensive skills or not.<br />
<br />
Try asking your guild if they are holding back on dps, if the answer is yes then it will exponentially increase the raid dps if you'd get some offensive AA skills :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If ripostes are becoming a problem just stop attacking.  If you're tanking and you died to a riposte (assuming not enrage) then either the healing wasn't good and you probably would've died anyway, or the healing was right but you just happen to be very unlucky and probably would've died anyway in some similarly freak situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just slightly off topic, but something I've been wondering about for a long time:<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever seen a non-melee (i.e. ranged attack, non-melee message) hit riposted/dodged/blocked/parried by a mob?<br />
<br />
If the answer is no, then there's a guaranteed-no-riposte 1h weapon I need to try vs. a prox aggro and/or rooted mob sometime...<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
<br />
BTW: went with ferocity, flurrys and crits for offensive DPS first personally, seemed like best increase in dps with both 1h and 2h with lowest downside in extra riposte dmg.  Getting all of em (offensive) done for the extra dps is a win imho, even with the increased ripo dmg.  DI chains can help mitigate riposte splatters, but loss of MT aggro is bad bad bad...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the DPS of the MT is irrelevant..if you had a choice of 18/20 weaps with no procs, or 5/20 with EB procs, i know which i would choose.<br />
<br />
and if you are worried about agro, go camp some snare glands ;p<br />
<br />
the only offensive AA's i ever plan on getting in the near future is maxing out PB. the other AA's just arent worth the extra chance of ripostes to me since i am my guilds MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-combat fury<br />
-fury of the ages<br />
-ingenuity<br />
-tactical mastery (maybe- assumes an attack thru a riposte can't be riposted...)<br />
and indirectly, stalwart endurance<br />

Probably not a real huge increase in dps, but &quot;free&quot; from a riposte dmg perspective.<br />

<br />
As I understand it, you still take damage from the riposte, but you have a chance of dealing damage too.  So you're gonna take the riposte anyway, TM doesn't change that, just increases your DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also... notice BoW is the end-all-be all weapon (well pre time arguably) for aggro, yet it procs less than BF/boc/HG combo... dps means RELIABLE aggro.<br />
<br />
High reliable dps is better than being dependant on flaky weapon procs.  Eb is a crutch, the less you NEED it to do your job, the better you are at your job.<br />
<br />
The extra 2k riposte you eat a couple times a fight  is easier to deal with than the wizards/clerics/slowers drawing aggro now and then on a 2k hitting mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taliefer</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">grunt, actually on the mobs where riposte matters, i hold agro just fine and dont need to worry about riposte's at all...gotta love the snare glands.<br />
<br />
EB IS a crutch,  just about anything a warrior does for agro is a crutch. they are not likely to give warriors a reliable way to build decent amount of agro.so you look for the best crutch available<br />
<br />
and i guess i should have clarified a bit more, sorry for that...i dual wield while disci is active where the extra ripostes dont matter as much, and then swap to a 2hander. i would also wager that with PB3 youd still take less ripostes than dual wielding. its all about striking a balance, more swings does give you more agro, but also increases the chances of being riposted. just gotta find the happy medium between agro building and eating rips.<br />
<br />
yes, DPS has a slight effect on agro...but not any where near the <br />
amount of procs. take a mob that requires bane for example, can tank seru and emp with just procers fine, or one bane and a procer just fine. and i dont ever recall being near the top of DPS parses(discounting any damage shield) while tanking<br />
<br />
if dps was the most reliable form of agro, you would see warriors using a bunch of the higher end weapons with low agro procs...most of the warriors i know stick with EB weapons with lower ratios for tanking. the blade of war being the obvious exception here. take away the EB proc and do you think youd see as many warriors tanking with it?</div></div><hr />

It (along with SEWS) can hold aggro just fine even if you have some bad luck procing streaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not really DPS that creates most of your aggro in the first place. It is number of swings and type of swings. Take a character with 2 duelwield rusty swords and take him to a mob that requires magic items to do damage to the mob or banes and let him swing at the mob for 1 minute. He will have done 0 damage but he will have very solid aggro on that mob due to the swings themselves and will take a bit to get the mob off him with swings that do damage if he were to stop swinging or with heals and debuffs etc. His swings would provide more than enough aggro to allow for healing and debuffing and others to attack the mob though with rusty weapon delays I wouldn't say anyone couild go all out on the mob :P . Swings alone make up about 85%+ of your meele aggro (Not counting procs) while the actual damage you do makes up for abut 15% on average. The types of swings you attack with also determine aggro. 2 Handed swings have more aggro per swing than one handed weapon swings. The exception of this rule is two handers that do not recieve a twohanded bonus seem to create aggro inbetween one hander aggro and twohander aggro. It is very close to double the aggro on a per swing basis between a 2 hander and a one hander thus a fast 2 hander like a 32 delay BoW actually creates more aggro just thru swings alone than 2 20 delay weopons will, especially when you count in flurry and other aa's that make you swing more since on a per swing basis the aggro is about double when the delay is not.<br />
Very good example of agro based on swings is Seru. We killed Seru using a BoW warrior. If damage was most of the basis for aggro then there is almost 0 chance of that warrior holding aggro over the course of a 45 minute fight (20 people 3 clerics I think) based just on the hate proc alone. Hell if they didn't proc before the first heal/debuff landed they would loose aggro immediately if swings were not the greater portion of your aggro basis and damage was.<br />
Those aa's make more swings and thus more aggro. That is far more important than increasing your chance to take a repost by a miniscule percentage on any given meele round. People who say that getting offensive AA's is bad for a tank need to stop being silly and look at the good effects and the bad and realize increasing a whole raids DPS by 10-20% due to others not having to worry much about aggro is MUCH greater than taking a grand total of maybe 2-3 extra reposts over a 4-5 minute fennin ro fight or whatever mob. Hell the DPS increase to the raid alone will shorten the fight enough that the total number of reposts taken over the course of the fight will almost certainly decrease in total.<br />
<br />
Do you people who say the AA's are bad use a haste item? If so why? Obviously those haste items would be much better on all the other characters since it makes you swing more and thus get reposted more.<br />
Do you get chanter haste when you tank? If so why? Let the chanters save their mana since you obviously don't need this spell on you as it will jsut get you reposted more.<br />
Those are exctly the SAME thing you are talking about with the aa's. More swings = more repostes thus if you are actually getting haste from the chanter and are actually wearing a haste item you are just a hippocrit really. <br />
Any warrior who said &quot;I won't buy the more swings aa's cause I get reposted more even though it would make my aggro 10-15% better &quot; would certainly not pass their probation or be given a probation in my guild or 99% of the higher end guilds I know of.<br />

I used to have a 13/16 mainhand, and 14/17 offhand, both no procs, while tanking back in our early Ssra days. The aggro sucked total ass, my TSBS 53/45 was a TON better aggro. So from my perspective, your theory doesn't hold water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  I used to use 2 fleshgrinders (12/19 160DD) and Windblade (50/44 no proc) blows that combo away both for DPS and aggro despite drastically lower number of swings.  There may be some aggro associated with a swing that is independent of it's damage but it's pretty low.  Now I use BoC/Blackout and while the aggro is pretty good if I get some procs it's horrible without procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Notice how he said 2handers get more aggro per swing than 1handers.  I personally think it is a significant amount higher.  As for the main point of his theory, it's 100% correct.  I tanked a mob that required bane weapons to hit with a Greatstaff of the Four Winds.  41 / 31 with a minor dd proc.  I held aggro easily, and it sure as hell wasn't from the proc.  Just swinging at the mob is very significant aggro, at least it is for 2handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If that's the case then it must be only swings that hit because I see a very large difference between the amount of aggro I get with a good string of hits (even without a proc) vs a string of misses.  This is especially noticeable with a 2 hander.  Overal the aggro is fairly good due to DPS but if you get say 3 or 4 straight rounds of misses you're probably going to lose aggro.  If just the swing itself made up the majority of the aggro then it shouldn't matter much whether you hit or miss.<br />
<br />
Also notice that on mobs that require bane weapons, a miss is not the same as a hit which the mob is immune to.  I would speculate that a hit that a mob is immune to generates the same aggro as if it had landed for normal damage.  It seems to work that way for spells and procs so I don't see why it would be different for bane mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been stated before that when tanking a mob that requires bane, if you are using a non bane dmg weapon you still do damage to the mob (creating aggro) but the mob is iummune to that type of damage so it doesn't lower his life.  Its hard to explain but you do damage in the aggro sense but not in respects to lowering the mobs life.  I have experienced this myself tanking seru before I had a bane weapon when our MT at the time died and I had to step in.  I'm pretty sure just swinging the weapon gives very minimal aggro, if any.  As for 2hers, the more dmg you do the more aggro you have, hence why the offensive aa's are worth it, even though you may take an extra riposte here or there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
More reliable way is to grab a fine steel weapon,  and same delay weapon with a good ratio (and preferably no proc, certainly no aggro proc) and see how aggro hols up.<br />
<br />
Or hit Paw and get a gnoll hide lariat or two (nice stun proc, uber 3/20 ratio)  and MT with those for a day.</div></div><hr />
