<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eintare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need advice from the pros.  Here is my profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=901340) .<br />
<br />
As  you can see, I wield a Greatstaff of Thunder.  I am thinking of getting these weapons:<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45056) <br />
Ancient Cursed Summoner's Crook (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45052) <br />
<br />
My question is, do you guys think I will be able to keep aggro with those weapons as well as with the Greatstaff of Thunder?  I always play with a level 63 rogue.  Most of the time she does not have to evade when I am wielding the GoT.<br />
<br />
I am not in a guild and I don't play in PoP.  I know that my upgrades would come from LDoN or the bazaar.  If you guys need more information to answer this question, let me know.  Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Is this the correct warrior message board to post on?  I put this post on the ezboard one and someone mentioned that it is not used anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would just put an anger augment on the GSoT and call it good. Save your adventure points for armor or other augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those weapons would be a nice upgrade, however unless you have the points to fully augment them right away, I doubt they would hold agro as well as your GSoT. However, I have not used them, so i do not know for sure.<br />
<br />
If all you want is to make sure you  have solid agro, slap an anger 2 aug on that GSoT and be happy while you upgrade armor.  If you are wanting to upgrade your weapons, get the combo you listed and aug them as soon as possible. Just keep the GSoT in case you have any trouble holding agro until you get the augs.<br />
<br />
In specific answer to your questions. 1) I doubt you would hold agro with those 2 weapons as well as GSoT holds agro without any augs. After you auged the LDoN weapons (both with Anger proc and damage aug) you would be fine. 2) Yes, this was the right Board to post on. Welcome to The Steel Warrior.</div></div><hr />
