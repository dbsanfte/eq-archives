Well, actually i've heard that because 60 is such a short level there is some kind of bug and AAs go faster. Dunno, probably lies, but i've known people that stayed at 60 for AAs thinking they would get them faster. But heh, go with levels. Oh, and...Mr. GM really needs to work on your name *evil grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranakor</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fairly sure xp was faster in pov at 60 then at highter levels (that was before the xp patches so dunno now if killing yellow+ is worth it so that might not apply) but as i understand it AA is a fixed amount of xp that doesn't change with level (example if it is 1million then at lv 50 it is 1 million and at 65 it still is 1 million) but since the patch a while ago that made it so killing highter blues / black yellow+ was more rewarding you would get more xp from those kill so even tho there is still same xp needed per AA at all level you might get more xp per kill at 60 then at 65 in say pov where mob go from yellow/red to blue i think only stuff that decide how much xp you get per kill is the level of the mob (X xp for a certain level fixed in the whole game) * the zone modifier and then a % boost if it is close to your level in blue or + (the highter in cons the highter the boost) <br />
<br />
ps absolutely not sure about all that it is only from stuff i have read and i have tested none of that (even tho AA at 60 seemed a whole lot faster then at 65 at same spots ) just posted all the rest because might aswell continue this thread to have a final answer on how xp works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm looking for someone to fill a slot in a group I always do /who all 65 lfg first.  If that doesn't fill it then I go down the levels.  If there are several people in the zone lfg of the same class, the highest one will almost always get the group.  65 doesn't always = better player but if you are playing with strangers it is the only indication you have other than guild tag about how good the person is likely to be.  <br />
<br />
Levels help with resists and you get HPs every level as well as a raise in your max stats.  I THINK you get on new defensive and offensive tables at 65 but I don't know... I sorta remember reading that somewhere. Even without the caster reason of wanting the next set of spells I would say level &gt; AA in general.  Only exception that I know of is Cani5 for shaman - that changes things for them SO much that a lot of them get it asap then use it to get the levels.  If warriors have an ability like that then maybe it would be worth doing AA... if not then I would recommend levels.  If nothing else it will get you into groups more easily to work on the AAs with.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you don't already have the flags, 62 opens two more zones for you - HoH and BoT.  BoT is one of the main XP zones for pickup groups.  Unless you love PoV, I would recommend getting the levels to be able to see more places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never understood this thing about people believing AAs come faster at 60. A lot of people in my guild believe this too, and I believe it's on of the things that's been holding us back.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just checked EQRankings, and with 2 exceptions that both appear to represent corrupted profiles, at least the top 2000 AA gatherers are all level 65. If AAs were so good at 60, you'd think at least one would crack the top 2000.<br />
<br />
In a decent HoH group (the best place I can exp), I can get a full AA in just over 2 hours. How fast are these level 60s getting AAs? And how frequently do they get the groups to crunch them out?</div></div><hr />

I however say, it depends on your situation.  Dinging 61 will turn most hunting zones pre-PoP light blue or green.  If you have a good hunting spot (permafrost for example) where you can slaughter quickly and efficiently and want to milk it, go AA.  That said, it is true: levels will be the largest upgrade to your character for exp spent.</div></div><hr />

Get part way into 65... turn on teh 90% AA and roll on!</div></div><hr />

There's no right or wrong way to advance your character. If the only time that you xp is in pickup groups, you'll probably want lvls first for reasons mentioned above and in a million other &quot;xp or aaxp&quot; posts (higher lvl = easier lfg). I haven't had to LFG with my warrior yet, fortunately I've been hunting with the same set of 8 or 9 friends since lvl 13ish. We're all taking a break at 60 to grind some aaxp, hang out in some underused dungeons, upgrade our gear slightly, polish off some epics, and fill our bank accounts.....because its simply what we want to do. Practical? Who cares. We're having fun =) And in the end having fun is all that really matters. We're not going away, and I don't think EQ is either...the REALLY high-level content will still be there when we all get there =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a group with players lower level than I am, they DO get more AA % per kill than I do (presumably because the difference between their level and the mob's level is smaller, therefore they get a bigger bonus).  Unfortunately, they also drain on the group's resources and ultimately lower our kills/hour rate when compared to a character of higher level.<br />
<br />
So, if gathering AAs as fast as possible is your plan, then (assuming that you can get in the same groups/hunting zones) you'll pick them up faster if you are lower level.<br />
<br />
However, level is more important to your character's overall ability than a few AAs (HPs, resists, damage, aggro, etc...).  Although your toon will be getting AAs faster, you'll be less effective in your groups and on raids.  So essentially, if you stay at a lower level, you'll be gimping your character while you do that.  And people understand this... a level 65 LFG warrior will be picked before a level 63 almost universally.<br />
<br />
I normally get an AA every hour and a half  to two hours when exp hunting.  It is my experience that the benefits of being higher level (able to hunt in better exp zones, and being a more capable toon in your groups) allows you to more than make up for any loss of &quot;level difference bonus&quot; from gaining levels.  At least for toons that group.  <br />
<br />
I am sure that some people who solo or duo/2 box have valid situations where it is better long term to stay lower level and reel in the AA from mobs that would otherwise turn green/light blue.  But for people that prefer to hunt in groups, it is better to level up, and move to new hunting grounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will pick them up faster ONLY if you are level 60 who has a group of higher levels hanging around to powerlevel you essentially. For most people, that's just not the case, and the end result is a slower accumulation of experience overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I dinged 60 I decided to go AA's, at least up till I got thru trials and got PoV/PoS flaged.  I list that as one of the bigger mistakes I have made.  My mage hit 60 last night, has 8 aa's(was doing aa's on her same time as my warrior), but has had AA's off for awhile now, and will leave them off till 65.  The difference in ability from leveling is much &gt; difference from a similar number of AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzee</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I was in POV inner when I dinged 60, and I noticed at 60 I would get about 1% exp per kill there but I would get 2-3% AA there.  The group I had was solid (7 hours, 1 death).  I don't think I was really getting PLed because group was just a 65 SK, 63 ENC, 61 Rogue, 65 Ranger, and 60 Cleric.  And we were constantly killing, only breaks for afk.  I was thinking though, that I'd just fill in my 6 AA's right now since it's great experience at 60.  Already have 1 done and 70% of second done. Thinking I'd just get those 6 then go to 65.  Besides, who doesn't love RS3. =)</div></div><hr />
