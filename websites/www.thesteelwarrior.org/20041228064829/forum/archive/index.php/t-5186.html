<br />
Had a LDoN end badly last night when the enchanter said &quot;Good luck guys&quot; and disbanded in the middle of the adventure. She was being continually pounded throughout the fight and would pull aggro every time she sat down. I watched her tash, slow and then DOT all within the first 30 seconds of the fight but generally that is not an issue.<br />
<br />
Long story short, I never have problems holding aggro in a group. I have ambi, CF3, Flurry, etc and usually use cord hilted spike driver and the hooked Sho'kar thing in offhand from Veksar if aggro is an issue otherwise, I use Keen Edged cleaver from Ssra augmented with lifetap for more DPS. I used incite on every pull.<br />
<br />
The only explanation I could come up with is that we were all lvl 65 and she was lvl 63... would that make sense? I would hate to have to admit that my aggro sucks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the problem was that she sucked.  Also, leaving during the  middle of an adventure just because you're getting hit (but presumably not dying repeatedly) is completely pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find aggro in LDON to be spotty.  But if your chanter was tashing, slowing and dot'ing within the first 30 seconds of the fight and then sitting, he/she should have expected a certain amount of aggro.  At the very least the chanter should have rooted or boggled before sitting.<br />
<br />
In situations like these I try to work with another one of the group members in order to work out aggro.  If I know one of the group members I'll ask them to root the mob.<br />
<br />
People have to realize that warriors don't have aggro lock.  We can do pretty well -- I keep aggro 95% of the time off all but the stupidest chain-nuking/whatever people -- but expecting aggro lock is like expecting a paladin to be able to disc on a named mob.<br />
<br />
It just sounds like the chanter has grouped with a lot of knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, just silly to sit on a pull.  Not your fault.  Tell the enchanter to root/sit or just don't sit or hell, if its a normal, just don't tash/slow, just chain nuke or get a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they did give warriors agro lock, they just didn't take it away from everyone else.:p <br />
<br />
From what you're saying, she should have skipped the DoT to make up for not sitting. <br />
<br />
My guess is she has a friend with a knight and is used to their level of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kutt</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question though is, would her being 2 levels lower than the rest of us cause her more aggro as well? I thought I read something about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It makes some difference.  Pretty negligible though.</div></div><hr />

Was on a normal adventure a week or so ago with a 62 chanter who was an idiot or ebayed or both.  The fool sat after slowing and tashing every damn time.  Usually he backed up across the room before sitting down which meant that I had to chase the damn mob.  I gave up trying to educate him after the fourth time that I told him not to sit right after casting high aggro spells.</div></div><hr />

Cripes, use glamorous visage on every pull if you suck that bad.  I've had my share of overaggro as an enchanter but after it happens once, it's MY job to figure out how to fix it.  Warriors don't get that much in the way of ideas....you hit taunt, incite, AT, and attack, /shrug.  Not your fault.  If she bitched about it, I'd just be like fine, don't do anything.  Don't even blink at the mob until it's at 40%~</div></div><hr />

The chanter was dot-ing the mob?<br />
<br />
That right there should have been a clue as to how silly your chanter was being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ejryu is right: enc with spell casting subtlety 3 will get really low aggro. I bet that the enc doesn't have it yet (since lvl 63, it seems pretty much evident). So don't worry about an enc chain casting and trying to med right after :b<br />
<br />
Btw, wtf use dots in LDoN when you have nukes. Unless you have max 5 ticks dots, it's really not worth  it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly, I see this all too often.  People can be really sloppy with agro because they are USED to being able to run full bore.<br />
<br />
Incite is FAR from agro lock<br />
<br />
And while it is all well and good to say &quot;well they were a sloppy player and should know better&quot; as a warrior, I still feel that I'm part of the problem, knowing that there are better (if for agro management) people for tanking.<br />
<br />
But then, when the shit hits the fan or tanking for big mobage is needed and I can step up to the plate with warrior skills needed, all that seems to fade into the background (like this weekend when our SK MT dropped doing Hedge quest and I held off 3 baddies with a combination of furious, defensive + throwing taunts and incite around to keep them at least thinking about me (no AET yet) while the CC got things locked down) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perfect example of what it means to be a specialist in our role there Ernie...<br />
<br />
Just like going to the doctor in a lot of situations you'll go to your GP (general practictioner) but when the shit hits the fan you need to see a specialist.<br />
<br />
For day to day tanking / grinding / clearing knights are often the preferable tanking choice - they take the damage adequately and offer a fair bit of utility to deal with different situations.<br />
<br />
When it all goes to hell tho and you need someone to take the hits thats when we shine.  Defensive / evasive etc give every warrior a huge tanking advantage regardless of gear / AA.  Where warriors are envious of knights and their agro control, you can bet knights are envious of our discs and what we can tank that most of them will never be able to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubt he/she had the AA to control a pet, but if they did, or were charming, pets get you nice early agro, and sitting is not gonna happen.<br />

Oh, and boggle sucks.<br />

Sounds like one of 'those chanters.' Hard to avoid a bad-egg every now and then doing pickup groups. You should have been like, &quot;You can't quit... because you're FUCKING FIRED!&quot; Hehe.<br />
<br />
But seriously, with the aggro problem you're describing I really doubt that the level discrepancy would have been a real factor, if at all. Sounds like just bad chanterness to me. The way a dog learns is simple. If the effect associated with an action is negative, avoid the action. If the effect is positive continue to perform the action. Why the enchanter couldn't make the tash-slow-dot = bad correlation, I couldn't answer. ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I would have to ask what the heck was the chanter thinking casting 3 high agro then sitting??<br />
<br />
I suspect you had the problems of 1) slightly lower level (and yes that does seem to generate a bit more agro) and 2) lack of AAs-SCS specifically (had a guildie who had the same problem as a wiz, ALL the crit AAs, no agro lowering ones. One 6K crit an, bam agro) 3) the biggest factor: CHANTER HAD NO COMMON SENCE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One 6K crit an, bam agro <br />
<br />
Just a note, spells pretty much give the same aggro, regardless of full resist, partial, hit for full, or crit.  Though SoS is a good very good amount of aggro anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how many times ive heard enchanters shout &quot;IF YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP CASTING DOTS IN HERE IM LEAVING!&quot; type s of things. honestly i cant recall a time in a group where the enchanter was dotting. dotting ranks up there with the best for agro generation and there are strategies among casters where they dot specifically to gain agro. sounds like this enchanter isnt interested in any groups where agro lock is not assured. ok so she wants a paladin. either she wants to be lazy or she wants the glory of casting lots of offensive spells. either way thats her problem not yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The chanter was dot-ing the mob?<br />
<br />
&quot;That right there should have been a clue as to how silly your chanter was being.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was going to say the same thing.<br />
<br />
I assume chanter slow sticks about as well as shaman slow, although I know it draws a lot more aggro.  My shaman can slow 75-90% of the mobs in LDoN on the first cast of slow, without casting a debuff first.  So there is your first problem, unless you have a caster heavy group, there's really no need to tash everything in sight.  In Miragul's, for example, I Malos the flying monkeys, because they tend to be very magic resistant, but everything else I try to slow without a debuff.  <br />
<br />
Second, why the hell is the chanter dotting?  If you are the slower in the group, you're using your mana to slow.  If you are tashing too, that's some more mana.  If you have extra mana, save it for a nuke here and there, late in the fight.  I'm sure the chanter thought the DoT was being mana-efficient, but it's not mana-efficient if the mob dies before the DoT wears off, and it's not mana-efficient if you DoT too early and draw aggro, and the cleric has to blast heal you.  <br />
<br />
My shaman can draw aggro even off a paladin with a slow and a big DoT.  The difference is, I know it's going to happen, and I don't mind taking a hit or two until the tank can get the aggro back.  Hell, I don't mind tanking a LDoN mob once it's slowed, as long as the cleric is paying attention they can't hurt me too badly.  OK, I have the advantage of focus in addition to virtue, but still, I know lots of chanters that have more HPs than I do.<br />
<br />
My shaman dies in LDoN every now and then, but that's because I enjoy playing puller, it speeds the group up and I don't mind eating a random death once every two or three dungeons in order to keep the melees fighting instead of waiting for pulls.  Just slowing, unless you get a mega-train or have a gimpy group, you're not going to die in LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My chanters usually cast at least one of the heavy aggro spells within the first second or two.  That's where Incite has been a boon for us - I usually pull with it, or use it when the mob is incoming.  Sometimes they'll get hit, not often. Sitting down will frequently get you hit.  That's how I reposition mobs - get some aggro, run to the right spot, and sit.  Mob comes right over.<br />
<br />
Every group is different.  Different AAs, different classes, skill levels, gear.  Player's have moods, get tired, impatient, etc.  That's half the fun.  When something isn't working, it is the responsibility of the unhappy player to make adjustments.  Doing the same thing over and over and then getting pissed and gating is LAME.<br />

CHSD is a fine aggro weapon.  If you're concered about your aggro (and you should be, until you retire from EQ) then I recommend an Anger augmentation.  I put Anger3 on my CHSD and it works pretty well.  Lots of &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Anger&quot; procs.  That being said, we're still at the mercy of the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duchess Inferna</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have probably had the same problem in that situation with the enchanter sitting after doing tash, slow and dot.  Only difference would be that I prob could have grabbed aggro back before she got clobbered much.<br />
<br />
But still I blame the chanter for that one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nokatsu</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keeping aggro on the MT requires a team effort. You were doing what you could, but the enchanter wasn't cooperating.<br />
<br />
I had a similar situation where I was constantly losing aggro to a necro. I thought if I told the necro to control his aggro it wouldn't be well received. So instead I said in groupsay &quot;I'm sorry I can't get better aggro&quot;. Its amazing how effective taking the blame for something that isn't my fault can be at disarming people. I quickly got the reply &quot;Hey man it isn't your fault&quot; and the necro thought of things he could do to reduce aggro. The aggro problem disappeared.<br />
<br />
Some people might still believe it is the warrior's fault, but quite often even if the aggro hog doesn't realize they are doing anything wrong the other group members will see it and apply some peer pressure. By accepting blame when I raise the aggro problem it allows the problem to be resolved without anyone losing face.<br />

Exactly what I was thinking.  Once the chanter started getting edgy, I'd have started pulling triples.<br />

It's all a mental thing anyway, keep everyone happy somehow and everybody wins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone has a role to play in a group.  One of the roles anyone who deals damage is responsible for is regulating their damage output to ensure the tank commands aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyone can take aggro away from the MT if that's their goal, or they're totally witless.  No matter how good you are or what weapons you use.<br />
<br />
I had a bad Rak Ashir encounter recently that led to early death of the Cleric.  I was playing my Shaman, and took aggro away from a Pally over time just casting Kraggs Mending.  Had no choice in that situation, it was do or die.<br />
<br />
You don't need an Enchanter to win in LDoN, or a Cleric for that matter.  You just need good people who play their class and know their role.<br />
<br />
That chanter was without clue.</div></div><hr />

The chanter definately sounds like a dumbass. Possibly spoiled by the aggro lock of Knights that trivializes many aspects of EQ, but possibly just ebayed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i'm on slow duty i tash fairly early then slow, then i do nothing for a moment, that way the tank can gain some aggro before i sit, can't say how much chanter slow is resisted versus shaman slow but i do get resists somewhat regular, and slow eats some mana so never fun(my chanter is like 39 or 40 so my mana pool isn't exactly huge)</div></div><hr />
