<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On monday our guild decided to do Agnarr.  We zoned up and the first floor went just as planned...i was on the named while the wizards destroyed the portals and the offtanks took care of the adds.  First floor done.  We then zoned up to second floor and I headed to named as usual and the next thing i see is all the wizards saying the portals cannot be destroyed, ok...all melee on the portals.....still nothing.  We ended up wiping due to the fact that portals kept bringing us adds.  We petitioned and supposedly it was a bug on all servers.  Just wondering if anyone else has tried the Agnarr script in the last week and if they had the same trouble as us.</div></div><hr />

Hope it gets worked out. Seems maybe a couple encounters been going screwy....atleast from recent TSW posts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild encountered this on our last Agnarr run.  We just adjusted on the fly, mezzed and offtanked the adds and put every nuker and ranger on Emmerick.  Once Emmerick dies, the portals stop spawning.  Now just chew through the large number of adds that are hanging around.<br />
<br />
It was challenging but entertaining.</div></div><hr />

Only happens on the 2nd floor so if you can manage the adds its still do-able.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah happened to us, just put all dps on emmerick, killed him and had about 13 or so adds up maybe.  The adds started taking out people once chanters couldn't handle them(pain in the ass to target those stones/differeniate targets) but then just had someone low hp kite the whole group of them while we rezzed/rebuffed in the middle.  Pain is the ass though heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happened on Prexus. Forget who the guild was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the adds come through tons more quickly on firestorms level too, last run we did we only had 2 wizards and were just going to destroy first two portals right off then have to wait the disintegrate refresh for third one. in the past this has never been a problem as hes only ever summoned like 1 add every 2 minutes, well in the 2-3 minutes it took us to get firestorm down we had over 20 elementals in the room from the one portal that was destroyed last. its a very bugged event since GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a sizable raid, theres no reason your melees should not be able to kill adds as they spawn... Unless you just do it WAY different from the way every guild on Xegony does it, your melees are gonna be afk or plinging arrows on Emmerick for 2 dps. You don't need a hell of a lot of healing for those adds. Just beat them down as they come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zagz</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had that problem also on Feb 20th Agnarr Raid on Druzzil Ro. Hope they fix it, its a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minowara</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same problem during our last Agnarr raid, managed to fight for about 10mins before we eventually began to wipe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing happened to us well before 16 Feb.. They haven't fixed that yet.. Jeez.. was my first time (Wizard) doing the Agnarr event and lemme tell you.. It definately pissed me off (And the other wizards) when we kept getting the &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; while trying to disintegrate  the second level portals.  Oh well.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone done Agnarr within the last few day that knows if this is fixed or if SOE decided to leave it this way to make it harder for people to do this script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did it a week ago, on Monday the 23rd.  Had the problem with the portals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it today (sunday feb 29) on povar, it's still bugged. Was our first attempt too and it sucked when we wiped. :(<br />
<br />
I hope they fix it soon, it's a pretty big cockblock for a guild thats starting to advance, especially when I'm pretty sure we could do it otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">same, did it feb 29 and still bugged. my guild had 2 agnarr kills pre change and i can honestly the say the event is signifigantly harder now that skyfury's lvl is unkillable portals. by the time we dropped skyfury today we had over 20 adds on the platform. it wouldnt have been THAT bad but these adds are so damn hard to target, have tiny hit boxes, and were running around like crazy. its hard to find one rock thingy out of 20 when it runs off.<br />
<br />
petitioned the crappy event and the GM just said send bug report, he wouldnt tell me if it was actually bugged or a changed script, after this long im guessing its a changed script, which in that case we should /feedback that its BS since they are completely screwing over guilds trying to get into elementals now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone received an informed answer whether this is a bug or a tuning effort?<br />
<br />
This is the next hurdle for my guild and its frustrating to read that it just became 3x harder arbitrarily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, its a good bit harder because you have to adjust your tactics.  We beat agnarr tonight, despite the annoying add fest on floor 2.<br />
<br />
You really have to get your CC situation under control.  If you can control your adds, Emmy is a punk, and angarr is cake.  I had knights agro kiting the mobs while they were mezed or controled while the rest of the raid burned Emmy down (as much as youcan while slowed!).<br />
<br />
Best of luck with the event, floor two is teh suck, but once you can figure out how to manage those adds, its much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a bug, but it's not high priority.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they just leave it the way it is as people get sick of waiting for the fix and just start killing him when needed.  Since that level is usually handled as a range fight, this bug doesn't make it all that much harder once you know about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes this event is all that much harder now. last time we did this we had 72 people on raid, all melee were doing adds, only me plus rangers plus nukers were doing skyfury and by the time skyfury was down we had over 20 adds. the event really is that much harder now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">still same bug 2nd march...tho for some reason kill went much smoother for us heh, and we went on to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the event isnt utterly possibly now, been killed 3 times on bertoxx since the change but its still a huge huge step up from the old event</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agnarr downed today! Woohoo.<br />
<br />
Yes, seems that the 2nd floor is going to be a permanent feature now on this encounter.<br />
<br />
Tip on 2nd floor:<br />
1. Adds are there to distract you.<br />
2. Adds cannot be rooted, snared<br />
3. Adds can be mezzed<br />
4. Adds can be charmed<br />
5. Emerrik's AE is a target AE. Emerrik can cast the spell upto a range of 200, but the range of the AE on the target is only 30.  (This is the 90% Slow, 3k AE).<br />
<br />
Put all these together, and you should know how to overcome the 2nd floor.<br />
<br />
3rd floor is a breeze after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed Agnarr the 4th of March.  2nd floor portals could not be cast on or melee attacked.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the change. This gives us other melee's something to do ( like kill the adds ) while the MA + rangers / nukers kill the named.  On the second floor we had no more than 4 adds at a time, just keep killing and you wont get over whelmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow korinn so glad your elemental guild didnt have a problem with the second floor, problem is this is a huge blow to pre elemental guilds</div></div><hr />

Gates in 2nd room killable again, done by our Wizies.</div></div><hr />
