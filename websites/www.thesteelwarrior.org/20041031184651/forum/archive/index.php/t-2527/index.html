<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is in a position that we haven't seen a Cursed spawn yet, we get XTC a fair amount but he has yet to put out with HG, and we just killed AoW for our first time after 4 months of wanting to see him and got 2 BoC's for our trouble. That means we have our top two warriors equipped with GBoS and BoC now.<br />
<br />
My question is -- how far can I go with this combo? As far as I can tell, there are no more MT-style weapons to look for until BoW. I will probably spend DKP on a HG when/if one drops for us and hand down the BoC, but with 6 other guilds above us on the server that are all racing for Cursed I am not holding my breath for a Bloodfrenzy (especially with a 1/9 chance). But I need to know if this combo can do ok vs:<br />
<br />
Emperor -- 2/3 of the guild is keyed now and we're starting to get enough Bane to be meaningful.<br />
<br />
All of VT -- I hear VT isn't too hard, just time-consuming, so I assume anything I can tank Emperor with will work in VT.<br />
<br />
PoP -- we already do Tier 1 bosses just fine. We're working on flags for the Tier 2/3 bosses now. As far as I can tell from looking at those encounters, they don't really rest so much on MT agro. However, RZ is a big question mark for me. We are going to spend a lot of time in VT before taking a shot at him, so I'm not too worried there.<br />
<br />
Or, do we need to make Cursed a huge priority? I know his loot makes him a priority in general, but it's the difference between living in Ssra vs just taking what's up for us, and we see far too much of Ssra as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will have no problems with those weapons.<br />
<br />
Get some more BoC for your guilds warriors. All warriors should have a least one EB weapon imo. Get a few BF or HG as well for select warrios :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, that's the combo I use and it is solid.  It's nice to have a bloodfrenzy or two in the guild if you can get them, but BoC is good enough.  I have tanked everything in PoP up to Bertox and Rallos with a BoC and it will be just fine.  I am a big fan of the GBoS and banked my SoD in favor of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ditto, Brutul, except I haven't taken a shot at RZ yet.  But Bertox, MM, and all the rest were easy enough with BoC/GBoS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">GBoS mainhand -- it's better ratio for that spot, procs a lot, and you don't need a lot of BoC procs to keep a mob pasted to you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and amusingly enough, the same day I post this question we got Cursed, no Bloodfrenzy tho! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd highly recommend the greatstaff of 4 winds.  It will work as a good aggro weapon for you now, and a good dps weapon for you later.  (Yes, i've seen a well AA'd warrior with GSof4winds easily out aggro a BoC/SoD tank.)<br />
<br />
If your guild has access to Sol Ro, then I strongly recommend you farming a few Obsidian Greatblade (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25997) which can be obtained with probably 3 or 4 groups without much trouble.  I'm using this weapon until my number comes up for BoW.  When tanking various trash mobs on raids, as long as I get 1 or 2 rounds headstart, usually I hold aggro off of BoW tanks.  Lucky procs can make it go either way of course, but the obsidian greatblade seems to have a greater proc rate than BoW.  On fights that are a bit longer though, BoW will win every time of course *grin*, but it's a great, easy substitute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">should tank anything fine with that dw setup(even elementals) till disc wears out, then switch up to any 2her of any quality, should have solid agro by then anyways.<br />
<br />
if the heals are tight while in defensive, you need to plan on a tank switch. always less messy if you single tank it but it takes less healing if u do a solid switch.<br />
<br />
all the moaning about agro and such is mainly in xp groups with ppl slowing right off. raids mobs are almost entirely about proximity and everyone knows they better give a defensive tank a few seconds head start - shaman and enchanters are expected to die = p. occasionally u will see a rogue die early but they figure it out sooner or later hehe. anyone with a decent pair of weapons is going to do fine, mobs tend to stay on one person till he dies. hardest mob to get initial agro on is those spiders in poa(hybrid tank all the way) and the generals in pof, stun proc just sucks and fear the knockback haha.<br />
<br />
biggest issue ive seen lately is the next tank after the first one dies with monks using reparm sticks, they make nice roadbumps for the next tank = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Draganetti <br />
I'd highly recommend the greatstaff of 4 winds.  It will work as a good aggro weapon for you now, and a good dps weapon for you later.  (Yes, i've seen a well AA'd warrior with GSof4winds easily out aggro a BoC/SoD tank.)<br />
  <br />
<br />
I have a greatstaff of the four winds, BoC (ok just got today but still), SoD, and GBoS. I have PB2, SE3, and TM3 for offensive AAs. I have to say that while I absolutely love my GSot4W for DPS, it's not BoC/SoD or BoC/GBoS or SoD/GBoS aggro. I can hold aggro ok in some groups with GSot4W, but in some I'm forced to go back to dual wield (and believe me, I'd love to be able to use GSot4W all the time) or else non-tanks end up getting summoned or beat on too often.<br />
<br />
Now I can't say how the aggro situation would be if I had PB3, Fero, and Flurry, but if I had to guess I would say EB/stun or dual stun would be better than GSot4W for aggro (on average of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have *no* problem keeping agro off rangers wielding GSot4W in xp groups or in raids, even before I got the BoC. However before I got the GBoS, I was using a SoD + CHSD and those same rangers gave me fits. (Hi Kirthen!) So switching to that would probably not be a good choice for me unless I'm not tanking.<br />
<br />
However, if we're raiding, I'm #1 or #2 in the MT rotation, so I'm not spending DKP on a 2h weapon until I can get one that will get/hold agro at least as well as my current dual wield setup. I care about two things in a weapon -- how locked will the mob be to me in 3 minutes so that I can move it around if needed, and how fast can I call attack without worrying about a rogue getting instantly pulverized. Thanks for the link on the Obsidian Greatblade, I hadn't seen that one before. It'll probably be a few months until we're into SolRo tower, but that looks like a worthy alternative to the BoW until we can do RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BoC alone + just about any comparable ratio offhander will get you to at least RZtW for a BoW chance on drops...My guild is `50-60% Elemental Level Flagged now; and we only have one BoW with the other tanks wielding BoC/HG-etc...I'm the only warr out of 7 minus a BoC ( SotB/Red Epic ).<br />
<br />
Save them brownie points/DKP for teh BoW; line up your other warriors with some BoC's/EB weapons like Taminy said; and you'll do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have BoC/GBoS and Greatstaff of the 4 winds, and honestly I hardly use my Greatstaff unless I am xping someplace gimp out of planes of power (veksar, ssra and such).  The agro just isn't really comparable between the two setups.  Also it seems like 95% of the melees in my guild also have a Greatstaff so its pretty hard to pull agro off someone else consistantly when they are using the exact same weapon you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, the tank I was speaking of does have nearly every offensive AA (raging flurry3 and fury of ages3. . .), but she used it with no problems holding aggro on raids really till she got a BoW.  The proc rate on GSof4winds is very high.<br />
<br />
As we all know, aggro is a bit more than a magical weapon falling into our hands.  Time of engagement, guildmates behaving, and raid strategies probably all weigh as heavily as having that certain weapon.  IMO, a greatstaffof4winds would suit you up through RZ.  The tank in my guild that had a GSof4winds declined the obsidian greatblade I linked above, because she thought GSof4winds was better.<br />
<br />
If you have a staff 'o 4 winds, I'd worry more about maxing out your AA's than another weapon until a BoW drops.  :)</div></div><hr />
