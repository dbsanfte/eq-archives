<br />
Wotcha all thinks o'yas new way o'walkin an runnin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>newbbarsher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the new animations are unbelievably and incredibly horrible. My character (Newb) looks like Richard Simmons when he runs. His arms go up in like a 30 degree angle, and he leans forward like he just learned how to use his legs. I didn't really think that SoE could mess up the luclin animations anymore, but I guess I was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">^--the winnar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I run like Velma from the old Scooby doo cartoon =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL gotta love it…… They wont fix any real problems but looky you run like a retard now!! All aboard the short bus!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Worst. Update. Ever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah the halflings have NO change. so i don't care. sucks for the rest of you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sure rub it in Dobbo.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">don't hate. but yes it's fun to rub it in. but i get all the assling comments so you have yet to feel the real pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ROFL! Ayup you got me there! I have yet to be called an azzling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i hope nobody calls you an assling you look a little too tall to be one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hence why i havent been called one would be my guess :rolleyes:  <br />
But chin up little brother at least your not in a race that has a bunch of little azzlings at your crotch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While Raychael probably doesnt get called an assling too often she probably gets this one~<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail Raychael, SoW plz&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rugal Bloodwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whee..my beard flies ahead of me when I move, fun! Wait, no, its not.<br />
The flying beard aside, I think the worst is the turning..ugh. Thats just sad. Old way of that did look better. When I turn around, I move more than my feet /shrug, I must be a freak since my character is supposed to look realistic and all that stuff :p <br />
Movements before never really bothered me (ok, maybe except cats), its the weapon swings that nagged me the most, especially 2hb and my freaking offhand. I think this is gonna be hard gettin used to..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i look like frankenstein doing a cross country marathon....and i'm a WOOD ELF....<br />
<br />
/sigh...time to turn the old models back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I briefly tried Luclin models, decided they mostly sucked, and turned them off. The ogre one is awful, and the ogre animations are a sad joke. Looks like a complete spazz fighting, and runs with his head down. Most of the elves look like hunchbacks. Really terrible job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree <br />
<br />
Pathetic job on these, I must say. Normally I'm not one to bash SoE because I know it aint easy doing what they do, but these animations are halfass at best. My shaman's beard floats off his face when he walks or runs. Geezus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ogres run like they just crapped their pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I havent logged in since the update.. im skeered! I actually like the way the luclin dwarven animations looked! bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Looks like they undid the patch,  I don't run like gorilla anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Fixed lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Troll models look retarded now. Dorfs havent been changed.<br />
Fell almost off my chair when i saw the diaku (oversized ogres) run in tactics yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>CasEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/sigh, all I get are hoot's from guildies, &quot;run Forrest, run!&quot;<br />
Human animations are pretty awful...</div></div><hr />

Looks like they undid the patch,  I don't run like gorilla anymore. <br />
<br />
god i hope so. please. that animation nonsense was horrendous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Dwarf model is the only new one i use anyway so i hope its the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yeah Dwarves didn't change, but I never really payed attention to it. But since soe had to redo them, they must have been game-breaking features, because without the new animations we surely couldn't play! Nevermind all the broken things that could be fixed, We have ANIMATIONS to fix!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I hate it. <br />
<br />
How about fixing something that is actually broken? Like the raid function, or spontaneous server crashes?  Nooooooo.<br />
<br />
I walk all hunched over and look goofy.  And my tits giggle when i walk too. How bad is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yep dey backed it out!  Now m'runs cute again. *smiles*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The only description I can make for my dark elf cleric's run is that he just threw his back out and is in excruciating pain but also has a severe case of diarhea and is desperate to get to the bathroom despite his back pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">While Raychael probably doesnt get called an assling too often she probably gets this one~<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail Raychael, SoW plz&quot; <br />
<br />
*shakes her head* <br />
Aww the pain of being a female wood elf! Everyone assumes your a druid even when they see plate and a wurmy <br />

Neato :eek: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Wow! Mine nevah giggled! *thinks shes been cheated by SOE*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">well, i used to run like i had a stick in my ass that went all the way to my neck(vah shir), and the way i ran after the patch kicked ass imho, but they changed it back because it was ment for test sever. as for other races, the barbs and iksar look bad ass. everyone else had a little to much lean forward action going on &lt;snicker&gt; worst was the high elf &lt;snicker&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">http://grimmlokk.homestead.com/files/beard.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Give the poor SoE guys a break! How do you expect the beard model to stay on when you keep slamming yourself in the face? <br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">O_O um........ Wow! Maybe your running so stupid your beard is imbarrassed to be a part of it :p</div></div><hr />
