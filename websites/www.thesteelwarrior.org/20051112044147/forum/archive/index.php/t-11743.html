But i will end up using hammer over arcaite due to chance of 3 second stun....which is nice for pvp....so which smith should i go?<br />
<br />
Axe<br />
<br />
Hammer<br />
<br />
Sword?<br />
<br />
Which benfits me more and gives me more money?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Axe smith.  The only good swords anyone wants are drops or quests.  I know our guild is hurting not having an axesmith and we could have made a guild effort for plans at AH, b ut no one had Axesmith.  However, hammer or Titans is nice for Shaman/Paladins and could sell well since oyu have it already.  Reaper still owns though for crafted weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you go axesmith, remember the reaper plans are rare as shit.<br />
<br />
It's been about.....6 months (?), and there's only 4 people on alliance on Illidan that can craft arcanite reaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Axe smith is probably the most useful weaponsmithing &quot;currently.&quot;  However, I would really go with what is interesting to you,  this is still a very young game, and content is constantly being added for trades.  (Now if they could just fix the cooking bug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would seriously look at one of the others.  Everyone goes Axe.  And, as weve seen in other games...the rarely used proffessions always get the hookup.<br />

Or just hold off for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought the plans for Arc Reaper this weekend for 75G   :) <br />
The guy tried to sell em in the AH with a 500G buyout.  His auction ended and broadcasted he was selling em for 75G.  My pointer moved over his name as fast as it ever had and just typed one word, &quot;sold&quot;.  Probably, the best 75G I ever spent.  My wife is our guild axe smith, our only, but is lvl47 and 270BS.   So, It will be a few weeks before she can start making them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the only thing I get asked to make is the Enchanted Thorium helm then they arent willing to pay for it like people are willing to pay for the Reaper.<br />
<br />
Hopefully in the future they will add better armor for the armorsmiths to make that people actually want</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hammersmith is very underrated. sure, we can't get +crit from Hammer of the Titans as we can with a Reaper (through Axe spec), but it's still a very slow, very powerful weapon for MS warriors. it's also in lower demand than Reaper plans so...bing.<br />
<br />
I am not liking Swordsmith anymore. Arcanite Champion is okay, but it's more of a paladin weapon, and the mats are not easy to pharm/buy. you could possibly buy a Destiny for a lower total cost if you want a similar weapon.<br />
<br />
Enchanted Thorium is damn nice, I'm glad Blizz added the recipes. Imperial Plate is cool if you want the standard Alliance footman graphics without hosing your stats - it's good enough to get you through the first tier of raiding instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mojak</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, the imperial armor is nice.  Ever seen an Orc Warrior in it?  Blue plume and all!  haha<br />
<br />
<br />
They shoulda added 2 sets of armor instead of one for that line.  Horde and Alliance.  I keep picturing my orc singing &quot;Big guy in a little coat&quot; from that david spaide movie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Imperial legs right now, and desperately want to get rid of them, but nothing better is ever in AH and I haven't had a hance to get some good legs from instanes yet.  I would really like to get some commander's legplates of the monkey to hold me over until eldritch,  but they never are seen in AH really.<br />
<br />
I would go armorsnith in heartbeat if my guild ever managed to get its hands on lionheart or stronghold gautlet plans, but other than that, not much worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">05-24-2005, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been thinking about this too.  Always wanted to go Axesmith for the Reaper.  However, I agree with Ugle, in that the neglected trades usually get a boost later on.<br />
<br />
Since it's permanent, I say go with whatever you'd like in theory.  The game mechanics should catch up after awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krelm</div><div class="date">05-26-2005, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about how orcs look in Imperial Plate. Disgraceful...</div></div><hr />

Huh, people don't want Lionheart Helms or Stronghold gauntlets?  Not to mention Dark Iron BP is damn nice for MC.  And the enchanted thorium stuff is also really nice, although the mat requirements I think are out of line considering you can get some equivalent drops much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">05-27-2005, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Armorsmith is definitely the way to go for a warrior if you're doing smithing.<br />
<br />
Still has decent things to sell, and its the only gear still usable at the high end (resistance gear, stronghold gaunts, etc) where as being stuck as a weaponsmith permanently almost makes me want to cry ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-28-2005, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh?<br />
<br />
You being serious or did you fuck up on the emoticon or what Granite?<br />
<br />
I'm sure the guy pumping out Arcanite Reapers on Boulderfist and dumping them for 7-800 a shot isn't crying that he went Weaponsmith.</div></div><hr />
