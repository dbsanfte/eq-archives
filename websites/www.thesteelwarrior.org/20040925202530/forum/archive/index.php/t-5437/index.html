 The saddest part is I'm sure every single one of them thought they were being witty/original/creative when they picked that name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I don't think anyone on the face of this earth can claim they have had all that many original ideas and thoughts.<br />
<br />
This just goes to show you how much people really are alike.<br />
<br />
I'm not defending the names they chose, just the idea that they are somehow not as smart or interesting or creative than anyone else just because they chose that name.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't ridicule them for it. <br />
<br />
Every thought you've ever had is but an echo and reflection of the thoughts of everyone you have ever met or will ever meet.</div></div><hr />

Short names (4 or 5 letters) that are &quot;readable&quot; like say &quot;Trog&quot; (as opposed to stuff like &quot;Xidr&quot;) tend to be a mark of an old toon.  Also, last names which are titles or have embedded spaces or punctuation mean the toon's probably an old one (i.e put in before the surname rules were).   Any other observations like this?<br />

 My character's original name was &quot;Fudgamaniac&quot;. My brother showed me the game and I made a char on his account. Stupid name to be a wiseass cuz I thought I'd quit in a week. Around level 18 an enchanter named &quot;Sylverlokk&quot; petitioned my name. So I had to come up with a new one on the spot, Grim sounded mean and I threw on &quot;lokk&quot; to spite the enchanter. He laughed at me and I felt dumb.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lochr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Cleric characters seem especially susceptible to Stupid Name Syndrome. Maybe it's because so many are bots, but you can't go 30 feet on SolRo without finding a cleric named Rez-something or HealU or Medic...<br />
<br />
I hate SNS. When DAoC came out, my guild went to the Guineviere server, as Mythic promised to strictly enforce a naming policy on the role-playing server. The policy lasted about 2 weeks. I think the GMs got tired of spending every waking moment policing idiots. Guineviere was also the most populated server at launch. Now it may have been because a large proportion of beta testers went to that server, but I like to think that a lot of people were trying to escape SNS.<br />
<br />
Actual characters I've seen:<br />
<br />
Rezzya Ornot   (Magician! Oh, wait, errr, no.)<br />
Kuuduudz LovesBritneySpears  (a warrior. gah.)<br />
Medik<br />
Rezzer<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Rezzur<br />
<br />
Every monk with some 'clever' ripoff of Bruce Lee.<br />
<br />
The sixteen remaining monks on the server not in the above category, with Fists in their name. DeadlyFists, SilentFists, ThunderFists, I'm talking about you.<br />
<br />
For some reason, bazaar mule names don't bother me. We've got the usual suspects: Waalmaart, AMule, BuyLow, UberLoots, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lamoeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Around level 18 an enchanter named &quot;Sylverlokk&quot; petitioned my name. So I had to come up with a new one on the spot <br />
<br />
I remember Sylverlokk! When I was a young monk, a couple of weeks into the game and full of the Stupids I decided to trek across Antonica from Freeport to Qeynos at lvl 12. As you'd expect a single teenage monkey in his pajamas was just the sort of snack the Karanan Gorge Hounds were looking for.  <br />
<br />
After I respawned in Freeport I saw a hideous corpse retrieval ahead of me, thru Kithicor, at night. Just as I was about to log off and call EQ finished for good Sylverlokk sends me a tell asking if I needed help. Oh yeah, I needed help. He dragged my corpse to the zone line and got a cleric friend to come and rez me. <br />
<br />
Sylverlokk kept me in the game without ever realizing what he'd done. <br />
<br />
*bows deeply*<br />
<br />
As for the names topic? *shrug* I like Rainbird for the druid, sounds Amerindian. Anywho, sometimes getting a name that won't be rejected as you create the character can be a total pain in the ass. That's why I go for wry plays on words. Examples:<br />
<br />
Leaping Miles, my druid<br />
Ironbones, my troll SK<br />
Prole Tarian, my chanter and Bazaar mule  :D<br />
<br />
P.S. If I see another monk with word &quot;fist&quot; in his name I'll gladly beat him to death with his own arms.</div></div><hr />

Lost a shammy I was experimenting with in PC once .. hired a necro to summon it by the name of Corpsedraggin Anuddernoob.   Nice fella, and I always remembered the name ... about 14 months later, shortly after I had joined TrollBraggers, one of the guild officers gets on his nearly abandoned necro alt and of course, it turned out to be him.

My friend had a bot chanter and bot cleric and a lvl 20 wiz of his own. We would rule the oasis with our c3 and aegolism buffs. If that wasn't enough he would log on his lvl 50 druid and ds us. We had an epic battle once with an sk and ranger who were similarly buffed one day, but most of the time it was so unfair, got kinda boring after a week or so. Ipitydafool is still lvl 20 and still has aego and c3 up on him. One of these days I'll log him back on and terrorize a newbie zone again for about an hour.<br />

Well, I hadda roll up a *Froggabone*.  He lasted a week, but I did wonder a few times what anyone mighta thought who didn't know my main.  And we had a guildie whose main was Qoharx or somesuch (generated) name his froggy Qermit. <br />
<br />
One of the G/F's faves was *Tellhung Westicles*, spotted in Neriak one day.  I refrain from comment when she snickers over that, well over a year later. :p<br />
<br />
Dunno if I gave the precis of my name's story yet, and I'm too tired to look.  A couple of MORPG's back, I used to go by my RL name.  Rolled up a toon with a name inspered by and AC/DC song, as those I used to roam with knew I liked *Back In Black* for Orc killing, and I wanted to give a clue to the ones I wanted to know me (while I commenced sloughing off the folx I regretted being polite too).  I've been using the nic online since.  <br />
<br />
My toon's surname (Deddaggen), is a shorter story - I died 8 or 9 times trying to solo my 20th level, and it fit the first name for rhythm and word length.  It had a visually symmetrical touch which I liked.<br />
