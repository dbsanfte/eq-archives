<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vanax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Honesly, I really now jack squat about programming and such, so I have no clue how to do this. But I am wondering if anyone remembers when monks or rogues (i forget which one) were placed on a totally different attack table for meelee attacks at like lvl 60 (or was it 65). I dont remember when this was done, or how it really affected monks or rogues dps at the time.<br />
<br />
But I was thinking, even though it does nothing for our aggro abilities, what if warriors were to be placed on a totally different mitigation table, to where basically say we took like 1/5 less dmg than before, which isnt a &quot;huge&quot; change but still somewhat noticeable. That would perhaps provide us a bit more desire for group situations. Basically we wouldnt have the extreme aggro of a hybrid (btw i always wonder why people say that pallies are uber aggro...i played a 65 sk and a pally could NEVER steal aggro even if they tried...but ermm back to the situation) but we would have the fact that we took far less dmg than a hybrid giving us back our &quot;tanking edge&quot; since we are in fact supposed to be superior tanks.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just kinda rambling and thinking out loud, but let me know what you guys think. Im sure its prolly been mentioned somewhere on the old boards or even here a few times, just didnt really have time to do any extensive searches</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">warrriors already tank very well there is no need for this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vanax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when did i say that warriors didnt tank well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I think that is an excellent idea.<br />
<br />
If we can't get SOE to give us a better taunt, then how else can we differentiate Warriors vs. Knights?  How can we make Warriors more desirable for exp groups?<br />
<br />
More HP's would be one way.  A significant amount of HP's.  20-30% more, given the same level and the same gear.<br />
<br />
A better mitigation table would be another way.  Make the minor HP advantage we have now go farther in battle.<br />
<br />
Or a combination of both the above.<br />
<br />
If implemented properly, a group would have a more balanced decision to make regarding whether to get a Knight or a Warrior for their exp group:<br />
<br />
Knights have much better aggro control.  This mean the group can go at 100% on the mobs with little fear.  However, there is more concern for healing the Knight.  More attention would need to be paid to Knight health.<br />
<br />
Warriors have better HP / mitigation.  This means the group goes at 80-90% to insure the Warrior maintains aggro.  Healing is much less of a concern.<br />
<br />
Perhaps even this level of differentiation isn't enough to make Warriors more of a viable option for exp groups, but at least it would be a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">would trivalize a LOT of encounters this will not happen. Do you want to see 1 group AoW? I sure dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vanax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont see a 1/5 difference in the amount of dmg we take causing a 1 group of AoW...just like you said, lets be realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">warrior requiering 1/5 less healing on raid encounters means the raid will have 25% more to suceed. This will make any single tank encounters that much easier. Hence this is not happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">would trivalize a LOT of encounters <br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
I don't see how giving a single class more HP's and a better mitigation table would trivialize anything.<br />
<br />
For exp groups there would just be less chance of the warrior dieing.  This would be balanced against the issue of aggro control.<br />
<br />
For raids, the only thing that would change is that perhaps a botted cleric or 2 could be dropped from a CH rotation.<br />
<br />
And I just don't think it's possible to 1 group AoW ... he has too many HP's and regen for 1 group to get good enough DPS on him to kill him.<br />
<br />
I still don't see how this breaks anything.  To my way of thinking, it simply makes warriors more viable for exp groups and doesn't substantially degrade uber raid encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">10 people can kill AOW now...<br />
<br />
Trak/Talendor/Servelious take what 3 people?<br />
<br />
heck Klandicar/Zlandicar are almost soloable, and i am sure a good DUO may be able to kill either...<br />
<br />
Your point about a one group AoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">warrior requiering 1/5 less healing on raid encounters means the raid will have 25% more to suceed<br />
<br />
Nonsense.<br />
<br />
Success is based on aggro control, keeping everyone alive, and DPS.<br />
<br />
The change suggested does nothing for aggro control.  It makes it slighly easier to keep the MT alive.  It does nothing for DPS.<br />
<br />
Making is slightly easier to keep 1 character alive out of an entire raid force does not add up to a 25% increase in the probability of the raid to succeed.<br />
<br />
But it certainly would make warriors more atractive to exp groups, especially exp groups that don't have a Cleric and Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your point about a one group AoW?<br />
<br />
It still hasn't been done, has it?<br />
<br />
It may indeed be possible to 1 group AoW one day, but it won't be because Warriors got increased HP and mitigation.<br />
<br />
It will be because of improved spells, or improved techniques, or improved weapons, or most likely a combo of all 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">k since you not geting my point of my view I am rewarding it.<br />
<br />
I do not want this game made any easier then it already is. For me it would remove all the fun. I already have trouble finding something of the chalenge to do. Give me this 25 percent mitigation increase for no work invloved?<br />
<br />
As far as raids being all about dps and agro  controll thats balony. Most mobs dont ping pong too much at all especially the velious encounter ones. Its all about how long your clerics can keep tank alive so whatever dps you got can do their job and 25 percent increase in that I see as beeing way too powerfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vanax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">actually 1/5 = 20%...not to be mean, just pointing it out...<br />
<br />
Honestly, if the game continues for years to come, yah, ANYTHING will be soloable...but be real about it.  This isnt like the avg 3 people in EQ can go and kill the stuff your speaking of, thats for people who are mid to high end PoP content and have High - end gear. Now dont get me wrong, im extremely close to breaking 9k hps and 1600 ac atm, and I had a real tuff time doind Vindi with 8 people, much less a one group AoW....<br />
<br />
Also, if you feel that every change sony makes to a class is &quot;something given for nothing&quot; then I guess you wont have fun in this game much longer, because with all the new games coming out, you will start seeing some BIG changes...havent you noticed that EVERY time a huge game altering change is made there just so happens to be another MMORPG coming out or just then hitting the shelves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice to see you thinking of the Warrior community as a whole, instead of focusing on just your narrow self interests.<br />
<br />
Your point before was that improving Warriors would trivialize encounters.  Your latest point is that you don't want to be bored.  It wasn't that I didn't &quot;get&quot; your point, it's that you changed your point.  At least now you're finally being honest.<br />
<br />
What percentage of Cleric's on any given raids are actually bots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Velious is 2 expansions, well 3 technically, old... <br />
<br />
It should be trivial...<br />
<br />
It's called progression...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmmm, good point ...<br />
<br />
Didn't some people in FoH do some calculations at one point and determine, theoretically at least, that there just aren't enough DPS in 1 group to kill AoW?  Or was that before the lvl cap became 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">25 percent increase in that I see as beeing way too powerfull. <br />
<br />
Better remove KEI, Bard song and Mod Rods then, because that was what caused the initial increase in tank survivability, and it was WAY more than 25%.<br />
<br />
You don't get it yet.  If you increase warrior mitigation so it's in line with what it should be (IE; CLEARLY better than hybrids, not just marginally), then you can adjust some of the other issues that were implemented into the game to compensate for that fact, things like massive mana regen which basically eliminate any chance any cleric has of running OOM before the mob dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vanax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ok totally not related to the topic, but can i get a golf clap for making a post that lasted over 5 minutes =) hehe i guess lil things in life make me happy...=p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Increasing warrior mitigation by 20% would be lame. It would trivialize every encounter I can think of that I have been a part of (thru Saryrn in Time). Most encounters, particularly those in PoP depend on keeping the MT alive. Increasing war mitigation that much would all but guarantee easy victories agains all the heavy hitters.<br />
<br />
Massive mana regen is not why clerics don't run out of mana. You could have a line of unbuffed clerics cast cheal indefinitely if you have enough of them (I think the number is around 12 clerics for low mana regen levels).<br />
<br />
Making is slightly easier to keep 1 character alive out of an entire raid force does not add up to a 25% increase in the probability of the raid to succeed. <br />
You're right. If our MTs where 20% easier to keep alive, then our success rate on mobs we don't already completely own would probably go up closer to the order of 50-75%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Guess what guys, if things continue the way they are, it won't matter HOW trivial raid encounters are for any of us, 'cause we won't be able to level enough to do those raids.  You have to EXP GROUP to get high enough to raid, and right now many of us are having a great deal of difficulty doing that because of the tremendous disparity between knights and warriors in aggro control, combined with the relatively minor difference in durability.  The only way to fix this problem is to either improve us or nerf knights.  Pick one.  Personally I dont want to see them nerfed, I like having strong people beside me in a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Increasing war mitigation that much would all but guarantee easy victories agains all the heavy hitters.<br />
<br />
That's an over-simplification and you know it.<br />
<br />
How many Clerics are there in an average PoP boss mob encounter?  How many of them are bots?  What is the timing on the CH chain?  Being able to get rid of 1-2 botted clerics is gonna make all raid encounters trivial?<br />
<br />
Besides, why can't improved mitigation be coupled with an increase in Boss Mob HP's or damage output?  Encounters were re-tuned when mod rods were nerfed.  Re-tune boss mob encounters for improved warrior mitigation abilities.<br />
<br />
Doing it this way gives exp group warriors something beneficial, and gives raid warriors something that doesn't &quot;trivialize&quot; any uber raid mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That's an over-simplification and you know it.<br />
You apparently have no idea what a heavy hitter is like.<br />
<br />
How many Clerics are there in an average PoP boss mob encounter? How many of them are bots? What is the timing on the CH chain? Being able to get rid of 1-2 botted clerics is gonna make all raid encounters trivial?<br />
We run anywhere from 5 to 8 clerics on most encounters. We don't bot any clerics. In most cases the timing is 2 seconds on a rotation, we would not get rid of any clerics on the rotation at all if warriors had 20% more durability. The difference would be that we could do things exactly as we do them now, but the warrior would NEVER die. The hard part of PoP encounters has to do with how hard a mob hits. If the MT dies, you can bet everyone that gets hit before the ST takes over will die. And the ST stands a good chance at dying unless he gets a lot of spam heals until the rotation adjusts. With 20% more mitigation, the chances of a mob 1 rounding a warrior would be next to nil, as would the chances of having several big hits in a row.<br />
<br />
As someone else stated, agro control is not a problem. I would know, my main is a wizard and I don't remember the last time I had to worry about agro. Sure, when the MT dies I am next, but it's not very hard to keep the mob on the MT.<br />
<br />
Besides, why can't improved mitigation be coupled with an increase in Boss Mob HP's or damage output? Encounters were re-tuned when mod rods were nerfed. Re-tune boss mob encounters for improved warrior mitigation abilities.<br />
Because encounters are tuned pretty good as it is right now (with the exception of the fucked up resist mods). A properly geared warrior does his job exceptionally well against raid mobs after many months of retuning.<br />
<br />
Doing it this way gives exp group warriors something beneficial, and gives raid warriors something that doesn't &quot;trivialize&quot; any uber raid mobs.<br />
This would do nothing but trivialize raid bosses. You can give warriors all the mitigation in the world, but against exp mobs it will be irrelevant because groups don't care how much damage the tank takes as long as 2 things are true -<br />
<br />
1. the healer has mana<br />
2. the tank has good agro<br />
<br />
My 56 warrior has no problem tanking any exp mobs outside of the elemental planes. He has no problem at all being a mana sponge, but he doesn't hold agro as well as an SK or Pally. How would 20% more mitigation help him in a group? It wouldn't. Cheals would land for 3khp instead of 3600hp. So what? The cleric still has plenty of mana but a knight would still hold better agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So what you are saying wandor, is that giving warriors more aggro will not be as trivializing as giving them more hps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">re-tuning every boss mobs is just not happening. Just imagine retuing then adjust all that shit after it goes live as it allways happen. Waaaayy too much work.<br />
<br />
As in regards it should be trival and they already are. But if you not in top guild you are not going to see any of loot dropers if they are trivalized them this much. You need those mobs to progress instead that gear will be going to twinks (not that it doesnt happenn now it just would happen much more if this went live). This is the reason why minis in Fire were upped.<br />
<br />
More dmg to warriors I dont see that happenin we already up there with proper gear, nor do I see making us better at soaking up dmg thats allready there too. What we need is utilities through discs that are usefull in xp groups so we can compete with knight's versatility. This would be best solution. No nerfing no twiking instead group friendly abilities.<br />
<br />
I am gonna ignore Haass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So what you are saying wandor, is that giving warriors more aggro will not be as trivializing as giving them more hps?<br />
No, that is not what I said, I did not offer a solution, I mearly pointed out the the proposed idea would be unbalancing and break the game.<br />
<br />
That being said, I do agree with that statement. Giving warriors more agro would not break raiding or grouping. Raid warriors already hold good agro as it is. Between EB weapons, agro increasing spells, positioning and proximity, and agro reduction available to DPS classes warriors already have very good agro. Giving a warrior another means to generate more agro would go largely unnoticed on raids unless your guild has a problem with ping-ponging bosses. I would venture a guess your guild, as with most experienced raid guilds, does not have this problem.<br />
<br />
It also would not break exp groups by giving warriors more agro. You would have to make some extreme changes to give warriors agro equal to a knights to begin with, so it wouldn't change much as far as balance. Knights would still have more utility (mana regen, heals, buffs etc) but at least warriors would be able to generate agro at or near the level of knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You apparently have no idea what a heavy hitter is like<br />
<br />
If a 20% increase in mitigation makes them trivial, they must not hit very hard.<br />
<br />
Except that they do.  Hit very hard.<br />
<br />
Your statement doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Actually, all things considered, this short thread has brought up several interesting approaches:<br />
<br />
1) increased HP and/or mitigation<br />
2) increased utility through AA abilities or disciplines<br />
3) simply increasing taunt<br />
<br />
Obviously the best answer for exp group Warriors is #3.<br />
<br />
I don't believe #3 will ever happen.  Because of this, #1 looks to be the next best alternative.  Several people have responded with what they believe to be potential issues with this approach.  I am sure that if SOE chose to go with this plan,then those concerns could be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Aggro won't break the game but it's also completely unneeded at the raid level.  There's really no reason why anyone should have aggro problems on a boss that doesn't have any ability that messes with aggro.  Yes people who push their aggro will die after the MT does but in a sense that's not so bad.  Who would you rather die to a 3K hitting boss after the MT dies?  3 rogue and a wizard, or 4 clerics?  The former, of course.  Losing the DPS guys just means mobs take longer to kill.  Losing 4 clerics means you might not be able to recover at all.  Giving warriors more aggro right now would actually make it harder for anyone except the first person to function (and the first warrior generally has no problem given any competent raid).  On a hard hitter, the backup tanks need to lose aggro fast when the MT dies because there is no way the chain can react fast enough.  If your aggro list looks like MT, ST, etc... then basically the moment MT dies, the ST dies as well so now you're down 2 warriors instead of 1.  So ironically, if a warrior is given more aggro innately, it makes it harder for all the backup ones to function properly.<br />
<br />
As for bosses that messes with aggro, they'll simply readjust the anti-aggro abilities to compensate.  If something deaggro 50% maybe it'll deaggro 75% now.  If something stuns for 20 seconds maybe it'll stun you for 40 second now.  If something mem blurs every 30 seconds it might mem blur every 20 seconds.  Rest assured SoE will do whatever it takes to restore the anti-MT bosses back to a level where they deem appropriately difficult to MT regardless of how good warrior aggro is (or isn't).<br />
<br />
Aggro on xp group is meaningless.  If it's too good, it makes Knights obselete.  There is no need for Knight's utility value if the warrior always has aggro.  If it's not as good as Knights, then you're still not as good as them, and according to what people say, groups only care about aggro, so why take an improved but still not adequate Warrior over a Knight who always have aggro?  Even if you can somehow put a Warrior somewhere in between, the end result is that for good groups will always want a warrior and bad groups will always want a Knight.  Since warrior aggro woes is largely a function of bad groups it won't really solve anything.<br />
<br />
Finally, on mitigation, you don't have any idea how much 20% mitigation really is.  It's better than having 20% more HP and that's saying a lot with elemental warriors breaking 10K HPs.  Even just another 2000 HP would render most heavy melee DPS bosses trivial, and 20% mitigation is actually far better than just another 2000 HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I am gonna ignore Haass. <br />
<br />
Ya, easier to ignore problems rather than deal with them when they don't fit into your little equation of the world.  Probably best for ya.<br />
<br />
What broke the game and made tanks virtually indestructible was in Luclin during the mod rod craze, amplified with Bard Song and then throw KEI in.  At the point it becomes impossible for a cleric to run out of mana, the game is broke.<br />
<br />
The game is still broke, even after the mod rod nerf, albeit not as badly.  Warriors are broken, we have no function in current day - to - day life, you could solve 2 problems with one fell swoop...reduce mana regenerate rates that are currently causing casters with a half assed amount of Focus + FT to be basically fountains of eternal life, and improve warrior mitigation to a level where you would WANT a warrior tanking over a knight because they WOULD TAKE LESS DAMAGE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE LESS HEALING WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE YOUR MANA REGENERATION WOULD BE LOWERED TO COMPENSATE.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't exist in a vaccuum.  Think big picture.  Warriors don't have problems because of any one specific reason.  There are a multitude of tiny effects which were amplified over time and gathered together and now we have a useless class.  Time to set the slate back to par again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If a 20% increase in mitigation makes them trivial, they must not hit very hard.<br />
<br />
Except that they do. Hit very hard.<br />
<br />
Your statement doesn't make any sense. <br />
Like I said, you apparently have no clue how the big hitters work or you would not make such an assinine statement. Let me put it in simple terms. In order to make AC count for something, PoP bosses hit for an assload - many of them hit on the order of 3k+ while at the same time having a rather low ATK. This basically means that big bosses hit for less than max more often than not. In many cases they hit for minimum (still a pretty high number) quite a bit of the time. This is where the challenge comes in. The secret to keeping the main tank alive is to minimize the chances of a boss hitting for max or near max because otherwise you have a chance of a cheal not getting you back to 100% HP, or worse yet, there is the possibility of being 1-rounded which no amount of healing will save you from.<br />
<br />
The only way to keep these situations from happening is to increase mitigation or avoidance. A 20% increase to either of those would completely fuck up the delicate balance that has been tuned after months of encounters being beta tested for you by the uber guilds. Right now, PoP bosses are all balance very well in terms of relative difficulty. To compensate for a 20% increase in mitigation you would have to completely rethink the way that PoP encounters work. It's not a simple matter of bumping up mob HP and making them hit harder.<br />
<br />
What broke the game and made tanks virtually indestructible was in Luclin during the mod rod craze, amplified with Bard Song and then throw KEI in. At the point it becomes impossible for a cleric to run out of mana, the game is broke. <br />
And you completely ignore the fact that I plainly stated that clerics can have infinite mana unbuffed by just having enough clerics in the cheal rotation. When you figure in specilization and spell casting mastery 3, complete heal only uses up around 240 mana per cast. At an unbuffed  and without FT mana regen rate fo 26 mana/tick it only takes a little over 9 ticks to regen all the mana they used casting. With 15 clerics a 3 second rotation would have infinite mana with absolutely no buffs. Mana regen is not the problem, and increasing mitigation 20% is certainly not the answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think 20 % is way too high and it would go in the wrong way.<br />
<br />
As someone already wrote is that you must see the picture and not parts of the picture.<br />
<br />
The picture is, that warrior lack a bit in the part of the game called EXP-Grind. The picture is, that warrior are ok in the part of the game called Raid.<br />
<br />
So you have to look for an ability which included.<br />
<br />
1. Knights must have better aggro<br />
2. Knights must tank a bit less<br />
3. Knights must hit a bit less ( with their better weapons )<br />
4. Knights are equal over all for the EXP-grinds.<br />
<br />
In this discussion the allround NO NO NO of some ppl. here is not very useful, cause they do not bring anny other point of view then to negate all what is written.<br />
<br />
First .. what have we now.<br />
<br />
1. Knights have way to much aggro in relation to warriors<br />
2. Knights tank arount 1.5 to 3 % less then warrior<br />
3. Knights hit nearly equal to a bit more .<br />
4. Knights are better over all for the Exp-grinds.<br />
<br />
No Nerf for Knights<br />
<br />
1. Raise the successrate of Taut to half between 100 % and now .<br />
2. Raise the Hp starting at Level 60 for 100 HP per Level so you winn 5 % hp based on the momentary maximum HP of 10 000.<br />
3. Raise the damage tables post 60 for around 3 to 5 % more damage.<br />
<br />
Result <br />
500 HP more is not nearly enough for trivialization of Raidmobs<br />
5 % more damage per warrior is also not the hit on raids <br />
Better taunt is nice but on raids not needed <br />
<br />
500 HP more is a point of discussion in exp groups <br />
5 % more damage is a bit to equal the lost of groupdamage for taking a warrior<br />
Better taunt is always good and cause of the chance of fail not a guarantee for aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well no fuckin shit Wandor.  And you can kill gods in 6 seconds if you have enough wizards around, wtf is your point? The game shouldn't be based upon a goddamned zerg raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Nerfing mana regen is the worst idea I ever heared anyone say...<br />
So let me get this straight, You say that game is broken because everyone has less downtime now? So you want to sit on your ass and wait for cleric to med after each pull more then not? I say fuck that. I like to be able to be always in action and moving as well as faster whipe recovery. If you dont we disagree in major way. Also since mostly people are exploering pop that has been tuned to luclin gear saying that luclin broke the game is even less credible. I guess you could complain that 1 lvl 65 wizzard can solo all the spiders in velektor but who really gives a fuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Don't be such a fucking ass hole Haass. The example I gave is with 15 UNBUFFED clerics. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that only minor buffs would decrease that number significantly. Or maybe I should spell it out and give you an example with clerics using clarity 1 and a little FT so you can understand that it doesn't take C5+bard+pot9+sd+mob rod+mind wrack+zeevfer's bite to keep a cheal rotation up for long periods of time. Apparently that point was too subtle for you.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, there are a lot of guilds that normally raid with 8+ clerics. I would hardly consider them zerg guilds just because they have a good cleric turn out.<br />
<br />
It hardly takes zerg raids to beat the encounters as they are tuned right now. As I already stated my guild usually raids with 5 to 8 clerics and we have beat everything up to the Zek twins in Time. Even those encounters in Time would be trivialized by a 20% increase in warrior mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I am not in favor of a 20% mitigation increase, and you'll find that I've never stated a number in any of my posts.  I'm in favor of enough of an increase to notice a difference when a warrior is tanking and no more.<br />
<br />
I'm also in favor of BALANCING THE FUCKIN GAME, not just one class.  This game would be a lot different if people looked at the whole game sometimes instead of just their class.  Druids can do way too much and IMO should be nerfed to hell and back, paladins and shadowknights are superior to warriors in every respect that matters, casters can do a metric fuckton of damage now with little or no downtime.  What is the point of being a gear dependant rogue or monk when you can just be a wizard and sustain 120+ DPS with the right buffs?<br />
<br />
Warriors need a mitigation increase to put them back where they are supposed to be.  Paladins and SK's are supposed to be 75% warrior, 25% cleric/Necro respectively.   As it stands, they are about 95% warrior and 60% cleric/necro, and the warrior sits here with not a goddamned thing because some high end pricks think every thing you do to warriors would make the game trivial.  Well guess fuckin what...the game is already trivial.  Now that it's been sufficiently dumbed down for the masses of chimps that play this game (How you can play this game and suck at it baffles me), it's time to BALANCE THE GAME CORRECTLY AND STOP RELEASING EXPANSIONS.  They fixed the way monks mitigate damage.  They can do the same for warriors.</div></div><hr />

I have news for you, to you and me this might be a game, but to SOE - the only people who's opinion really matters - this is a multi-million dollar business. When the people who make the decisions sit down and decide between completely retuning the entire game to fit some antiquated description written by a company that no longer is involved with the game OR putting their energies into releasing another expansion that will profit millions, which do you think they are going to pick?<br />
<br />
Your narrow view and examples you use are suited to fit your arguement, but by neglecting to mention other slightly important facts you make it seem like the game is completely out of balance. There is no point in going to details since you appear to have your mind made up already, but I think most people would agree that some tweaks to make warriors more group friendly is all that is needed for the warrior class at this time.<br />
<br />
SOE has fixed the things that people complained about the most. There is less downtime, travel is easier, lower levels are faster. So yes, the game has been severely dumbed down for the casual player. The changes that are proposed in this thread - the ones that we are discussing - would break the game. No one here has disagreed that something needs to be done to help warrior grouping, that was never in dispute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">frankly I couldnt give a fuck what was written 4 years ago in class desciption about 75/25 thing. It a dynamic game things change all the time IE with every expansion. There is not much out there that still works the same as it did 4 years ago if anything. Mitigation of any class should not be fucked with I would think. Tanks are able to tank other classes are not and thats how it should be. Plus if you would follow that 75/25 thing to the line it would be stupid. Just imagine lvl 65 knights beeing able to cast lvl 30 and below cleirc/necro spells or some shit like that and not being able to tank worth shit. I sure dont want to see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">You have your veiws, I have mine.  The problem is that on this board, no suggestions can ever be made to improve warriors because there is always people that disagree with them.  The warrior community can never come to a consensus on really what would fix us.  The problem lies in the fact that there are so many little factors that have piled up over the last 4 expansions and have gone unchecked that now we're rendering classes obsolete.  Why pick a warrior for an XP group right now?  No reason at all to have them tag along.  At level 58, why pick a cleric over a druid that can do the same healing job, and add in superior utility?<br />
<br />
Making taunt work more won't fix warriors.  In my opinion that's not the problem anyway.  The &quot;aggro lock&quot; that knights can create is what's faulty.  Giving warriors improved natural HP won't fix warriors.  The problem is the piss poor itemization that put us in this situation to begin with. <br />
<br />
Do you see now why you can't just make one fix?  The game needs to be readjusted across the board to bring everything back into line.  Making yet another goddamned bandaid fix is only going to appease the masses until they can fork out another expansion, and it means nothing to the actual game.  Dream world or not, it's the truth, and it deserves to be said.  When you stop caring about your product in favor of how much cash you can crank out, you start losing customers to rival companies.

The warriors in my guild seem to be able to hold pretty good aggro, I would have to make an effort if I wanted aggro from them during XP camps.<br />

However I have seen a lot of warriors in XP groups who have a lot of trouble.  Maybe its lack of weaponry, but also low taunt is a problem.<br />

Heres a couple of idea's that might improve it;<br />
<br />
Make +Hate weapons for warriors super common, droppable versions that you can pick up for 5k would be good.<br />
<br />
BodyBlock - A warrior ability to prevent a mob moving past them.  Like a push, this would not prevent the mob from attacking, but act like a snare/root type attack for a few seconds.  The bigger the mob, the less effect this would have on them, small mobs would be stopped dead, larger mobs snared, and huge mobs wouldnt be impeded.  Refresh time say 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
I like the body block idea, I would like to see warriors with the ability to block a corridor and prevent mobs moving past them.<br />

Wandor, you feel the raiding game is balanced for all classes?  Why, because you're free to nuke, concuss, nuke, concuss ad naseum?  Let's bring skill back to the raiding game.  Remove concussion, keep the warrior the same and hell, let's give paladins something to do in raids.  Let them keep their aggro generating ability, so they can gain aggro immediately after wizards are splattered and warriors can then piggy back off the paladin aggro.

The only way to keep these situations from happening is to increase mitigation or avoidance. A 20% increase to either of those would completely fuck up the delicate balance that has been tuned after months of encounters being beta tested for you by the uber guilds. Right now, PoP bosses are all balance very well in terms of relative difficulty. To compensate for a 20% increase in mitigation you would have to completely rethink the way that PoP encounters work. It's not a simple matter of bumping up mob HP and making them hit harder.<br />
 <br />
<br />
For some reason this statement made me laugh extremely loud...<br />
<br />
DELICATE BALANCE is never something I woule ever attribute to anything in EQ...<br />
<br />
So you are saying that after months of FoH and AL pounding their head into the wall, all of Furor's numerous and amusing posts, that the &quot;Delicate Balance&quot; was created, so that after a single patch (of course AFTER FoH and AL entered time) this &quot;DELICATE BALANCE&quot; suddenly allowed about half the servers to INSTANTLY enter Time? <br />
<br />
SOUND'S more like they gimped it so that everyone else could get in to me... <br />
<br />
There is no delicate balance in EQ... <br />
Every fight in EQ is made trivial by the next expansion...<br />
The only thing that EQ does is decide who they want to be the power class of the week.<br />
<br />
It kind of reminds me of Warhammer/40k whenever a new codex comes out, it HAS to be ALOT more powerful than the last until by the time you get to the end, the first one cant even compete with the last....<br />
<br />
Balance is something I doubt anyone at SoE even can comprehend, It seems each class has a Dev that does everything they can to boost their class... except warriors..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">And you completely ignore the fact that I plainly stated that clerics can have infinite mana unbuffed by just having enough clerics in the cheal rotation.<br />
<br />
This statement is precisely correct.<br />
<br />
When you figure in specilization and spell casting mastery 3, complete heal only uses up around 240 mana per cast.<br />
<br />
316 mana, assuming Specialize: Alteration 200 and Spellcasting Mastery III.  Right idea though.<br />
<br />
At an unbuffed and without FT mana regen rate fo 26 mana/tick it only takes a little over 9 ticks to regen all the mana they used casting.<br />
<br />
Cleric sitting mana regen is 27/tick with maxed meditate skill (1 natural, 1 for sitting, 25 for meditation).  However, you are not considered to be meditating while casting a spell, even if you're riding a horse, so unbuffed mana regeneration is 1 (or 3 at level 65, for some reason).<br />
<br />
More realistically, your raiding cleric is buffed with Voice of Quellious (18/tick), Chorus of Marr (21/tick), and Armor of the Zealot (8/tick), with a Flowing Thought count of (conservatively) 8, and I'll allow an extra 5/tick from assorted mana regen measures like mod rods, Zbite, paragon of spirit or whatever for a total of 60 mana/tick.  That's 6 ticks or 36 seconds to regen a CH; some guilds will be able to cut that down to 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
With 15 clerics a 3 second rotation would have infinite mana with absolutely no buffs.<br />
<br />
I make it 12 clerics fully buffed, but the idea is right.<br />
<br />
Mana regen is not the problem<br />
<br />
Nope, mana regeneration is not the problem if you have 12 clerics per tank.  Hence, uberguilds overcome challenging encounters by employing extremely large numbers of clerics.<br />
<br />
This is retarded, though.  Warriors, and bards, are key raiding classes too, but the &quot;number of clerics&quot; requirement on PoP raids is usually more than the number of warriors plus the number of bards put together.  Step back, lose your preconceptions about how many clerics it takes to raid, and ask yourself how many it ought to take, compared to the number of warriors.<br />
<br />
A change in the tanking ability of warriors would serve to help cut the minimum cleric numbers back down to reasonable levels.  You'd still need a load more clerics than warriors per raid, but at least things would come slightly closer to being in balance.<br />
<br />
In other words, I concur with Vanax.  The tanking change wouldn't trivialize content, it would merely make it defeatable with realistic numbers of clerics.</div></div><hr />

Not hard to test with spells like Hand of Virtue. 4 ticks between start casting and spell going off, can see fairly well your 25 mana regen from meditate is kicking in. I notice it just with casting c5 myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Sscaley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I've been saying since Velious that the high hp/ac items available to all plate classes were breaking the balance between warrior and knight tanking.<br />
<br />
Changes that made knights superior exp-tanks:<br />
<br />
1. Relative HP/AC upgrade from the itemization screwups of all/all or plate/all items<br />
2. DPS upgrade from the 2h revamp<br />
3. Mitigation upgrade from the Knights-&gt;Warrior mitigation table<br />
4. Taunt upgrade from increased mana-regen of buffs, FT and AA skills<br />
5. HP upgrade from the line of selfbuffs<br />
6. Relative tankability upgrade from the line of AA-skills available to the arch-class of plate tanks<br />
7. New spells with each expansion while warriors got nothing unique<br />
<br />
These are the factors that are responsible for knights have gotten so much better at exp-tanking than warriors that it's not even funny. The things that will (help) restore the balance are (in my opinion, and no preferred order):<br />
<br />
1. Real difference between knight and warrior tankability to offset the huge difference in snap-aggro generation on the knights' part - either by bumbing knights down a notch, or increasing warrior tankability (and breaking the high end game in the process) - pick one<br />
2. Better warrior dps for a tad better long-term aggro and differentiating warriors from knights on the offensive term<br />
3. Inherent warrior aggro multiplier like the SK spells, make it non-stackable with the aggro enhancing buffs for no raid impact<br />
<br />
The ideal is that the difference between knights and warriors is that warriors tank superior while knights aggro superior. The knights have (since velious) been ever encroaching on the warrior field of tanking while giving no significant concessions on the aggro-part to warriors other than AE-taunt which is a 15 minute one-shot wonder and does not increase a warrior's chance of getting an exp group at all, especially as mana-regen on knights have been increased to allow more aggro-spells per time unit.<br />
<br />
The problem is that right now, warriors face the same problem that knights did during kunark, they are obsolete in exp-groups. With all the above increases, both active and passive SoE really went way overboard when knights needed upgrades, and they did need upgrades badly in kunark/velious, they just did not need all the upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really really wanna know who came up with this line of BS. Because when people start to believe this, it permeates the entire aggro-lock situation. Nowhere ever was it handed to paladins that they should be the kings of aggro, well the SK's have a little more going for them here, but we always return to balance.  Balance something no one at SoE has a clue about. Theiridea of balance is to addd, add, add...<br />
<br />
Lets look at these basic concepts...<br />
<br />
AGGRO == BAD<br />
<br />
If you draw AGGRO from action it should be considered bad, UNLESS you are the tank.<br />
<br />
It should be easier for EVERY other class to draw aggro, than it is for the tank.<br />
<br />
The tank should never have on-demand, 24/7 aggro capability.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As far as the original topic, Mitigation tables... IMO. We need our own tables. <br />
<br />
But, the way I would change warriors is thus.<br />
<br />
First Remove the discipline  DEFENSIVE, this discipline has been our bane since it was created. It has been one of the reasons why we have sucked at a dry tit for so long.<br />
<br />
Second, give warrior a Skill called Tactics, or some other combat like term. This skill would have a cap of 250. raise 5pts a level from level 1 to level 50.<br />
<br />
Now what does this skill do? Very simple, We all remember the old formula  <br />
<br />
Damage = DI+ DB * (rnd(20))   <br />
<br />
well for warriors this would become now the formula.. <br />
<br />
Damage = DI * (Tactics/1000) + DB * (rnd(20)) * (Tactics/2000)<br />
<br />
Or something very similar... the number can be changed to tweak it some.<br />
<br />
At Level 59 add a new Class AA (3/6/9) that increases Tactics by 2%,5%,10%  so max will be 275 skill.<br />
<br />
At Level 61,63,65 add a planar ability AA (3/3/3) to add 2%,5%, 10% total more to it, making the max Tactics = 300 skill.<br />
<br />
this would add what one line of code to the melee damage algorithm? well maybe 3 as it would be a conditional...<br />
<br />
If (Target.class == War) <br />
    then Damage = DI * (Target.Tactics/1000) + DB * (rnd(20)) * (Target.Tactics/2000)<br />
        else Damage = DI + DB * (rnd(20))<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">First I want to point out some math probs in this thread and then some thinking.<br />
<br />
I am not saying I am for or against the 20% idea, but I didn't take the posters initial idea the way a couple in here are vehemently knocking the poster's idea on.<br />
<br />
A 20% improvement is not = 20% less damage from a mob. So lets get that straight.<br />
<br />
As a &quot;numbers&quot; professional(CPA) let me run the numbers what 20% improvement in damage mitigation means.<br />
<br />
These are numbers chosen for simplicity to illustrate, and does not reflect actual in game mob/damage mitigation tests - but just to illustrate.<br />
<br />
Mob does 1000 damage, and warrior mitigates 50 of that damage. This is our example of warriors currently.<br />
<br />
If we take 20% of the warriors mitigation, as suggested from poster, this = 10 points of damage(50 X 20% = 10). Added to warriors original mitigation then = 60(50 + 10) total points of mitigation if additional mitigation was awarded.<br />
<br />
Our original warrior shrugged off 5% of the damage(50 / 1000 = 5%) OUR IMPROVED 20% MORE MITIGATION WARRIOR shrugged off 6% damage(60 / 1000 =6%).<br />
<br />
In terms of actually taking less damage it equates to 1% change.<br />
<br />
Some of you are thinking 20% less damage from the mob and that is an entirely different ball game. If we calculated the improvement on the warrior for 20% total damage delivered and not mitigated then that would equate to 200 points of damage added to his original 50 points of mitigation or a 400% increase.<br />
<br />
I read some posts above and decided to add some clarification.<br />
<br />
Now as for my opinion.<br />
<br />
1. Warriors need an improvement on damage mitigation.<br />
2. Warriors need to be evaluated in regards to class role ability(when they chose to accept the warrior button on creation) of aggro control vs. equipment ability of aggro control(what they are able to acquire in game).<br />
3. Warriors are screwed up as for being a distinquished role.<br />
<br />
No one is asking to trivialize the game, just to be able to play a class that distinquishes its role.<br />
<br />
Edit: What's with some of these threads of people attacking the character of the poster and not the actual idea the poster is presenting? IMO it comes off either way defensive or like they are better than the other.  And if someone posts a thread using the word asinine at someone(meaning unintelligent), they probably should atleast know how to spell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">3. Mitigation upgrade from the Knights-&gt;Warrior mitigation table<br />
<br />
Warriors have the same mitigation table that knights and clerics do. The only difference is in avoidance, with an approximately 10% increase in skills caps for skills such as dodge, riposte, parry, and the like.<br />
<br />
4. Taunt upgrade from increased mana-regen of buffs, FT and AA skills<br />
<br />
You mean aggro generation capabilities have been increased. It's important to be clear about that. Taunt is not aggro generation (it is simply equalization on the aggro list), and aggro generation is not taunt; they are two entirely seperate things. Taunt is not the warrior issue, rather it is the lack of aggro generation capabilities on demand.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Relative tankability upgrade from the line of AA-skills available to the arch-class of plate tanks<br />
<br />
There was no relative tankability upgrade with the AA skills, and if there was, it is so insignificant as to be not worth comment, as hybrids were already on the same mitigation table as warriors. They both got the same defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Real difference between knight and warrior tankability to offset the huge difference in snap-aggro generation on the knights' part - either by bumbing &lt;snipped for brevity&gt;<br />

I agree completely.</div></div><hr />

If only SoE would take the time and do these things, then things would be a-ok. But chances are they're too busy f00king around with SWG, EQ2, EQOA, And LoE and LDoN to give a crap about what made them great in the world of gaming. Regular ole EverQuest. Everyone's friend. And it seems like the people who are saying warriors don't need fixing or blah blah blah, need to read that last line. I'll even quote it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Sscaley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Warriors have the same mitigation table that knights and clerics do.<br />
Quite so. As you will note, I pointed out that knights had been upgraded from a previously inferior mitigation table to the same one warriors use, this happened during Velious.<br />
<br />
There was no relative tankability upgrade with the AA skills, and if there was, it is so insignificant as to be not worth comment, as hybrids were already on the same mitigation table as warriors. They both got the same defensive AA's.<br />
I disagree, the HP gained from ND is definitely worth more to knights as a larger percentage of their total HP come from +hp/sta items compared to warriors. It waters down the inherent HP advantage of warriors higher base HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Tell me, how much of a difference does that make in raw hitpoints?<br />
<br />
Then work out, how much of a difference does that make in terms of percentage difference in hitpoints?<br />
<br />
I think you'll see that the difference is maybe 1 or 2 percent, and as such is pretty much insignificant.</div></div><hr />

Sad shit, ain't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Sscaley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I didn't say that it was a game-breaking single item, I just noted it as one of the items that, since Velious, when they come together, have made knights better (exp)-tanks than warriors right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Valhalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Im coming in a little late here, and honestly didnt read most of the posts. So someone may have mentioned this, but maybe not. <br />
<br />
It is my understanding that a long, long time ago, in a Norrath far away, Warriors were on a different Mitigation Table than SK/Paladins.<br />
<br />
The problems really started when they were put on the same table and given gear to get them to the Levels of HP/AC as most standard tanks. <br />
<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">That's part of it, yes. A lot of other things have been done to allow knights to  get closer and closer to warrior levels of tanking, or to make the small difference in tankability meaningless.   Also, someone earlier said that now warriors are where knights were in kunark, not wanted in xp groups.  That's not entirely accurate.  In the kunark days, knights could at least solo when they couldnt find groups.  We cant.</div></div><hr />
