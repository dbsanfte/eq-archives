I left before LDON came out and stashed some creds away just incase I came back.  I got about 200k sitting somewhere, and here's my gear . . .<br />

Was wondering if anyone had any advice on items I can get, buy, or quest for.  My old guild disbanded before I left (reason why I left) and I have no clue about augmentations etc.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For your gear, maybe invest in a some droga weapons for a little better agro, but otherwise your gear is looking fine.  Do some Miragul's (EF) LDoN's and pick up an anger aug (I'd grab anger2 - better than anger 1 but not as many points / as much as a grind as anger 3) for your GSoT and you're sorted for agro until you pick up something from a raid.<br />
<br />
As for augments, do adventures, pickup stat and resist augs and put them in your gear.  The buyable augs to look out for (other than procs) are 40hp augs for BP/Legs/Helm/Arms/Feet for 1150 points at EC, and 10AC augs for face/shoulders/neck/waist/back for 510 points at BB, but you probably wont want to shell out on those until your gear is at a point where you know you wont be getting an upgrade for a while.<br />
<br />
None of your gear really stands out as needing attention, so whatever upgrades you do get you will probably be paying a high price for very little gain.  <br />
<br />
Maybe an elemental bow eg. Stonewood compound bow would be a decent investment, but it might be worth sitting on your cash for now and waiting for a good deal on a BoC or SoD or something else kinda special to come your way.</div></div><hr />

A good plan could be to do hard adv to get the 90 / 100 hp various items (100 / 90 hp rings,  90 hp neck, 90 hp earing,  90hp mask, 90 hp haste cloak,  85 hp boots,  85 hp shoulder,  that drop there, while getting decent xp but might lead to quite a few fails. <br />

here is an idea of what you can find at merchant or in hard adv</div></div><hr />
