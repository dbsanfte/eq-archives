Sounds like theres something bad happening in the exchange between your comp and the WoW server when logging in your char.  I take it this just started?  They're always mucking with the back end it seems.  Its possible they added something recently that disagrees with your firewall's software or your cable modem/dsl.<br />
<br />
You try posting on the tech support fourm over at Blizzard's site?<br />
<br />
EDIT: also, is there an upgraded firmware available for your firewall?</div></div><hr />

Planning to call too, since I have VOIP and unlimited long distance. Lastest (2002) firmware has been patched in forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any kind of error logging in the firewall?</div></div><hr />

They never got to the point you're at, because it finally died on them (maybe getting worn out?).  Never found out exactly what the problem was.<br />
<br />
They changed to a Netgear router...or maybe Linksys.  Haven't heard of any problems.</div></div><hr />

i had the same problem but with frozen throne i would log in and game would crash i was also on wireless but the problem was that thier was a firewall or something on certain ports that installed it self and blizzard was trying to go through those ports but i solved it by contacting my wireless provider and the provider of my system....link..and then called blizzard they told me how to open my ports and disable the firewall and re setup for my whole system instead of hvaing like 3 different firewalls....just makes life so much easier</div></div><hr />
