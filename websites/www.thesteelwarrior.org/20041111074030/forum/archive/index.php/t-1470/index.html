<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mitch Megablond</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where to start…well I think all players of pure melee classes (monks rogues and warriors) would agree that we are currently unbalanced compared to the other classes, we have frankly fallen behind in every area that counts, namely:<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
Utility<br />
Desireability<br />
Raid functionality<br />
<br />
This gradual erosion began in Luclin with the advent of FT items and horses and poor itemisation and has continued at a rapid pace since.<br />
<br />
After a lot of thought on this matter I have come up with some proposals which I would like the communities feedback on, and though this i'm a monk I’d welcome warrior feedback as well.<br />
<br />
Some of my points pertain exclusively to monks and for that I apologise but I do not have the depth of experience of warriors with which to fully address all the genuine concerns I know they have. Most of what I will address does concern all melees equally though.<br />
<br />
The areas I have identified as being of most concern are:<br />
<br />
Itemisation<br />
Buffs<br />
Utility<br />
Disciplines<br />
<br />
First I’d like to look at itemisation, it has long been prevalent to have multiple classes able to use the same items, lately these have tended to be split into their sub-classes of mnk/bas or pall/sk or into slightly wider ones of perhaps warr/ran/pall/sk/bard/rog. There are also of course the all/all items (more on them later).<br />
<br />
The difficulty with this system is that classes in EQ are measured in 2 ways if melee, HP and ATT (AC is mainly just for bragging rights unless insanely high). Now the caster classes are measured in not 2 but 4 ways, HP, DPS (as melee) but also in FT (mana regen) and Mana (mana pool size).<br />
<br />
This system means that when we see an item which has HP, Mana and perhaps FT and a spell focus as well that the casting classes receive a –double benefit- from the same item as opposed to a pure melee. Think of this using the following analogy, a Wizard ad a Warrior both go do the same job for the same amount of time but when it comes to collect their pay the Wizard gets double the money of the warrior.<br />
<br />
This double benefit to casters is clearly unbalanced but there is a simple way to address it.<br />
<br />
Firstly All/All items should be replaced with items that have generic stats for HP, Mana and show the effects that would apply to the class using it, let me illustrate with an example:<br />
<br />
Staff of Balance<br />
Primary secondary<br />
35/30<br />
+5 to all resists<br />
Melee HP 150 Mana 0<br />
Caster HP 50 Mana 100<br />
Hybrid HP 100 Mana 50<br />
AC 15 Str+10 Int+10 Wis+10<br />
Melee : Vengence V<br />
Caster: FT 3<br />
Hybrid: Vengence II &amp; FT 1<br />
Classes: All/All<br />
<br />
As you can see the item delivers the same total benefit to each of the classes that can use it but does not reward one class in more ways than another, hybrids (bards, pall, SK, Rng) get a mix of the 2 but still only receive the same total number of HP/Mana that the item has to offer.<br />
<br />
As far as making this work there are 2 options, either the engine identifies the class who wields it and adjusts accordingly or, and probably more simply, each zone has a NPC that you can hand the item to and it will cycle through the various types until you find the one for your class.<br />
<br />
At a stroke this mechanism would remove a large part of the melee caster imbalance that exists in the game today. To apply this retrospectively to all items is probably too large a job so lets be realistic and say apply it to all PoP zones and future expansions plus certain other high end items as SOE sees fit (Emp Loot, Seru Loot , VT loot etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next part of my melee fix involves buffs, specifically HP buffs. I’m going to use as an example a made up buff as below:<br />
<br />
Buffage<br />
Target receives 1000 HP<br />
Allowable targets : all over 46th level<br />
<br />
<br />
Now this buff looks innocuous enough, a basic example version of HoV or Virtue perhaps but its exactly this type of buff that has crept, insidously into the EQ psyche and caused such damage because it weakens the advantages of melee over casters in most situations. You see a melee should always have more HP (assuming same level of play) than a caster and it should be a good sized margin, frankly there is no way that a similarly equipped druid or cleric should be within a couple of hundred HP of a fully buffed rogue or monk, it just shouldn’t happen that way because high HP are one of the advantages of such classes when compared to a pure caster.<br />
<br />
Lets use some more examples to illustrate this point: (all examples at 65th and only approximate)<br />
<br />
Unbuffed HP<br />
<br />
Warrior 7297 (example uses 250th placed warrior on EQ rankings)<br />
Palladin 5970 (example uses 250th placed palladin on EQ rankings)<br />
Rogue 5216 (example uses 250th placed rogue on EQ rankings)<br />
Monk 5289 (example uses 250th placed monk on EQ rankings)<br />
Druid 4165 (example uses 250th placed druid on EQ rankings)<br />
Wizard 3449 (example uses 250th placed wizard on EQ rankings)<br />
<br />
Fully raid buffed HP (assumes 2500hp of buffs)<br />
<br />
Warrior 9797<br />
Palladin 8470<br />
Rogue 7716<br />
Monk 7789<br />
Druid 6665<br />
Wizard 5949<br />
<br />
<br />
Unbuffed warrior is our baseline for comparision<br />
Unbuffed the Palladin has 81.81% of the HP of the warrior<br />
Unbuffed the Rogue has 71.48% of the HP of the warrior<br />
Unbuffed the Monk has 72.48% of the HP of the warrior<br />
Unbuffed the Druid has 57.08% of the HP of the warrior<br />
Unbuffed the Wizard has 42.27% of the HP of the warrior<br />
<br />
All those ratios seem fairly inline with what you would expect but now lets look at the stats buffed:<br />
buffed warrior is our baseline for comparision<br />
buffed the Palladin has 86.46% of the HP of the warrior<br />
buffed the Rogue has 78.76% of the HP of the warrior<br />
buffed the Monk has 79.50% of the HP of the warrior<br />
buffed the Druid has 68.03% of the HP of the warrior<br />
buffed the Wizard has 60.72% of the HP of the warrior<br />
<br />
As you can see the buffs have dramatically altered the ratios in favour of pure casters whilst making only very small changes to the palladin monk and rogue. To be specific the following increases have happened:<br />
<br />
Palladin % HP increase 41.88<br />
Rogue % HP increase 47.93<br />
Monk % HP increase 47.27<br />
Druid % HP increase 60.02<br />
Wizard % HP increase 72.48<br />
<br />
The above figures clearly show the huge imbalance happening here and remember that the higher the amount of HP buffs you have the greater the imbalance becomes. These type of generic buffs eat away at one of the primary advantages of the melee classes, namely their HP advantage.<br />
<br />
There is a simple and elegant way to resolve this, buffs need to add HP based on class, something like this:<br />
<br />
Warriors get 120% of Base HP given by the buff<br />
Palladins and SK’s get 110%<br />
Monks rogues rangers bards get 100%<br />
Bst Clerics Shaman druids get 90%<br />
Chanters Wiz Necro and Mage get 80%<br />
<br />
By doing this you would maintain the class HP advantages which were intended from the very start of EQ and upon which all our most basic concepts of balance began.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of what this would do to the above raid buffed figures:<br />
<br />
Fully raid buffed HP (assumes 2500hp of buffs) as things stand<br />
<br />
Warrior 9797<br />
Palladin 8470<br />
Rogue 7716<br />
Monk 7789<br />
Druid 6665<br />
Wizard 5949<br />
<br />
Fully raid buffed HP with proportional buffing<br />
<br />
Warrior 10297<br />
Palladin 8720<br />
Rogue 7716<br />
Monk 7789<br />
Druid 7539<br />
Wizard 5449<br />
<br />
The wizard now has 52.92% of the HP of the warrior fully buffed, still an increase over his starting point of 42.27% unbuffed but not so much as to threaten the melee advantage noticeably.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next topic I’d like to discuss is utility for the pure melee classes (monk rogue warrior)<br />
<br />
As things stand the pure melee has little to no utility at the endgame or before, sure we can buy potions and have the odd little clicky effect on items but basically most of the very basic most simple utility in EQ is not available to us and just like melee binding (thanks soulbinders) and no travel (thanks PoK books) its time to give the melee a few totally harmless and unbalancing bits of utility that DON’T AFFECT any of the other classes in any way at all but simply make our life that little bit easier to live with. Remember, the game is about fun, not hassle.<br />
<br />
To this end I’ve come up with an idea to give utility to melees. All these apply only to the melee themselves, cannot be cast on others (OMG she said cast) and are subject to the normal casting times but do not have fizzle rates or mana requirements, such as the clickable spell effects we have on items.<br />
<br />
I suggest a series of Innate abilities starting at level 58 and ending at 65 with one given each level and utilising the Spell icons to use.<br />
<br />
These are just my first thoughts on this so look at it more as a concept that as a hard and fast proposal:<br />
<br />
Level 58        Regeneration (lowest level version)<br />
Level 59 Levitate (requires components, lowest level version)<br />
Level 60 EB )requires component, lowest level version)<br />
Level 61 Heat sight<br />
Level 62 Bind (subject to same limitations as casters and really not a big deal since soulbinders)<br />
Level 63 Damage shield (lowest level version)<br />
Level 64 Invis to Undead (lowest level version)<br />
Level 65 Invisibility (lowest level version)<br />
<br />
All would be identical in all ways to their normal versions and be subject to a fixed rcast time of perhaps 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of them impinges on any group utility of other classes as they are self only, they are also very low level so of only tiny impoact to a character of those levels but nonetheless the monks rogues and warriors out there would, I believe, love this kind of ‘cantrip’ ability and it would take away some of the small hassles we deal with every day whilst hurting no other classes in any way at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly I’d like to discuss disciplines, frankly the melee disciplines are totally messed up, you have gems like defensive and utter crap like the monk assassination one, every discipline for pure melee needs reexamining and some (and here I focus just on monks) need trashing and replacing.<br />
<br />
Edit:  deleted monk specific stuff so as not to bore the Ogres :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
That’s pretty much all I have to say on the subject of melee balancing so feel free to discuss or disagree but take any flames elsewhere and lets have some sensible debate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dall18or</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like what you wrote about itemization and buffs, those are both well though out things I agree with. In terms of buffs there are also many buffs that are useful to caster and prioest while only a bare few that are only useful to melee. Examples of caster usefulness are KEI, Spirtual Purity, spells that lower cast time. While for melee I can only think of buff's that raise only atk suck as Spirit of the Predator. This may not be correct because I have seen some higher end casters use fantastic weapons and containing high dmg procs melee. <br />
<br />
What I do not like though is how you figure to deal with. Our utility should deal with our utility in combat situations. Those small quick fix spells that dont get called spells don't address any issue they will just be one more thing so people can say &quot;We let you have that your all better, you don't need to be addressed for another 3 years&quot; Would sujest tuning our classes to be able to deal with certain situations differently. I had heard mention by someone on the boards about a bar that when turned one way our class would highten towards defensiveness, and when on the other side would lean towards offensiveness. I really like this idea. When being a tank the tank can play this role. But all those other warriors who are just excess bagage that NOBODy wants can tune themselves to be higher damge melee's at the cost of their warrior defensiveness. It goes to show a calm precise warrior will parry and calcuate his moves drawing out the fight and stustaining little injury to himself, while a berserk crazed warrior will attack all out not caring what injuries he stustains so he will be able to be hurt badly but he will deal damage out faster and end the fight quicker. <br />
<br />
<br />
No to much comment on disciplines. They are al really stupid. /deleate all classes disciplines will make the game better. The only class that will complain is rangers I imagine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunndarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there is nothing wrong with the buffs that are more specific to certain types of classes.  casters get mana regen spells, yet melees get haste, SoP, avatar,  and ferocity.  if anything casters should complain, not melee.<br />
<br />
also, the innate casting ability is utter crap.  there are items in game which can do each spell you mentioned, so would just be a waste of time to patch in the codes for it.<br />
<br />
HP buffs, they are fine as is.  if anything needs to be fixed in reguards to HP it is the STA to HP ratio with STA above 255.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the class balance forum.<br />
<br />
And Thundarr I'm so glad you don't post very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Itemization and Buffs I am 1000% in aggreement...<br />
<br />
This is what to me has radically changed the game for the worse.<br />
<br />
The Utility... the spell-like ability is nice, wouldnt really help us all that much unless we were without a group. As melee by design we were meant to group, instead i suggest skills.<br />
<br />
I also think we should get some skills.<br />
<br />
What I think is that PURE melee should get a list of skills, kind of like AA. <br />
At certain Levels they get to choose a skill. <br />
<br />
say level 20,40,50,55,60,61,62,63,64,65.<br />
<br />
Some skills only available at high levels, some skills trained multiple times, and have prerequisites. (( think of feats in  3e D&amp;D ))<br />
<br />
Make the list large and varried, unlike AA's where people can just spend endless hours to get all of them, these would make people make choices... Specialize warriors in certain skills dual wields, weapon-shields, ranged  etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Itemization is key i think . For an example just compare all the warlord armor with the ornate armor , most peices of ornate are 1-4 ac better only and warlord armor is from velious , 3 expansions ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I don't see why pure melee never got specializations like pure casters do.  Higher innate damage, or something for melee skill, or specialize in avoidance or defense</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Specilaizations I would want us to have:<br />
<br />
Two-handed Weapon (more damage/decrease delay)<br />
Shield (Better ability to fight with a shield/make 1her faster/more damaging when using a shield/better ability to mitigate damage)<br />
Willpower (Makes it so tank can stay on their feet after hit points have reached 0 for between 2-15 seconds longer, but still dies at the end/ during this time weapon delay is doubled but damage is tripled)<br />
Swordsman (Makes warrior able to increase personal haste by decreasing amount of weight and bags on them.  If the warrior is carrying no bags or extra equipment and has weight of less than 10% of capacity like 30/305 the warrior has 100% extra haste even above haste cap)<br />
Crossbowsman (Warrior can get Endless Quiver and can use a crossbow, a slow delay bow that shoots two arrows at a time)<br />
Resistant (Warrior grows more and more resistant to magical attacks over time (eventually a 200 MR base) as well as two other resists of 150 base)<br />
Accuracy (Warrior has a  better chance of hitting than base -- like TM, only better)<br />
Snarer (Warrior can snare a target using some sort of item out of inventory once every two minutes -- unresistable if target can be effected by snare)<br />
Stunner (Warrior has a natural ability to proc a stun using any weapon swing)<br />
Leadership (Warrior increases the attack of all members of the party just by being in it and if party members are in close proximity)<br />
Smasher (Warrior decreases the AC of the target over time 100 AC every 5 ticks at level 65 up to 500 AC maximum)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like the idea of specilaizations, espically the ones that make us inately better at our melee skills.<br />
<br />
I also like the idea about itemization and buffs.  That really is the root of our decline over the last few expansions.  Equilivent warrior items to the hybrid items come from only the hardest encounters in the game, where hybrid items are signifigantly easier to get.  The buff idea is just great.<br />
<br />
I disagree with the utility idea though.  Creative idea for sure, but we need to avoid bandaids that don't adderss the problem, like oh say, /shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we get 5 ac, 6 stats advantage.<br />

<br />
so for 13 ac we give up 160 in hp/mana<br />
edge - not even close... paladins <br />
<br />
No longer do PAL's need to make the choice of Tank or Caster gear, they get both from the same thing... This is but one of the factors that has created the great imbalance in EQ... And It is something that is almost impossible to correct at this date without completely reitemizing the game. <br />
<br />
The best I can come up with that is workable, is giving <br />
since AA's can give people bonus's I am sure it is easy to code in this into the base classes...<br />
<br />
all pure melee bonus's in ac/hp +20 %<br />
hybrids are base line<br />
all pure casters get ac/hp - 20%   mana +20%<br />
<br />
This will not fix things but it is a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You're right, it's not the end fix, but it is a start.  The additional hit points, either naturally or through a modified buff code that made hit point buffs land for more on warriors and leaving the hybrids the same, is a good start.<br />
<br />
However, I don't think your suggestion for the pure casters will ever see the light of day.  The reason being that the fixes to warriors for the edge in tanking and for aggro control have to be centered on us, I don't think SoE will seriously consider any changes we ask for that nerf other classes.  I know you compensated by giving them an additional 20% mana, but I don't thin that will be enough, they need those hit points to stay alive too.<br />

Also, like Kazzuk says, we need to all be posting in the stickied thread.  The more we spread this out the harder it will be to track down what we want if someone from SoE should stop by for a read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One class needs to be the base. Since 90% of gear has HP/Mana and hybrids are best served by that gear. I assume Hybrids as base-line, pure casters will gain magic advantage, pure melee will gain hp/ac advantage. <br />
<br />
The problem I see is that all of the discussions of class balancing have never looked at the whole picture. they look at casters balancing, melee balancing, then hybrid vs casters and hybrid vs melee... in the end, what happens is that hybrids become extra powered losing all their drawbacks and gaining on the 'pure' classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually IMO the ratio of warrior HP/AC to other class HP/AC should remain the same whether you're naked, equipped but unbuffed, or equipped and fully buffed.<br />
<br />
If I have 3000 hps naked and a wizzy has 1500 and fully buffed I have 10000 hps that same wizzy should have 5000 fully buffed.  By the same token if knights have 75% of warrior hps without gear or buffs assuming the same STA they should also have 75% of warrior hps with equivalent gear and full buffs.<br />
<br />
It really shouldn't take that much work to add a class based multiplier for HPs and AC that affects gear bonuses and buffs.  So if I have 2x the hps of a wizzy naked then virtue gives me double the hps it gives the wizzy.  If a wizzy puts on a 100 hp item he gets 100 hps, if I put that same item on I get 200.</div></div><hr />

HEADBUTT<br />
Player screams out in rage and smashes his head into %t.<br />
<br />
make it cap at say 235.<br />
the skill adds 500 hate + taunt effect.<br />
at skills over 200 it adds a chance to stun.<br />
reuse timer 3 minutes.<br />
 this should be low enuf to use once on almost every mob, whilst still resetting fast enuf to use on boss mobs more than once.<br />
this being a skill would keep disc's free while providing us an innate ability to add to the hate list. the cap would insure its not to powerful to screw any other class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1mana =/= 1HP for purposes of equipment choice.<br />
<br />
If I had a choice of something with 50hp and 100mana and something with 120hp, Im going to take the 120hp hands down.<br />
Nearly EVERY hybrid will who knows what they are doing will make the same choice.<br />
<br />
+mana is useful, but not as useful as warriors would like to make it.  Remember that +100 mana is not really 100 mana for a hybrid.<br />
We get the 100 mana added to our totals on goofball &quot;rankings&quot; sites, but our spells cost +20% over the costs shown on lucy...  so if a spell costs 100mana, then we pay 120mana for it.  If an item has +120 HP, we get all the AAXP bonuses for it, on top of the fact we have no penalties in regards to it.<br />
<br />
Being ALIVE to cast such a spell is more important to a hybrid than having an extra 100 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree itemization is a problem, (it is for ALL classes) but landrains assumptions about hybrid armors is WAY out of whack.<br />
(all melee -including hybrids- could use effects that benefit melee combat...  similar to caster focus items.... and BEFORE time please...  also would be nice if they'd TELL us what they do.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Would I mind if Warrior armor had more HP on it?<br />
<br />
Nope<br />

<br />
So you are saying that having 100hp+ / 100+ mana in every slot has not increased your power immensely, in comparison to 100hp only? <br />
<br />
That the additional 1500+ mana even if it is only as you say 1200+ mana has no effect on your abilities to cast more spells than you normally would? To go longer without medding? That if you had to choose HP or Mana that it would not affect your abilities?<br />
<br />
The problem is, THER IS NO REASON TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES...<br />
<br />
they give you the warrior hps and the cleric mana...</div></div><hr />
