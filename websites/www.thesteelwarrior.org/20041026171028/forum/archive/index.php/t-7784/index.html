<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find it sad that lately I've actually had to debate whether or not I should bother even logging in to trader-mode.<br />
<br />
I'm not even sure what's changed lately. I have quests I want to complete, but from experience I know that the reward will have little to no percievable impact on my tanking ability. I remember doing my noob armor quests with my druid when I was new to the game. It was an awesome experience wandering around Kelethin and the Faydark looking for components. I couldn't wait to log in each day and work knowing that my time was not wasted on some invaluable trinket. I wore that armor until I was in my 40's, when I started replacing a few pieces with acrylia studded that I made myself through working up my tailoring skill, and then camping in the elysians in the Umbral Plains from my elysian armor, which I still use today.<br />
<br />
Contrast that with the fact that the only way I get upgrades now is through the bazaar, both for my warrior and druid. I miss being able to look forward to working (not farming pp) towards my next upgrade.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering, what happened to EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've hit the ceiling of truly casual content.<br />
<br />
 As someone else said, once you get Ornate and the best of the Bazaar gear, it doesn't get you any new content, it just allows you to do the older content you were already doing easier. Yawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, you just hit that glass celing for casuals. You'll either do adventures or hope for mudflation to get yourself better gear and more content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was involved in a really big debate over on Monkly Business about this very topic.  The thread is dying now, which is probably just as well since all the important points on both sides of the issue have pretty much been covered.  Sometimes very vehemently, the opinions on the topic vary a LOT.  But my perception is that SoE has continued to lift the difficulty bar each expansion since PoP without giving the non-raider player a real opportunity to advance appropriately to meet it.<br />
<br />
Of course many people pointed to LDoN as the non-raider improvement path.  And then we had the non-raider who responded that to get where they felt they had most of the improvements out of LDoN they needed, they'd been working at it for 40 hours a week for 9 months.  Hardly something most people are going to be able to reasonably accomplish.<br />
<br />
I've left the game myself because I've hit the wall.  The point where investing more time and energy into the game gives such minuscule returns that even if you tested before and after, the change falls well within the margin of error.  SoE, imho, has really screwed the pooch in that they've tied up the majority of the content, the majority of the worth while items, and the majority of the progress into raiding.  It used to be that raiding was an extra added to the game.  Something you did when you wanted EQ+.  These days it has turned into the game and if you're not doing it you're getting EQ lite.<br />
<br />
They've fumbled the ball, badly.  It really is debatable whether or not they'll even realize it and pick it back up, in as much as they obviously put a great deal of stock into what the raiding population thinks, and this particular issue is one that doesn't negatively impact the raiding population and many raiders are pretty strongly against changing.</div></div><hr />

Glatius, could you link that thread? Also, I agree, LDoN should have been our (non-raider's) solution to gear progression, but the devs really failed on execution. At 65, LDoN is a major grind for non-raiders even by optimistic, but still realistic, estimates. Its even worse if your are not 65. Vikken spent most of his time leveling in LDoN, but he's just now got to where he can buy the level 45 armor in MM at 55, and that's just one piece, of which he could have and has bought better in the bazaar, for multiple slots. I still believe the point rewards are too little and don't scale correctly with the item costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, LDoN is a quest if you think about it, but even then I've still ended up buying upgrades instead. LDoN would/should have been the ultimate non-raiders progressive quest. However, since you can't turn the gear back in, there really is no point in spending your much more valuable time earned points for shitty gear when it's best to just buy upgrades hoping one day to be able to spend those points on something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
And this isn't because the buyable gear in the bazaar is underpriced. IMO, on my server fierce heraldic is right where it needs to be for the income that is attainable by those who would find the gear useful.</div></div><hr />

 It's not even so much that in my eyes - it's then what do you do? If you've done your tour of the lower tiers in PoP and (depending on your guild) tried stuff like Xanamech and Rumblecrush and the like, at some point you're running into the problem that the gear you upgrade may make it easier to do what you're already trying, but there's nothing beyond it. What's locked away is locked away behind timed flag mobs and incredibly long key quests that - even if by some miracle you get your key/flag/whooziz, requires you to have 40-50 (casual) folks to bypass some part of the content, if not more.</div></div><hr />

Wow, thats a long thread. It's gonna take me a long while to get through all that, but the quotes from Absor are disturbing. It's hard to believe that someone could be so out of touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaknaafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Reading those pages linked above, I just felt like I was reading a dialogue between whiners and realists. I am a casual player, although I do raid often, I'm not uber because we are a small guild. I wasn't &quot;old&quot; for EQ mainstream player base when I first started, but I guess I am now .. do I really need to describe to you the kinds of games my brother and I spent hours and hours on day after day for months at a time on?( Frogger anyone? pacman? or the uber advanced Ms. pacman?) With graphics that basically never changed? If you're bored with EQ --fine, you're bored with EQ -- noone ever said a game was supposed to keep your interest for the rest of your life. But i don't see how this is EQ's fault. A guildy recently linked his fully stacked 1400 or whatever point ldon bp in guild chat and I was imediately pissed that it was so much better than my raided for ornate bp (minus the buff which everyone says is useless anyway, but i love it ) , but I stopped and thought a min about the amount of time and work he put into getting that, and realized he deservered it.<br />
<br />
EQ has been a time sink since day one -- since the day I sat my ass on a boat for 30 min just watching the scenery -- then realized I had to make a corpse run on the boat 5 min after getting off it and possibly fail and have to do it all over again, and again, and again. It was true back then, if you don't enjoy riding a boat for hours  trying and retrying to retreive your corpse, humiliatingly begging other players for a hand, then so what? don't play. But don't whine to SoE for creating an entirely unique experience which is challenging as hell just because you had a hard time.<br />
<br />
That path to progression outlined on the first page of that link is completely viable  if you don't want to take it, fine, but it is all one groupable, I'm doing it in weaker gear than the one groupers I see in top ldon gear, but it is a time sink -- it has always been a time sink, and it has always been (especially for warriors) entirely dependent upon the relationships you build in EQ and how much you can do with them. ldon - hard ldon - god is possible ending in time type gear. Raiding will get you superior gear. Both are a HUGE time sink. If you don't enjoy it then you're probably one step ahead of the rest of us irl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi, raiders dont get to turn in the gear they spent dkp on 2 months ago when they upgrade. Casuals do need to be able *reasonably* keep up with the expansions, and there does need to be content relavent for them.<br />
<br />
But whining because &quot;ubers&quot; get to see zones you dont etc is BS. You didnt put in the work,dont complain because you dont have the reward.And saying its not the time but the path is just as much BS.<br />
If I drive for an hour towards point A, and you do the same to point B, dont whine because you arent at point A.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think that the point was, not that raiders will have a select few zones that only they gain access to, but that a substantial portion of both PoP and GoD have been locked behind flagged zones.  And the very people who argued that this was a good thing because it excluded the idiot non-raiders (of course they never admitted that it did nothing to exclude the idiot raiders, and there are plenty of those as well) also claimed that the quests involved in getting the flags outside of a raid were relatively trivial.  If they're so easy, why do guilds continually back flag?  Why do guilds set up flagging agreements with other guilds?  I guess the quests must not be all THAT easy.   <br />
<br />
Understand this, if the majority of people reach a point where they feel their play style isn't supported adequately by the game, they're going to leave.  And that is going to impact SoE and anyone else left in the game.  While people may disagree as to whether or not the majority of people feel their style of play is or isn't supported, the numbers don't lie.  If subscriptions are going down, there is a reason for that.  People who have been playing this game for years are leaving.  If the game could hold their attention for 3 and 4 years, yet now they're suddenly deciding to leave, why is that?<br />
<br />
Oh and raiders really really need to stop referring to everyone as whiners who doesn't raid and feels that the raid game is over supported in comparison to the player base that it represents.  Raiders want their benefits for putting up with raiding, I think everyone knows and understands that.  But using that as justification for supporting a status quo that seems to be driving people from the game in droves just cuts off your nose to spite your face.   And setting up 1/2 to 3/4 of an expansion behind locked doors is not player friendly.  It may be raider friendly, but it most certainly is not player friendly.<br />
<br />
Now, if SoE wants to keep moving EQ into the all raid all the time mode, fine, more power to them.  Just don't expect to keep people like me as customers.   If our happiness as customers is less important than raiders' happiness as customers, I imagine that people who feel like I do will do what I've done, take their money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
If people are whiners because they don't want to make a &quot;leisure&quot; activity a second job and commit 40 hours a week to it to still not feel like they're making good progress and have places to go, then so be it.  Obviously EQ is becoming a game that is primarily for people who can either focus huges amounts of time on it as a non-raider, are willing to commit almost all their time to raiding, or a accepting of piddly ass progress that isn't even a noticable improvement after months of work.  That doesn't strike me as a really &quot;big&quot; draw on people's interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have been both raider and non-raider in EQ (am currently unguilded non-raider), and I just wanted to comment on the issue of time sinks. &quot;Time sinks&quot; and &quot;grinds&quot; keep getting brought up in regards to the non-raiders path through LDoN, GoD, etc. I want to make sure we are all clear about the amount of time sinks and grinding involved in raiding. Emp Keys, Emp Bane, Seru crap, VT Key, BoT access parts, BoT Tower keys, PoP progression Flags, etc.. <br />
<br />
I am not even close to being one of the hard core raiders that frequent this board, and I have killed some of the mobs in Kael, Ssra, VT, and lower tier PoP dozens of times each in the process of getting people flagged, geared up, etc. The &quot;grinding&quot; you speak of is not limited to the non-raider paths in EQ...IT IS EQ.<br />
<br />
On a side note Im not sure I agree about where you say the glass ceiling is in EQ. In my opinion you aren't even close to that glass ceiling with Vikken. Yoiu can level to 65, get many more aa's in a wide variety of places, Improve your gear significantly with just single group stuff, and do a great deal of progression through early PoP, LDoN, and then GoD. Anyway, not saying a ceiling of sorts doesn't exist for non-raiders, but I dont think you can claim to have hit it at level 55 with no aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi, raiders dont get to turn in the gear they spent dkp on 2 months ago when they upgrade. <br />
<br />
Well it seems to me that if acquiring the gear in LDoN was so easy that people should be expecting to gain the same points 2 and 3 times in order to buy the mid-level upgrades rather than waiting on the best possible purchase, then raiders would be plowing through LDoN and purchasing their upgrades as well, right?  Wrong.  That's not what's happening.  Why is that do you think?<br />
<br />
Could it be because a raider in the amount of time it would take them to purchase the very best LDoN has to offer can get two or three upgrades for the same slots by raiding?  If that's not true, if raiders aren't gaining better gear faster by raiding than by doing LDoN, why aren't more of them doing LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Could it be because a raider in the amount of time it would take them to purchase the very best LDoN has to offer can get two or three upgrades for the same slots by raiding?

<br />
Not really intending to argue with this... but maybe they don't like LDoN? Some people actually ENJOY raiding (I don't count myself among them). I still think EQ should have an alternate path to all the hgh-end zones, that this 'glass ceiling' shouldn't exist. But it does. Deal with it, and either leave the game or make the most of it. EQ is your money, spend it how YOU want to and don't whine to ME about it when you make a bad choice.<br />
<br />
PS: Alright fine, if someone got you EQ as a birthday present and it sucks for you, you can whine to them, but even that is bad ethics. It's the thought that counts right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Quest's dont count as progression flags (For PoP)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may be right, but two things to consider.<br />
<br />
1.  If the best and fastest loot was in LDoN, wouldn't raiders be gearing up there in order to improve their raiding regardless of their like or dislike?<br />
<br />
2.  If raiders don't like LDoN, why should it be one of the primary progression paths for non-raiders, or aren't they allowed to dislike it as well?<br />
<br />
Deal with it, and either leave the game or make the most of it. EQ is your money, spend it how YOU want to and don't whine to ME about it when you make a bad choice.<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm not whining to you about anything.  I'm expressing an opinion in hopes that someone somewhere in SoE might get the point.  But the easy solution for you not wanting to hear about it is to simply stop reading threads like this one.  No one is holding a gun to your head making you suffer through it after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true, that I'm not as geared up as I could be, but if you look at my dream profile, you'll see I have realistic goals setup from making my character better. The point is that after I've gotten those item, it won't be long now, there are very few significant upgrades from me to be looking forward to without grinding forever in LDoN. I could do that, but it is my OPINION that the rewards do not fit with the time involved. I've expressed this eslewhere, but I do not thing that the reward scale well with the time involved.<br />
<br />
Raider have to do flagging event, learn new encounter, but after that is all said and done, they hit farm mode and start cranking out those drops. There is a payoff to your hardwork.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to argue about raiders vs non-raiders. The point I was trying to make was that I miss being able to quest, really honest to goodness quest, for upgrades and be able to go out and fight in the zone that I play in and get upgrades from there. And maybe, just, maybe, be able to tell a difference after I complete the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Unless 1300 AC is a magic number (I'm not far from it), I doubt I'll see much of a differenence when I'm tanking PoP. And BTW, Vikken is 55 for a reason. It is the level that my guild is lacking xp tanks is quantity. Aeriwen is 58 for %heal that comes at that level, otherwise I happen to like be able to xp in more than a few zones and have to fight over camps. Yes they are both working AA.</div></div><hr />

The diference is that LDoN is a progressive quest, or at least should have been. Noone here is whining about anything, just stating an opinion in the hope that some good changes will come about. If it were not an issue then how come it strikes a cord so well wehn the topic is brought up on all the class boards?<br />

I do like that analogy though, minus the whining part. However there better be a whorthwhile alternative at A compared to B.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">you know what i think it comes down to is a misjudgement on the part of soe first of all followed by sony.<br />
<br />
when kunark came out i seriously expected the level cap to be raised to 70. it was 60. when velious came out i lowered my expectations to only 70. it was aa. when luclin came out i hoped for 70. it was squat. when pop came out we finally got a whopping 5 levels. ykesha ldon and god gave us no levels at all. <br />
<br />
we should be at level 200 by now. but i really think they designed much of the coding in the early days to not easily expand up endlessly in levels so they probably couldnt do it even if philisophically they thought it would have been a good idea.<br />
<br />
but of course they really would love us all to play for years and years so they can keep bringing in revenue. so what do they do? they make the progression slower and slower in order that we would not be able to exhaust the content before the next expansion comes out even though our gains in power from one expansion to the next is trivial compared to how fast we were able to progress in the early days. remember in the early days before kunark it was typical to get a level every 4-10 hours or so online. and a level back then had the same effect on our &quot;power&quot; as 3-6 months worth of work today. 3 months assumes you play a LOT.<br />
<br />
no wonder we are all getting bored. not everyone is bored by this system but i think its undeniable that eq seems a lot more like &quot;work&quot; today than it did 4 years ago. those like me who do a lot of ldon get to spend a year to get 2 anger augs one breastplate 5 10-ac augs and .. well sometime this week i think ill get leggings finally too and increase my hitpoints by a whopping 40 or so. those who do raids spend months getting flagged for the new content of whatever expansion they are working on at the time and a few more months getting their 1000hp upgrade that the new content opens up. we all have one thing in common. we are all investing HUGE time to get rather modest gains compared to what we had in the prekunark days. so yeah it does seem like rather dull work no matter what your strategy of progression is.</div></div><hr />

Luckily, I'm in such an old-school and casual guild I'm not letting anyone down. Play when I can, do what I can, don't sweat the rest.<br />
I'll tell you what I've found is interesting: go to newbie and low-level zones and find people who are new to the game and who are not asshats. They'll be fighting things and not begging and not wearing twink gear. Talk to them. Help them a little (I tend not to give them twink gear, but I'll help them get better gear or make it very difficult for them to die if they want to try something new). Go to mid-level zones and, if you see a corpse, /who all corpsename. Offer to help on the CR. <br />
Watch what other people are doing. My server has a number of people who are long-time players (I mean since 1999 or early 2000) who don't have any characters over lvl 60. Some of these folks are odd, but interesting companions.<br />
I frequently get tells from folks I've met and helped, sometimes years ago. Often they are much more powerful than I am now. But usually the fools will forget me and the cooler players will remember. <br />

The thing is that ever since pop items were upgraded too damn much. Gear that was available in PoP made ALL previous expansions trival to me. Thats not good. Not good at all. Basicly all my fav zones like revamped CT or Sebelis, HS, Veleks(not spiders) became useless to me. There was no point going there anymore. XP started sucking by PoP standards, they no longer provided a chalenge. So now like anyone with a brain I was hanging out in good xp zones that are only avilable in latest expansion. Which limited me to CoD, Tactics and robots in PoI. Out of those 3 I only like CoD and Tactics and its resonably hard for me to get a group going for CoD. So whole single zone was left for me to have fun in! Whoopy.<br />
<br />
Thats how the game got screwed imo. None of this raider/non-raider stuff mattered. Basicly SoE shot themselves in the foot with pop. They kill any and all uses for lvl 60+ player to be anywhere but in pop.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS<br />
when kunark came out i seriously expected the level cap to be raised to 70. it was 60. when velious came out i lowered my expectations to only 70. it was aa. when luclin came out i hoped for 70. it was squat. when pop came out we finally got a whopping 5 levels. ykesha ldon and god gave us no levels at all.  <br />
this is incorect. Kunark - lvl 60. Velious - nothing(if by nothing you mean the best EQ expansion made). SoL - AA. PoP - 65.</div></div><hr />

Casuals do need to be able *reasonably* keep up with the expansions, and there does need to be content relavent for them.<br />
<br />
But whining because &quot;ubers&quot; get to see zones you dont etc is BS. You didnt put in the work,dont complain because you dont have the reward.And saying its not the time but the path is just as much BS.<br />
If I drive for an hour towards point A, and you do the same to point B, dont whine because you arent at point A.<br />
<br />
Didnt put the work in? You arrogant self-absorbed ass. I play more than most raiders I just dont raid due to time (of day) constraints. Hell I probably play more than you. But I guess its in your self-righteous nature to define what &quot;work&quot; is (i.e. if you dont raid you dont deserve shit). Try putting up with 115 LDoNs (and about 40 hrs or aaxp farming since the LDoN xp sucks so bad) in the last 4 weeks. Talk about frigging boring. The only challenge I have is to see if I can hit the 45 minute cap or if I can get more than one named mob. If I could be Uqua flagged with 30+ hrs a week of play time (but not certain play times, i.e raids) then I would be. Now I am stuck rounding out the weak pieces of my guys stuff with LDoNs and one groupable mobs.<br />
<br />
After seeing some of the best casual (defined as non raiding) players leave the game, (Romidar on PoN who I respect more than any other casual player for example) I hope you guys like your raid server with 140 Time guilds (they better instance that puppy).

This shit is coming to a head and from your stance its clear you are moving on to WoW because only someone stupid would look down on someone wanting better than a VGGS because it comes too close to his DBotW.<br />
<br />
And one final point, there is a reason why raiders dont bitch about not getting anything for their old stuff. THERE IS NEW STUFF TO GET. THE AMOUNT OF NEW GEAR FOR NON-RAIDERS SINCE LDON (AND EVEN THAT IS PRECIOUS LITTLE) HAS BEEN SMALL. Oh my pally got a velium gemmed great sword in the bazaar so some raider who farms (I know the seller) Kod Taz level mobs for loot got it and made a bunch of plat off of me. NP I have nothing else to spend it on anyways SINCE THERE IS NO NEW STUFF.<br />
<br />
Oh and I forgot, but my upgrade path for LDoN is at a halt because they are going to add elemental level stuff and not do full refunds, so I get no progression until that point unless I just decide to eat the losses.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You just have to face the fact that EQ is a raiding game.  LDoN tried to turn that around but the point system on it sucks imo.  They should provide cheap medium class upgrades for folks who are hurting in the total wealth accumulated group.  The exp there isnt that great, and people are doing it just for the items, augs, etc.  So it's just one big farm zone that you spend endless hours trying to save up enough to get ONE upgrade.<br />
<br />
The only thing left for EQ is raiding.  When epic quests and flagging just to get into new zones require 40,50,70 people then the game is a different monster all together.  <br />
<br />
I use to enjoy leveling pre 40's and looked forward to some upgrades I could make.  Some of the old world zones were pretty nice, but then the leveling slowed down and it seemed more like work than playing.  When you log on and have to do something you dont want to for hours on end (just to get the next upgrade or better stuff), then the portion of the &quot;game&quot; is gone.  Why play it if you dont have any fun or it seems like a longer part of your work day.<br />
<br />
Most of us have full time jobs and we dont have the time to spend playing these games.  It stopped being a fun game to play when I had work the next day and a big raid until 2-3 o'clock at night.<br />
<br />
Ive jumped around games for a while (DAoC, SWG, AC2) and EQ does have a LOT of content.  The problem is that a LOT of it requires a large portion of time raiding with 60 of your buddies to try to even get into it.  I would prefer something that I can log into for 3-4 hours and feel like Ive accomplished something or just had fun.  Hopefully WoW will fill those shoes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only differance is you dont mind stabbing your friends in the back as soon as some hive mentality guild has a spot for you, fuck the guild and friends that got you the gear and requirements to join the guild you like so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">LDoN is a joke of an answer to the casual EQ'ers issues of lack of content - with its' cookie-cutter zones, crap gear, and a point system that is 10 times worse than Chinese water torture...what casual gamer really considers LDoN as the answer to their problems? I'd say a very small few...if any. LDoN is a BS expansion and was a shoddy patchwork job by SOE to ebb the flow of the casual gamers from leaving EQ altogether.  LDoN is kinda like putting a band-aid on a sucking chest wound. It didn't work...people are still leaving.<br />
<br />
Yep, EQ has evolved from Everquest into Ever-raid. The direction of the game has been a slow evolution and gradual change that has been more and more raid focused with every consecutive expansion. Now, once you hit levels 60+, the only thing left beyond that &quot;ceiling&quot; is to join a raiding guild and start raiding. There is nothing else for you to do after that point. It's just a simple fact. To say otherwise about the state of the current game is to deny the obvious - Now it's simply raid, raid, raid...and when you're done with that...raid some more. I could have once been described as a serious raider...or hardcore raider...whatever you want to call it...but endless hours of mob clearing, backflagging, keying, etc. just doesn't appeal to me any more. Raiding 6-8 hours 4-5 days a week isn't fun...in fact, it F'ing sucks. But what else is there to do in EQ? Eventually, you come to the conclusion that alot of people have come to recently...if you don't want or can't raid, it's time for you to quit EQ and move on to another game. And it's sad to say good-bye to a game that really set the standard for on-line gaming and provided me with some serious fun and adventure, not to mention all of the on-line friends I've made over the past few years. But the current state of EQ is not fun and provides very little, if any adventure. The good ole days of EQ are exactly that - good old days. That old game is a far cry from the current game. <br />
<br />
Time for me to get a new addiction going and, hopefully, WoW or CoH is the new drug that will replace EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Figg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Could it be because a raider in the amount of time it would take them to purchase the very best LDoN has to offer can get two or three upgrades for the same slots by raiding?  If that's not true, if raiders aren't gaining better gear faster by raiding than by doing LDoN, why aren't more of them doing LDoN?<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion it is more of a status symbol to have the gear that the raiders get.  They dont want to have the same gear as some casual gamer could have.</div></div><hr />

You're probably right.  But that's not how SoE is packaging their expansions.  They're still attempting to present them as having something for everyone.  Maybe they intended that they would, and just dropped the ball.  But if it is their intention that they continue to support the raid game to the exclusion of adequately supporting the non-raid game, then they're not interested in keeping the non-raiders money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think PoP did a number of things that in retrospect have turned out to be wrong.<br />
<br />
1.  Locked the majority of the expansion behind flagged zones and required either trials that weren't particularly even handed (ever try getting in a PoJ trial pick up group as say an enchanter?), the killing of boss mobs, or the completion of long quests that would flag you for a particular zone, but wouldn't be counted for additional flagging beyond that zone.<br />
<br />
2.  Increased the difficulty of the mobs significantly as you progress deeper and deeper into the expansion to the point that if you haven't raided previous boss mobs, you reach a point where it just isn't particularly realistic to continue.<br />
<br />
3.  Locked much of the character progession behind AAs, which while very nice, also aren't as psychologically rewarding as obtaining an item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I'm sure you do eat loses.  And I'm sure that new apps pay half of what you had to spend.  But you get the gear sooner, get the benefits of having it longer, and usually have upgrades on the near horizon.  If you're raiding regularly and your guild is successful at it, you'll have significant gear turn over in just a six month period, barring you completely having conquered the game and having most of the best of what's available.  While a non-raider will be lucky to see a couple of gear upgrades in the same time period.</div></div><hr />

RL is part but I think what sent me over the edge has been the balancing issues and looking at the last 3 expansions that the only one I see more than once a month is LDON and not sure how I would count POP since I am locked out from about as many zones as I am allowed in. Counting PoP I guess it would be 4 expansions where I really do not use a majority of or even 1/4 of the content. PoP I guess I use 40-60%. I am in an average to small guild so we tend to avoid the big time sinks if possible. Looking at how i use the last 4 expansions and then seeing another on the horizon is frustrating when the biggest thing I use from them is books, Magnus's, and AA's. <br />
Reading DeathDealers post I guess is about exactly the thought for me. I always liked raiding but stuck with my online friends as a casual guild and enjoyed it. It's been about 4 weeks for me now since I have logged on. Will give it a few more and then see if I still feel the same. So far I haven't been missing it other than friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you hit 65 with a char, I dont know how other people can lvl up another char.  Ive twinked alt folks before, fully equiped them with fungi/haste/gear etc, but it still takes a long time to lvl.  The only way I could ever stand it was to PL using a 2 box druid (fully twinked too).<br />
<br />
Getting from lvl 1 - 55 in 2 weeks, now thats some progress.  Only problem is that after 55, you really need a shaman or cleric or something to continue.  You can hit lvl's 1-20 in a day of PLing (good 4-5 hours).<br />
<br />
Then from 50's+ its all about having to group and get exp the slow way.  Once you are raid capable, they take hours upon hours, esp the lower level ones.  Nagy raids turn into 3-4 hours of prep, getting folks, buffing, etc and then it just turns into a zerg fest.  I still dont undestand how it takes 30 mins - 1 hour to split up loot among 50-60 people.  (I think they are looting the good stuffs)<br />
<br />
EQ is a very well designed time sink.  I mean the boats esp, it was nice the first time but it gets annoying later on.  People would rather pay 10 pp for a port via druid or wiz (before PoK).  I mean some of the quests in EverQUEST takes hours and hours of camping something stupid.  They are all on 1 hour timers with like 20 place holders, all random.  <br />

EQ = Time Sink and for most folks that isnt a lot of fun.  No fun ==&gt; Not a game you want to play.</div></div><hr />

On the new expansion even if it is open, there are still 3-4 others prior that I either do not have a good reason to utilize or can't with out making some changes in guilds then spending 3-8hours in multiple zones or even in the same zone to be able to get to the next. That doesn't include if we fail on attempts or need to do it multiple times to get geared for the next zone. One zone up to what you need could be 100hours or better even for the best guilds to get done gearing up. Seems like SsRA was that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The thing what happen I think is this:<br />
Old world/Kunark/Velious/luclin - while only these expansions lvl 60 toons had something to do in all of them.<br />
<br />
PoP - exp gets jacked up to insane levels in PoP zones only. High level items now provide 2x hp for warriors and focus/ft/mana free spells for caster. These items are in relative abundance. Lvl 65 toon has no longer any reason to visit previous expansions. Ever for any reason other then nostalgia. <br />
<br />
Toons got too powerful too quickly. If you remember just before pop came out you probably could count all the people who had AA's maxed on two hands on any given server. Even ppl who play quiet a bit had like 50 AAs. Meaning it took an average person a year to get 50 AAs back then. Now 50 AAs can be done in a week or two. Of course casual players running out of stuff to do and get bored since raiding never was their thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I don't think you've got it exactly right Casai.  People don't enjoy grinding out hundreds of AAs, or at least I know I don't.  So the boredom comes quickly because it's not fun.  It goes like this.  Yay, I got another AA ability.  Does it seem to make any difference in anything?  Not one damn bit.  So am I gung ho to grind out the next one?  Not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I agree that levelling can and a lot of time was a bit tedious. On the other hand I remember spending a year levelling to 50 then another a year and half from 50 to 60. Maybe it wasnt always fun and whoopy do but it gave me something to look forward to and a sense of accomplishment once achieved. First few AAs were exciting to get as well. I remember so totally looking forward to AE Taunt and Flurry and god knows what else. Back then it was not a short-term goal thought. You took your time and worked on that at your own pace.<br />
<br />
Now everyone and their mama is 65 so sense of achievement from levelling is zip. AAs? Since those don not really give you any bragging rights either they are not that big of a deal. I mean EQ is all about friendly competition so people have to have something to look forward to when they log on. Now that all have been reduced to items and raid only items mind you. Since the stuff available to casual player is overshadowed by such ridiculous margin by &quot;uber&quot; items. Also now there is so much content that raid only that every casual player is very motivated to join raiding guild. I mean everyone wants to see everything this game has to offer. Before it used to be single zone, which required a lot of extra work, now its half of an expansion.<br />
____________<br />
<br />
So at some point you join raiding guild. Why did I keep joining raiding guilds? To be able to see content and to have something to look forward to. With raids comes dealing with 50+ ppl you never see but on raids and some of whom you will dislike. Eventfully comes burn out because 80%+ of raiding is not fun and the bigger the guild the more work it is trying to keep up with crazy raiding schedule. It is crazy when guild expects you to log on for 4+ hours every day. Its like a second job. Then comes realization wtf am I doing with my time. Fun stopped months ago... <br />
<br />
For times like that there are 2 options quit guild hang with friends or quit EQ. I've quit raiding guilds before and that usually brings fun back into EQ, but there is very minimal character advancement with that, which always sat on the back on my mind. So eventfully I'd join another raiding guild and start whole process anew. What really upsets me about raiding guild is once you start going there is no stopping. A lot of times I'd like just to stop take a break from raiding for a bit and just hang with friends, but there is no way because guild needs everyone to advance and I feel obliged to help since we are all in this together. So if I am online I am doing a raid and most likely do not have time for anything else like hanging with friends. The urge to log in at all diminishes because of the self-imposed trap. Log in and raid or dont log in at all.<br />
____________<br />
I think this is it in the nutshell. So now that Ive written this I think all the expansions that offers ubers items, that are crazy good with almost exclusively raid content are driving EQ into the ground, by not offering casuals a way to compete for comparable items without raiding.</div></div><hr />
