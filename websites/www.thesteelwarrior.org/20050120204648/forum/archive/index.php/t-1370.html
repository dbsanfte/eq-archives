<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's dumb but that's the nature of a high percentage of eq players, they go where the loot is. Unless you're pretty much tops of the server it will be a problem. Tighter recruiting measures can help combat this somewhat but people will be people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you join a guild and are there for 1-2 months and find that you don't like the people or aren't enjoying it then its better to get out now, quietly and respectfully, then to wait 6 months till you really can't stand it and storm out with a post full of flames.<br />
<br />
If you're not happy then do yourself and them a favor and move on.  Be honest with them with why you are moving on and they should respect that (unless your reason is &quot;u guyz r all tardz and u didnt give me enuff lewtz&quot;).  <br />
<br />
Remember regardless of all the loyalties and obilgations you feel you may have in EQ it is a game that you play for entertainment and if you aren't enjoying it (eg. spending 90% of your raid time doing bad things to your blood pressure and yelling at the pictures on your monitor) then move on and find some people you can enjoy the game with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's good to let them people go if all they even join your guild for is for loot. <br />
<br />
just don't let it get to ya; you run into people like that every day. <br />
just have fun with your friends and go kill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My feeling on the issue is this. I am in my guild because the people there are like family to me. Someone may be looking for a raid guild and assumed they found it. We raid like twice a week and hang out as often as we can. For some that will not be enough and if they choose to move on quietly and respectfully then they need to do what makes them happy. I do not begrudge people for joining and then leaving but I do usually ask myself why. I play for the friendships and family I have in EQ not the Phat Lewtz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think some people join guilds just to have a tag over their head.  Then when they get a chance to join a bigger more exciting guild they drop you and head for greener pastures.  It sucks to always be bleeding members and having to find new ones, but it happens in every guild except the top uber guild on the server.<br />
<br />
About the only thing you can do is talk to your recruits and see what their goals are in EQ and why they want to join your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is a small family oriented guild as well. About 9 of us all told we have a couple of allied guilds that let us come along on raids and help us with ours. When I first started looking for a guild I will admit the Phat lewt was something I thought of but I've come to relieze its not youre gear its how many people want to hang with you:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind the &quot;they play at a better time for me, so I can go on more raids&quot;.<br />
<br />
What I mind is &quot;thanks for all the epic work you did for me; that's all I needed to get into Uber_Guild_01&quot;.<br />

Leeches = teh suck.</div></div><hr />
