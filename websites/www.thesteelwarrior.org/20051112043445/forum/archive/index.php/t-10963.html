So while outside of BRD just farming coffer keys and waiting for other guildies to show up, I decided to play around with a full rage bar execute to see what kind of damage i can do. <br />
<br />
So with 1 finger posed above the screenshot key, I took this screenshot of a full ragebar execute critting.  Just wondering if anyone has played with this and what kind of crits you're getting.<br />
<br />
BTW, that weapon in my primary hand is a Thrash Blade.  I duel wield most of the time just because its much funner and it keeps my 1h skills up for when I use a 1h / shield combo in instances.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thengel</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've hit just over 4k with a crit execute, I think 4125 on some poor lvl 30s shaman.  Best way to get the big numbers is to fight a caster and sunder it all to pieces before filling up for the kill, as execute is mitigated by AC.  Execute should be weapon independent, so it doesn't matter if you hold a dagger or a doomsaw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The funy thing is Execute calculates to ( 600 dam + 15 dam/rag * 85 rag ) * 2 crit = 3750 damage. I wonder if they are nerfing Improved Sunder Armor because it is causing monsters to take additional damage? I thought an opponents armor could not be sundered less than 0 but perhaps Improved Sunder's 30% is causing them to have negative mitigation?</div></div><hr />

Impale ups it quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

I'm only L38 so far, but I've had the DD portion of Immolate (normally 101 max) hit for 151 noncrit with Curse of Elements on a mob.</div></div><hr />

I don't have impale but I do have One-Handed Weapon Specialization which would account for the 10% difference. That's a nice bug. So now why are they nerfing Improved Sunder!</div></div><hr />

Because one person with improved SU can ruin aggro for every warrior in a raid pretty much?</div></div><hr />

Hehe fun.  Even more fun after they fix it so all your rage isn't sucked up when execute misses!</div></div><hr />

True that the ac reduction/rage ratio has droped a bit but considering that the agro/rage ratio has increased, this talent change seems to have increased value for tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had not thought of that and it does make sense. Nothing frustrates me more than a Rogue putting out a 2 or 3 point Expose Armor that is just high enough I can't use sunder.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand I am going to miss the total armor removed. 30% was pretty signifigant even if the ability now has a better aggro/rage ratio.</div></div><hr />
