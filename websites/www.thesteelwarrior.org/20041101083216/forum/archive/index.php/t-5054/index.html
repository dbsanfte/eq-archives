<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...so i'm sitting in bazaar waiting for junk to sell, and i see this weapon for sale. Poison wind censor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=551). I don't wanna put out 200k for an earthshaker right now, maybe later but not yet.  And this costs nothing so i picked it up. Is it any good for AEing? I mean...sure, it's not as good as earthshaker, but it's still something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sadly it is only good if you want to detonate yourself trying to AE. It is a standard AE spell, not Point Blank ( safe ). So it hits 4 targets within range, basically 3 mobs plus yourself. AE with that and you will be splat before anything else =/<br />
<br />
I was going to buy one as well till I heard that little bit. Same for Sword of Skyfire or whatever it was called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahh...Guess it's not very good then. Oh well, i just spent 150k on an earthshaker anyway. Wonder if it was a good deal heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It Procs a Shaman poison rain that will hit you as well as your targets. It's somehitng that if you're fighting a giant sized mob and you're at max melee range you might miss, but the spell gets resisted so often anyway that a lot of Shaman don't even bother casting it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah i gotta get rampage, fast! So i can test this out. I took earthshaker for a test run without rampage in KC, didn't proc much...I've heard it procs often due to the really high delay, i guess not. But i still had fun beating up 50 mobs with furious. Of course ya can't proc on a riposte so that doesn't count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bakaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">150k its alot of money for Earthshaker.. I got one, but I didnt pay anything for it.. and I would never pay for one! But good luck on that rampage thing, dunno if its fun! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it will hit 4 NPCs at all times, IF you are yourself in range, it will hit you as well.</div></div><hr />
