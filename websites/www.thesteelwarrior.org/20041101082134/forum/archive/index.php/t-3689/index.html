<br />
Thinking about keep on doing mistmoore and getting this<br />
<br />
Earring of Gray Flesh<br />
AC:4, Str:10, Agi:5, HP:60, Mana:60, FR:5, CR:5, MR:5, type1,type1,type2  for 660 Adventure Points.<br />
<br />
I could also save up a buttload like 1200 Adventure Points and get the haste aug there, I think it's 36 percent, then I could just find an item to put it on.<br />
<br />
I got about 5k in cash, 8k in sellables, including the gavel in my profile.  I was thinking about earring of the solstice but prices are crazy on my server right now it would cost me about 7k.<br />
(Edit:  I got an earring for 3k.)<br />
<br />
I'm also thinking I could save up for a second droga weapon, but I haven't run into any agro troubles with the GSoT and I like it because it is 2 handed. (Edit:  I got a Copper Hammer)<br />
<br />
My other thoughts are getting fierce heraldic greaves and selling boots and trying to get fierce heraldic boots.  But both are rarely for sale.<br />
<br />
One other concern is my mask, what can I do for my mask?  I know about fierce heraldic, but it's rare on my server.  14 ac 60 hps I think.  (Gonna look for flourishing, frozen mana, heraldic or grimling contraption if they are decently priced)<br />
<br />
My last concern is the range item, is there any better under 10k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">did I provide too much information to get a necessary response for feedback?</div></div><hr />

<br />
other options lupine frenzy earring as a second, face mask of frozen mana. flesh eater's ring. lotta good stuff from ldon drops. amulet of forgoten magic from mig's has type1 and type 3 can add 5/10ac and the haste to it i think(aug serch is down at the moment) make it a 12/17 ac 13 dex 9 sta 30 hp 36% haste neck. sandstorm fragment gaunts (blue neon freeking blue look good realy)<br />
<br />
also velious armor or mq's<br />
<br />
alot is just going to be minor upgrades few hp their few sta their few ac their.<br />
<br />
nothing sugested will be better then what makes you happy though. cookie cutter syndrome can be bad.</div></div><hr />
