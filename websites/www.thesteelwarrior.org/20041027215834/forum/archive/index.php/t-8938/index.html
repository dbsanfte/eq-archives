<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a lot of confusion about this yesterday, so here's the truth about the /claim item.<br />
<br />
It is called a Frozen Crystal Shard. It is a range item with 2ac 10hp 10mana and 10svF with a 3.0 sec casting effect called Gelidren Aura. Some people got a Burning Crystal Shard, I don't know how or why.<br />
<br />
Gelidren Aura adds a frosty particle effect around your character. So far it stacks with everything and it does have a buff slot so grats everyone on a nifty new dummy buffer. You need to have spell effects turned up to at least 50% Opacity and Low Density to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">woo all right; more rainbow brite spell effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any idea what Burning Crystal Shard does? I got that p.o.s. clicky is doesnt seem to do anything???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It gives you, personally, a smoking particle effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It gives you, personally, a smoking particle effect.<br />
Well, damn ... I gotta get me some of that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think which item you get may depend on the year you were created but not positive.  All the people that I have talked to that were created in 99 got the burning crystal.   This is just a theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have no idea if you get one or another originally based on whatever, but there's a gnome in pok named Bertrand Bibblesworth beside the overpass betweeb nexus stone and big bank who exchanges one for the other.  I switched my ice particle clicky to fire :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oogagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not true... Oogagan (ogre) was created in July 1999 and my cleric (dwf) in June 1999... and both got Frozen stick. For my wiz I preordered, so can't say about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm i suppose it is purely random, However, I kinda assumed that after reading you could trade it in for the other.  Thanks for the info though as it was only a quick thought theory :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But does it do anything besides make you sparkle?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it saves you the trouble of camping a gobbo earring.  Sounds overpowered for a pre order item to me.  NERF PLZ K THX ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>hungri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">its not a insta click though. not same as gob ear</div></div><hr />

1. Gob earring has ATK buff, which does something for you.<br />
2. Gob earring is insta-click.<br />
<br />
It's about as useful as Captain Nalot's Eyepatch once you get Kizrak's Gauntlets or Enchanter haste - a 3.0 casting dummy buff that stacks with everything but does nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/shrug.<br />
<br />
Cast time on Kizrak's gaunts is 3.0, and I can routinely get that off in combat.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, I fully realize I'm being ridiculous here, so you can stop pointing it out.  :) I stand by my previous statement.  NERFAGE!</div></div><hr />
