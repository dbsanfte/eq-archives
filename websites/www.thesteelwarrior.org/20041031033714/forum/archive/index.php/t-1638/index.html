<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rwem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice.  I'm a lvl 41 human warrior, god is Mithanial.  I have mosly crusty armour, with 1 hero bracer, 2 of the 55hp rings and 2 wolf fang earings and a set of crystal chitten hand wraps for haste.  I have looked into cultural but since I worship Mithanial I wouldn't get the best out of them like I would if I worshiped Rallos.  Money doesnt come to easy,  but I have been saving up.  So should I buy the cultural or should I try to get Thurg/Kael/skyshrine.  Before you say those keep in mind that I don't raid a ton.   I think I want a pair of mosquito legs and a pair of valorium ring of gallantry, but thats about it :)  Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well the Cultural Armor would be better AC wise.  If you want stats thought I'd go for Thrug/SS armor.  I know the Mith Marr stuff gives Wisdom/Mana and yeah I don't think you really need that :p.  So I'd say go for Thurg/SS should equip you well enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fyi this is the battlefield for questions about zones and mobs so next time you make one of these make it in the bunker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SS/Thurg....Mith Marr cultural is not only really not useful for a warrior, plus it's a pain in the ASS to make...my friend had one helluva time getting everything....</div></div><hr />
