<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkrogue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I figured a buncha burly warriors (who rely greatly on their ability to proc) would know the answer to my simple question.  I've been reading up a lil on proc rates.  It appears that the standard is 2 per min (+/- a certain %, and dex figured in).  So the short and skinny of it is, does the number of times you hit affect the number of times you proc?  I.E.  If ya hit 50 times in 1 min, are you likely to proc 1/2 as much as if you hit 100 tims in 1 min?  And on the same note, if I hit 100 times in 1 min, am I more likely to proc than if I hit 1 time in 1 min? =P  Saavy?<br />
<br />
P.S. I do not admit that warriors are superior (and nor do I think it), sounds like warrior mischief to me! =P</div></div><hr />

The meat of the information was posted by Wandor when he wrote...<br />
<br />
More attacks due to a change in relative weapon delay does not increase your proc rate. More attacks with no change in relative weapon delay does increase your proc rate.<br />
<br />
Proc rate is based on the delay of a weapon. If a weapon has 20 delay, the combat engine expects that weapon to swing 30 times in 1 minute. Of those 30 swings, there will be 2 procs or a 6.6% chance to proc on any given swing.<br />
<br />
Now if we add more attacks without changing the delay of the weapon - ambidexterity, PB, flurry, rampage, ferocity - you still have the same weapon delay so you still have a 6.6% chance to proc on any given swing. The difference is now instead of 30 swings in a minute, you have 40 swings per minute. This could change your proc rate to 2.6 PPM. This phenomenon can be seen by using an Earthshaker and rampage, procs out the wazoo. Of course the numbers are purely made up, but the theory is accurate.</div></div><hr />
