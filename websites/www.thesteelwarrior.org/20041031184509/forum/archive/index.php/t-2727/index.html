<br />
Any suggestions as to a way to go?  I've been reading and I know to go Fierce Heraldric for most with SS gloves, but the shoulders, back, ears, etc I'm not sure on.  I managed a few really good deals in the bazaar to get where I am now, but havent' done that in a while, so money's tight again.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stuff looks pretty good..<br />
<br />
I'd replace the cloak with the Cloak of the Maelstorm.<br />
<br />
Also get a new haste item since FBSS has no stats, a cheap replacement would be Silver Chitin Hand Wraps but your hands item look pretty good.<br />
<br />
If you have some pp, get a pair of Vallorioum Rings of Gallantry.<br />
<br />
Good Stuff though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anterrabae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">See, I considered the schw, but passed it up, because it's too easy to get better gloves.  I've been drooling over the Valorium rings for a while now, but the price has to drop just a tad more.  :)  Hadn't considered a Maelstrom cloak, I'll look that one up now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off, your gear should be fine for your level; but once you start grouping in any of the planes besides justice, you'll need either really good buffs, or better gear. Unfortunately, you're to the point where a few hundred (or even thousand) plat will only get you one or two upgrades, and they'll be minor ones too.<br />
<br />
Start doing kael raids/groups, and turn in lots of toes/heads in thurg, try to get enough faction for thurg armor. Look for thurg helm, bp, legs, and boots first and foremost. Any more pieces of fierce heraldic armor you can get will last you for another 10+ levels, so get any if you see them for cheap. <br />
<br />
Other slots to upgrade:<br />
Haste- Try to find a good deal on a Sash of the Dragonborn, Silvery Belt of Contention, or a Shadowy Assassin's Sash. There's also a neck-slot haste item called A Worn Golden Tooth that shouldn't be too expensive<br />
<br />
Range- Either get a nice bow that has ac, stamina, and raw HP on it, like a Darkwood Bow of Suffering, or pick up a Goranga Idol and keep that equipped until you need to use your bow.<br />
<br />
Neck- Either get the Worn golden tooth, or get a clattering bone necklace if you can.<br />
<br />
Offhand- I never was a big fan of that axe, the proc never seemed to add much aggro for me. I'd say the Sword of the Bloodsworn should be enough aggro alone for now, so try getting a good ratio weapon in secondary. (Defender's Lightblade is good, or a frostbringer, they're dropping in price really fast)<br />
<br />
Overall, the biggest upgrades for you will be buying fierce heraldic legs/boots/bp, and getting thurg armor to fill in the other slots. Your gear looks pretty good though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anterrabae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, thanks to hours and hours in GD, my Coldain faction is ally.  And for some reason, I hadn't considered the other options for haste belts, mainly because the only other one I saw (probably due to who had what in baz) was the Rune Branded Girdle, and that's way outta my league right now.  <br />
<br />
So, scribbling everything down now, going to see what I can get when the server comes up again.  Thanks much for your input, folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not realy a upgrade to fbss but the drop belt from air has ac and stuff. tag along and hope it drops and no one needs it. most would rather see it go to use then rot. no drop war only and stuff.<br />
<br />
might have to provide your own stone and coffins though.<br />
<br />
your also at the point were stuff stars costing cash if you buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anterrabae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Okay, got me the bow of suffering (Thanks for pointing that out, Necksnappa) And yes, stuff is starting to cost...  loads and loads...  Still looking for the right replacement haste item, though.<br />
Have to see what I can afford....  *sigh*.  Never ending battle with the bank account.  hehehe.  Both here, and RL... It just never ends.....  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure if this applies to you, but a 65 rog friend boxing a 65 shammy, along with myself, 55 war, can easily take the shop camp in veksar where the soulscream belt drops. I see that you're in STC, just get a group of guildies together and farm it for a while. get a map or someone who knows the way, and have people who can cast both invis and undead invis; you can run all the way to the camp without fighting a single mob. There's some other decent drops from the camp, as well as plat from most mobs, so your guildies shouldn't mind being dragged along. You might want to bring a higher level tank though, the mobs were tagging me for upwards of 260 or so, along with spells, and the mobs past the camp can harmtouch for 1021 =/</div></div><hr />
