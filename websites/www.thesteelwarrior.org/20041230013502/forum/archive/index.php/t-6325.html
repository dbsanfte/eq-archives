To make the Taunt skill work the best for you... do you mash the button so you taunt whenever you can... or just hit it when someone is in trouble (ie you lose aggro and taunt is right there ready to be used)<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I xp groups I just hit it when it turns on someone (usually doesn't happen if group members control their own agro).<br />
<br />
On raids if I MT I just hit it whenever it refreshes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt basically puts you at the top of the aggro list, plus 1.  So if you are at the top it does you no good to mash it.  Save it for when you lose aggro, so you can jump ahead of their aggro.</div></div><hr />

Top of hate list plus one is good info... <br />

Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />

go taunt mashers!</div></div><hr />

otherwise while MTing in raids i just smash the button since i usually don't see sh33t of what's going on :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the devs, taunt only puts you on top of the hate list plus a little bit more.  If you're already on top, it does nothing.  However, I went most of my career not knowing this, so I'm a taunt button masher, and I'm still not really 100% convinced of what the devs said.  I've had successful taunts and not seen the mob switch targets in the HoTT window.  It's something I play around with when it doesn't matter; only taunting if I lose aggro.  But in most cases I just hit the button whenever it's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in the Kunark days I taught myself to only taunt if I lost aggro.  Back then it actually worked.  Nowdays when I lose aggro the majority of the time even a successful taunt doesn't bring it back.  I think alot of it has to do with weapon delays being so low nowdays.  Even with a successful taunt I will most likely lose aggro on the next group members hit and they will most likely be using a weapon with &lt;20 DLY on it.<br />
<br />
Taunt at 65 should really add more then just barely at the top.  It should add enough to keep us there through a few group members attacks as well.  It's mostly useless.  The best use for Taunt I've found is to Taunt and if successful I'll Incite immediately.  This allows me to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
In XP groups, I often find myself chain taunting nowdays just to see how often it's actually successful, though.</div></div><hr />

what would happen to the remainder of the agro(hate) list?<br />
does this eliminate any agro you have generated through incite, procs?<br />
or <br />
does the amount of agro you have generated get put on top of the list with a successful taunt?<br />
<br />
Im of the view use it when you need it.  I used to be a button masher but have since changed my ways..with shield ability and incite line...i like have taunt handy when i need it.<br />
however<br />
i have noticed loss of agro after a taunt following a hate proc...<br />
but i have also noticed immediate agro after a failed taunt.<br />
Taunt is a strange creature...<br />
use what works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know that the taunt button works *exactly* as described by &quot;top of hate list +1&quot; but I do think that description is close enough to be functionally accurate.<br />
<br />
Therefore I do not mash taunt when I can tell that the mob is already on me.<br />
<br />
I don't know what level your warrior is, but by and by you'll find that there are several ways of gaining agro. Some, however, are not really under your control at the moment you lose agro. soe agro factors are:<br />
<br />
1. Regular melee attacks. Yes, it's a good idea to remember to turn on autoattack, lol. Other than that, it's not much under your control. Using dual wield will give you more agro than using a 2-hand weapon, generally speaking.<br />
<br />
2. Procs. Try to max your dex and use the best weapon you can, obviously, but for the most part you just have to cross your fingers and hope you get procs when you need them. If you've just made this warrior, it's likely that procs won't be much available to you for a while, and you don't have to worry about it until then.<br />
<br />
3. Disarm. Tests have shown that this really does not add to your hate in the midst of a fight, so I don't use it for agro-building purposes. Sometimes I use it for fun, and because I can get pretty &quot;twitchy&quot; when I tank and I run out of buttons to push but feel a powerful need to DO SOMETHING NOW GODDAMNIT. Some mobs actually hit harder/faster when you disarm them, so you have to know the mob. I've also used disarm when I'm in a pick-up group with a speed/ninja-looter and I want the mob's weapon. No, I am not joking. If you walk up to a green mob and hit disarm, it will attack you, so there's some sort of initial hate value to /disarm, but no real practical value in a fight, I don't think. <br />
<br />
3. Range attack. Agro on range attack seems oddly out of proportion to either the damage that I do or the frequency of attack. In other words, under certain circumstances, I can use a bow to tag a mob being pulled to camp and the mob will head for me. This can work surprisingly well, though I know of no tests that have analyzed why. Also, this can be done at greater range than using the provoke line, and basically is a free ride to the top of the hate list when it works. Can be very useful in outdoor zones when you are MT but not the puller. (If you are the puller, then clearly a bow is your friend too.)<br />
<br />
3. The provoke line. If I've tagged a mob with an arrow as the mob is coming to camp, the next thing I do (immediately when mob is in range) is use the provoke line, which depending on your level will give you a more or less significant head start on hate. The provoke line is also quite useful when I am pulling certain mobs in indoor zones, partly because it can be used at range and partly again because it gives you a hate head start, and that hate builds, so the sooner you get to it the more hate builds and the sooner the button will refresh. If I don't have agro, and taunt and provoke are both up, I hit taunt first, then immediately hit provoke. I don't see any reason not to use the provoke line right away in a fight. Hit it as soon as it refreshes for as long as the mob is fighting and you have END available.<br />
<br />
3. The taunt button. Appears to me to function as &quot;top of the hate list +1.&quot; If I'm on the top of the hate list, I don't hit the taunt button. I want the button up if I lose the mob, and the longest seconds in the game for me as a tank involve waiting for taunt to refresh while the cleric/other caster is getting the stuffing beat out of him. If I lose the mob to another melee, I hit taunt and, if I'm lucky enough to have the provoke line refresh, I hit that. Taunt first because if it works, I jump to the top of the list, then provoke, because the hate it generates is additive. If I lose agro to a caster, it's taunt then shield and provoke if available. If slam is up, I use that--basically, I'm throwing everything I've got at the mob as fast as I can. There are exceptions to this, however. The first exception you'll notice has to do with enchanters. If they draw agro, very often they'll want a chance to re-mez the mob. If they successfully mez the mob and you hit the mob, you'll breakt he mez but probably not have agro. What you will have is one pissed off enchanter in your group, heh.<br />
<br />
4. /shield. I don't normally use shield to protect other melee, with a few exceptions (for example, if I'm not MT I might shield MT if I have reason to believe that an incoming heal will be a little too late, but those situations are, well, situational). I will shield casters who draw agro. Normally, I taunt first, partly because to shield someone you have to be very close to them. I taunt, then if mob turns to me, I don't shield; if taunt fails, I immediately shield. I believe that shield has some +hate factor, but I don't know of any tests that have definitively shown that. In my admittedly unscientific observation, the mobs turn to me immediately after I /shield far more frequently than chance or my own melee damage would account for. I can't actually recall when you get the ability to /shield--level 30 sticks in my head, but it's been a while--when you get it, make hotkeys for it for the appropriate caster(s) in your group. There are various threads on /shield on this site with suggestions on hotkey set-ups for /shield.<br />
<br />
5. Other stuff: A failed &quot;beg&quot; will also draw initial agro, but I never beg mobs because like disarm, it doesn't seem to have much practical value in the midst of a fight. Some warriors used to advocate useing beg on mezzed mobs, but for some time taunt has given you a message that tells you whether you have successfully taunted the mob. I just break mezz with taunts--taunt until you get the &quot;you have taunted...&quot; message. <br />
Proximity to the mob is also helpful--it sometimes pays to be the closest player to the mob. Rooted mobs will always attack the closest player, so if you want a rooted mob to hit you, you need to be standing closer to it than other players are to it.<br />
Sitting down can also increase your agro, but you'll have to play with that to see when it makes sense to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disagree if you wish, however that IS how it works.  For it to work the way you described, all the melee would've had to have the exact same aggro, and be above you.  However, in a real situation, most of the time aggro is lost to casters from my experience.  So when you successfully taunt and are put above them, they don't do something immediately to pass it up again.  When it is a melee who passes you, often the mob will ping pong, even after a successful taunt.  Most melee though will do something to stop producing aggro if they are in that situation (evade, fd, just turn off attack, etc).<br />
<br />
does this eliminate any agro you have generated through incite, procs? <br />
<br />
Lets say you have 1000 hate from a mob (via incite, procs, melee).  A caster hits the mob with a spell and is put at 1300.  You successfully taunt, which puts you at 1301.  (It may not be exactly 1, but it's simpler to refer to it as 1 instead of saying &quot;a little bit&quot; each time).  If you then proc Anger3, you would be at 1901.  This is why it is much more effective to use incite after you successfully taunt, and not before, otherwise it's wasted if not at the beginning of a fight.<br />
<br />
Regarding Disarm:<br />
<br />
Varaho did some tests that proved that disarm does nothing to the aggro list, other than just put you on it.  I then did some more tests and confirmed his findings.  It doesn't increase aggro at all, just puts you on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Regarding Beg:<br />
<br />
Three things can happen after you hit beg.  You can succeed, fail, or get a critical failure.  A critical failure is the only one that gives aggro, and it is also very rare.  Consider also that as you use it more, your skill goes up and critical failures get even more rare.  Add in the fact that you have to turn attack off to use beg, it's not worth even touching.  Some also believe that some mobs are &quot;immune&quot; to beg, where they just give a fail message, and there is no roll.  Those mobs are basically all non humanoid / intelligent creatures.  Haven't seen any proof of this, but wouldn't suprise me.</div></div><hr />

I'm still looking for how to manual attack need some buttons like Rockem Sockem Robots. That would make playing a little more. Exciting</div></div><hr />

Have you ever noticed how you can hit attack, and nothing happens for several seconds?  Why is that?  The processor is waiting for the beginning of the next tic.  All combat is divided into 6 second tics.  Consequently, a complete round of combat must occur before agro is determined, i.e. it doesn't matter who hits first because the code factors everyone hitting in the same tic.  The order of spam on you screen is immaterial.  Once all damage is calculated, agro is determined for that tic of combat.</div></div><hr />

if you lose aggro to a melee youre generally gonna either have to wait for them to de aggro or for you to get a proc to have aggro</div></div><hr />

Negative. successful taunt &quot;should&quot; put you straight to the top of hate list .<br />
I say &quot;should&quot; because since the patches somthing has been screwy.</div></div><hr />

  I completely disagree. I see mobs ping pong. I attack when I hit attack and get aggro when I should. Sometimes I miss, sure, and I don't have misses on... Do you? Is that perhaps why you think you don't swing immediately? Are you on a slow connection? I've been playing this game a long time, and I've never seen any evidence that would lead me to believe aggro/combat rounds are synchronized or tick based.</div></div><hr />

It does put you at the top.  But not by very much.  So if you don't proc, or if they don't fd / evade / etc then they can easily regain aggro over you again.  Thus more pingpong.  I tell guildie melee that I won't use taunt if they get aggro for that reason =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
positive, if another melee (and i mean pure melee, monk rogue) is taking your aggro its due to their much better dps and even if you taunt they are still gonna jump back ahead of you on aggro list until you get a proc or they de aggro b/c their dps will keep passing your +1 aggro from taunt</div></div><hr />

I agree too - this is how taunt has always (and predictably) behaved for me in the past ... but aside from this, I have noticed occasional screwiness lately with taunt and aggro overall (not always in a melee pong either).  Mebbe it's just the failure message that's broken tho, and the taunts I think are succeeding - ain't.  I've muttered about it in a different thread, not gonna repeat it here<br />
