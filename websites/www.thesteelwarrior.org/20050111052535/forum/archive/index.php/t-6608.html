&quot; rogue is Primarily a DPS class, that is our role...and perhaps our greatest asset..... to keep our role as masters of melee dps, &quot;<br />
<br />
Rogues are head and shoulders above the rest of the game's melee &quot;DPS classes.&quot; And yet, just like every other one of the huddled masses, it seems they too NEED more DPS. It's good to see that monks and zerkers and rangers and warriors aren't the only ones that feel they NEED this upgrading. :P<br />
<br />
&quot; the class is VERY one dimensional, and lacks Utility : We lack Utility! probably the most one dimensional class in the game, &quot;<br />
<br />
hahahahahahahahah. One dimensional? Rogues at least have skills like scouting and CR and even stupid lock picking to fall back on. Warriors ... Clerics. THOSE are one dimensional.<br />
<br />
I won't even touch the nonsense about being a rogue puller.<br />
<br />
That post is just classic. You could take out all references to rogue and insert ANY other class ... including monks ... and it'd read the exact same as all the other posts of its ilk. I'm just surprised that a rogue would be ballsy enough to try it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have a better idea. how about increasing rogue dps since its pretty much all theyve got. ill take a wizard for dps in an exp group  long before i take a rogue because wizards have lots of utility for bailing the group out of trouble. rogues dont. an offtanking rogue is just one more class needing a heal. but .. if they increased dps then rogues would be tempting.<br />
<br />
as many classes as possible should be unique. rogues for &quot;most dps&quot;. wizards for most &quot;burst dps&quot;. clerics for heals. warriors for defense. enchanters (or was it bards?) for crowd control. then all the other classes get lumped into what we call &quot;hybrid&quot; classes. but why turn the rogue into a hyrbrid class like this guy obviously wants when there is such an obvious niche for rogues as the pre-eminent dps class?</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I think the Rog mez idea can be blamed squarely on World of Warcraft where it appears Rogues are the be-all, end-all.  It was only a matter of time before EQ rogues started calling for the WoW Rogue &quot;SAP&quot; ability.  In WoW it appears the rogues can stay out of combat and CC with sap, they can slow and snare with effective poisons and are generally a much more powerful class.</div></div><hr />

Rogues are not a very rewarding class to play.  We're often the unsung heros who stoicly do our job and move on.  PoP was less about our DPS, and more about the TIME we saved the guild on each and every raid.  The impact of that alone over the past year is tremendous.<br />
<br />
Giving and taking from a class over and over, just gets old after 3 years of it.<br />
<br />
Don't expect me to shed a tear WHEN they give Knights some form of defensive, because you warriors seem to think our sole role is DPS.  And as you all know, our DPS is limited by your aggro, which Paladins are vastly superior to.  Thus we can go full DPS without worry, which is what we're supposed to do, right?   :p <br />
<br />
Don't mock our plight.  All I've wanted is a decent batch of AA for an expansion without the prior stuff being made worthless to some degree or another.  But that isn't a part of the new and improved EQ to EQ2 conversion &quot;vision&quot;</div></div><hr />

Warriors tend to get so vehemently blindsided about their tanking abilities, that they ignore the other factors.  That was my only point.  I prefer solid warrior tanks over a knight any day.  When the crap hits the fan, the warrior's got a good chance to pull out the trump card.  The knight's too busy consenting me.  The one key factor about rogues over monks and warriors is how dependant a class we are on others.  That will never change, and it never should.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eh, not like that's any different than what they've done to monks. Well, except that Rogues always have their DPS to fall back on. And monks only have the GROUND to fall to. <br />
<br />
Yes and I've been able to sympathize with the monks.  They got hit pretty hard.  Multiple times.  The problem is, they keep trying to redefine our class (monks too to a degree), then change their mind.  In my opinion, that's beyond nerfing.  And if you look at those Time parses at the monks tanking, you can bet that somewhere down the road Sony's going to slap them upside the head again due to their own shortsightedness.  As it is, a lot of the items and the mods have gotten quite ridiculous.  Somewhere down the line will be an item with a right click DT.  Except it'll end up being a hybrid only item.  ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
I've always thought that Rogues got the shaft hard on AAs. But to some degree, I see that as a blessing. It sure beats having to get 200+ AA just to be able to do what you are supposed to be doing. <br />
<br />
What makes you think it's any different for a rogue?  We're in there taking ripostes because the rangers and knights have NO clue how to control their aggro.  We're taking the AEs too.  Add up LR5 and ID5, ND3, PE, Ambidex, Ferocity3, Fury of the Ages 3...  HP, resists, and the ability to mitigate or dodge those stray hits when the mob flips around is what keeps up in the fight for the whole duration.  Maybe everyone else is fortunate enough to be using a nice, slow 2h to severely limit riposte damage taken, but the dual wielding rogues who have 18-20 delay weapons have little hope of survival without those same defensive AAs.   :)   Those that don't, can hope and pray nimble goes off before they get to their bind point and a patch heal lands before LHA gets them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
What they really need to do is sit down and take a serious look at the pure melee classes and flesh them out more instead of nixxing this and that to try to make the class appeal to a different crowd of people.  It's obvious that they still have no clue what to do with the pure melee classes.  They just did a quick fix back in December to appease everyone and figure they'll get around to fixing the rest....  4 expansions from now.  Just in time to add in DX10 and get so caught up with that, that it's delayed another 4 expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a warrior too (yeah, yeah, I'm a glutton for punishment heh) so I do see the other side of the coin.  All I ask is that you guys try to do the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of Sony giving the pure melee the Ass Monkey of the Year  award for 3 years running.</div></div><hr />

About 375 days /played as a rogue. We have our weaknesses, but we also have our strengths. Above all, it's still fun. If &quot;a lot of old time rogues are quitting,&quot; it's because they're burnt out on EQ, not because rogues aren't a fun class to play.<br />
<br />
I do agree somewhat with the lack of AAs to purchase. Even if we got a bunch more mostly useless skills, it would just be nice to have more to choose from. I spent the last couple months of POP being maxed out on AAs, and once I purchase packrat, I'll be maxed out until the next expansion with only leadership AAs to work on in the meantime.  Either way, I'll still be having fun with my rogue for as long as they let me.</div></div><hr />

Certainly not monks or warriors or berserkers. I see just as many high ratio daggers available to rogues now as I do supposed high ratio monk weapons.<br />

monks can pull and mend.  they have utility.  yet, they match low and mid range rogue dps thanks to high ratio droppable weapons.  until recently, the best droppable rogue piercer was 15, 20.  sure, in most cases rogue do a little more damage when they have the back 100% of the time and have BoT towers or the LDoN dagger but monk dps isnt dependant on mob positioning and aggro control.  they also have far more utility.  give up your FD and mend and then maybe you deserve to match rogue dps, til then, you shouldn't match it.<br />
<br />
warriors dont match monk or rogue dps and i never implied that they did.  however, they are the best tanks in the game hands down.  being best at one thing means you have to sacrifice others, right?<br />
<br />
mid level ranger dps thanks to the tradeskilled elem bows is way out of line.  sony fucked up hardcore with those bows.<br />

as far as berserkers are concerned, i have no idea where they fit in.  they seem more of a hybrid class due to all of the utility that they have.  who cares though...they were an unneeded class.  adding another class was one of the most stupid things sony could have done.  they cant even handle the classes that are already available.  i guess they needed a reason for mid and low range players to buy GoD though....</div></div><hr />
