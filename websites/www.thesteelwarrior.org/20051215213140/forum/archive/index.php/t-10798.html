I just fought a druid in bear form and he handed my ass to me.  He was only one lvl higher than me and he had me down to 25 percent by the time I had him down to around 80, that is ridiculous. All he did was melee me and somehow stun me in combat then back up and charge me like every 15 seconds to stun me again. I used a potion and still only managed to get him down to 60 percent life before I died. Oh well just had to get that off my chest, near as I can tell druids get alot of our good abilities with less rage cost less cooldown and no need to stance twist, plus all thier regular abilities. Grrr.<br />

Dual wielding toothpicks?  I fought a druid my level +2 a couple days ago.  We dueled 3 times and if was never really a contest.  His mitigation in bear form was still pretty minimal.  I did the standard stuff til he got low.  When he shifted out to heal, I pummeled him, and execute to finish.  He did get one of those druid intercepts off on me once, but he couldn't deal enough dmg to take advantage of it.  Just keep in melee range, hamstring, strafe, and remember to pummel when they unshift to heal... works for Feral Druids anyways.</div></div><hr />

Hrmm I was dual wielding but didn't see any message from damage shield. That must have been it and I turned the messages off somehow. Dumb mistake... Good thing I just won a doombringer in ah. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to say it was the damage shield also.  I'd suggest going 2hander next time.  Druid's DS can put out 18dmg per hit (with a 25% chance to double with talents).  Against a dual-wielder, that's significant.<br />
<br />
I don't think it could have been his melee, since druid bear melee really does suck.  It's not affected by weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our rage generation, so far as I know, is no better or worse than a warriors'.  We can gain chances to get additional rage with feral Talents. <br />
<br />
The difference in bear mitigation could be greatly effected by the druid's choice in weapon.  There is one weapon in particular that has 260Armor on it which, when you take into account the x3.6 ratio for shifting, is significant.  For the most part, though, druids aren't going to stand up to a warrior toe-to-toe in bear form.  I haven't seen many with that high of AC and our DPS really is the pits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druid rage generation is pretty low due to the crap DPS they put out. They also only get one stance. And even beyond that, they get some pretty crappy PvP rage skills, pretty much limited to a bit of extra damage, a stun and a charge (with talent points). Bear form can get up to some serious mitigation through armor though, as pointed out above.<br />

The high armor might help a bit, but I reckon the parry and Defensive Stance differences outweigh the higher armor.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand how he's reaching those numbers (his gear alone is 1781 with an additional 260 from the staff which isn't showing for some reason - take that by the 3.6 and you get 7347.  What is armor class naked? It isn't even close to 2k)  And the &quot;64.58%&quot; next to the armor is strange...plus his stats shouldn't be showing him as bear anyway.  What am I missing?   His health seems extraordinarily high too.</div></div><hr />

Simple, the rankings are wacked.  There is no way the lead warrior has 12k armor with the equipment he has.  (His is semi comparably to mine, I have about 8.5 with full buffs, pally aura and protection potion).<br />
<br />
Druids can push around 10-11k armor in bear, but they have to totally whore out armor equipment to do it.  I understand this is because a lot of items that used to be +armor, got changed to a straight &quot;armor&quot; rating earlier on due to confusing people.</div></div><hr />

That makes the entire rankings worthless other than just being a pretty magelo.</div></div><hr />

Aye, for those actually padding their weak ass with this tactic.  I personally like their interface better then the competitors (AKZam/Thott), especially since they have updated to keep up with the popularity of their site.  They were SO slow to load as little as a month ago...it has improved and will get better still.<br />
