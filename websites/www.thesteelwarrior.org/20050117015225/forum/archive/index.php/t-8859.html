I will warn you, my equipment is positively horrid with a few minor exceptions, I am currently working on the quested haste neck from LoY to upgrade my haste item, other than that I am at a loss because I am not in a big guild either.<br />

Thank you for any advice you can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">go buy yourself a Black Blade of Tormenting, if you're a good race go do the Praetor Blade of Debility quest; and get some guildmates together and hit up LDoN. Your weapons aggro-wise are junk bro....no offense, I know you've worked hard for them but come the 40's and 50's YOU are what comes between your guildies life and death and you need to start fixing yourself up to do that job !<br />
<br />
Seriously; for the casual/small guild player LDoN is the answer. Save them Points, buy gear that, as a casual, would most likely never see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd also reccomend making friends with a Smith that can make FH armor.  Look up the recipes, offer to farm components, save your cash as much as you can, and work towards a set of Fierce Heraldic.<br />
<br />
Velium fire wedding rings would be a nice upgrade and can usually find em cheap.<br />
<br />
As far as weaps go, you can get upgrades for like 25pp. you gotta go look at your servers bazaar and see whats up. Weighty polearm is upgrade for you and they almost free. Veno axe, Frostbringer, blade of insanity, there are just tons of things out there that won't cost a bunch.</div></div><hr />

What is your budget, exactly?</div></div><hr />

Judging your armour, I'd say that your bank vault i near empty? I suggest you drop the xp'ing for a while and start making some plat. You can make thousands of plat in a single evening, by selling leather padding to smiths. Another way is to kill skeleton guards in paineel and sell their stuff (in paineel).<br />
<br />
You first upgrade should be your weapon - here I recommend barnacle covered axe, since it is cheap. Then slowly improve your armour with bazaar pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jadesii</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, the bank is dry. I have a max amount of 20 to 30 hours per week total to play, between work, school, and being a mom, so farming is hard to do. I prefer to work for my gear versus buying things in bazaar (call me an old school purist), and as such I have been looking into working on smithing some of the LDoN armor. Wouldn't be great for a warrior at 46, but would be huge upgrades for the crappy newbie armor I am currently in. Thank you for the suggestions, folks. I do appreciate the time you took to respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd upgrade your weapon first, as previous posters have said (mainhand). Do a search on this site for &quot;goranga&quot; and look at how to get the spiked club for free (possible to do at your level if you are polite). It won't solve your problem, but it'll be better than what you have now (if magelo is still up to date).<br />
I'd go to East K and slaughter lions and spiders. You'll be looking for low quality, medium quality etc hides from the lions and silk from the spiders. Both will sell fairly well, and if you stay away from the giants not much can kill you there.<br />
Rockhoppers and shadeling silks are another option. Look at the EQtraders message board on smithing and tailoring for some tips on where to farm these things.<br />
When you get some pp, upgrade your newbie armor slots with gothic or frosted armor, which you can buy from PoK vendors near the smithing forges for around 100 pp per piece. (Smiths using them to skill up on sometimes sell them to the nearby vendors, so they aren't always available, but they'd be better than what you have--just be sure that you're buying the right size for your race).<br />
You can also get fairly good rings in the bazaar for 250-500 pp.<br />
I'd suggest that stuff not because it's going to last you long, but because if you have that stuff you can group without being a total mana sponge. <br />
then, look for a weapon with a good aggro proc and research components for cultural armor. Keep your eyes peeled for smiths &amp; make friends with them.</div></div><hr />
