Obviously Ive been playing the game with all of the details turned down but the worst part of this setup was the fact that there was no pixel shader support for the terrian textures. Recently I discovered some 3rd party drivers from omegadrivers.net that have boosted my performance significantly, removed several graphical glitches, and most importanly stoped my eyes from bleeding when viewing the terrain textures in WoW. If you suffer from lack of pixel shader or just want to tweak your graphical perfomance I highly recomend that you check out omegadrivers.net.<br />

<br />
I've been using their ATI drivers for the last year or so over the traditionals from ATI and they are usually superior in quality and FPS - ATI even endorses them =)<br />

Good webpage to keep bookmarked is :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive also been using a tool to change the latency of my graphics card bus. This has helped my overall performance by stopping my 7500 from hogging the PCI bus. The combination of this tool and the omega drivers has eliminated the lockups that I used to get when running in and out of the AH in IF.<br />
<br />
The tool is somewhat self explanatory. In my situation I use it to change my graphics card latency from 255 to 64.<br />
<br />
You can get this tool from here:<br />
