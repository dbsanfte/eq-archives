<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I have a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled and a Blade of Carnage (which i literally got less than 5minute ago off AoW). <br />
<br />
Alright, here is my problem.<br />
<br />
Which weapon should I put in which hand? <br />
<br />
The BBE will proc more and sooner with its proc mode on it, but the BoC will proc more hate per proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was thinking BBE in main hand and BoC in secondary for the best snap aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You got it right IMO, you can switch em for better agro over time if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that the both the ratio and the global proc (the increased proc rate of the BBotE match the hate diff) are barely the same for both weapon, the difference of aggro between the two of them should be less than 5% I imagine. So yes equipe the BBotE MH for a better chance of early proc, and the BoC OH (usually we put best ratio in OH so...). I don't think the hate difference will do anything on fight shorter than 5 minutes so don't feel obliged to bother switching them, but it's your feeling. on a side note, with the SS AA (that give a DB to the OH) the BoC will have a DB bigger (by one lol) than the BBotE, but the diff is so small than once again they should do the same whatever you put in MH/OH. So all in all you can't really made a bad choice of placement so go for whatever you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the help. <br />
<br />
I think I'm going to keep the BBE in my MH with BoC in OH.</div></div><hr />
