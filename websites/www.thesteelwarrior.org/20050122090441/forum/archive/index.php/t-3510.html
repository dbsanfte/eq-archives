<br />
I would think you could proc on a riposte, but I don't really know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...that's alot of attacks.<br />
<br />
And I don't think you can proc on a riposte, but I'm not too sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can proc on a Riposte. <br />
<br />
Duel someone with max Riposte skill and a procing weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pretty sure that you can't proc on the free attack you get from a ripostes.  I used riposte disc against a huge train of mobs in the ssra basement before using earthshaker and I didnt get any procs out of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recall a thread a while ago (probably the old board) about this same subject. I am pretty sure the conclusion is that you cannot proc on a riposte against an npc. <br />
<br />
If someone has done it, I want to see the log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope it can't be done to my knowledge, try grabbing a huge train of mobs and use riposte disc with auto attack off.. if you proc on one of those.. wtg you win a pretzel :p <br />
