<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We did time yesterday and i was bored, so figured id parse each god fight to see how much different my parses were compared to a few months ago.  For the fights  i had 12140 hps 2864 ac, which varied a bit for times when spirit of the wood was on, avoidance 30 and shielding 14.  I was evasive on all mobs other than vallon, and did not tank tallon.  There may have been a random vie or rune thrown in but for that really wont affect the results much.<br />

im roughly 20%-30% higher with BoW / BF + Aegis of Earth<br />

~2250 / 2400 AC, No avoidance, No Shielding<br />

this is worth a link to caster boards, screw clerics bidding on %shielding stuff :(</div></div><hr />

call of the rathe<br />
shield of torment<br />
mage ds<br />
about 3 or 4 spirit of the woods<br />
bard amping veeshan, dropped warsong for guardian rythms to keep ac constant.</div></div><hr />

Next time have him twist warsong,nivs,veeshan for a good DS/AC combo.  <br />
<br />
normally do but wanted to keep my ac constant during the fights, he normally twists veesh, niv, warsong, guardian but as i said i wanted to keep ac constant for 1 and 2 we only had 2 bards so he dropped warsong for ae resist for bert inny tt saryrn ct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wihtout a baseline that info is kinda useless on its own.  Would be nice to see some distribution histograms from the old ac and new ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i had a few parses with 2400 ac, but they really arnt comparible to this as at the time i had shielding 3 and avoid 20.  I would say the most telling tale is from tt and saryrn, who i used to parse every kill.  Hit rate from 0 avoid to 30 avoid was roughly 44% to 38ish%.  Im sure a large part of that has to do with 500 more ac, but thats still a huge jump.  The problem with comparing the effects of shielding avoid and ac, is that its virtually impossible to replace a shield or avoid slot with an item wo the effect with identical ac to solely isolate the effects of the shielding or avoidance.  For example i could parse time with 0 avoid but would lose about 100ish ac meaning the difference in numbers would be a function of 0 avoid and 100 less ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">REgardless, you could look at hit distributions which are not affected by avoidance or shielding.  I would like to see them if you could.  The average hit seems lower than I would have expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You took the same dps on a few of those that I take tanking in Ikkinz trials...  Really puts those mobs into perspective.<br />
<br />
Anyways like Brodda said could you post the hit distributions of the fights?  Broken into Disc/Non Disc chunks if possible but thats a bit of extra work that can be figured out from seeing the hits anyways o not really necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I havent really had much time to play with eqcompanion, but is there a way to have the software break melee dmg into di 0-19?  If there is i can post a breakdown tonite, if not ill have to dl a parser that can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He said he used evasive so it shouldn't matter unless you had BoV.  I use yalp for the histograms.  It isn't quite DI 1-20, but close enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AC from items doesn't increase avoidance, your defensive skill is what gives you the original number.  The +avoidance, on the other hand, will increase your avoidance (believe it or not!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This weekend ill reparse this mobs with 0 avoidance, ill flip in charm of defense for vz orb (the dodge mod is useless since i already have it on my ts ear), Replace plat cloak of war with that retarded high ac shit stat back shield from katta, the quest shoudnt take me long, and replace my avoid ring with a glyphed ring from ikkinz.  This should keep me within 30ish ac of where i was and 0 avoidance.  Should give a fairly solid indication of the magnitude avoidance has on hit%.  Then again you really cant break avoid 10-30 down unless you assume its a linear effect, and you can really never assume.<br />
<br />
Edit if i get a chance, ill also split my logs from disc down to end of fight and throw those numbers out and disc on numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unfortunately it won't because the length of the fights are not constant and I was evasive on all mobs other than vallon.  If you are evasive for 3 min and the fight last 4 min you will get different results then if the fight were to last 4.5 min.<br />
<br />
You could cut and paste the time spent w/ and w/ out disc to respective logs and parced them seperatly I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">thats what i was planning on doing, each mob alone really wont give much of a sample, but assuming avoidance will have a similar affect on hit% for every god in time, the combined should give a fairly reasonable number as to the effectiveness of avoidance 30l</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Doh, was a bit late didn't see he used evasive.</div></div><hr />
