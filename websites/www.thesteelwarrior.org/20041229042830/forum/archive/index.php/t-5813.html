<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for information on the point cost progression and effect progression of the group leadership abilities.<br />
<br />
I'd like any info anyone has available on the diff abilities and what they do/cost.  Heres a breakdown of what I know right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Title - Cost - Effect<br />
<br />
Mark NPC - 3/4/? - Using a hotkey accesable only by the person with the skill, it places a &quot;1&quot; at the beginning of the targets name and also places a target ring around the mob that is seperate from the normal target ring(note: currently this extra targeting ring may be adversly affected by custom UI's and my not display properly).  The second and third levels allow you to mark one additional mob each with a &quot;2&quot; and a &quot;3&quot;.<br />
<br />
NPC Health - 2 - Highlights mob's name and adds its health at the end in the format &quot;NPC Name - %&quot;<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - 4 - Adds a White and HIGHLY noticable second target ring around MA's target<br />
<br />
Delegate Mark NPC - 4 - See &quot;Mark NPC&quot; above.  The only difference is the group leader with this skill can chose to give anyone in the group the marking ability.  Limited to a single marked NPC.<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs - 4/6 - Allows group members to get a list of a targeted group member's buffs via a hotkey made from the leadership window.  Second level shows the time remaining before buffs fade.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness - 6 - Allows you to know all spells being cast in your vicinity.  Format - &quot;NPC/PC begins to cast a spell. &lt;Spellname&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Offense Enhancement - 4/5/6/7/8 - 10atk/20atk/30atk/40atk/50atk<br />
<br />
Mana Enhancement - 4/6/8 - 30mana/60mana/100mana<br />
<br />
Health Enhancement - 4/6/8 - 30hp/60hp/100hp<br />
<br />
Health Regeneration - 4/6/? - 1hp pertick/?/?<br />
<br />
Find Path to PC - 4 - Creates a Find style path to targeted group member<br />
<br />
Health of Target's Target - 7 - Adds an extra target window showing the name and health of your target's target.  Clicking this allows you to target your target's target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless noted otherwise assume all abilities are available to the full group and all effects effect the whole group.  Leadership abilities are only active when the person that has them is the leader of the group.  Also it is assumed that all effects hp, mana, atk, regen stack with current worn caps.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:  According to a post on the cleric boards the hp enhancement GROUP ability stacks with the RAID ability, I'm assuming this applies to mana, atk, and regen as well.</div></div><hr />

The regen is 1hp a tick and the next lvl costs 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Monk was grouped w/ a rogue that had NPC Health and desiginate Main Assist.  I belive he had them both at level 1 and it showed them highlighted when I checked my leadership AA stuff.  The NPC Health is real nice as it highlights the mob name making it even larger and places a % of the mobs Hps at the end of the name.  Was nice and easy to see and was marked like this &gt;&gt; NPC Name - % &lt;&lt; .<br />
<br />
As he designated himself the MA when every he had any NPC or PC targeted it added a White and HIGHLY noticable second target ring around them.  I am using the default UI so not sure how it will show up if your using a custom one so if anyone sees different then please post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems there are four skills that would be useful in both xp groups, ldon group, as well as raids.  Of the following four which would go for first?<br />
Offense Enhancement<br />
Mana Enhancement <br />
Health Enhancement<br />
Health Regeneration<br />
<br />
I have 3 points earned and am leaning towards Health Enhancement first, followed by Mana Enhancement as it seems to help in the most number of situations.<br />
Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish people would get Spell Awareness and Delegate MA.  Those two can help a lot more than an extra 30 HP or 10 attack could in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inspect buffs allows anyone in the group to make a button using the Leadership window.  Targeting a group member and pressing the button gives you:<br />
<br />
Groupmate has the following buffs:<br />
Stamina<br />
Grim Aura<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Any party member can do it and casters love to be able not to have to ask whether their buffs wore off and it's probably great for short HoT spells and damage shields.<br />
<br />
It seems to have unlimited range but you have to target the player so it has to be in the zone.<br />
<br />
The next level will cost 6 points.  What it will do, I have no idea as the description didn't change.  Someone suggested that you could then inspect non-group members but it didn't say that in the description.<br />
<br />
I also have NPC Health.  It adds the health percentage at the end of the NPC's name for whatever you have targeted.  If I am MT I see the main target's health but nobody else does unless they target it too.  They see their own target's health.  You need to be grouped for the ability to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got Mark NPC before Delegate Main Assist as I found the wording a bit confusing. Funny thing is I find Mark NPC handier as it gives an emote in groupchannel saying a particular NPC is marked with a 1 so I can just use it as a pull/targetting message. <br />
It also gives an extra, green targetting circle and puts a 1 in front of name. Next step shows as 4 points so costs is prolly 3/4/5.<br />
I agree with Phantron, the utilities will be more of a help than a bit of extra hps/atk, spell awareness is definately next. Knowing exactly when a mob starts a CH or 4 buff dispell is obviously very handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree with the usefulness of the utility skills, most of these are things that good players know/do anyway.  I'll break it down . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
Mark NPC/Delegate Mark NPC - The only real use I see for this is marking the mob to be attacked or mez'd on a multipull so that the chanter can mez quickly.  My guildie chanters don't seem to have a problem with simply assiting me then targeting the other quickly, just not an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
NPC Health - All the melee should already have this in their target window if they're assisting properly.  For casters its very very simple to setup an assist MT button(something they should have anyway) and then use the toggle last two targets key to switch back and forth between mez'd mobs or heal targets and the MT's current mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - Dear god, if you don't have a key &quot;/assist (insert MA name)&quot; which you change to the MA everytime you join the group, you don't need to be grouping with me.  Again for casters the toggle last two targets makes assisting the MA to check their target without losing their current target very simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs - If you're too lazy to tell me when you need a buff, I'm CERTAINLY not going to inspect your buffs every 10min to determine if I need to rebuff you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness - This could have some usefulness, though in general if you don't know what castertype you're dealing with by the first spell they cast then you're just not paying attention.  If its a cleric and its under 40% health and it makes the healing sound when casting, its probably chealing.  If its a chanter and it makes the same sound, its probably dispelling.  Just about any other class and you can assume its gonna nuke or debuff you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Health of Target's Target - WTF is this? If you're healing a group member(stop me if I sound like a broken record) just use the /assist MA + toggle last two targets method.  if you've targeted a mob, then most likely this would display a group member, HELLO PARTY WINDOW.  The only good I see this doing is quickly ascertaining the first PC on a mez'd mob's agro list, hardly seems worth the points when targeting the mob and using /assist does the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">NPC Health is nice when tied with the MA ability, Healers can keep you targetted and see the mobs % of hp's without switching targets or asking &quot;whats it at?&quot;, plus its nice being right in your face at all times rather than looking at a target health indicator. Clerics like it alot, every single one I've grouped with has said so and happy clerics = fast groups.<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist isnt to teach people how to assist or even help with assisting, thats not what I got it for anyway. I wanted to mark the NPC I was on so enchanters didnt mez what I had targetted on inc and die or have to run around to the other side of the room to hit F8 to target the other mob after waiting to see if health dropped etc.. and enchanters love it, again every single one I've grouped with has commented how much easier it makes their job of picking a target faster and more reliably to mez, the days of pick and pray are gone with this ability. This is the best leader ability there is imo considering the dps of unmezzed mobs in GoD. Also people can see when you switch targets fast to throw a succesful taunt and incite on a mezzed mob and switch back fast and shit, gets lots of compliments and comments about not just hitting attack and watching TV.<br />
<br />
I just recently got the Find PC ability and it does work just like the find feature in towns and the bazaar, never again will I have to go back for someone that says &quot;which way did you all go?&quot; priceless imo. Plus theres a /findpc pcname command so you dont have to jump through hoops buttons and scroll down lists to use it.<br />
<br />
Spell awareness is one I will get very soon, I'm just anal about knowing everything going on around me, the more I see the better, and this does that.<br />
<br />
Health of targets target is the first thing our raid leader is getting he said, I agree I dont see the usefulness in groups but in a raid environment it should save alot of lives.<br />
<br />
Another 100hp's isnt nearly as useful as a few of the other abilities imo, although I will definitely get the hp's soon also. We bring very little to a group in the form of utility, these abilities are especially great for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grobsmashprexus</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was in beta I played a bezerker who had all leadership AA's maxed.  There was one of them that when you conned the mob it told you its level, class, what is had a strong resist to (like a strong cold resist) and if it had any immunities (like immune to mes or slow)  If it made it live I am not sure what skill it is linked with but I thought this was by far the best Groupleader AA.  Maxed inspect buff will tell you how much longer the buffs are going to last so it could be nice to have to see if you need to get anything refreshed before a long fight.  The mark npc I could see every chanter and raid leader wanting to get just so they can mark the order they want something killed in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
YOUR cleric begins to cast complete healing on the rogue.<br />
YOUR druid begins to nook the mob.<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
I'd much rather know what people in my group/raid are doing to better time when to smack discs then knowing what spell an NPC is casting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your list seems to be coming along.  I am thinking that the regen lvl 3 costs 8 but im not sure.  Also i think it might add 2 more for lvl 2 and 3 more for lvl 3 being a total of 6hp a tick added through leadership, but it might only be 3.  Also the hp buff is probably the same as mana 30 hp or mana 60 hp or mana and I am willing to bet the 3rd lvl is 90hp or mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hand of Virtue (184 min)<br />
Divine Intervention (4 min)<br />

Target's Target gives an extra red life bar showing the name and health of your target's target. It updates real time.<br />
<br />
As a cleric I find both of these far more interesting than the MA stuff or the hp/atk/mana - even though I dont deny that they dont add any power but merely convinience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its just like your target bar - part of the UI - so you can move it where you might want it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Health of Targets Target is the Best Leadership ability I have seen in game yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
It gives yu a second target window,and obviously as the name implies shows you the Name and health of whatever your &quot;targets target&quot; is.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://surlok.netfirms.com/tot.JPG <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that it also gives you a name is important.<br />
<br />
While it has limited usefulness in a group on raids it is huge,Especilly so during clearings or in large Ring events.<br />
<br />
If anyone has tried out Grand Summoner Ring in KT and encountered the golem rings then this ability is a godsend ,I can rapidly switch targets of mobs and tell instantly what the mob has on target without having to switch off it or assist,This allows for immediate Engaging,taunting assist/shielding whatever.<br />
<br />
You could always simply hit assist for this,but in the inital stages of a mob popping and aggroing off proximity that target can change rapidly,Instead of having to back target to get the mob back on target again you never lose the target.That is important,there is myriad of things that can happen during the time you don't have a mob on target,including another mob hitting you and giving you a new target removing your old back target to another tank engages with say aetaunt and then you blowing ae taunt etc etc.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And most importantly,when your tanking,and some random melee takes aggro,since you have the mob o target...that melee comes up right away in the other window.And then of course you nkow who to yell at and they have no excuse.<br />
<br />
Thats the best part,and totally worth the 7 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you have the second level of Offense Enhancement, could you share with us what the 2nd and 3rd levels of this cost point wise? <br />
<br />
I thought I saw that someone already posted it, but sure.  The second level of Offensive enhancement is 5, the 3rd level is 6.  So, my assumption would be its 4, 5, 6, 7.  Will let you know for sure in a few weeks...my guild is seriously tank heavy, so it seemed the best course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RJs68Olds</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good info you guys are gathering here.  I've been looking all over for a decent breakdown of the new LAAs.  I've picked up Designate MA and NPC Health so far.  NPC Health was just an impulse buy since it was so cheap, and now I know why it was :)<br />
<br />
One question regarding Heath of Target's target.  Does clicking on the name in your 'Target's Target' window automatically target your target's target(God that's a lot of targets in one sentence)?  If so, it may be more nifty in groups than I thought it would be.  Even so, I can't say I'd consider it worth the 7 LAAs.  As a raid AA though, I'd make this my #2 priority next to designate MA for sure.<br />
<br />
My next LAA choice is torn between Health of Target's Target and Spell Awareness.  Spell Awareness was brought to my attention by the monks in guild as a very useful pulling tool, since sometimes when they FD off adds it's hard to tell if the NPC is casting on them still or if it's just casting some crap buff on itself.  So, I'm leaning towards Spell Awareness ATM, but I'm still thinking the ability for the tank to see when he's got aggro on the mob without having to wait for someone to get hit is pretty worthwhile too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anofalye</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NPC health is VITAL for someone that is chain pulling, as you start playing with pacify and lose assist and are to far to assist anew!<br />
<br />
When you have 2 wizards and 1 mage in group and you are supposed to chain pull, I assure you, this is no luxury!</div></div><hr />

yes you can click the name in the ToT window and bring it up as your own target.</div></div><hr />

This skill is actually a godsend for enchanters and Bards. Being able to see what the tank has targeted as mobs come into camp without having to go through the time of assisting the MA then trying to target the other mobs. It speeds up my ability to mez a good deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How accurate and detailed is the time on the 2nd level of Inspect Buffs?  Does it just show minutes remaining, ticks, or is it accurate down to the second?  If so, it might be really useful for timing short heal-over-time spells and such.<br />
<br />
I got Mark NPC instead of delegate MA and am very happy with it.  I like the flexibility, though I requre a button for it.  When I switch targets early to taunt or whatever, everone else stays glued to whatever I had marked which is what I want.<br />
<br />
Anyone have both Delegate MA and Mark NPC?  I'm wondering how the two abilities interact.<br />
<br />
I'm eventually going to need Delegate Mark NPC so the enchanter can mark what's gonna be next, but there's so much I want more.<br />
<br />
Health of Target's Target is next for me, I think.</div></div><hr />

I saved and got this first. It was down between this and Spell Awareness and I decided to get the bigger one done first=)<br />
<br />
Ok, you get Target of Target. When people in your group activate this, they will get a window that shows the target of their target.<br />
<br />
So far, the people in my group that have used it, love it.</div></div><hr />

If I have Delegate MA and Delegate Mark NPC 3 how do they interact?  For instance, we have 4 mobs, and MA is attacking one and the enchanter has marked the other three as 1,2, and 3.  When the MA kills one and starts attacking the one previously marked as 1, will the other numbers/marks automaticly change?  Does Mark NPC 1 stack with Delegate MA?  Can you Mark the same NPC as 1 and 2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First it seems to have a bug where if you zone with an NPC marked the mark stays where it was on the ground permanently. I left a couple in Ikkinz trial 1 and they were still there when we did an Ikkinz raid later... Everyone else in my group reported also seeing them. They were gone a few days later though.<br />
<br />
The other problem is several people report instead of seeing a green circle they see some annoying flashing thing that gives them headaches so they ask that I don't use the ability. Does anyone have a solution for these folks? I would guess that it's some sort of custom UI issue but we've had them delete their targetting ring UI file and that didn't fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

I found it highly annoying(using default UI), but at least my chat window mostly was covering it up when I was fighting.<br />
<br />
Its supposedly possible to change, but not easy, our resident guild-UI guru posted some 20 lines worth of junk you need to paste into the target .ini file(dont have it handy atm sorry).</div></div><hr />

I took it then yesterday, could create the button to activate it, but then it didn't do anything ??? And same for all others in the raid. No one could get the second window Target of Target.<br />
<br />
Anyone got same problem with the raid version of Health of Targets Target  then ? Or am I missing something ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mirrored the values from Health Enhancement to Mana Enhancement since theres no in game way to measure mana effectively so I simply assumed the numbers are the same.  <br />
<br />
Updated Offense Enhancement, filled out cost, filled out atk to level 3, not making assumptions since Health Enhancement got a little perk at the end, though I'm still assuming this will be a straight 50atk once maxed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any confirmed info on the regen and a short concise writeup on Mark NPC and Delegate Mark NPC would be appreciated.  I probably won't be getting any of the utility abilities until I max the hp/mana/atk ones since my groups already do fine without them.  100hp and 20atk kicks alot more ass than Target's Target in my book, but to each his own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the first level it places a &quot;1&quot; at the beginning of the targets name and also places a target ring around the mob that is seperate from the normal target ring. If the SS's from Sony are any indication, levels 2 and 3 will let you mark 2 and 3 targets with the appropriate numbers. And also with target rings that indicate the number they are. (Though the rings seem effected by custom UI's)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is that it doesn't work like that precisely.  There's a fairly large and noticable update gap if you watch it carefully.  Last time we killed RZ I noticed that occasionally RZ would turn but the target's target stayed on the MT.  I thought it was part of the animation till I turned on other hits and saw that he would turn quad a pet, kill the pet, turn back, and target's target never got updated to reflect it...  Really annoying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZ turns to cast, he does riposte while turned though, since his casting animation is long (throwing the axe) he stays turned a few seconds, and pets are always in ae rampage range also, maybe thats what you saw. <br />
<br />
One of the great things about targets target is you dont waste taunts when a caster turns just to cast a spell since they keep you as the target and youre still on top of the hatelist, after awhile its just natural to look at the targets target bar any time a mob turns giving you much better results with all taunt abilities and /shield if need be, thats been the case for me anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I'm not positive on the ripostes since I dont play with my misses on and I use abbreviated Hits Mode, I'm pretty sure they all do though.<br />
<br />
I am positive all casters can switch to another PC to cast while keeping you as target and switch right back to you when done casting since spell casting follows a different hate list and other factors such as debuffs already on you etc.. Its noticable on RZ and not most other gods in Time since his ability is targetted and not a Point Blank AE or Proc I would guess, very noticable on regular mobs whom are casters though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, there's a limit to how many people can use it at once.   I'll work on figuring out whether it's limited by group or if the limit is zone-wide once I find someone else with the ability.<br />
<br />
Second, the path is rarely the best path to take to get somewhere.  Elevation changes can cause it to double back on itself.<br />
<br />
The path does not stick to the PC you're looking for but rather ends at the spot where they were when you activated the ability.  One cute use is to start it when you zone into a LDoN and then if you don't bump into the player you activated it on, you'll have the path to zout should you need it.<br />
<br />
Once it's been activated, the path will follow you and mark the path you take, rather than snapping to the best or shortest path.  Fun to write stuff with it.<br />
<br />
It looks and acts exactly like the vendor find feature in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />

RZ does turn when casting, I thought he was agroing on others as well, but its just what he does.  I have seem him do this during enrage and no mass slaughter occured, so i would gather that the front facing for him is still facing the MT even tho the model is going thru an animation.</div></div><hr />
