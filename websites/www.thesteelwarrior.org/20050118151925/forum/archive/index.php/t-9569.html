Your question sounds like you think he has them bagged but hasn't augged them =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I ask that because he has those 40 hp augs.  For the price of one 40 hp aug you could get 2 AC augs (IIRC).  20 AC &gt; 40 hps.  I am not saying he has them around, I am asking why he chose the hps over AC.<br />

Because old habits die hard.  And also, TSW is kind of a bastion for enlightenment.  Go into your server's bazaar channel and try to explain to the level 70 ranger in there how many times per minute his weapons proc and how you know this and watch what happens.<br />

There are many things still being done on a regular basis in EQ that serve absolutely no purpose anymore.  Trying to understand why is just futile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i choose hp over AC, now as i recall, the +10's are not just chest helm arm leg feet slots only, as the type 7 40's are.  that said, perhaps i will stick +10s in the other open augs slots that i have, or where i  have ldon +12 or 15s.  though personally, and i expect lots of flames from EQ buffs, but i tend not to see much differene in how i tank and take damage with more AC, granted im gonna die a lot faster with 500 ac than i am w/ 2k, but it seems like a LOT of work to bring AC up, when i can get hps up so much faster.  flame on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The +10 AC augs go in:  Face, Neck, Waist, Back, Shoulders<br />
I don't recall where the +40 HP augs go, but I thought that even with all of the AC aug slots filled, you could add at least 2 HP augs.  Feet and something else, perhaps?<br />
<br />
I do agree though that the AC augs are better &quot;bang for your buck&quot; than the HP augs.<br />
<br />
Now if we could only convince the robes that AC &gt;&gt; HP...someday (yeah right).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok guys, lol you win.  i just won a 10 AC aug off granitesmash, type 7 all slots,  in addition to my 20 AC off BHR and 15 ac outta ferubi.  i just starting looking through augs at ldon merchants, and i have about 3500 points avail.  anyway, none of the +40's clash with any of the + 10 acs, so i went ahead and bought another 2500 points worth of ac (50ac) and threw in my + 10 ac aug somewhere else..  anyway, im up to 1720 AC unbuffed, and im  like 1/2 a faction level away from the OOW armor, and i have all the pieces set for all but bp and legs . . .  can hardly wait!! wooooooo.  i fucking love steelwarrior lol</div></div><hr />
