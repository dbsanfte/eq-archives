<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macenion</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have asked here before and since then gone an gotten a bunch of aa, been working on the loyalist shield(only need the damn ashes and the bastitsie wont SPAWN!!!!!) and am in a bit of a bind.<br />
<br />
I recently joined a Guild that raids like once a week, we are starting off fairly slow downed vindi last weekend for example. Now i am alternate MT and wondering on my aa path from here.<br />
<br />
In the Vindi fight i was 2 up due to being only tank with ae taunt, when main went down i hit ae hit incite and hit defensive and had total aggro. Have a BBoTE with a3 and Windspeeder with a2 at this stage at about 5523 hp and 1376 ac unbuffed<br />
<br />
Now to mah Question given this situation where i will prolly end up being backup tank for these raids what is the best aa path.<br />
<br />
Currently have run 3 sta 3, nd3, ca/cs1, Ae Taunt, PE WA 1 and a couple of singles.<br />
<br />
Should i finish out the HP aa and then worry bout defensive or due to being the alt tank get all mah def first then finish out hp aa.<br />
<br />
hp aa progression is pretty straight forward if defensive aa is what u think is the priority which way do you suggest.<br />
<br />
CA/LR/ID or<br />
CS/LR/ID<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for the help, been browsing here for a while and thought i would ask.<br />
<br />
PS:- the magelo is way different to what i currently have, waiting for them to update it so my autoupdate thing works again.<br />

<br />
From there my preference would be a couple ranks of offensive aa's (Ferocity and/or TM), then LR. WA2 wouldn't hurt either.<br />
<br />
If ya start gettin a lil worried about stats, grab a rank of PP/PD along the lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Buy a level or 2 of WA if you need more aggro ... maybe some stalwart endurance if youre not an ogre and dont want to get stunned ... and slowly work on Sturdiness.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, make sure you do all defensives before anything else, and dont freakin touch any offensive aa's until you have everything defensive and aggro oriented taken care of (and yeah this includes stalwart endurance  :p  )</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my advice, given what I've read and info I got for a similar question:<br />
Avoidance &gt; Mitigation &gt; HP (not absolute, but generally this is true, if you're not getting one-rounded or two-rounded).  <br />
<br />
Avoidance will allow you to not get hit possibly saving 300 - 1k+ points of damage and saving cleric mana and keeping you alive longer.<br />
<br />
Mitigation means when you are hit, it won't be as hard, again, you will probably save more hitpoints of damage this way than you can add HP through AA alone (presuming it's not a trivial mob).<br />
<br />
WARNING: These examples do not use actual improvements and results may be somewhat exaggerated versus reality.<br />
<br />
Say if you're a 8k tank and you are fighting GoD Sewer Plant mobs with no hp aa, avoidance aa or mitigation aa.  Chances are (without a real high AC), well before the GoD revamp for knights, you would be getting hit for near 1k damage a lot.  Let's say that is roughly 4 rounds (including a few misses here) and your dead (without a heal).<br />
<br />
If we add let's say, 1K HP from most of the HP AA you can get, that's what?  1 more hit or less than 1 round.<br />
<br />
If at max avoidance and you can miss a 1K hit every other round, that's like adding 2k HP in the original scenario of 4 rounds til death or a good chance you'll now survive at least 5 rounds.<br />
<br />
At max avoidance and mitigation you are now getting hit on average for 75% damage, you might now last 6 - 7 rounds.<br />
<br />
Add the HP aa and maybe it's quite likely you'll last the full 7 rounds.<br />
<br />
WARNING: All numbers here are make-believe and no one should expect these numbers to be realistic as compared to EQ.  It is just an attempt to explain that although everyone in game looks solely at how much HP a warrior has, that argument is only valid if they all have maxed their defensive AA.<br />
<br />
There are also numerous other threads will you find more specifics, like if you are tanking mobs that proc something nasty (3k+ lifetap, etc.) that avoidance is best.<br />
<br />
If the proc nothing and have a really high atk value, mitigation might be better.<br />
<br />
If you are dying in one round and 500 hp will let you live through first round or you are not ma and dying due to dots a lot, then it might be best to max hp.</div></div><hr />

He did spawn for me on Torvo, i figured it was broken, but Heratius Grolden popped on the top flo0r balcony.<br />
<br />
Heratius is a pretty go0d fight, hes harder than the other named in the castle.<br />
<br />
Valdanov .... this guys pretty tough, he happened to spawn on us when I had no crack, healer, slower, buffs, at all!   Ended up scraping it together and killed his ass.  Remember, need vampyre bane weapons.  Someone to DoT him is go0d ... he's got sick regen.</div></div><hr />
