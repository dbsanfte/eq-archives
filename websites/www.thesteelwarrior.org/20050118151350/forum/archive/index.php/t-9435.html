With an Anger III proc thrown in there how will it compare to dual wielding ChoS and SotBS? <br />
<br />
I know the 100 dd procs fairly often but I dont expect that to be much aggro so it would be mostly relying on Anger III + dps. The main person we are worrying about getting aggro is the Shaman. At the moment its not an issue, but in a few levels when we move to WoS aggro on her needs to be somewhat solid for slows, etc.</div></div><hr />

Sure, you and your group can probably make this work. Having a few levels of WA could help with this a little. However, these same aa's would increase the effectiveness of the Droga pair as well. <br />
<br />
Ultimately it won't be as good as Droga combo regardless of what you do to it. Any aug you put in EoE you could put in a CHoS instead. <br />
<br />
My advice is to sell it while they still getting a good price for em.  This is really more of a DPS weap in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

They proc stuns and are agro weapons, while this is much more of a dps weapon.  Add two anger 3 augs to your current DW set up and you will be golden.  If you dont want 2 anger 3 augs then I suggest getting a ykesha aug from sro.  Also, if you can handle it, one grouping Eindride Icestorm in the SW tower of BoT for the Great Blade of Storms would be a good idea.  Same proc as Chos but its 14 18 and better stats.</div></div><hr />

Hrm ok. I already bought the Edge of envelopment :) Paid 40k for it because the DPS on it was hard to turn down for 40k. <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I just need this answer.... can I put Anger III in this and have it work? I know two anger III in the two droga weapons would = unstoppable aggro, but If I can get enough hate from the 2hr, lower riposte, and do more dps it would be worth it for the regular exp group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input guys :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: So the question is not which is better. i know that. The  question is, will this work ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you can make EoE with A3 aug work in WoS.  Your group will be responsible for making it &quot;work&quot;, i.e. controlling agro, doing less than their potential DPS, timing slows and de-buffs appropriately, timing heals appropriately, etc..<br />
<br />
On a side note, I question the logic of increasing your own DPS when you are reducing the amount of damage the rest of the party can do and not take agro. Also, i have not seen ripostes be a problem in WoS (facing a mob to pets is not tearing the pets up there for example). <br />
<br />
Anyway, use what ya want. It just a game :)</div></div><hr />

Heh... the only dps in my group is a rogue... and bard.? and a shaman. As long as the shaman can slow by the first CH hitting, and the rogue can evade, and the shaman can do a few dots afterwards, then that is plenty.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I do appreciate your frankness... I guess I will just try to get 3 augs then. 2 for main weapons and 1 for the 2hr'... I would like to be able to at least try it :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't waste your time getting three anger III augs, just get two and if you're really dying to try it out augment it and then take it out later when you want to.  Sure it will cost a bit for the solvent to replace it to another weapon, but what's a couple thousand PP compared to another 1150 LDoN points to get a third?<br />
<br />
Besides, if you keep one in there even during the times when you're DPS on a raid or the odd time in a group you won't want anger on it.  Just try it out and if you REALLY like the small amount of &quot;added&quot; DPS to the group then take it, that is if people in your group don't mind dumbing down their DPS and precisely timing everything well.</div></div><hr />

Your aim should be to have the most agro you can get.  This sword is a good one, nice stats, ratio etc.  I put a dps aug on mine and and use it when i want dps.  I have another set up for agro.<br />
<br />
While agro management is a grooup effort, and a good group will adjust to the amount agro a tank supports; it just makes things go smoother if you get a lot of it.  (less mob chasing,  dps classes can really open it up and whack mobs good....)<br />
<br />
That said,  if you want to anger aug it, it will probably work fine if you know your group.  I have used this in some group/raid situaions,  with a 150 DD aug, and it does pull agro once in a rare while.  I wold assume that if you put a anger III aug, make first contact, incite, and have taunt ready, you will do fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I prefer 2handers.  I just do.  I did the droga setup and I just couldn't take looking like everyone other warrior.  I know its better, I know its what I should do, but I CAN'T! :)<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the guys I play with know right where the aggro line is when I'm tanking and flirt right at it.</div></div><hr />

Ok thanks. Thats the point I was trying to make. I know that the drogs &gt; eoe, but my group will NOT have to sacrafice dps... i just need to make sure it will keep SOME aggro :). I would be interested for someone to do the math of two unauged droga vs an auged edge of envelopment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is adding in Ykesha to it. You know it won't be as good, but it'll add more DPS and aggro. Call it splitting the difference between your DW setup and DPS setup.</div></div><hr />

Just a random note,<br />
<br />
Pets dont eat ripostes except Enrage.  This was changed at the beginning of PoP because pre 60 pets were getting eaten by ripostes in places like PoV from what I understand.</div></div><hr />
