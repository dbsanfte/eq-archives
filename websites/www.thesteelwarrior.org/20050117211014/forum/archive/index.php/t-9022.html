<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbahansen</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read that a Warrior should be able to easily get to 7500 HP unbuffed even if they are in a non-raiding guild or just casual players.  What items should I be looking for to do this.  My current guild is not progressing and I have been struggling to stay with them, but I would like to equip myself for better content.  If you look at my Magelo you will see alot of no drop good gear, but not even close to 7500 unbuffed HP.  Does anyone have a sample Magelo profile that I could look at that would show me the items I should be looking for?<br />
<br />
Should I just be going out and buying a bunch of 40HP or 10 AC Augs or do I need a complete remodel?<br />
<br />
Hoping to get to a serious guild at some point, but I want to have more to offer.  BTW I have changed my weapons setup to Red Blade and CHoS.<br />

I had some friends with over 7k before GoD that were guildless, either 2boxed with a shaman or bought everything on the character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, you'll gain 500 hp from Sturdiness 5, and almost 150 hp from getting your unbuffed stamina up to 305.<br />
<br />
You'll get probably about 500 more hp if you level from 65-70 and keep your stamina close to cap.<br />
<br />
Your gear is typical Luclin-era gear, but is behind the curve for POP/GOD era. The following suggestions are all purchaseable or single-group obtainable, and none of them are from insane places like Tipt.<br />
<br />
A purchased elemental bow will raise you by about 88 hp.<br />
Purchased steel rings of earthen resistance will raise you by about 40 hp.<br />
Purchased bloodied boots of dark rites will raise you by 70 hp.<br />
Ornate greaves (bought or looted) would raise you by 58 hp.<br />
Ornate bracers would raise you by 46 hp.<br />
Purchased/looted crystallized acid bracers would raise you by a further 128 hp.<br />
Looting Pitted Vambraces from sewer trial would raise you by 70 hp.<br />
Looting several pieces of hard LDON mission loot (ring, cape, mask, neck, earring) would raise you by 163 hp.<br />
Purchased Halas 10 lb Meat Pies would raise you by 46 hp. Tormenter Stir Fry another 12 hp.<br />
<br />
Augments: I'll assume you're not going to grind your way through thousands of LDON points.  If you got two +25 hp augment from Natimbi/Ferubi, three +12 hp augments from normal LDON, and three +40 hp augments with LDON points, you'd gain 241 hp.<br />
<br />
Charm: If you do four of the five POP alternate access quests, and did enough LDONs to gain the above gear, you'll gain about 70 hp.<br />
<br />
Tribute: Increases you by up to 150 hp I believe.<br />
<br />
Together these non-raid upgrades would put you at 8001 hp, without having even bought a piece of LDON armor, and without having upgraded your velious BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IF your guild is doing Ssra, I'm going to assume they could also take out Sula Dar's Shade.  I'd recommend getting that raid together.  With VP access, you can complete 6 relatively simple (duo-able) quests that will net you 120-130hp off-slot items like earring/ring/mask/range/back/neck.  I also think you should camp in Ferubi and get into the mountain trials so you can get your hands on the 125HP shoulders, 110HP greaves, 135HP bracer, and 125HP earring.   All of this gear is obtainable with a single group of mid-to-exceptionally geared casuals.  It will take a lot of camping, but those areas yield pretty nice exp too. <br />
<br />
Sass, I'm not convinced your suggestions would put him at 8001, but, hey, I never was very skilled at math.  I've finished Sturdi 3 and I believe I generally have superior gear to your gear choices (aside from the remaining FH bracer, which I plan to replace with Tipt once if I get lucky with the drop and roll).  The only other things I could do per your suggestions would be Sturdi5, level 70 and purchase Tribute.  This would actually land me above 8k, but, again, I have at least 8 armor slots with superior HP items to those suggested above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's totally doable in the short term.  Aside from the 130hp ring that I have from Time, all of my gear is either purchased, obtained from far-off long-ago raids, or single-groupable/questable.  I am at 7297 and I will gain 200hp more from completing the Sturdi line, 150hp more from Tribute, 45HP more when Doze finally drops the fucking platinum tear, 35HP more when I get lucky on a Tipt roll, 25HP more when I get lucky on a Ferubi drop, 40HP more when I get lucky on a Vxed drop...and a lot more HP if I ever get my LDoN ass in gear (gawd, I hate LDoNs).  Probably, with loot now obtainable in OoW, my dream profile will be shattered with better gear that is easier to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots, and lots, and lots of LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lochr</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Augments: I'll assume you're not going to grind your way through thousands of LDON points.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3 +40 hp augments = 3300 points. 60+ odd LDoNs, just for those alone. Certainly doable, but you're pretty much assuming a lot of grinding.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the + mana and + hit point augments are, by far, the rarest types. And they're the most popular, so you're pretty unlikely to get a round of 5 passes and a &quot;grats, you&quot; like you would on yet another Immaculate Diamond of Chilling Protection. I have around 130 LDoNs, and have two + hit point augments. My cleric, who has a few more LDoNs then that, has two + mana augments. <br />
<br />
I could have been unlucky. But I'm guessing getting three +12 augments isn't a trivial task, timewise.<br />
<br />
Fairly long camp for the +25 hit point augment off the named in Qinimi too. Uncommon spawn, duoable/trioable, so when up doesn't last long given the traffic that goes through Qinimi. Mob only drops one item off a 4 or 5 item loot table too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't confirm that it's all non-raid, but I posted a warrior's magelo that used both LDoN and GoD and got it over 8k.  I'm pretty sure you could get 7500 using it as a template even without the augments.  This is also without counting level 70, using equipment gathered from the &quot;GoD for the non-raiding warrior&quot; thread in the Bunker.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1034967<br />
<br />
If you get into Kod'Taz you can get near 9k also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds about right, Vigdis.  You have several slots which are superior to his, but I count 9 slots in which he has superior gear to yours, and you have only one hit point augment over him.  So you are pretty comparable to him actually, the main difference being that his bad gear is REALLY bad.<br />
<br />
At level 70 with sturdiness 5 and tribute, I'd guesstimate that you'd be around 8100 hp unbuffed, Vigdis - with no augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of very short-term suggestions:<br />
Your greaves: AC: 38<br />
STR: +10  CHA: +5  WIS: +5  INT: +5  <br />
HP: +40  MANA: +40  ENDUR: +40  SV DISEASE: +4  <br />
SV MAGIC: +4  SV POISON: +4<br />
<br />
Tribunal greaves: AC 40, STA 10, HP 80.<br />
<br />
You'd gain 2 AC, 10 STA, 40 direct hps--not as good as the ornate suggested by Sassinak, but much much cheaper and perhaps easier to find.<br />
<br />
Your boots: AC: 28<br />
DEX: +2  STA: +4  HP: +25  ENDUR: +20  <br />
SV FIRE: +1  SV DISEASE: +1  SV COLD: +1  SV MAGIC: +1  <br />
SV POISON: +1<br />
<br />
Tribunal boots: AC 30, DEX 5, STA 5 HP 60<br />
You'd gaid 2 AC, 3 DEX, 1 STA, 35 direct hps<br />
<br />
You might look at your bracers, too. <br />
Tribunal bracer: AC 25, STA 5, FR/DR/CR/MR/PR 5, hp 50. Better AC, STA saves and hps than the Myrmidon bracer; better STA, saves &amp; hps than the warlord's (same ac).<br />
<br />
Note that Sassinak suggested upgrades in these slots that are better than cultural (but more expensive). Kind of depends on whether you feel like you need every bit of a bump you can get in order to tank stuff that drops better gear than cultural, or not (or, in fact, whether you can simply afford to buy ornate molds, but I'm assuming you can't at the moment). If you don't need the short-term bump, don't bother with cultural. But in any case if you're trying to improve your hps, slots with less STA and raw hps than cultural deserve some attention soon, I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN are such a good bang for your buck.  I know we all hate them but they are really a great thing and give A LOT of oppurtunity to the non raiding warrior and even bumps the raiding warrior up even more.<br />
<br />
It appears you have the same access I do to zones (well atleast loot wise).  It appears you are VT capable.  HP upgrades are awesome there.  I am assuming you were in a guild that did VT and you left or it stopped raiding?<br />
<br />
I don't know if you are able to box someone, but there is also a nice little camp in Natimbi that a 20hp aug drops.  It seems to be a really rare thing, but I used to hang out there on down time or when I just wanted quiet time.  That might help you as well.<br />
<br />
Also a few quests you could do for HP's<br />
Spirit wrack cords- 100hp multi slot item.  You also get a 85hp ring with this (Pain in the butt faction, but if you really want the hp's and don't raid it is worth it)<br />
Strength of the elements 100hp shoulder item<br />
Dain ring. (You will need to have a few groups if you are non raiding guild for this, but it is always fun) 100hp ring<br />
You may want to check those out...<br />
<br />
Btw very great ideas there Sass, woulda taken me a huge amount of time to throw that together!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cister Battle</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoever says that you can get 7500 unbuffed hps is not being very realistic.  Sure, you can grind out 100 ldons at @1 hr a piece (30 odd mins to complete, buff and group forming) if you are lucky and the drops come easy.  The Sturdiness 5 is like what 60 aas?  You dont get 60 aas grinding ldons.  You do it in high tier zones that require elemental access or you spend absolutely forever grinding them in zones that are subpar to elemental zones.  The items you speak about buying alone are over 480k on my server.  You dont get 480k farming ToD.  It would be wonderful to loot Doz items except you cant get it for the farmers for their alts.  You say the loot is obtainable from single group but a single group of what?  The people of your group are not normal ldon geared people.  Its all relative to your position.  Im not trying to make this into a have vs have not debate.  I am just stating that its not as easy as you are making it to be.  I understand most people who are non raiders are people that cannot put in the time that some people can.  Its just a matter of priorities.<br />
<br />
Normally I read these discussions and dont say a word.  Its just normally not worth the effort to respond and deal with the response forthcoming.  But in this instance, for someone to say something is obtainable with a sense of ease when anyone who actually FITS the bill is trying to do it and finding it exceptionally difficult, it is offensive.  Its like the filthy rich who inherited the money looking down at the middle class who are busting their ass to make it and improve.  Unless you are in my shoes, dont say how easy it is or how obtainable it is with a hint of superiority because YOU are capable of doing it.  Why dont you step into MY shoes and see if you could do it with such EASE.  Lets see you take a non raiding, non elemental access geared character and group with SIMILAR people and see how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DurpDiggler</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoever says that you can get 7500 unbuffed hps is not being very realistic. <br />
<br />
Actually it is very realistic...but it's not an overnight process.  You can grind the crap out of LDoN's.  Yes it gets old, but it's a neccessity if you want to get easy &quot;raw&quot; hps.  Chances are if you do your &quot;100&quot; LDoN's not only will you have saved a lot of points, but you more than likely would've won possibly a few upgrades from hard LDoNs.  The list by Sassinak is actually a good route to go, if you're willing to invest the pp or the time to obtain the items on the list.  I agree grinding out 60 AAs in LDoN would suck royally...but if you dont have access to elementals or other &quot;higher&quot; xp zones, why not do hard LDoN's, get xp, get points, and get possiple upgrades to your adventurers stone all at the same time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mukaz</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cister, you make it seem like casual or non-raiders can only work on one goal at a time.<br />
<br />
The beauty of being casual or a non-raider is that you can choose zones to hunt that fulfill 2 or 3 of your requirements at once. Is it optimum for a single goal? No, but it allows us to improve several areas at once.<br />
<br />
Raiders are forced to divide their goals by their play style. You can't very well grind AA or lvl exp on a raid. Tradeable items that drop on raids frequently go to feed the guild bank (although removing expensive components on spells might relieve this somewhat).  Raiders have to do these things separately.<br />
<br />
When I needed a haste upgrade I went and camped an item in a zone where I could get AA exp, some cash drops and the haste belt I wanted all at the same time. <br />
<br />
As casuals and non-raiders move into GoD and OoW zones we'll gain access to faster exp than tier 3 PoP, better drops than LDoN purchased gear, new tradeable loot that  is better than what's currently in the bazaar and we don't have to raid to get any of it. <br />
<br />
There are balance issues between casuals, non-raiders and raiders to be sure. But its not all doom and gloom.</div></div><hr />

I got to 7500 unbuffed, but it sure wasnt easy.  I havent been in a guild since early Luclin, and so it goes without saying, I do zero raiding.  <br />
<br />
I didnt mess with the Ldon 40HP augs since hp's arent really my problem, it's AC.  Get the 5 Ldon 10AC augs asap, they dont cost that much.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the suggestions.  I think I am going to stay away from stuff that is only going to be usefull for a short period of time as I hope to get into a raiding guild soon.  I was hoping to app with a little better character and some of these suggestions may be doable for me.  I still need to grind a few AA so I may try that in a new zone that drops something I need as suggested.  I noticed some nice augs are dropping off of low level named in OOW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like something you can expect to acheive over the course of an expansion. Months not weeks.<br />
<br />
edit - I just had a play around on magelo and with old bazaar loot (not OoW stuff) you can make a warrior with v nearly 7500hp (well over 7k).  <br />
Start questing a few things (like Dozekar items), get some GoD one group drops and you are getting close to 8k. Admittedly your AC is still not that great, but your hp are doing well. Admittedly some items are v expensive (BoC, CT bracers) but you can replace those with LDoN and put the time in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't expect to get hooked up by getting in a raiding guild, I want to get gear that I can use in the long run as raid loot is something you have to work for over time.  I have not apped yet because I want to be in better shape when I do so that I have more to offer a raiding guild.  It is kind of like working out before football season so I can make the cut.</div></div><hr />

If you were referring to my posts, I haven't done many LDoNs at all, so that was not what I was suggesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Sturdiness 5 is like what 60 aas? You dont get 60 aas grinding ldons. You do it in high tier zones that require elemental access or you spend absolutely forever grinding them in zones that are subpar to elemental zones. <br />
<br />
It's a ton of AA, that's true.  I was directing my comments to someone who it seemed wasn't a slacker.  Generally, anyone who takes the time out of game to post on this forum is a relatively serious player and someone who is asking for gear upgrades is theoretically quite serious about upgrading his character.  In which case Sturdiness is a no-brainer. <br />
<br />
I don't grind in elemental zones, ever.  I grind in ChardokB (no shit, but I needed a bunch of faction), Ferubi, and now instanced zones of Dralnik's Scar.  Sure, it takes me longer, but I'm multi-tasking because I can get other loot or quest items in those zones too. <br />
<br />
It would be wonderful to loot Doz items except you cant get it for the farmers for their alts.<br />
<br />
This is no longer true.  I believe Povar to be one of the most heavily-populated &quot;farm&quot; servers out there.  For the last two days, there haven't been more than 10 people in BOT at any given time (there were NO people in BOT the night before last).  I found Zlandicar up after checking on a whim; and I've taken down Doze with my friends the last four times he's been up.  I totally understand how frustrating it was when farmers took everything - and that was only a couple months ago - but I honestly believe you are living in the past.  The farmers have found a new farm spot, and it isn't in expansions 4 years old. <br />
<br />
<br />
 You say the loot is obtainable from single group but a single group of what? The people of your group are not normal ldon geared people. <br />
<br />
Don't assume you know who I hunt with.  These are the people in my typical Vxed/Tipt group:<br />
<br />
Bard (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=485847)<br />
<br />
Cleric (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=679422)<br />
<br />
Ranger (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3164)<br />
<br />
Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=773942)<br />
<br />
The only seriously geared amongst us is my enchanter, and we do just fine. <br />
<br />
I was furious, too, when &quot;ubers&quot; told me that 8k was possible, because they simply don't understand that 8k might take me a year to achieve and in that same span of time a newly guilded applicant to their guild will probably get 10k unbuffed after starting BELOW my present HP.  But such is life.  We'll put in more time, but it is possible and viewing my suggestions with a defeatist attitude, or worse, as if I am in some way insulting you, is not helping anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When a person applies to a guild, they get brought up to within 10% of the guild's average equipment level in a very short time.  The reason is obvious: guilds get a lot of gear that they don't really need, so people with less get upgraded faster.  It's bad to compare yourself with that.  The guild applicant gains gear faster than anyone, even faster than the most hardcore members of that same guild.</div></div><hr />

Hoping to get to a serious guild at some point, but I want to have more to offer. <br />
<br />
Depending on the level of guild you are talking about, chances are pretty good that you will be wasting your time trying to gear up. Your time will be better spent powering levels and AAs in the short term. A raiding guild is going to be a lot more interested in a 70 warrior with all the right AAs than one who has bettwe gear but less AAs/levels. In your poisition I would recommend grinding in places were you are likely to get an upgrade. That way, you may still end up with some gear, but more importantly you get your experience out of the way. You will pick up more AC/HP in a month of rot loot from a serious raid guild than you could get from a year of farming and bazaaring.<br />
<br />
If you really want in to a raid guild, work on what's important - AAs, levels, and warrior skills. A tank with 1800ac and 8500hp is useless without the rest of the package.  A good guild can get you gear, but they can't get you AAs, levels, and skill.</div></div><hr />

You know I think you are right.  I shouldn't be worried about the fact that I don't have the best available gear for a non-raider and worry more about finishing the AA's and now the new levels.  That is what is most likely to make me the more attractive candidate for a raiding guild.  I was worried about not being able to live through the KT access prereq that seems to be the new standard.<br />
<br />
My brother leveled his SK up and got 125 AA in a year and now 3 months later he is almost through Uqua and has insane gear with a couple of pieces of cultural that I made for him.  The stuff I see rot makes me ill.  I will try to AA first and then Level during my app process. An SK with just under 10K HP unbuffed and 2500 AC in less then 16 months makes me very ill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very true ... I have been in the same family-style raiding guild for the past 15 months ... we've gone through HoT, WToV, Ntov, AoW, Ssra, and are now hitting VT ... you know, &quot;old school&quot; content.  Most of our regular members are essentially  maxed out on current gear ... new folks that come along generally get to grab big upgrades for relatively cheap prices.<br />
<br />
I know that for myself I am basically waiting for the boss mobs to drop a certain piece of loot, e.g Bloodfrenzy, rings, etc.  It's not uncommon for me to go a couple of months in between upgrades.  Being a family-style guild means we don't raid as hard aw we could, but everone generally likes and respects each other.<br />
<br />
I know that a lot of people put emphasis on being uber, but what are the consequences?  We recently did an Emp raid in which several members of our servers main uber-guild attended just so they could loot the rifts ... these folks had never been to Vex Thal.  Why grind your way to being uber when you miss all the content?  Someone joining either one of our 2 top guilds today will probably never see VT or Time with their guild, because their guild has moved past that content.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to this ... decide what you want and then do it.<br />
<br />
Edit:  something else I've noticed ... as soon as we killed Emp we got covered up with new applications.  Gee, I wonder why ...</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming insane pp availability, and insane endurance to LDON grinding.<br />

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1113290<br />
<br />
Add in 150 tribute for hp, which gives 175, and 41% tribute haste, 50 tribute attack, 50ac, and it nicely rounds him up :)<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, I'm not sure I'd have enough of my current 2.5 millions pp bankroll to equip such a twink....<br />

<br />
<br />
You couldn't do that twink for 2.5 million?<br />
<br />
You're getting ripped the fuck off on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with those that suggested concentrating on levels (first) and AAs (second) over gear (third), though there's a few suggestions in case you can work them out easily enough.<br />
<br />
From the looks of it, most of your gear isn't really in need of severe changes, save the following slots:<br />
<br />
Right and Left Wrists<br />
Arms<br />
Range<br />
Feet<br />
Secondary Melee (possibly, see below)<br />
<br />
My suggestions are the following, depending on the time you want to spend on them and your available funds versus camping abilities:<br />
<br />
Wrist 1: Crystallized Acid Bracer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27851)<br />
* Unlike previous suggestions, I completely suggest you loot this one yourself.  CT is very, very rarely populated nowadays - so little that I often find named mobs up and the zone empty.  The mob(s) for this are quite easy too even for a non-raider, as long as you have a group and a half or so of friends who are willing to come help out.  See this (http://www.scienceofwar.net/strats/acidicmass/) link for details of encounter.<br />
<br />
Wrist 2: Farwater Plate Bracer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31297)<br />
* There's a few options, depending if you have cash to burn (above), time to burn with a group (Royal Attendant Bracer of Sand (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44303), or time to burn solo (Spirit Wracked Cord (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5723)).<br />
<br />
Range: Featherwood Compound Bow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29598)<br />
* Not likely campable by yourself, but at least on my server, these have come way down in price and are nearly a steal compared to the Stonewood Bows of the same variety (since Featherwood lacks the attack/regen effect).  If you can overlook that, you can probably grab one of these for a nice pulling item and 100 hp range item for around 10k plat.<br />
<br />
Secondary Melee: Velium Gemmed Long Sword (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=58898)<br />
* For some reason, no one ever seems to mention these, and for the life of me I can't figure out why.  The ratio is extremely good compared to similar non-raid/single-group weapons, they aren't lore, they have TWO aug slots, and the stats are fairly decent as well.  The last selling point is, again on my server at least, they sell for 5 - 6k plat; a steal if you ask me.  You might consider one for your offhand (or mainhand if/when you get an Anger 3 aug).<br />
<br />
Feet: Boots of the Vindicator (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25043)<br />
* If you can't sport the force for Vindi (which I can completely understand), Helanic Tundra Boots (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=23683)<br />
<br />
Arms: Helanic Tundra Vambraces (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=23688)<br />
* The bang for your buck is well worth this upgrade in my opinion (oh how I loathe my own Agnostic ass...)<br />
<br />
-Bashiae-<br />
<br />
Edit: I just noticed in your Magelo you have a 90 hp ranged item bagged, obviously your bow is used for pulling and not tanking, so ignore my Range item suggestion &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I chose not to go for any LDoN items other than the BP though, so everything was bought in the bazaar. With some smart shopping and patients I managed to get completely geared up, for a lot less than you expect. The trick is to make your plats work for you while you wait for the harder to find items. If you spend some time in the bazaar every day and watch prices on items for your class, you will get a pretty good feel for what is and isn't a good deal. I would usually buy up warrior gear Monday-Thursday and resell it on the weekend when prices would shoot up on my server. Often, I would buy something I wanted, then sell it on the weekend because I knew that I could get a replacement during the week at a discounted price. Before you know it, you end up with a pretty substantial profit. With an initial starting bank of around $175k I managed to get all of those items, as well as 2x Crystallized acid bracers, velium encrusted gaunts, boots of the storm, ornate arms, and ornate legs. I am still wearing quite a few of those items still.</div></div><hr />

I still lack the last 2 levels of GoD sturdiness as well.  With tribute i'm low 7900s.   All of my gear is doable by a non-raider other than maybe my dain ring (ring war requires a small raid) and arguably my seru shoulders (though i myself have participated in a single group killing of seru, he is still considered by most to be a &quot;raid target&quot;).  And even then, there are buyable and groupable rings with 100ish hp on them and quest str of elements with 100hps on them for shoulder slot.<br />
<br />
Everything else of mine is either buyable or comes from one groupable encounters (trials and hard ldon mostly).  with tribute and last 2 levels of sturdiness i'll have 8100 hps unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Look at my magelo ... it is shocking to see how little &quot;raid quality&quot; gear i have, and how most of this &quot;raid quality&quot; gear is easily matched if not bettered by various 1-groupable encounters.<br />
<br />
And no i dont consider vallon zek a &quot;raid target&quot; either as i've 1grouped him a grand total of 11 times now.  You could techinally add his necklace and belt to my magelo as well  ;)  .</div></div><hr />

Well that's pretty much up to the debuffers.  If they don't mind taking a few hits from every mob then by all means let em fly immediately.  If you don't want to get hit then chill for 3 seconds so I can get a proc and then you can do whatever you want to it without getting hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all my magelo is screwed up. Here are the inconsistancies:<br />
<br />
I only have 40hp augs on my bp and legs ... so the helm, boots and arms augs are not yet in place yet, though i will buy them soon.  I also do not have sturdiness 4 and 5 like my magelo says i do.  Now you might say, why did you add it in when you dont have it?  first of all my magelo has always shown me at about 200hp than i really have (not sure why), and second of all, i wanted to see about how much i could have with a bit of work once upon a time and have been too lazy to update it.<br />
<br />
  That said, my actual unbuffed hps were at 7050 w/out tribute and 7250 with tribute at 65.  Without changing any of my gear i jumped up to 7550 unbuffed w/out stamina maxxed and 7750 with stamina maxed (from buff).  Add in the 200hp from tribute and i have exactly 7926hps with no buff other than stamina (which simply raises me to the 330 cap and i click on myself).  Add in he 3 40hp augs i will have soon and the 200hp from Sturd4 and 5 and i'll have roughly 8200-8300.<br />
<br />
I got exactly 260hp from the last level up ... ~91 hps per level from hitting 67, 68, 69, and something like 70hps from dinging 66.  All in all i got roughly 600-650hps from just leveling up after OoW.<br />
<br />
hitting 7500 or even 8k without any serious raid gear is far from impossible these days if you're willing to put in all the time to get it.</div></div><hr />

Dude, I don't need you to preach at me.  I already know that.  I said it in this very thread and it should be clear as shit that I'm willing to put in the time to get it as I've apparently passed your semi-raiding magelo by 200HP.   I just wanted some confirmation about overall HP to level 70 without all the steam you usually blow on the flame threads.</div></div><hr />

I was the fully casual, non-raiding, family casual (can barely hold enough active members to stay together) guild player for a while. Then I went into the hardcore player but still in a smaller sometimes raiding had big dreams guild. Now I sit in between casual at times (I need to not play now and then) and hardcore play nonstop (Soanso tells you, 'OMG Tyn are you ever gonna log off?') and a guild that is trying to pull it together to raid alot more and see ELE/GoD more. Takes time though and we're working on it.<br />
<br />
But on the subject. If you told me just 6 months ago... (heck see my old post when I was lvl 65 with only 4500 hp and 1200 ac) that I'd even get to 5600 hp nonraiding for the most part (got a sword from a pickup flagraid thing and a few flags..but that was like 2 weeks of raiding then back to none), I wouldn't have believed it. But I have and I'm pretty proud of it... even though I got alot of work to go, but with the right buffs I can just hit shy of 8k now... (magelo is partially out of date)<br />
<br />
I am lacking in the AA dept still quite a bit, which has become a focus for me, but I was just adding up some gear changes last night in the bazaar along with getting the AA's I need done... and I actually could hit 7500 really easy.<br />
<br />
ah all i'm really saying is that it can be done with time and a little patience... sheesh now I'm preaching... damnit Tyn.. why do you always ramble when you intend to make a little point...<br />

I agree wholeheartedly with that statement, having minimal raid loot and the rest of my gear being self obtained with minimal help. I think im doin just fine at 6200 hits, and i dont mind grinding ldon.<br />

whats the problem with them anyway? everyone bitches but its at least *some* experience (decent even, on hard) always open, and offers much more than just armor upgrades. yeah it may take a while, but it *IS* a viable upgrade path. as CB said, its all about your position in the game, and im pretty sure he wouldnt have asked for gear advice if he was in a big raiding guild :p<br />
