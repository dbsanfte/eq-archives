<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This game has finally stopped being fun.<br />
<br />
Some of you will rejoice, some of you may be sad, most of you won't care.<br />
<br />
I suppose the only thing that kept me playing as long as I had were the other people. Friends, guildies, random people that I met day to day doing the grind. The low lives driving you to madness, the good guys doing great things to help you when you were down. <br />
<br />
Strangely, before it became a seemingly endless grind, exp grouping was once my favorite part of the game. Going around doing new things while talking to new people is perhaps the most fun I have ever had from a game. Mobs could be interesting the first few times you saw them, but after a while they grow stale. People; on the other hand change even when they do not want to.<br />
<br />
Goodbye, to all the people I met along the way. Those that would call me friend, those that would call me foe, and those who would call me &quot;that crazy ass tank with the axe and huge lance!&quot; This last drink of mine goes to one such person whom I will never have the chance to see, the very first of many people I met while in Norrath.<br />
<br />
Here is hoping that you all have fun with whatever you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't stop lurking :) might be worth doing what I'm doing, just logging on when you feel like it, no stress and no hassles, hit the /who all friend button, see if anyone has space and if not just chat or log, I'm lucky in that before the grind got too much i got some pretty damn good kit (and a great bunch of friends), if you're not ahead of the curve then the game can really suck I must admit....<br />
<br />
/salute <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry to see ya go Varaho, though, you could join the ranks of those who have retired but still check the boards :D <br />
<br />
Anyway, if the game is no longer fun, definately the best thing to do is leave.  We'll all be here if you decide to come back though. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hopefully (like everyone else has said) you stick around here and from time to time pop into the game.  I was at the same point for quite a bit where everything but the people just got old.  Now i'm just as hooked as ever before.  Take care and good luck to you in the real world :)<br />

<br />
I thought I would never play again, but I am now playing with more excitement than I did in all of 2002.  The game changes, you change, and boom -- you are hooked again.  At least I was.<br />
