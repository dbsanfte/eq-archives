<br />
Besides the obvius earring (upgrade waiting on raid), which slots would you upgrade and in what order?  I am primarily a dps tank for raids and most groups I am in.  Also, I do not have a large budget.  I can occasionly raise 10 - 20k or so.  Also, I am considering selling the soulscream belt and using tribute haste and another belt.<br />

<br />
Get rid of the obsidian bead hoop!  Camp/buy another mosquito leg earring or make a solstice earring!<br />
You could do some north ro LDoNs to pick up a new necklace, amulet of mummy wrappings, also, it should not be too expensive in the bazaar if you don't enjoy doing LDoNs.  This will net you a couple more ac and more hp.<br />
Consider a dwarven cultural bracer to replace your PoG bracer.  Shouldn't break the bank.  I'd also consider the cultural breastplate.  Or, if you do LDoNs alot, getting the bp from the EF or Nro camps.  <br />
<br />
I'd look into camping a haste belt from veksar or droga (both are 31%), this would fix your no haste problem nicely.  Both are easily duoable with just a priest partner, if you know how to make your way to the camp safely.  Another easy camp with 2 or 3 people would be the grand pauldron of study in plane of Mischief.<br />
<br />
There ya be, each suggestion easily under 20k, if your server's prices are anything like Torv's (i.e. running stupidly high).</div></div><hr />

Also, dwarven cultural stinks (51ac 6wis 30hps, mana, end for bp).  I am better off with the one I have than that... same is true for the bracer.<br />
<br />
Anyone else with an opinion?<br />
<br />
Edit:  I should also mention that prices on Povar are probably in the top 3 cheapest of all servers.</div></div><hr />

I got my shoulders for 17k.  Not bad imho.  Also, my back slot was 20ish k I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the shoulders, they have an overinflated price on povar right now, i.e. 35kish was the last one I saw and it sold quick.<br />
<br />
I have seen the shroud of the fallen defender as low as 5k on povar, although its holding steady at 10k this weekend.  However, since I already have a conquerers cape, I don't think its worth me spending that much plat for the shroud, espicially since I have a limited budget and so many other slots that need help.<br />
<br />
Currently on my shopping list if I can find it for the right price is:<br />
ornate helm<br />
ornate bracer<br />
Articulated Battle Gordget<br />
Stonewood Compound Bow<br />
Heavy Rubicite Belt<br />
<br />
And then an unknown belt and unknow chest piece... to be determined when I see a good deal.<br />

<br />
No.  Your current BP has 36AC and dwarven cultural has 51AC.  If you factor in the stamina from your current BP and calculate the AC difference, you are still ahead on the dwarven cultural. <br />
<br />
You mention doing raids.  We'll I'd recommend doing a raid on Einride and getting Kizracks, which would kick the crap out of both of those BPs.   Alternatively, take a group of friends and kill Vindi. <br />
<br />
Get horned spiked shoulderpads, or do the quest-ish out in WW. <br />
<br />
Ton of other upgrades, but you should be able to search Ally's and find the doable stuff, especially with OoW out now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said, &quot; do the quest-ish out in WW.&quot;<br />
<br />
Could you clarify?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;quest-ish out in WW&quot; is Strength of the Elements.  I'm at work, so I can't access Allakhazam to link it.  Do an item lookup for them and you can get at the quest info that way.<br />
<br />
I can't look at your magelo (did I mention that I'm at work?), but if an Amulet of Mummy Wrappings is an upgrade, then Serpentine Necklace would be an even better upgrade.  Don't know what prices are like on Povar, but I picked mine up on Torvonnilous for about 8k.  Definitely worth it.<br />
<br />
If you don't insist on a bow for the ranged slot, look into the Marsinger's Gem quest.  This is infinitely easier if you have a wizard to port you in and out of the Plane of Hate.  Awesome, awesome range slot item, even if it isn't a bow.<br />
<br />
If you have are, or have a friend who is, a GM jewelcrafter, I suggest running around Dranik's Scar and try and find you some mudflow stones (+4 STA augs).  They drop all over the place (from what I understand), and a GM jewelcrafter can turn them into radiant cut mudflow stones (+12 STA) that you can either keep or sell for more upgrades.  I don't recall if they're lore or not though.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you're better off than I am, but best of luck with your upgrades. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Did you read my message at all before replying. Almost without exception, everything you suggested is explained in my orignal message.<br />

<br />
Anyone else with an opinion?&quot;<br />
<br />
My first suggestion would be to stop dissing people who suggest upgrades for you.<br />
A 51 AC BP may &quot;stink&quot; but it is better than than the 36 AC BP magelo says you're wearing. Cultural BPs are not the strongest cultural slot, but when you can find them they are fast, easy and cheap to get. the 15 AC bump you get will be worth the marginal loss of total hitpoints the first time you're off-tanking something and it takes a swing at you.<br />
You mention selling a soulscream belt, but there's none in your Magelo and in fact I gather that if you had one you sold it and you're using tribute haste, since I saw no other haste on you before I got too irritated to keep looking. Depending on your raid schedule/loot that might be affordable for you, but it is an unusual choice for someone with a 2AC/3AGI earring and a sub-cultural bracer. And no, you are not better off with the 19 AC 15 hp 2-resists 15 END bladesman's bracer than you would be with the underfoot bracer at:<br />
AC: 25<br />
WIS: +5 **HP: +30 **MANA: +30 **Endurance: +30 **<br />
SV FIRE: +5 **SV DISEASE: +5 **SV COLD: +5 **SV MAGIC: +5 **<br />
SV POISON: +5 **<br />
Recommended level of 45<br />
WT: 3.0 **Size: LARGE<br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL <br />
Race: HEF DWF HFL GNM <br />
Deity: Brell Serilis <br />
<br />
If you get an ornate bracer, that's great, but the Underfoot is better than what you have now on the magelo. <br />
Kiya's right to pick up on the earring, too, as it's about your weakest item. I'll take your word on the idea that a raid drop upgrade is going to happen, but why wait even an hour? Buy something droppable and re-sell it if you get better. Maybe the tribute haste is doable for you, but i'd be surprised if you weren't better off looting a soulscream or a spiked seahorse yourself and using the items you're tributing to buy visible armor upgrades.<br />
Given that your primary role for some time in raids is dps/offtank, get a dd aug for your dps weapon. LDoN icicle strike or some such. then get a Yeksha or Anger III aug for your GSoT incase you have to MT outside of raids or hold aggro while steamroll tanking on raids.</div></div><hr />

I honestly can't remember what I paid for the Shroud...thought it was 20ish, might not have been.  I just upgraded the boots you have to Boots of the Storm for 21k.  Not a monumental upgrade...but an upgrade none the less.</div></div><hr />
