All/all equipment and plate classes sharing gear is a disadvantage to pure melee.  If a warrior and a knight are both getting the exact same gear but there is mana and wis/int stats on it then a knight will benefit from it more.  If anyone is still skeptical about this don't my word for it, <br />
go read this:<br />

I am by no means participating in the high end content of the game but one of FoH's top warriors voicing concerns about the same issues every warrior on this board has been posting about I'd say there's merit to these arguements.  Also, Mofu wasn't making the example to talk about that one piece of gear, he is making the point that itemization as it stands puts warriors at an disadvantage.  <br />
<br />
The best solution I've read on these boards to solve problems with itemization are to make all/all equip or plate class shared equip have different stats depending on the class wearing them.  So when a pure melee has the same bp as a knight they will have stats on that gear to benefit there abilities and vise versa.  <br />

As for you Brik, about 20 percent of the stuff you write I can at least see where your coming from and is constructive as points for debate.  The other 80 percent though is absolute, narrow minded garbage littered with mightier-than-thou BS that makes me roll my eyes and reach for the Rolaid.  God-forbid (or at least the board admins) you and Goodwind ever end up landing in the same topic on SW, the flamefest would leave case against aggro lock in the dust.     <br />
