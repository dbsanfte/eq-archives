<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>werdara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whats an Earthshaker worth these days? I have one cluttering my bags atm, on Tunare, and I'm considering selling it.  Due to the age of Tunare and ease of plat there, I initially tried 500k but only 1 person showed any real interest, he just didn't have it right now.  Of course I got the normal &quot;??!!&quot; from newbies in PoK, but we know we can disregard that  :p <br />
<br />
I've had my fun with it, and I know an Ornate BP and Legs would do me far more good, but I'd like to have enough left over for something else &quot;fun&quot; to replace it.<br />
<br />
Should I hold out at 500k or drop it to around 350k?<br />
<br />
(Ornate BP and legs will cost me at least 300k together)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An Earthshaker is worth what people will pay for it. Mine originally cost me 5k. I overpaid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">anyone who would pay 500k for a situational toy isn't right in the head or took advantage of the many plat duping bugs that were out.<br />
<br />
Earthshaker should be no more than 150k if that, and yes I know you can't get them anymore. It is a crap weapon and usefull on very few fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Over the last 6 months the average market value on my server has been 100-200k.  Your mileage may vary though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bout the same on Fennin Ro mostly, 100-200k, but they are rarely available for sale.<br />
<br />
I got mine for under 200pp, long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Havent seen an earthshaker for sale on tunare since the prices shot up and they all sold. Didn't think those would have any kind of trouble selling at any price from the way they went.<br />
<br />
I wanted one myself (mainly for RP) long before the AE madness that took over everybody, but when I finally had a couple of thousand to spend on one the prices skyrocketed to unreachable (for me) levels.</div></div><hr />

Damn, I need a new keyboard after i just spit my beer from laughing so hard.  But a shaker is not worth 500k ever.  It is only a toy.  If you happen to find someone who buys plat from yantis everyday and dumps if off to you, then consider yourself lucky.  Hell, I paid 2k for mine like the week after it stopped dropping.  Then the week later it was 150k+.<br />
<br />
I think it is one of the most screwed up weapons because it is only a &quot;toy.&quot;  It has no real use and is very dangerous to go around trying it out.  But I would never sell mine not because of the function, but more so I can say I have something not may others do.  But to your question, just raid BoT towers and get BP yourself, legs will come in due time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I paid 200K for one and its out for 555K, no takers. But I previoulsy sold one for 444K.<br />
<br />
last night I got my 3rd for 250K, gonna trade for AoN. AoN are very high on SZ cause of some targeting bug...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">AoN are very high on SZ cause of some targeting bug... <br />
<br />
Heh, sounds just like the PvP servers.  AoN's have always had high value on PvP servers due to the difficulty of targetting skeleton models, but I imagine with how screwed up targetting is right now that it has gotten even worse.  Sucks that people on PvP servers flock to exploit any exploit they can as soon as it becomes known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey Werdara I'll buy that from you look me up in game :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">People have always paid a lot for the kinkier items, especially when nerfed.  It makes a nice collection piece, although...doesn't the something something tulwar from PoWater have the same kind of effect?</div></div><hr />

Most beautiful log clip ever!<br />
<br />
While the coral hilted tuwar has a similiar effect, the much lower delay means it's less effective at stacking death and doomnation on one swing of the rampage button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">only hybrids can use the water one plus its not as well suited, less dmg, and faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I guess the ES prices started soaring after &quot;that post&quot; about warrior AE, I think that was a month or so after the thing was removed from the revamed Hole. I picked mine up for 2k the day we did the AE group, and the next month it was selling for hundreds of K in the bazaar, on my server... It's not worth it. You could just ask your close warriors friends, if you have any, to borrow theirs for when you want to toy around with it.<br />
<br />
As for the original poster's question, I think it would be very unwise to sell your own ES, even for 500k. One, you will be losing a cool toy, two, you will want to rebuy it later, and three, you keep the price on ES high and that's not a very nice thing to do to your fellow warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After knowing the benefits of this toy, and even a few tricks if ya search this board a lil, i can't understand why anyone would want to get rid of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In the effort to acquire better equipment, I sold my Earthshaker, which I originally bought for 300pp.<br />
<br />
I sold mine for 350k.<br />
And I promptly bought a Helm of RZ with the cash. I haven't looked back - I don't even have Rampage yet, and probably won't get it before I leave EQ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bah! I bought mine for 200K on Karana.<br />
I would have paid 500K though.<br />
<br />
You dont have to exploit the game to get that kinda money.<br />
There comes a time when the only thing plat is good for is tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LastLizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm.. a Ferrari is only a toy, too. Have you ever tried to tell your local Ferrari dealer how much that car would be worth to you? ;P<br />
<br />
Still trying to get a decent offer for mine though - knowing that i'll probably never be able to replace it, it'd better be an offer i can't resist :D<br />
<br />
l33t toyz: priceless</div></div><hr />
