<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharse</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all ,thanks for the quick responses to my other questions.<br />
Anyway now lvl 24 (ooooh,ahhh). Going to hit 25 next (unless I figure out how not to) and get riposte.<br />
This seems to be the last skill I get(friend told me disarm is worthless if you don't duel?)<br />
<br />
So..<br />
1)Are the practice points used for anything else or can I jusr use them to raise skills I already have?<br />
<br />
2)Also-assuming I can find enough people in my level range- are LDoN the way to go until 50 or so? Or should I level up in Marus Saru etc until 50, then do LDoN?<br />
<br />
3)For those of you who have done them is there any real difference in which you choose to do? (I've done a search for LDoN on a couple of boards,but seems to generate alot of hits)<br />
<br />
<br />
4) I've discovered (or made the mistake of) that I seem to do better when grouped if I ask the Cleric to keep me at about 30-35% health. Obviously I can't keep this up forever but with a good cleric can I continue this into my 30's? Or is this a really bad idea?<br />
<br />
5)I was looking at AllaKhazam's at all the disciplines, I understand most of them aren't in yet (at least until you hit 50 or so) But anyone know if the're planning on putting them in or are they no longer being considered?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use them to raise tradeskills if you ever want to do them, or weapon skills if you have any lagging. I spent about 60 points (more?) on 2hb when I got my ToD. There doesn't seem to be any purpose in saving them, so just use them where you need 'em.<br />

<br />
  Haha, I actually do this on LDoN normals alot. It's risky at times, of course, but if they can prevent you from dying and not run oom, there's no real reason for them not to. It keeps them on their toes too.<br />

I'm assuming you mean the openings. They canned those. We may see them pop up in some other form later, but there's no info yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is LDoN the way to go?  <br />
<br />
LDoN is great if you only have an hour or two to play before you need to log.  It is also great if you have a longer chunk of time to play, and you get a group that wants to run through several missions in a row.  Your xp / hour takes the biggest hit when you spend a great deal of time setting up a group, then run a quick &quot;normal&quot; setting LDoN, then have  a group member or two drop out and need to look for replacements.  At your level, you won't get many adventure points per win, but you will get a few that start to add up, and you will get some dungeon practice.  If you just want to get some good quality xp, and you can convince a group, I suggest heading off to SolA  and Guk (the old Guk, not the LDoN Guk).  You can get in a great groove playing in those zones, and most of the camps are open these days.   <br />
<br />
I do NOT reccomend Marus Seru, Lake of Ill Omen, or The Overthere.  Experience in outdoor zones lags far behind that of dungeons, the loot is terrible, and you don't nearly test your skills the same way that you do in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Which LDoN should you do?<br />
<br />
Please check out this LDoN Merchant Sorting Script:  http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi<br />
<br />
With this script, you can figure out which zones have the goodies you want, and start concentrating your missions there.  Mistmoore (MMC) has a decent set of lower-mid level armor for 150 points.   At level 25, you will be getting very few points per mission, but they will eventually add up, and you will be getting experience, coinage, and the possibility of random augments during the adventures.  Most people seem to prefer Mistmoore, Takhish (the North Ro camp), and Rujark (the East Commons camp).  Guk (South Ro camp) is the hardest to pull, due to twisty passages of uneven heights, and mobs that camoflage into the background.  If you do Guk, some sort of crowd control is extremely important.<br />
<br />
Is the disarm skill of negligible importance?<br />
<br />
Disarm only works if the mob you are facing is carrying a weapon (duh), and if that weapon is non-magical.  It has a very short range (like taunt).  That being said, it's main value, to me as a 65 warrior,  is that it has a small (very small, but I will take what I can get) aggro component.  At lower levels, your skill will be terrible.  Also, you can only gain skill when you are using it against mobs that have weapons.  So, you might as well toss some of your unused training points at it if you have nothing better at which to toss them.  If you are able to get a group in Sol A (Sol B once you've gained a few more levels), or Upper Guk (Lower Guk once you've gained a few levels), you will be able to disarm those fine steel weapons from the goblins and frogs.  Make sure to check the floor, and pick up the disarmed weapons that are laying about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that was the way i did it, i went from like level 20ish to 51+ in pretty much just LDoNs.  the exp is good, iirc close to half a level per adv.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Personally, I mashed disarm for years, just for a button to push and becuase it's funny when you actually manage to take a weapon, but your friend is right that it is mostly useless outside of duels.<br />
<br />
LDoN will be great exp, loot, and cash for you, and will teach you everything you need to know about warrioring, much more so than single-pull outdoor zones like LOIO or MS.  That said, if this is your first character, I would highly reccomend checking out places like guk, Sola/b, Crystal Caverns, Karnor's, Sebilis, Droga, and Chardok as you level up for a change of pace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...that could explain things.  I was going to recommend not doing LDoN because my baby wiz only got about 18% at lvl 30 on an ldon, but we were on normal level.  Guess I'll try again on hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soon (I'm pretty sure this happens at lvl 30, but don't quote me) you get the ability to /shield &lt;player's named&gt;. A very handy ability if used correctly. It's not a disc; you hotkey it and, when mob beats on your healer/slower/fingerwaggler you run up very close to that player and /shield them until you can taunt mob off. The other player will take 50% of the melee damage they would have taken while /shield lasts. You will take 75% of the damage (yes--that adds up to 125% damage; that's the cost of using it). /shield has three advantages:<br />
1. Caster survives longer.<br />
2. /shield has a taunt factor; disarm, as Brutal and your friend point out, does not.<br />
3. /shield convinces your casters that you're doing everything you can to save them. They are oddly attracted to that notion.<br />
<br />
(Another thing you can do with /shield is to use it immediately on any non-tank melee who won't stop ganking your aggro. Not only does it offer the real possibility that the mob will turn back to you, but it sends the player a message about what you think about their tanking ability, mwuhahahahahaha.)<br />
<br />
Disarm is for amusement purposes only in non-pvp settings. Some mobs in fact attack faster once you've disarmed them. If you walk up to a non-aggroing mob and the first thing you do is hit disarm, you will find that it puts you on that mob's hate list; but beyond that it does nothing for your agro. Since attacking the same mob in any way also puts you on the hate list, disarm effectively does nothing. The only time I've used it for any purpose other than fun is on rare occasions when I've been in a group with an idiot groupmember who is speed looting everything in sight. Disarm the mob and at least you'll pick up the weapon, heh.<br />
<br />
Gruda's advice is detailed and excellent. I might offer an alternative view about M. Seru and OT, however. Two things are behind Gruda's comments--first, the rate of experience is faster in indoor/LDoN zones. Second, at higher levels, more and more of your fighting will take place in dungeons or dungeon-like zones. You can level to 50 without ever going into a dungeon, but if you do you'll find yourself at a disadvantage after that (not in terms of your character's abilities, but in terms of what you know how to do as a player). <br />
But having said that, I still think that you should spend some time in M. Seru and OT and possibly the Dreadlands after that. It's not simply the case that wide-open outdoor zones require fewer skills than dungeons. In fact, they require some different player skills. If from 24-50 you do nothing but LDoNs, most of your primary tanking skills will be highly developed, you'll level fast, you'll get decent loot, and you'll be in a position to start using your adventure points to get far better gear than you could loot or earn in places like OT. However, you'll know much less about mob pathing, fighting on uneven terrain, using a bow, and pulling in general. Also, at least in your 20s in LDoNs, once you clear a room, you don't have to worry about mobs re-popping. In non instanced zones you do have to worry about that, so if you only do LDoNs in your 20s, you'll get no practice at sort of having a running timer in your head that tells you that a mob is about to re-pop right on top of your cleric.<br />
You also don't want to be one of those Lvl 52 characters sitting in PoK for an hour and a half begging for a wizard port to Lavastorm because you can't imagine how anyone could possibly run from the PoK book in Nek Forest to the outside of Naggy's Lair. Being comfortable running through outdoor zones that have dark blue mobs is a player skill that can be very handy for a warrior. You should be able to do this and choose whether or not you get aggro. With SoW (and at an appropriate level), you should be able to run across a third of an outdoor zone like OT or DL, aggro a specific mob, and drag that mob back to where you started without getting any adds and without the mob ever hitting you. If you can do that, you understand bow pulling, mob pathing, and aggro radius in outdoor zones.<br />
Anyway, concentrate on LDoNs, for sure. But every once in a while, go to the other zones, too. Mix it up.<br />
Finally--and this may be completely random, and is certainly anecdotal--in leveling a couple of alts through their 20s recently, I noticed a surprising, but very strong pattern. I fought in Neth. Lair, M. Seru, and LDoNs (hard collections in the Butcher Block/MM LDoN). The pattern was this: the *average* player I met in Neth. Lair was much better than the average player sitting around the LDoN camps (at this level).  Maybe that was random rather than a pattern (I've only tried it with two characters, and my sample set is small) -- and, of course, that's not to say that no good players are at the LDoN camps (most players are there, in fact, so most good players are there). But I can tell you that if I had an early 20s character who was interested in grouping outside my guild, I'd head for Neth Lair and M Seru at least a couple of times.<br />
<br />
Finally, something else about experience that most people don't discuss much. The ZEM of a zone is only one factor determining your actual rate of experience. Two other factors are much more important: can you get a group fast? and how much time will be consumed waiting for you or other groupmates to be rezzed? The best experience modifier in the game for warriors is going to a zone where you can find a group fast. That, and not the ZEM, is the big benefit to popular hunting grounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
May never know anything official about it, but it sure seems that way.  Shammy bounces a slow, mob turns on him, you hit shield, mob turns back.  It's happened to pretty much all of us....if we didn't completely waste a /shield every time we did it, we might not have noticed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/Shield definately helps getting aggro off slowers.<br />
<br />
Some of my friends like to slow stuff thats incoming 20 yards out with one arrow in it ,while they yell &quot;I can tank!&quot; I shield them just because they hate it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to remember someone (Varaho maybe?) doing a test where he shielded someone being attacked by a non-kos mob and the the mob stayed non-kos, which would certainly indicate that /shield adds no aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shield hotkey. I never used shield until I read about this hotkey on this board.  Some thread about how folks had their hotkeys set up.  <br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause somenumber<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
Basically, you're assisting your target (the mob you're fighting) putting in a pause to wait for the game to catch up, and then shielding that target.  <br />
<br />
You will need to put a number after the pause line, varying from 1-10.  (it's 10'ths of a second.)  It takes a bit of time depending on your lag situation to swap the target.  <br />
<br />
Right after the shield kicks off, you'll need to tap your target nearest key or click the mob with the mouse.  If you're fighting in a crowded situation, you may want to be careful about re-targetting, as you can end up on the wrong thing with your weapons still swinging and break a mez.  If you get good at this, you're only off target for a swing or two.  <br />
<br />
I use this whenever I see someone getting mashed in my group.  More often than not, I get a message about how I can't shield myself, because I get aggro back pretty quickly most times.  But it has saved a chanter or two in LDoN's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh, I should have been more clear about /shield and aggro.<br />
Shaiel's right to call me on it.<br />
I don't have any proof that it adds hate, other than my experience of it turning the mob far more often than it seems to me that other factors would account for. (mob turns on caster, I follow mob, get a round of melee on mob (mob still on caster though), fail taunt (mob still on caster), hit /shield (mob turns to me!), then the next round of (my) melee occurs.<br />
However, as I've said before, the history of players' understanding of game mechanics in EQ is a history of people who were &quot;certain&quot; of something that later turned out to be false. Variations in proc rates of weapons are the classic example of this. I'm certain there's some sort of hate value to /shield, but that sure as heck doesn't mean there really is.<br />
The taunt factor (or lack thereof) of /shield is without parse proof as far as I know, and seems to me to be pretty difficult -- though, come to think of it, fun -- to test (&quot;Uh, enchanter buddy, stand here and cast slow on that yellow mob to get some nice solid aggro, okay? We need a big sample size, so we'll do this 10,000 times. The first 5,000, I won't shield you, and the next 5,000 I will. Just be sure not to move or do anything else after the mob starts hitting you. And we'll see what happens, okay?&quot;)<br />
But seriously, the original poster asked what other abilities he'll get after lvl 24. He will get the ability to /shield, and I think it's worth using under the right conditions:<br />
Use /shield because it cuts down on the damage that the shielded player takes. Don't use it as taunt button; it might add hate but that's not what it's for. Use it to give yourself an extra round (or 10, depending on your level) to taunt the mob off the caster before the caster dies. That's what it's for, and it's something you can do, and it costs you very very little to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may not necessarily add hate, but it may adjust the hatelist, like proximity aggro does. <br />
<br />
I find it WAY too odd that the majority of the time that I don't shield players who have aggro, it takes a good round or three to get aggro back, but if I toss in a /shield, they turn right back to me.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, I don't have active accounts anymore, nor machines that can run EQ anyway, so that's as far as I wanna go with it without being able to do some in game testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I see it, most people you end up shielding are those that don't want aggro and are doing everything they can do ditch it.  Example:  chanter gets a mez resist, chanter gets aggro, warrior shields chanter, chanter blurs mob.  Doesn't have to be blur, or concussion, or whatever.  Most of my shield targets are those who shouldn't/don't want aggro and are going to act as innocent towards that mob as possible until they lose aggro.</div></div><hr />
