It sounds good, but do any of you have expericance with it?</div></div><hr />

Didn't see them draw aggro from the proc a single time. Using BoC/SotBS</div></div><hr />

Pulled agro once without taunting and that was when I got 3 procs with this and 2 JSoFF in about 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can basically promise you without ever picking it up that it's shit for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onian</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt really think it made all that much aggro. The proc rate was REALLY slow in my opinion.  If it proced alot sure, i dont think it would be too bad though:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually,  I find it quite nice aggro.  I 2 box an out of grp rog sometimes for xtra dps,  and I can manage aggro just find without having to evade 5x a fight ( generally don't have to evade at all during the fight ).  But I normally have dex to full so that could be part of why I see it as such a nice wep,  the DPS from it is so intense when you have it proccing alot that it's hard to not have aggro.  <br />
<br />
--edit--- I normally off-hand a CHoS with a lifetap augment on it in off-hand while using the Orb.<br />
<br />
However,  I still find it safer, while less DPS, to have my good ol' frostreaver equipped ( unaugmented FR )</div></div><hr />

I disagree on a few points.  20/28 isn't that good of a ratio, the dd didn't draw any aggro when i was using this.  Im willing to say Frostreaver will put out more dps then orb / chos .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">only aggro you will generate is if you get a proc on the very first swing if you and the main tank engage at the same time, and it's only for a few seconds, then the mob quickly turns back to MT. <br />
<br />
As for DPS, it's actually not so bad. 20/28 is a crappy ratio for a main hand weapon, but i believe the proc helps the dps portion and crit blasts for 640 is always fun :)<br />
<br />
it's just a fun weapon to use and i only use it when i feel like having fun. I wouldn't use it on a normal day to day basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Used it in SSRA last night, it didn't do anything for agro... but seeing me nuke for 320 was always entertaining. But we're talking about SSRA here, so hitting yourself in the face with a spiked mallet is more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This weapon is too slow for mainhand , you just wont be adding your 13 in often enough with it . It seems like a good offhand tho , the ratio is pretty good and being a bit slow means nothing for offhand , heck you will take a few less ripostes .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh.<br />
<br />
&quot;20/28 isn't that good of a ratio, the dd didn't draw any aggro when i was using this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ratio is not as bad as people give it credit for. An excerpt from a post on MB:<br />
<br />
&quot;PARSE INFO:<br />
a locked box in KC<br />
round one 1:28:34<br />
Delightful Orb of Forgotton Magic + Whistling Fists<br />
DPS: 94.22<br />
<br />
Of that the procs accounted for 0.69 DPS mostly due to the near 100% MR property of the target. However, I noticed it was about 1 hit proc per 80 swings of the Orb. scanning hte parse more proc hit but were mitigated to a very small amount (a lot were for only 7 when the base for L65 is 320) so a conservative estimate is that there was 1 proc every 50 swings. based upon that, even if you assume most mobs to be more suseptable to magic damage would take an average of 300 HP damage, you are looking at a max of about 5 DPS due to procs. It really is a pretty insignificant factor.<br />
<br />
round two 2:34:06<br />
Staff of Flowing Water<br />
DPS: 113.50<br />
<br />
nothing special to say here but the performance increase is about 20 percent in the DPS category. Even if I had a Waning Light Katar in the offhand, I can't expect the combo to truely come close to the power of a solid 2HB.<br />
<br />
In other words, I'll be sticking to the big stick. &quot;<br />
<br />
So the Staff of Flowing Water beats the delightful orb for DPS.<br />
<br />
Like we didn't see that coming.<br />
<br />
But, the underlying point is ... a 20/28 in the mainhand ain't as bad as everyone thinks it is, DPS wise.<br />
<br />
Aggro, well, that's another story entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaoraEci</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a nice weapon, a good choice for non tanking. However for agro, it's not a weapon you should be choosing.  I've tested it in LDoN and in PoE to see how well it could pull agro, and it doesnt.  <br />
<br />
Pretty toy though, especially if you like watching spell crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just a toy. If you try and take it any more seriously than you'd take a Fererro with one of those Lamborghini body kits you're kidding yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wowser I think a few of you should really look at the numbers and not talk trash with nothing to back it up.   Fact is in BOT  I do 79 dps with copper and blood (ig3) and with the Orb and copper I do 95 tanking.  This was over 4 hrs with 2 hrs on each, shaman noticed no diffence in how much of a beating he took (he slows on inc).<br />
<br />
   To slow for a main hand, BS, you tell me in NUMBERS the diff between a 10 delay (20 + 100 haste) and 14 (28 +100 haste) for your 13 bonus, its one hell of alot less then the 11.57 dps I get from the proc.  Over 50 mins of continus fighting it proc'd 97 times (2 a min) I had 3 full resist and 3 partial with 16 crits for 640.<br />
<br />
Is it a good aggro weapon hell no, is it a good dps weapon for me yes.   My guild has been working with a larger guild to move up in pop and on most raids we have at least 5 Overlords so I dont mt very offen.  For this it works perfect.<br />
<br />
I think what it comes down to is if your in a good group and everyone knows what to do I can use it (even in LDoN) but if there are any aggro problems then out comes the Copper and Blood.<br />

<br />
You wanna use it, fine, but it's not gonna win any real endorsements amongst the masses any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viladdar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This weapon is just a nice toy, but that's not the most beautiful part. The trick is that I sold it for 25k (that's on Trib) 2 hours after have won the roll on it. Dont know what class could seriously use this regulary, maybe a monk, but certainly not a warrior. The fact that it is mainhand only screws it. I would MAYBE use it in offhand, but not in mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason &quot;maybe a monk&quot; would use it, is because it puts out good DPS.<br />
<br />
Most monks who play around with it report back that is has DPS comprable to their entwood mace in their primary.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
DPS is DPS. Don't matter how slow the stupid weapon is.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't ever consider suggesting a warrior equip it for aggro, but that has nothing to do with it's delay and everything to do with its proc.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, remember back in Kunark? A 17/28 was pretty good DPS back then. Now it's a 20/28 with a big DD proc on it. It's not surprising that it's decent for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slow 1H were under-rated before and they're under-rated now. Wurmslayer took a beating with virtually no actual parsing. While my parsing showed it on par with/ahead of Jade Mace at 60. But that's not really on topic...<br />
<br />
 Beasts have found the orb to be better than the ubiquitous Waning Light Katar(16/22) by a fair margin. It's ratio really isn't bad, and higher ATK will make up for any applied damage bonus shortcomings(IE: fast 2H, same deal).<br />
<br />
 He asked if it was a good agro weapon, it is not. I have tested it, it doesn't hold agro worth a damn in my groups, wiz/mage/rogue all pulled agro off me repeatedly. Granted I'm a bit past where most people would be using this seriously, but that's what I have to add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onian</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One reason is sells so well is the stats on it. Its actually a Very good item for int caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its useful<br />
<br />
a) if you a second tank in a ldon group<br />
b) if you are on  raid and not tanking<br />
c) if you are in an easy exp group w/o any agro concerns<br />
(+)<br />
d) you don't have a better dps weapon<br />
<br />
So its situational...I played with one and didnt like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A shaman friend of mine loves his, with rabid bear and tons of points in SCF he does almost decent melee damage with a lot of crit procs lol</div></div><hr />
