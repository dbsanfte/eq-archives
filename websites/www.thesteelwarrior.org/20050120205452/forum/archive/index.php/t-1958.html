 Not EQ related. Didn't know whether to post it here or the outhouse. But I knew some people would get a kick out of it, I know I did.</div></div><hr />

I can not even begin to say how sick this guy would have to be. Typically I would mock some guy for being a dink or whatever but this is so serious that I can not even mock the situation. I seriously hope this guy stops these kind of activities but the fact is that he most likely will not and people are at risk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't get to read the original post, perhaps this is more serious than I first deemed, maybe I'll go back and read the second part again.  Excuse me for being insensitive plz.</div></div><hr />

Makes me sick.  Also reminds me of some of the shit that happened to my last girlfriend when she was younger, and how much she was hurt by it.  After being with her, and with her taking herself from me because she couldn't get over how much she was hurt in her past, it's impossible to know the amount of anger and hatred I have for people like him.... he better pray for help should he ever see me.</div></div><hr />
