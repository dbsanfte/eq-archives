<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DaTrollTank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping someone hear could shed some light on this for me. What are the level requirements for LDON raids? I have read that 18peeps is the min requirement to get in, but what about levels? Can any levels raid? I have a younger guild (few 60's and a fair amount of 50's) and would like to try an LDON raid with them. The books shipped with the CD for LDON says that the raids are based on the average level of the raid. Is this still true? <br />
Thanks everyone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Minimum level required - 60<br />
Raid level average required - 63<br />
<br />
Most are rated for elemental level/geared raids, a couple are rated for VT level/geared raids (and i assume a hair easier), but i forget which camps are rated for which level.<br />
<br />
Only allowed 30(?) deaths i think before raid is auto-fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Death limit is raid dependant, I think - I know I personally died at least 15 times on our first LDON raid and we had 2 full wipes of 36 people without autofailing.<br />
<br />
That aside ... There's much better stuff for a late 50s-early 60's guild to do with 18-36 people. The 'VT' level script in Rujark can easily demolish a Time+ guild, thanks to incredibly boneheaded, forced scripts, and the elemental level MM raids are even more frustrating. I have no experience with the Takish Hiz VT level script.<br />
<br />
Look to Velious and Luclin for much more satisfying, and probably more rewarding, raid encounters. Mobs like Velketor the Sorcerer, Telkorenar, Gozzrem, Lendinaria the Keeper, Doljononimorinar, Dain Frostreaver, Yelinak, Klandicar, Derekor the Vindicator, Rumblecrush, Doomshade... The Ring of Slime in CT. Cazic Thule himself. PoP has Vahkhiz the Shade, Mujaki the Devourer, Overlord Banord Paffa... All more enjoyable for you and your guild than LDoN raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only way a Time+ guild can fail the BB EP one is if when you split up you didn't put any class that can CC on the path that needs CC to win.  <br />
<br />
Rujarkian VT one is only hard if you try to pull instead of just charging at everything.<br />
<br />
Different raids have different death caps, and some raids might not have death cap at all, but the raids are long enough that you will probably lose on time if you wipe too much.<br />
<br />
I found the LDoN raids to be very fun, but certainly not worth the time involved.</div></div><hr />
