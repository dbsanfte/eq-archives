Getting into the face of his nearest foe he roars like a mad man drawing his attention. His weapons swinging with the rhythm of battle, his blood on fire with the heat of war all thoughts of everything but this battle fall from him.<br />
<br />
No longer does he really see the battle with eyes but with instinct knowing where his savagery is needed. Roaring his taunts and swinging his weapons to keep all the foes upon him while his party does their job. Taking physical and magical blows that would cripple most he rages on into the bloody battle.<br />
<br />
His inhuman endurance driving him his skills supporting him he weaves havoc with his weapons and taunts. His instinct is to protect and guard, to die if he must so the others survive. <br />
<br />
As warrior he was born, as warrior he lives, as a warrior he often dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have played warrior since EQ been out.  Warriors were one of my favorite classes back in the D&amp;D age.  Never got to play much though everyone liked me to be the GM because I could make some dungeons including stories and graphics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good stuff...</div></div><hr />
