Lepidus: Warriors are a group that has been very vocal about problems with their class. Are there any plans to give special attention to the needs of this class or any other?<br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: We will be hosting a chat to discuss the changes we have in mind on November 24th. We will be doing something more than a just simple balancing pass. It's more of a melee combat system change. The goal is to make melee combat more interesting over all, to introduce a little more skill into the way a melee character is played, and to achieve the balance that we are always looking for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 See you all the 18th and many days before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">reminds me of the &quot;Boy who cried 'Melee Balancing Incoming!'&quot;<br />
<br />
this will be the icing on the cake; or the last nail in the coffin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damnit, just after I had started drooling over the thought of becoming a WoW warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im actually a bit excited about this :p<br />
This may hold me glued to EQ till WoW comes out... <br />
Hope the chat comes out nicely, time will tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL, we're so predictable and SoE is playing us like a violin :)  After months of waiting to hear something and finally organizing an event to make known our grievances all they have to do is stick a little blurb out about &quot;a melee combat system change&quot; and we're all once again glued to the EQ computer screen.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I'm kinda interested to hear what this is about :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yehan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sigh...<br />
We took the bait, the hook, the line and the sinker?<br />
<br />
Is that all it takes to make us happy? &quot;We promise we would look into it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Haven't we heard this before?  Pray tell how much longer are we going to have to wait after this &quot;discussion&quot;?<br />
<br />
Do not get me wrong, I am all for a thorough revamp of the melee combat system and its many problems.  I am  very much in favor of it.  However, warriors are still suffering and  just a few cosmetic changes would go a long ways towards alleviating this suffering.  For the time being yet we are getting what we have got before : nothing.</div></div><hr />

Until PoP itemization is fixed or there is going to be a new expansion which uberizes everyone even further thought I dont see this making things balanced. I mean how can you balance someone with 8k hp and 0 mana vs someone with 7.8k hp and 5k mana(knights) or 5.5k hp and 8k mana (caster)</div></div><hr />

By giving us extended warcry of course!</div></div><hr />
