Since Warrior isn;t listed on the classes i'd say yes you wouldn;t be able to use; it's also no drop so i would question why it did not go to a rogue who would clearly get the most advantage out of it anyhow.  If I happened to have it (and you just missed putting warrior on usable classes) I might use it, but i really don;t think a pidly DoT is going to really make it hold aggro very well at all, and in a DPS role i usually use a big 2hs like windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fire line of dots is very low aggro, it's one of the things SKs/Necros use when they don't want to get hit. Unless all you're looking for is DPS, give this over to the rogues first, then the bards, rangers, and beastlords. (Any knight that goes in for this needs his head examined.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As has been mentioned, it's not listed as warrior usable, but it IS warrior usable according to Lucy and Alla'Khazam, so I guess you can use it after all.<br />
<br />
It also have a nice amount of +HP on it, some saves and I guess it's all around nice. Comes from BOT mini boss too (Brynju Thunderclap I think), so not too hard to get I guess. Think it's one of his more rare drops though.<br />
<br />
- However -<br />
<br />
It has a backstab modifier on it and is one of the fairly rare 1H piercers with more than 15 Damage on it, so if you ever get one, be ready to be backstabbed and looted by your friendly neighbourhood rogue.<br />
<br />
And then there's the whole &quot;should I dualwield or not&quot; mess at high levels too, due to ripostes. So I guess it's really up to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and if I remember correct, Heat Blood is a DOT from the Necromancer spell line. Old School spell too. Necro's get them pretty early, like before level 20 or so. Guess that's why it only adds little aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it *is* warrior usable, as well as the most common drop from BT. i think just about everyone in my guild that wanted it has it has one. i agree that rogues should get first on it, but it's so common that they'll be rotting after a few runs. a couple of our warriors used it for DPS. the proc isnt really much agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proc is negligable aggro at best even tho it procs VERY often. I never have problems with aggro when using it with my Rogue. In certain situations it will outdamage my other piercer.<br />
<br />
Overall its a nice poker, but as a warrior I would only take it if it was going to rot.</div></div><hr />
