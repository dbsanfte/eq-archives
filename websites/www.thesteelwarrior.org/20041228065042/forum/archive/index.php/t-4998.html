All of the discs cost me about 1400 pp with 100 CHA.</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to bet that the tomes for all the &quot;old discs&quot; will get a price bump in the not too distant future ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you see if from a caster point of view (not that I am one), they have to buy their spells or get the drop. So I wouldnt say that having a discipline cost 400pp is bad, in fact, thank god it is that cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I do. I also play a Cleric and a Shaman. <br />
<br />
And ... WOW .... some of those spells are pricy!!!<br />
<br />
I guess in all what I'm saying is this ....<br />
<br />
Sony's in an attempt to keep all things .... being equal.<br />
<br />
No complaint here .... just have to kill more stuff. :p<br />

Still it is refreshing to have these CA's to work with unlike a year ago.<br />

<br />
/agree ... to a point<br />
<br />
Eventually, those of us who already had these disciplines will have bought them ... the price increase I suspect is coming is for those unrolled twinks.  I think we got the bargain rates - *grandfathered in*, in a sense.   I betcha that one day, the will be like spells which you're supposed to buy.  Idle speculation, tho.<br />
<br />
I would have been pretty pissed off if they had rolled 'em all in at the same price scale :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.. to express my sincere anger at the stupidity and greed of all the idiots selling berserker tomes in the bazaar for 100's of pp.<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, i know, if someone is dumb enough to buy it, they deserve it, but still...<br />
<br />
*looks around for greedy bastard to bonk*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors who haven't bought simple CHA gear such as opal encrusted steins (25 CHA each, somewhere around 20-25 pp each last time I checked my server) should take a careful look at the price lists Garoar has made before buying the more expensive tomes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite and Stonewall are the only 2 you need anyway.  Healing Will is kind of cool to use and then go afk or something but certainly not needed unless you solo a lot.<br />
<br />
I bought all the tomes just for completeness sake though.</div></div><hr />
