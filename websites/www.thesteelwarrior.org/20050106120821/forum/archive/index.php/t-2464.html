Gorenaire is easy, but unzergable. need good ppl on her that dont get taken out by her AEs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually its the slow that pretty much nullifys melee damage on her (assuming your in a group/guild that is not way beyond her) and that is what makes her hard. EQ/AM3 Rangers and a few good nukers is all you really need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I fought her we had a bard war cleric wizard and it was WAY overkill. Bard song brings me to 500mr so not 1 single spell landed from Gor.<br />
<br />
She has 32k hp which can be beat down really fast. If you have low mr or cold resist she could give you trouble but if not you will own her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive taken down gore 3 times in a row last times he was up on my server.  I had 200+on all resists and was still getting AEd.  However last night i had a bard in the group and was at about 330s on the resists.  Some were still landing.  Not sure if there is a way to resist fear other than discipline or Fearless AAs.  A single group does fine.  Have a tank, a CH class (Shaman/druid/cleric), and the rest DPS (have a puller too, and get a haste buff).  His main AE i hate is his 70% slow :(.  RGC didnt cure it after multiple casts, but Radiant Cure did.  Trust me, if your group full of melees are all slowed, it goes horribly slow, so as others suggested, just get 1 tank, 1 CH class, and the rest nukers<br />
<br />
also tried Crusaders Touch... and after a few times it didnt do it either <br />
<br />
Crusaders Touch<br />
Removes 20 Disease Counter(s)<br />
Removes 20 Poison Counter(s)<br />
Removes 5 Curse counters <br />
<br />
Remove Greater Curse<br />
Removes 45 Curse counters</div></div><hr />

<br />
With no real buffs but what we brought, everyone started fighting her. It was such a long fight that she had cheal'd twice and was OOM.<br />
<br />
She snacked all the casters from doing so much damage and we finally got her to like 10%<br />
<br />
All the melee were slowed and there was only like 5 of us left.<br />
<br />
She turned to run and I swear she made it halfway back to KC before we killed here LOLOLOL...<br />
<br />
We were cracking up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
With all &quot;slow&quot; type spells its cure disease not cure curse. 1 cast of pureblood or sometimes 2 casts of abolish disease will cure any slow in the game.<br />
<br />
There are a few curse slows but they are in time and maybe Ssra(iirc).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Gore? I can't wait to see her up again. She drove me nuts every time I tried to run through DL. Its payback time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not the case with Gore's slow. Cure disease will cure all standard shaman/ench slows, because they all add disease counters. Gore's AE is Freezing Breath: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=845&amp;source=Live which does not add any disease counters. The only way to cure it is to dispell it, or to use Radiant Cure, which has a chance to remeove detrimental effects as well as cure poison/disease/curse counters.</div></div><hr />
