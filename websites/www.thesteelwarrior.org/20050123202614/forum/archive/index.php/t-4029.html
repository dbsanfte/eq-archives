<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok magelo is on the left and I know that my current weapons are ok. My question is, by the time It takes me to gather the points to get an anger 3 augment or 2 anger 2 augments I will probably be level 55 and able to use the GSoT. I have been working 2hb and it should be maxed by 55 with ease.  Knowing that I doubt I will ever get to upgrade my current equipment unless I happen to get some Ornate Molds in the bazaar or I get enough adventure points to get new armor and weapons. The question is, for me as a MT, what would you do? Just get the 2 anger 2 augments and put one on the CHoS and SotB or just put an anger 3 proc on my GSoT first? My only goal is to hold solid agro and give out great DPS. I will eventualy get the procs on the all but what should I get first?</div></div><hr />

I personally like the GSoT, and have built my aa's around the 2h fighting style so far. My plan for the last month has been to aug the GSoT with Anger 3 and save cash for ornate and points for Tak armor.<br />
<br />
My guild just downed Xanamech, and a Cord Hilted Spike Driver could indeed fall into my hands soon enough. I am rethinking going to re farm CHoS to be ready to offhand it, then aug both CHSD and CHoS, as I do not see AoW within the near future.<br />
<br />
I suppose we are in the same boat really, a ship named &quot;What If&quot;. If you think GSoT or CHoS and SotB is your best attainable for a good long time, I think I would go with GSoT auged with Anger 3.</div></div><hr />

I group alot with the same people the shaman i group with can malo slow epic and use his 65 dot and i get argo back np. I used a GSoT for a while and didn't like i like the SotB and CHoS better.</div></div><hr />
