Credit card info is was gets you, if you're not the original owner chances are you won't have that info, at least from what I've heard you need that to transfer a character.<br />
<br />
Also I thought you couldn't transfer from FV server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>fndarksyde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Isnt there some way to transfer through stormhammer or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">not anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have the account info you can change the credit card info.  I fail to see a problem but understand the apprehension.</div></div><hr />

Original CC info + CD keys.<br />
<br />
Unless they've changed this, which I doubt, second-hand owners pretty much can't transfer servers.  I'm the original and only owner of my account but I changed CC info, and getting my transfer through was a real pain in the ass. They were incredibly strict about it.</div></div><hr />

I am the original owner of my account.  I just transferred from Bristlebane to Stromm.  All they asked for were the character names and the current CC number the account was being billed for.  There was also an option to bill the transfer to a different CC if I wanted to.<br />
