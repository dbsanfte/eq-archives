<br />
I am considering selling my LSoEE while I can and buying another weapon that helps me best do my job.<br />
<br />
Yet, It is still very unclear to me how aggro works in off hand (EDIT: other than procs :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
I am looking for suggestions on a replacement in the price range of the LSoEE, keeping in mind I will be loosing 12 Dex, 15 AC, and 10 SVM (and the rest of my gear isnt uba)<br />
<br />
PS: would the Barnacle Covered Axe be viable in off hand ?</div></div><hr />

Put this i main hand and frosty in off hand and there you go :-)<br />

<br />
I used LSoEE and Frosty for a while - ac was nice. + good dps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the Silken Whip of Ensnaring a serious option for tanking till 60 ? I do like the snare effect, dont get me wrong, just wondering how it fare in planes (poi, pod, ..) The sound is great too ^_^<br />
<br />
And yes, the LSoEE is nice DPS, I would keep it if I could for when I am not main tank. If I was not tank I';d definitely look for one.. yet for some reason I have a really hard time to get 'rid' of it.. seems lots of people dont like the negative stats :/  I have been auctioning it as low as 6k that's the lowest on bazaar atm :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually i think the snare whip is still viable.  even if snare gets resisted, its a nice aggro getter. in fact now that i got to tier 2 recently , im even thinking of getting one again because i didnt realise that some mobs in PoV start running again at low health</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen the Silken Whip of Ensnaring for 2k and could probably get one for less with a little patience.<br />
<br />
So I think I will buy one and keep LSoEE for DPS.<br />
<br />
I could also sell the LSoEE and buy the whip and a Defender's Lightblade for when  I am not main tank.<br />
<br />
I am wondering how it would compare to the LSoEE ? The DPS is lower, but there is no skill check on the magic damage.</div></div><hr />
