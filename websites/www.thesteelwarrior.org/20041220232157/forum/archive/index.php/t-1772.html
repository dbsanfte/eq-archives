In Neriak, the second area there is a DE mob that has a title(something with an ex at the beginning of its second name). It hits for 3-6 and has such a high regen rate that Breath of Ultor and Blood of Saryn stacked on it didn't move its HP at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot.<br />
<br />
So to borrow from Obi-Wan Kenobi:<br />
<br />
&quot;These aren't the mobs you're looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for posting about this :D <br />
<br />
I will agree that it will probably get nerfed soon, so I'll give my info and hope people can use them before it does get nerfed<br />
<br />
There are 3 exterminators.  One in third gate, one in commons, and one in foreign quarters.  The one in third gate (female de) casts necro spells, but is green to a 65.  The one in commons (male de) hits for 5 max, but it next to a few guards, easy to pull to third gate zone, kill the 1 or so guards that aggro'd, then fight him.  He is blue to 65 and summons.  The one in foreign quarters (male troll) is also near a bunch of guards.  My little lvl 1 sk mob finder got hit for 81 when he attacked him.  Forgot to con him with my war.<br />
<br />
So the one in commons is best.  After an hour of fighting with a tash stick, and a shield (to build up 1hb and bash), with occasionally equiping my primal 2hb (to proc avatar), he was at 90% and I was at 100% (had a fungi on, bet even vindi regen would be &gt; him).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the troll exterminator hits over 100 but not too often, green con at 65, slow regen compared to the translocators.  Approximately 2 million hitpoints.  The female dark elf exterminator also hits for over 100.  Lots are using the male DE (NPC abuse heh) to get skill ups, especially those slacking in the defense skill (ie rogues)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzee</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, tried Exterminator Sutten in Rivervale tonight, 1million hp, hits for high of 77, landed about 1 in 20 attacks on me at 1100ac at lvl 60.  Soloed him down to 90% with TD and Fungi, but called some groupmates so a mage, necro, ranger, cleric, and enchanter joined.  Total fight time: 1 hour 50 minutes.  About 12 assassinates from the Mage's Epic pet.  I got the kill shot, and it's definitely going on the Sig =).  Problem is, I went to help skill up but the mob was green =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So which is the best for skilling up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DE mob in Neriak 2nd zone(commons I think)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went through to check out some other cities, got bored though so didn't look in all of them.<br />
<br />
Note: all of these are con'd by a lvl 65.  I did not aggro any that were not blue in any city other than neriak, simply because they are useless to me at 65, so I do not know what their melee / stats are.<br />
<br />
North Kaladim - Lightblue<br />
North Felwithe - Green<br />
Halas - None<br />
Erudin - None<br />
Paineel - None<br />
Ak'anon - Green<br />
Freeport (East) - Green<br />
Freeport (West) - Green<br />
Neriak (Third Gate) - Green<br />
Neriak (Commons) - Blue<br />
Neriak (Foreign Quarter) - Green<br />
<br />
So, only blue one I've seen is Neriak commons.  I'm told mobs don't assist, but if you are kos the guards will aggro.  He does not aggro, even though he shows scowling to me.  He actually does have a proc also, but it's a mana drain, so not a big deal for us warriors.<br />
<br />
In a total of 4 hours in two days I went from 200 1hb to 250, and 60ish bash to 125, so not too bad, hope to finish off bash before the nerf =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting Hussar, I had very different experiences with the Neriak Commons mob. The guards did assist, and he has a very large aggro radius if you are KoS, which actually made him very easy to single pull to a safe spot because he can see invis. I clicked my GVD, and got into his aggro radius, and booked it for a nice private spot. Since I was invis, no one assisted. Worked out nicely.<br />
<br />
I broke my level 50 warrior out of mothballs for the test. He conned red at 50, but had ridiculously low AC, I was hitting almost every time with a 2hb skill in the 40s. He also procs a mana drain, and oddly enough, blocks.<br />
<br />
Expect a nerf soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, thats odd.  I ran right next to him and waited for him to aggro me, he didn't attack until I kicked him.  Later I was killing guards for fun, and pulled the one right next to him with a kick without aggro.  I agree that he has low ac, he also has low atk I would guess, since I got hit very rarely (I would refresh my Eyepatch of Plunder (3 second cast time) during battle with no problems usually).</div></div><hr />
