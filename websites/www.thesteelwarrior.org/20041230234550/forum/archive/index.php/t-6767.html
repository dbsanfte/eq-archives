<br />
I was told by my trainer that I can, but he forgot to tell me which hand to put my weapons in!.<br />
<br />
So can someone please tell me the nuts and bolts of Duel Weild, how the ratio works for each hand, if training a new weapon where should that go.. like i said nuts and bolts.<br />
<br />
I've got a wurmy and that new skeleton sword the procs ice or somethen.<br />
<br />
Thanks Greatly,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each hand swings independently of the other. So if you have a 20 del weapon in the offhand, every 20 sec you will have a chance to swing. At max skill, you swing something like 50% of the time with your offhand.<br />
<br />
Genererally, most people say put your fastest weapon mainhand and the best ratio offhand (Wurmslayer being a recognized exception, along with Centi LS)</div></div><hr />

- Only your mainhand will give the damage bonus<br />
- Mainhand procs a maz of 2ppm, offhand max of 1ppm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some quick rules for dual wielding:<br />
<br />
1 - The delays are seperate for each weapon: putting a faster weapon into your mainhand will NOT cause your offhand to swing more often.<br />
2 - For each 10 delay, unhasted, it takes 1 second to swing.  A 25 delay weapon, unhasted, will take 2.5 seconds between attacks.<br />
3 - If your offhand has a delay of 30, every 3 seconds it does a check against your dual wield skill.  If you meet the skill check, you will attack with your offhand.  It will then do a check against your double attack skill, etc.<br />
4 - Rule of thumb is to put that faster weapon in your primary hand, but only if the two weapons are similar in their ratios.  If you have one weapon that is significanlty better than the other, but slower, it may still be better to put in your mainhand.<br />
5 - At level 65 with max dex (305), the average ppm (proc per minute) is 2ppm mainhand, 1ppm offhand.  This can be altered by AA's such as Weapon Affinity and some rare weapons have an innate change to their proc rates.  But for most weapons it's the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The poster said he just trained dual wield.  The damage bonus that is the reason that people say to put the fastest weapon in the primary slot doesn't do jack until about lvl 50.  The damage bonus is added to your mainhand each time it hits, so the faster weapon swings and hits more therefore getting more bonus damage over time than a slower one.<br />
<br />
Until around lvl 50, put your best ratio weapon in main hand and your second best in offhand or use offhand to train other one hand weapon skills like piercing, blunt, etc.  At some point you will find it advantageous to have one person in a group maintaining the attention of the mob so that is the only person getting healed.  At this point you may start looking for weapons that have a proc that upsets the mob and makes you the focus of their attention.  When this happens the ratio of the weapons becomes less important, although it is still a consideration.<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy the warrior.<br />

<br />
Was hoping someone would point that out to the poster. :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comprehension not the strong suit this morning apparantly. <br />
<br />
Baadan is saying you put your fastest weapon primary and your best ratio weapon offhand.  The wurmslayer will likely be your slowest weapon, and it will also likely be your best ratio weapon, THUS THE EXCEPTION, being that it is mainhand only.<br />
<br />
Edit : Jesus, I've been up way too long if I'm actually defending Baadan :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parrn</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Guys, <br />
<br />
Thanks so much for the info.. I tried to read some Ranja stuff but they area ll messed up over there.  Just made my 17th season, and look forward to my older years.  <br />
<br />
I will keep the wurmy in primary and train with others, How long can I keep the wurmy as primary weapon then until I out level it?  <br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnyjohnson76</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you prolly shouldn't be using the wurmy until at least 20+ if not 30+ due to damage cap, it's far too slow to be usefull when you can't hit for more than 30, but then again im biased because i hate wurmslayers with a passion, anyways, it will last you into your 40's after that I would suggest a lamentation if you don't have lots of funds, and a venemous axe of the velium brood is a good weapon when you hit 35, 85 DD proc, decent ratio, 10 ac is always nice and they don't usually cost more than a couple hundread plat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is incorrect; procs depend on the weapon. But the 2ppm primary and 1ppm secondary is true for most weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daggorr, no.  There is no maximum amount of procs per minute.  Mainhand procs an AVERAGE of 2ppm, offhand procs an AVERAGE of 1ppm, with max dexterity.<br />
<br />
(Well, I suppose that the number of swings you make in a minute is your theoretical maximum number of procs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, what the hell was i thinking, i know better than that. Ment that more as a general rule of thumb not a be all end all.  Sorry bout that.<br />
<br />
Thats what I get for working during post-time. &lt;gibbers&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">until your skill is a bit higher than what you get initially, it doesnt really matter what you have in the offhand.<br />
some claim more skillups with faster weapons, but i've not seen any proof of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faster weapons will help with skil ups due to more checks against the skill. Like tradeskills, the more checks against a skill you have, the more likely that one of those checks will result in a skillup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things.<br />
1. as pointed out above, you do have a damage cap until level 20, so the wurmy will be a better weapon after that (for a while) than it is before lvl 20.<br />
2. Speedy 1-hand weapons are nice in the main hand, partly because in the early going, you'll have trouble training all of your weapon skills (you'll level too fast). As Wandor points out, the more swings you take, the more &quot;chances&quot; you have to improve your skill.<br />
3. Eventually, procs become the significant difference in the ability of weapons to hold aggro; however, as late as your late 40s it's not a huge part of the game, because most of the best weapons are not usable at that point, and because your DEX will almost certainly be far closer to 100 than 300.<br />
<br />
Now, you want nuts? Bolts?<br />
