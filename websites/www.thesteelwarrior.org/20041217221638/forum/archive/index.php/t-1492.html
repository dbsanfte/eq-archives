Last night I had to leave the channel for the second time in as many days because it got too spammy or because there was too much sheer dumbassery.  Before that, I've never had to log out for any reason other than to clear my chatbox so I didn't miss raid stuff (and I haven't even done that in months).  Nobody gives a damn about mysupersales, and nobody wants to rehash the same damn aggro isues for the millionth time.  Get serverwide.thesteelwarrior back to what it used to be, a place where people can go to get info or shoot the shit with warriors from other servers, not a place that gets spammed with dumb stuff every 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
meh, it's not eloquent, but it gets the point across.</div></div><hr />

I left the channel the night someone kept moderating it, then spamming. It has become a joke now.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to hear it's going downhill though.  Same thing has been happening to the boards lately it seems to me.  Somehow we attracted some real winners in the last few months.</div></div><hr />

Not that I ever say much (antisocial I guess /shrug). Different place, but still has its gems now and then.. altho, yea.. I mostly keep it on autojoin outta habit/laziness.</div></div><hr />

Most of it is fake link spam anymore, no real content or usefulness.  I stay in there for when others come in and try to get real info, instead of bs.  Though, I get dropped from channels constantly, don't know if I could stand being in there for too long if I wasn't being dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, bringing this back to the top...<br />
<br />
there's still some good info to be had, and I hang around in there to try and help out some newbs...but I swear, next time I see a link to a fucking gnome decapitated head, I'm gonna snap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only thing i get sick of is the same 3 people asking for BoC links every 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
and the stupid fake links of &quot;Cup of Shut the F##K up&quot;<br />
<br />
its nice that people know how to make fake links, but please, keep it to your guild chat.<br />
<br />
Let the channel go back to what it was.  And have those of us who know stuff, answer questions asked by those of us who dont.<br />
<br />
or in my case, answer questions regardless if we know the right answer or not .... its 42 i tell you 42 .... yes ... AoW has 42 HP, and you need 42 to enter Plane of Time ... and Ageo has 42 less HP than Virtue ... and well, everything is 42.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">last straw for me... was when some dumbass from errolisi marr who had an intentionally hard-to-spell name kept spamming with &quot;HIACHU's&quot; (btw, that's &quot;Hiaku&quot;, retard). <br />
<br />
but let them frolick in their toilet channel with fake links, ASCII macros and mindless banter about nothing to do with warriors.<br />
<br />
just remove ANY reference to that channel from this board, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW: Elementous and Smashur make the HAUICHUS or whatever, and Dima makes the Cup of Shut the Fuck Up and Sword of Paladin Slaying links, and Acyclos makes the gnome links.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quit going there about a month or so ago, tried going back a few weeks ago to ask a question, and it was essentially just a bunch of garbage running past. I saw people ask legitimate questions, and they were just simply ignored. <br />
<br />
 Some might say it's because of summer, but the downhill slide began before then. I'd already noticed a lot of 'higher end' warriors had quit going there before I quit going..not to mention it seems to get regular 'invasional' stuff either into the channel or to go and harrass other class based channels as well. At this point, I'm just going to stick with the message board because the spam can just be skipped over.</div></div><hr />
