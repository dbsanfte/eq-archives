<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this on my server boards,Customer: Hi, I bought this drill and it won't turn on now.<br />
Sears CSR: Try plugging it into a different outlet.<br />
Customer: Okay, done. It still isn't working.<br />
Sears CSR: Are you sure you plugged the right cord in?<br />
Customer: Yep, only one cord here.<br />
Sears CSR: Disconnect all other cords in the room you're in.<br />
Customer: Uh, why?<br />
Sears CSR: We need to narrow the problem down to just your drill.<br />
Customer: Okay, done. It still isn't working.<br />
Sears CSR: Okay, turn off all the lights in your house.<br />
Customer: Huh?<br />
Sears CSR: We need to make sure this isn't a power problem.<br />
Customer: Uhm, okay. All lights off. All appliances off.<br />
Sears CSR: Does it work?<br />
Customer: No.<br />
Sears CSR: You may need to contact your power company.<br />
Sears CSR: Is there anything else I can help you with?<br />
Customer: You haven't helped me with this yet.<br />
Sears CSR: The problem is either with your power company or your outlets.<br />
Customer: Are you serious? I've plugged in 10 other appliances and they all work. It's just YOUR company's drill that doesn't work.<br />
Sears CSR: I'm sorry, I am unable to assist you further until your power company has been ruled out as the source of the problem.<br />
Customer: I'll go to the store. Thanks for nothing.<br />
Sears CSR: Glad to help. Have a nice day! Happy crafting!<br />
<br />
<br />
Customer: Hi, I bought this drill from you guys, and it doesn't work now.<br />
Employee: Did you call our customer support?<br />
Customer: Yes, and he said it was probably my power company.<br />
Employee: Could be. Did you have them come out and look at your wiring?<br />
Customer: No, I didn't call my power company. All of my other electrical appliances are working.<br />
Employee: Ah, you may want to disconnect all those other appliances before trying the drill.<br />
Customer: I did that. It didn't work, and now I'm here.<br />
Employee: Did you push the trigger with your left or right hand?<br />
Customer: I'm right handed.<br />
Employee: Try it with your left hand.<br />
Customer: I see a line of other people with the same drill, complaining about the same thing.<br />
Employee: Yes, it's hard to teach hundreds of people how to use a drill.<br />
Customer: Is it possible the problem is with the drill.<br />
Employee: Hehe. Naw, most problems are from improper use. Or the power companies are to blame.<br />
Customer: Many of these people are from all different parts of the country using many different power companies. How can this be the power companies?<br />
Employee: Is there anything else I can help you with?<br />
Customer: You haven't helped me with THIS yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Combine Braable and Badaan's posts and you pretty much have my recent call to Hewlett Packard Technical support, but you have to read it all with a thick middle-eastern accent that is impossible to understand over the phone.  I swear the only training they give these people is &quot;blame everything except the product and get them off the phone as quickly as possible.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you for Calling Sears:  Error 1017, you cannot connect to the support center at this time, usually this is a temporary condition, wait a few minutes and try again.</div></div><hr />
