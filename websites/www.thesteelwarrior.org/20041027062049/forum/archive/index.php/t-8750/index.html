<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gordic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is ornate armor?  I have heard others mention it like it was the end-all be-all of armor, but a friend of mine heard me say something about wanting to see some, he spent a butt load of money on the patterns and items and had some made for me as a bday present.  but when he got it from the smith it was not so great.  any explanations on this?  thanks.</div></div><hr />

Kizrak's is warrior ornate armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ornate is the lower version of the PoP quest armor. The molds are dropped by named mobs in PoP and are tradeable so can be bought and sold in bazaar, but the armor once made is no drop/<br />
<br />
   What your friend probably had made was Ornate Chainmail, which is player made armor and only slightly better then banded. Of course folks still try selling ornate chainmail in bazaar for stupid prices to cheat folks looking for ornate chainmail patterns</div></div><hr />
