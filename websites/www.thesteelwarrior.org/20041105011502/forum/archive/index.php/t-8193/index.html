<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question about haste stacking.  I have 36% worn haste and am using tier 2 Tribute haste (26%).  First, those do stack right?  Second, spell haste (Chanter, Shammy, BST) stacks with Worn and Tribute to a max 100% right?  My question is where does Bard haste fit in there?  Can you go over 100% with normal bard song haste?  Does Bard haste stack with Tribute haste?  My normal group includes me and a bard so Worn, Tribute and Song are what I mostly run with unless I grab a haste from someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tribute haste counts as spell haste (like chanter/shammy haste buffs), so tribute haste does not stack with other spell hastes, but will stack with your worn haste.  Normal bard songs will stack with worn and spell haste up to the cap, but a select few songs also allow you to break the cap.  This is my understanding anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tribute haste counts as spell haste (like chanter/shammy haste buffs), so tribute haste does not stack with other spell hastes, but will stack with your worn haste.

<br />
From my research this is wrong, unless they changed it.  Tribute haste counts as WORN haste.  Therefore, you are wasting tribute haste if your worn haste item is greater than your tribute haste.  When I want extra beef, I will ditch my haste item and replace it with a better stat item and turn on tribute haste.<br />
<br />
Some bard songs (not all) stacks with casted haste and casted haste always stacks with worn haste up to the cap (100%, some bard songs allow exceeding this cap) and cast haste will stack with worn haste (which tribute haste is considered).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tribute haste is item haste. Item haste does not stack, only the highest value will take. It will stack with casted haste (clicky/proc/shaman/enchanter/beasty/bard) up to 100%. Most bard songs are casted haste and follow the same rules as normal. However, Bards do have special songs that they can use that will stack, giving you over-haste (&gt;100%). You are wasting money with your tribute haste (26%) being lower that your already worn haste (36%).</div></div><hr />

No. Tribute = item.<br />
Second, spell haste (Chanter, Shammy, BST) stacks with Worn and Tribute to a max 100% right?<br />
Right.  You get one item haste and one spell haste, and they are capped at 100%.<br />
My question is where does Bard haste fit in there? Can you go over 100% with normal bard song haste?<br />
Normal bard songs are the same as spells.  They don't stack with spells, and are capped at 100%.  Example: Warsong of Zek (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3374&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
&quot;Haste v3&quot; bard songs stack with everything, and can take you beyond 100%.  Example: Rizlona's Call Of Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3362&amp;source=Live).<br />
Does Bard haste stack with Tribute haste?<br />
Yes, since tribute = item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hempire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) If the cap for haste is 100% (excuding for now special bard songs which over-haste) how does that get applied to the weapons listed delay?<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that 100% doesn't reduce delay to zero (duh) but rather half the listed delay. (ie delay 20 at 100% haste = delay 10)<br />
<br />
2) Are fractions rounded up, down, or not at all? <br />
<br />
If rounded down then odd number delay weapons aren't any better than the next slower.  Why use a 19 delay when a 20 delay ends up the same after haste?<br />
<br />
3) Is there a minimum delay cap, where a faster weapon at 100% haste does not get any faster.<br />
<br />
I would hope this is below 10, or anything faster than delay 20 would be waste.  I remember reading somewhere that 16 is the fastest delay weapon in the game, though I'm not sure where or when (or what weapon for that matter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1) correct 100pct haste on a 20 delay weapon is essentially like the weapon is a 10 delay weapon.<br />
<br />
2) I doubt there is rounding, at least at the point that it would matter, but I haven't seen any parses that look at that.<br />
<br />
3) there is not a min delay, there is a min time step in your log though (1 second), what happens if you go under this min time step is you start getting multiple rounds in a timestep.  (ie if you got two 4 hit rounds at .5 seconds it would look like you got 8 hits in one round in your log)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is best to think of haste as &quot;more swings&quot; rather than &quot;less delay&quot;.<br />
<br />
Without haste, you are at 100% speed.  When fully hasted, you are at 200% speed.<br />
<br />
Max haste means you swing twice as often.</div></div><hr />

Ahh, ok, I think the &quot;more swings&quot; idea answers my second question as well. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

im pretty sure everything in EQ is rounded down, at least that's what i thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does anybody have a link to something that proves there is a haste cap and what it is?  This came up recently and I realized I have no idea how the conclusion that haste is capped at 100% came from.  I don't doubt that it's true, but I can't think of a post or a parse that proves it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Compendium of Haste Data (http://cloud.prohosting.com/~talone/HasteData.htm#top) <br />
<br />
This is the most accurate listing of haste information I've got.  A bit dated but agree's with all thats been proven as far as i'm aware.  ALthough aside form the caps per level and calcualtion examples not sure if it has what your looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cujomatifc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=9&amp;ForumID=132<br />
<br />
I wrote this pre-tribute. My understanding is  that tribute is 'worn' haste so whatever is higher, your worn haste or the current amount of purchased tribute haste takes effect.<br />
<br />
The haste compendium is pretty old. I believe mine to be more up to date and to correctly explain (not CLEARLY by any means, just correctly) what bard hastes do, the compendium is a little inaccurate on that score.<br />
<br />
The current bard 'cap busting' stacking haste songs are the vah shir/rizlona/muse/trusik songs. These can put you over the 100% haste cap by 15/25/30% depending on how much v0,v1,v2 haste you already have (the total of those three can't give you more than 100 post lvl 60, though.)<br />
<br />
ie. if you have 47% worn (lucky dog), 70% chanter cast haste, you are at the 100 cap. If the bard sings Warsong of the Vah Shir, you get 25% added to the 100 cap for 125% total (not the 47+70+25 you'd hope for).<br />
<br />
This information is not warrented in any way, use or quote at your own risk......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I confirmed for myself by logging a few LDoN runs that Tribute haste in fact DOES NOT stack with Worn Haste.  Exact same DPS whether tribute was on or not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Has there ever been any hints by developers that there might be different haste caps for different classes or even a haste cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>cujomatifc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't know about the dev's acknowldging the haste cap.<br />
<br />
The data I saw was from parsings, with a haste cap of 90 at lvl fifty, scaling to 100 at sixty. I believe it hinted at lower haste caps below 50.  The info as to types of haste was derived from raw Lucy data....and it was noted that hastes of the same 'v type' did not stack.<br />
<br />
I have not seen or done any parsings of berzerker battlecrys. It is apparently handled differently than spell/item haste (ie. like the monk 'hundred hands' effect), so my guess is (and what I have read says)  it stacks with the spell/item haste, tho what net % outcome is I don't know.<br />
<br />
***Edit*** that should read that it &quot;should&quot; stack with other hastes when fixed...the haste component of the war cry series is currently 'broken' and fixing it appears near the top of the berzerker top 10 list.</div></div><hr />
