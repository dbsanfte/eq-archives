Epic still has no endurance, vinid bp has zero, warlords arms got +15 (maybe it had it before, but I didn't notice).<br />
<br />
Other than that I didn't notice anything else.</div></div><hr />

There are way too many pure melee items that do NOT have mana on them, and you guys get the shaft.  Common sense isn't so common anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still no endurance on FH or HT Armors, or the Greatstaff of Thunder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">None on Helm of Ralos Zek nor Mithril Boots either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it me or are warrior only items pre-pop excluded from having Endurance?<br />
<br />
Not sure how other pure melee classes are doing with items for pure melee, but does it seem odd that Hybrid classes can get mana on items pre-pop but endurance is not? I mean...I am sure there are hybrid only items pre-pop with mana on them - why can't there be pure melee items pre-pop with endurance?<br />
<br />
I'm interested in knowing SOE's logic in this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I don't think we'll be seeing is END added to items that are also wearable by at least one hybrid class and don't have mana on them.  Such items would be Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV, Boots of the Storm, Blade of Carnage, Mithril Boots, Strength of the Elements, Fierce Heraldic armor, Helanic Tundra armor, ect.  They said they would make endurance as accessable as mana for hybrids, and if a hybrid can wear the gear and it doesn't have mana then don't expect endurance on it either.  Also on the warrior epics, if you go back and look at the hybrid epics most don't even have mana, and those that do the hp/mana total adds up to 100 just like our hp total on epics adds to 100, I don't see much of an argument for end on the epics.<br />
<br />
That being said its rediculas that war only items such as HoRZ, Bloodfrenzy, and Greatstaff of Thunder don't have END on them now.  <br />
<br />
- HoRZ should recieve something like 60END to make it similar to the mana values on similar progression items like the White Dragon Helm.<br />
<br />
- Bloodfrenzy should get at least 100END if not 125, all the hybrid weapons dropped from Cursed have anywhere from 75 to 125mana on them, the average being closer to 100.  This argument goes for Khalshazar for rogues as well.  After looking at the Cursed's other drops you can't make a valid argument for these two weapons not having END.<br />
<br />
- Greatstaff of Thunder should get at END equal to its hp, god knows the lower end warriors having to use this weapon to have some kind of agro management while trying to deal with PoP's riposte damage are already giving up enough as it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, Necklace of Eternal Visions . . . . I mean WTF, this thing has mana on it and is warrior usable, I'm hoping the script they used to add END to items just hiccuped on this or something cause this is a blaring contradiction to the statement SoE made about comparing mana and endurance accessability.</div></div><hr />
