<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To counteract the 10,000 or so messages that will soon flood this board asking for 'omg, I'm a warrior, where do I level' gonna just say PoJ now and link them to it every time :D PoJ is THE best exp for a warrior + a CHer from 46 til lvl 60. Maybe throw in some DPS into the mix. Exit camp to 55ish, then the beasts/creatures til u ding 61 :) So THAT my friends is where you level with your solo, duo, trio :D For the record... prisoners at exit camp give 1 blue exp per solo kill reg exp til 51, then it slows down but its still significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoJ does rock for low level duo/trio's. Alot easier for those pre 55 to find a partner here than a group in PoN/PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm...dunno, I'm 61 and I've found nothing better than PoV inner or outer, or BoT for xp. 3% AA per kill roughly and 1% Reg xp.<br />
<br />
You saying that duo Justice is still better than this? Never really hunted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Justice isn't better than the tier 2/3 planes, but your average 46-61 doesn't have access to all those places.  I know as soon as my cleric hits 46 I'll be headed to Justice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rugal Bloodwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoJ slows down alot once you go past 60, unless you go in deep enough. But yea, the exp is really nice solo or in a small group.<br />
And its different from &quot;sit on a zonewall, pull from open field&quot; that is all too common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sanori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok...<br />
<br />
If I have a 52 druid (or 48 cleric) and 52 shaman at my disposal...where should I hunt in PoJ?  I have only been there for trials, so I don't know my way around that well.<br />
<br />
Also, is the AAXP better than 4% per 11 minutes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like PoJ alot.  I pretty much only group with some RL friends and there are usually only 3 or 4 of us.  Exit cell mobs have become LT blue to us so we have been doing the next set of cells (the ones near tunnel to tribunal) but those are rapidly becoming too easy.  They still pretty good AA but reg EXP is not that great.   <br />
<br />
We have been thinking about moving to some of the harder camps, i.e enforcers or the caves.  WOuld appreciate any advice on thse camps.  Group usually consists of me, 59 Druid, 59 Pally and 58 Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay... Sanori &gt;&gt; Enter PoJ, exit GY, go down the stairs, go around (right or left, its a circle) go up the stairs on the backside... then go straight, thru the door and u are facing the cellblock of mobs you want to kill. You want to camp in the 'exit' so go either right or left and its the open doorway either on the right or left dependings... in the back there is a door that when u click on it u zone out... generally you want to camp at the end of one of the sides of exit and pull the 16 mobs, 4 mobs per 4 walls<br />
<br />
Gaylon &gt;&gt; Problem is, you REALLY want a slower in jail/caves. Caves moreso than jail. Jail you can PROBABLY do, but you will want to harmony pull the mobs so you can get htem single. Harmony left, pull right works WONDERS. Assuming you know how to get to jail.. you can either camp outside of the 4 outter mobs or in the right corner (hug right as you enter the second door or u aggro the trap) in the main room in front of the grate (for repop reasons). Caves you want to hug the right side of the room and keep the mobs AWAY from the left wall (or you get aggro). Here too you want to harmony pull. You CAN get them all single, there's just a trick to the second set... there are 2 mobs at the entrance to the cave system, clear those, then there is a larvae on your right, harmony the larvae and then hug the wall to the right of it, you should aggro the next mob and get it single... otherwise pulling the right larvae will bring the two. *IF* you get two ya want your druid or ranger to root one away from the group. The mobs drop pieces for a 20 wis ring which likely your druid friend will want... so in the caves pull to the right. The larvae drop the alkaline stones and the scarabs drop the cloudy eyes. If you have a good mezzer/slower you can move in to the right side...right at the first fork, camp at the second. In summary: Jail is better loot and easier but you get the uber n00bs that have to get to Mavuin trapsing thru every once in a while. Caves is better exp and no one will bother you.<br />
<br />
Also: If you have T2/3 access you probably aren't looking for where to exp :P You know where the kickass exp is :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sanori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Roma I'm sure I know where you're talking about.  Those jail mobs are light blue to me now.  I noticed the ones further in (near the Trials entrance) are blue and scowling. <br />
<br />
In reference to those mobs, how is the xp?  I have a favorite spot that I can solo a mob with shammie assistance and get 4% AA every 10-11 minutes.  But I am always up for a spot that I can take duo/trio and get th same AA and level my toons at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay, my bad, lol. I looked at the level of your partners (52) and pointed you to exit. That level gap IS a problem for ya. You can't do anything lower with them or they will act as a large magnet and attract mobs by the dozen. You might be able to pull it off *if* you only used them to heal you between fights. Otherwise, you might wanna camp at exit and try to level them to 55 so you can move down and take the mobs that you saw that con blue to you. Just turn on your AAs and take it like a man ;) I had to PL my druid from 56 to 58 so she had her CH spell so she could keep up on heals. It might just be easier for you to seek a trials group to get a PoV/S flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sanori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okie I'll head back to my old spot.  I forgot about low-level aggro being such a big issue in the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>farghen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can someone give a quick rundown on faction in POJ?<br />
<br />
Specifically I'm wondoring where the prisoners I can kill that make the guards like me more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Guards are non-KOS. There are 2 factions in PoJ: The Creatures and the Beasts. Creatures are the faction giving racial mobs and the Beasts are the ones that look like zone mobs. Killing Creatures gives positive Beast faction and negative Creature faction. Killing Beats gives positive Creature faction and negative Beast faction. There are a couple quests including the self-PoTorment key that require you to have one of the factions so you can talk to one of the mobs. Other than that, I have found no reason to pick one faction or the other. I just keel em both :D Its toooo easy to fix your faction with one of the groups if you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The HighGuards of Justice are all level 60, and xp on par with PoV. There's a very nice spot with one single and 4 more in a room behind it ( on your way to the Green Mile / Mauvin ). The wonderfull thing is they non-aggro, so your puller can pull 'm right in your camp, and you just tag the one that stays (have to have a SK puller to pull this off). ~2%AA xp with a full group per kill. No faction on them. Drop diamonds, blue diamonds and parchments + cash drops. 13 min spawn, so if you kill fast you can pull some GM mobs. (HG assist on mobs thou so be careful ) I went from 61 to 63 + AA on that camp, then I had enough powa to succeed a trail :)</div></div><hr />
