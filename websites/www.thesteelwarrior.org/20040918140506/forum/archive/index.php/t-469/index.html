<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday League of Guilds planned to try vindi. It was going all good and everything we pull vindi. MA wipes at 70% the SA gets aggo and dies. TA goes in gets aggro and dies. Now the rest of the raid just attacks instead of letting me try. and he knocks us off one by one. we wipe luckily a cleric camped out cleric rezzes clerics and mana sponges then the rest and we see another guild thats gonna go for statue, idol and then AoW. We ask them for another chance at vindi. they say sure but then ANOTHER guild comes in trying to beat them to it. so they pull vindi kill vindi pull statue kill statue pull idol kill idol then pull AoW and kill AoW.<br />
Now they had to do it cause the guilds are arch rivals and of course it was a big bummer to us not having another chance. Luckily they let us roll for the thing on vindi which happened to be a Chestplate of Vindication. Now LoG doesn't have a point system so it's random nbg and of course everyone needed. so we rolled for random 1000 and before rolling i prayed and i got a 981 which was highest. So i got a Vindi breastplate!!!! kinda sad raid but i still was happy. the other thing that dropped was a 17/25 hammer and another warrior got that. then we had like 6 silk 2 chain 1 plate and 1 leather armor drops.<br />
<br />
so BEERS ON ME<br />
<br />
now time to update magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats on your vindi.  Keep going back and learning that encounter with Vindi, he really is fun to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats on the Breastplate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah he seemed fun. i forgot a part. i was getting out and i see their monk. then i notice LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br />
<br />
boy AoW does hurt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Copy Cat! I just got my Vindi BP =P Anyways I am curious, which two guilds were racing and which of em killed vindi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Clan of Shadows vs Sanctus Arcunum then Black Company tried to come in after SA left. and CoS killed them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carnican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats to both, Dobbo and Kendolekk!<br />
<br />
Dobbo, I am happy you got your BP.  :-)  In the world of fairness, Dobbo even belongs to a guild that is in the &quot;Application process&quot;.  <br />
<br />
As one of the council of the League of Guilds, and the raid lead on this, I wanted to publically express the gratitude I feel towards, the members of Sanctus for pushing us (League of Guilds) to higher goals.  And to Clan of Shadows for realizing that Vindi was a big goal for us and that Vindi is a mere speedbump for Idol/AoW.<br />
<br />
There were lots of raiders upset that our target was taken, but the reality was &quot;timing blew chuncks&quot; about the spawning of the Idol.  That was the only part that was outta our control.<br />
<br />
As for CH rotations, that was the first encounter we attempted that needed that type of tactic.  The learning process was the greatest &quot;loot&quot; we actually walked away from Kael posessing.  <br />
<br />
We will be attempting this soon enough, again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats man, vindi bp is generally a HUGE upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gratz.... I just got me a new BP also. /Grins  We wiped the first go at Vindi also but then took him and the Statue on the next attempts. Pathing was very bad on the Statue but we got lucky... Monk died then poof he was right in front of us. Damn bards always singing away...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Congratulations on the awesome breastplate man.<br />
<br />
Wonderful stats, and a quite an adventurous story to go with how it was obtained. That's the fun part of EQ, eh?<br />
<br />
Enjoy it man.<br />
<br />
/toasts Dobbo with the beer he bought me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congratz man hope you enjoy it for along time.<br />
<br />
/em slams the beer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats again Dobbo.  If you guys want vindi just don't try to get him on patch days, you'll always have to deal with 2-3 guilds who want the Statue and AOW.  He's only an 8hour spawn, you can get him almost anyday of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gratz Dobbo,<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to mine.</div></div><hr />
