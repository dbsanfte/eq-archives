<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual quest is probably one of the easiest you'll ever do.  You'll probably finish everything up to camping Heratius Grolden in about 6 to 8 hours.<br />
<br />
Camping the Vampyre tower is where it gets nasty.  Heratius spawns on the balcony to the right if you're looking from the mountain behind or way to the left if you're inside the castle looking at the balcony from within.  He hits for 160's, flurries, has 24k hp, relatively high ac, and lifetaps for 200pts.  He will stay up for roughly 25 minutes after he spawns IF he is not taken out by the top floor named that roams in the process.  Remember, Heratius is a traitor vampyre.  The third floor named (Trix or something) will attack him and the centurion will add.<br />
<br />
Upon Heratius's death spawns Valdanov right smack in the middle of the balcony.  Valdanov is level 62, immune to melee unless it's vampyre bane or undead damage.  He has 48k hp to the dime, which I will tell you how I concluded later on.  He will double for up to 370 and has a random 1k lifetap proc.  He is a necromancer, so he will try to cast dots AND HE WILL FEAR YOU  Overall, he's pretty mean, but once slowed and crippled, even a shaman can keep the MT alive.  Killing Valdanov will require anywhere from 6 to 12 people depending on their abilities.  He really isn't that hard, but he can be without the right mix of people.  Melee will do pathetic damage against this guy cause the weapons that hit him are 10/23 piercers.  <br />
<br />
Now, here's the deal though.  Overall, the quest sounds pretty easy, right?  It is, but camping Heratius can be very time consuming.  I've sat there waiting for him to spawn for 40+ hours so far and expect to put anther 40+ before I see him spawn.  He spawns roughly twice a week at no set pattern and stays up for a very short amount of time when he does.<br />
<br />
Mages, beastlords, and necros are the bane of Valdanov.  He is stunnable.  Just make sure the pet receives the vampyre bane weapons as well, as they will not hit him even with the new PoP weapons that have +3 magic/fire/ice damage to them.  Have the mage use the air pet.  Have the beastlord load his warder's most useful stun.  Have your necro go to town.<br />
<br />
And HP - Because I've camped him for so long, I've gotten a pretty good feeling of how many hp each mob has.  I've noticed that all the named have 12k hp.  Always.  I then started doing the math.  I noticed Centurions have around 3k hp, generals have roughly 6k hp, named have 12k, Heratius Grolden has 24k hp, and I tested Valdanov with a 1k nuke from my mage and it took away 2% of his health.  That would mean Valdanov has 48-50k hp on the spot.  I was wondering too.  People had said anywhere from 40 to 100k.  At least now we know a definite amount.<br />
<br />
=P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the Allakhazam quest guide to it - <br />
<br />

<br />
Scroll down and there's a nice writeup written by one of the Allakhazam members.<br />
<br />
Here's my tip on the pottery requirement.  You don't need any pottery skill for this quest.  Simply find someone who does have the pottery skill and have them make the mold, but don't let them fire it!  The created mold is just LORE, while the final fired product is NODROP.  Have them make the mold, then have them hand it back to you and YOU fire it yourself.  It can be MQ'd, but at least if something goes wrong, the GM's can help you.  GM's won't help out on a failed MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i heard that he gates at low health if u kite him ? can ne1 confirm?<br />
<br />
im thinking of using the bard to kill him, dot kiting, maybe mez to interrupt gate.<br />
<br />
thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's a necromancer, so he'll be casting on you during the duration of the kite.  If you don't get feared, snared, or rooted, then he should be out of mana by the end of the fight and thus, will not gate.<br />
<br />
If he gates, you're fucked.  He CH's himself.  I gritted my teeth yesterday and helped the person who had been camping this while I wasn't on the computer.  Valdanov just ran at 15%.  <br />
<br />
Also, I doubt you'll be able to kite him, though I'm honestly not sure of bard song damage output at the high end.  He has pretty high regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if hes mezzable, ill mez and mana drain till he has nothing.<br />
<br />
bard DPS while kitting can be substancial, I can easily get 75+dps with chants and depending on resists 100dps. again is mezable i can use that to interrupt gate. ill give it a whirl and report backs. bards are a fun alt to play. I can also kite right there on the top floor of the castle, shouldnt gate and i dont care about adds really. just need to stay sharp )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's not mezzable. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy shit dude, I just looked at your magelo.  Save yourself the trouble and simply ask a couple of guildies to help you.  A 65 shaman is more than enough to keep you alive during the Valdanov fight.  Once crippled and slowed, his 1k lifetap really doesn't go off that often (Same procrate as the 200pt lifetap on the other vampyres).  <br />
<br />
I mean, seriously, no offense bud.  A couple of guildies of your calibre will make Valdanov look like a Freeport yard rat.  Don't waste your time attempting to bard kite him, own his ass with 4 or 5 others.  :)<br />
<br />
(Valdanov only has about 48k hp.  His melee is pathetic compaired to what we're used to in PoV+, but he does have pretty high ac.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I may have found a formula to predict when Heratius Grolden's spawns...seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, give up the formula, 8 hrs today no luck, what a drag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50+ hours so far not to mention the 15 that my friend has put in for me. :)<br />
<br />
I've missed Valdanov 3 times now.  He spawned on Monday at 4pm while I was at work.  He then spawned very early Thursday morning at 1:30am that I missed by about a half an hour (another guild got to him).  The 3rd time was when my friend logged in my Magician to watch the balcony for me on Friday morning around 10am.  As he began looking at his spellbook, he was immedietly hit by dots.  He wondered what the heck was going on until until he looked up and saw Valdanov Zefveer standing right in front of him, who proceeded to simply waste my Magician in seconds.  Some necromancer had killed Heratius Grolden about 30 minutes prior and left Valdanov up.  Guessed where my Magician was logged?  <br />
<br />
No ashes yet.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I finished the quest last night.  You won't believe this, but I think I have the formula for Heratius Grolden's potential spawn time.<br />
<br />
****THEORY, NOT TO BE TAKEN AS FACT****<br />
<br />
He spawns once at least every 60 hours.  Within that potential 60 hour timeframe, his chance to spawn is every 3 hours.  My examples to back this up:<br />
<br />
The following are his spawn times for the week:<br />
-Monday ~4pm<br />
-Thursday ~2am <br />
-Friday ~9am<br />
-Saturday ~10pm<br />
<br />
The difference in hours to these spawn times divided by 60 all roughly end up in multiples of 5%, hence why it is my opinion that his chance to spawn is every 3 hours.  Now, before you guys go nailing me to the chalkboard in bad mathematics, these are approximate spawn times that I received mostly by word of mouth.  Heratius will stay up for 25 minutes while Valdanov can stay up for 45 minutes.  Necromancers often solo the castle and even solo Heratius, but will leave Valdanov up because he's simply unsoloable.  Heratius will NOT spawn while Valdanov is up, so that adds roughly an hour discrepancy between the spawn times.<br />
<br />
Now, using this formula and a wildly good guess, I predicted on Friday that Heratius would spawn at roughly 7pm on Saturday evening.  To my suprise, he spawned exactly 3 hours later.<br />
<br />
Wing ding ding ding ding, I think this is a lead to better predicting spawn times for Heratius Grolden so people won't spend the combined 80+ hours into camping him like my friend and I did.  <br />
<br />
I predict Heratius will spawn between 1am and 7am Monday morning next on Druzzil Ro.</div></div><hr />

On one point you made about pottery, I'd like to comment.<br />
<br />
When you try to make it, and fail, you get the piece back so you can keep trying. Go get a few stacks of the other materials and keep at it. You raise your pottery skill and that's a good thing!!  Why?! you say?<br />
<br />
At 122 pottery and ally coldain faction, you can make a thurg gate potion. It's cheap, no drop, and lore. When you get stuck in a place where it's too risky to run out, you have that emergency escape to Thurgadin.  Took me 100pp and a lot of stupid bowls, and time, but it was worth it.<br />

The part where you turn in the figurine of summoning or whatever it is called, you get a Named shade and 3 mini shades to spawn in the caster guild. This is broken and you will get several sets of these mobs. We did this part on Sunday this last weekend and got 9 named Autukar(sp?) and 27 mini shades. Needless to say this was ugly. <br />
tip:<br />
should this happen to you I recommend either kiting the whole mess for a long time and have the group pick and peel ( but be advised the named Autukar shade does cast paralyzing earth) <br />
Or what you can do is train them to the zone to Tenebrous and wait out the despawn of the various additional waves. Once you are down to the last set it is rather easy.<br />
I was able to Tank down the named Shade solo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not get multiples when i did it. I played bard and chant kited them down. was trivial. did this within the last 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up getting 5 shades and 2 lords.  The event is certainly bugged, but the mobs aren't that hard.  The shades won't even bite ya for more than 50ish damage.  The lord will hit you a litle harder, cast necro spells on ya, and has quite a bit more hp, but overall the event was hella trivial when I did it.<br />
<br />
Valdanov, on the other hand, is a different matter.  Dunno Ragnarz.  You could probably solo him if you kept him from casting necro spells on you (mana draining him), but the fact that he has SO many hp and regens rather quickly might make you go out of your mind doing so.<br />
<br />
With a single level group all 65, you could own his arse in 2 minutes flat and be assured of a sweet victory.  Remember, this is a pretty horrid camp.   You *WANT* him dead the first time he pops cause you'll go out of your mind camping him again.</div></div><hr />
