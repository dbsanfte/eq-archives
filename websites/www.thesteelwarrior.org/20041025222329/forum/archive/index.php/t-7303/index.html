<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Endjinne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild's MT's mostly use BoW's or DBotW + EOE.  We usually use A3 augs on all of these.<br />
<br />
Our guildleader suggested that using a shield (SoS or Aegis) as an offhand is Standard for the Main Tank on many of the boss mobs in time and GoD.<br />
<br />
Is this true?  Can the furious bash on these items hold aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Darkblade holds agro, not the Furious Bash. You can hold agro with them provided your setup is all out agro otherwise, such as Planemasters, Raex BP, ect. The shield is just for the AC beefiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Using a shield just means your guild isn't doing as much DPS as they could have.  Some of our people still find a way to get summoned with DBoW + EoE (even with newer weapons don't see one that'd significantly outdo EoE in the offhand for aggro) and all the standard aggro-ness you would expect on the high end.  Granted, very few people actually need that much aggro, so you can probably get away with a shield.  But if your people can push for more DPS just use another weapon and let them do their damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it's a fight where the dps will be switching from the named to adds and back and forth several times during the fight, often you can get enough aggro with dbow/eoe combo to swap a shield in after awhile.  It has situational advantages, but if you need an all out DPS push on a fight, it wouldn't be such a great idea to have the shield up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Start out with the best aggro combo you have and switch in shield once aggro is locked down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EoE has 20ac<br />
JoS has 22ac<br />
<br />
SoS has 85ac<br />
AoE has 75ac<br />
<br />
<br />
If 50AC made enough difference to drop the agro from EoE, then why has noone auged their offhand weapon with AC instead of a proc?<br />
<br />
Your guildleader was wrong. I've never seen a warrior use a shield for anything other than magelo fluffing, or pretending the shield is useful in an effort to justify his magelo fluffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh any AC aug you can aug weapon with you can aug shield with so i dont see your point.<br />
<br />
On Longer fights, a shield can be useful peice of equipment, nature of GoD quick burns downs make them a wise choice, but in Time when fights can get pretty long espcially with low numbers, extra hp/ac/shielding can be more useful then more aggro, depends on your guild/situation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh come on, this is not rocket science.<br />
<br />
Single target fights where the MT is the MA, you are not using a shield. It hurts your entire guild dps, period.<br />
<br />
When I find myself offtanking stuff that hit for thousands per quad and know I will tank this while the guild kills other mobs, do I pick out my shield which gives me: +144ac, +4shielding, and a few dozen hp extra? Damn right I do. Anyone who wouldn't, given the choice, is not right in the head.<br />
<br />
Shield is a situational tool, it helps you tank. It's not for MA, its for survival, especially when you do not have unlimited healers assigned *just* for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A FB shield and a Gnollhide Lariat is teh bomb when tanking Rathe Council,  Demorgoth. Perhaps when you reach such advanced content you'll change your tune ;P.<br />
<br />
Owning a shield and using it ocassionally is one thing, fluffing your Magelo instead of putting it in your bag with other situational equipment is another.<br />

The only situation you might have a point is when your long-term addtanking a high DPS mob that noone else is attacking. Rathe council for example, or possibly the petting zoo event in Qvic. On a regular boss fight when everyone else is attacking with PoTime level DPS/agro, they expect a certain level of agro from me, and a shield simply wouldn't cut it.</div></div><hr />

Furious is your friend, noone will pull aggro off you with a shield.  Then again i never have a problem with shield aggro tanking bosses so really not sure why you have such a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mondion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">grr double post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mondion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think the aggro from a dbow augmented pretty much drives itself.  You can have nothing in your offhand and you'd still have excellent aggro.  I am still getting a feel for my shield, but I can assure its more than a magelo buffer.  I tend to only use my jagged onyx staff in offhand when I'm MA and there is alot of clearing to do in order to be quick to get aggro.  But on mobs where I am first to attack a mob (time mobs) I am very comfortable using a shield.  After a certain point having 2 anger3 augmented weapons is just eye candy though, its nice to see anger3 popping like mad.. but I'd rather have 4% more shielding less riposte and 70 more AC, and still have the mob facing me and only me the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We use shields a lot and very rarely have any problems with aggro.  Did some testing with EoE + Shield and the aggro wasn't that great, but I can imagine it's fine with a DB since, like I said, our tanks rarely lose aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I cant comment about shields but can say 1 thing :<br />
<br />
My GL had  DBoW+A3 &amp; Coirnav+A3 for over 5 months (BP+Saryn Range).<br />
And i often pulled agro off him during fights (BoW+A3+BP+Saryn+CE25).<br />
<br />
And that wasnt during the first 20 secs, more like 40-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Skywiser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A MA's job... first and formost is to stay alive... simple as that.  DPS is a fine thing... one that I leave to the Rogues, Rangers, and others more befitting Their  class.  When I am MA, agro is firmly established after Furious, and if it's a heavy hitting GoD mob I have no problems throwing in the shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shakkha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">damn 2months old post...<br />

<br />
funny to see you know use an ac augged shield according to you magelo ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway always been in favor of shield for tanking mobs, really MT needs to cut the crap about their leet DPS, win or loose of a fight is not based on the MT dps, but rather in his survival.<br />
<br />
With Mastruq an auged DBotW and a shield, you lock aggro on pretty much everything (unless blur-mobs, but that's a special case) so why not having more ac/hp, shielding and less riposte?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Two weapons with anger augs are gunna own a weapon + Shield period atm.  SOE needs to find ways to make shields more important to warriors IMO, by like adding a block AA that gives us a decent chance to block hits totally.  Anyways the only reason I ever use a shield...is to take less reposite damage and the RZ shield had more HP than EOE.  I hardly use a shield now that I replaced my EOE with a Demerix though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dual Wield aggro weaps + FB shield ghetto bash is awesome aggro.  After defensive wears off, shields rule.  No way main + shield aggro could ever touch an aggro procing off hand.  Unless of course that off hand swing causes a riposte hit that kills ya.  then you're fucked.  :eek:  Dead tanks have shit for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It has never been in question whether 2x 1h+A3 has better agro than 1h+shield, that is a given. The point is that a shield adds considerable survivability. Now that we know that shield AC increases your AC softcap it should be a no brainer to swap in a shield once you have locked in agro. If you are not using a shield when offtanking while the raid kills other stuff, you are only making more work for who ever has to heal you.<br />
<br />
Shields are situational, but they are very beneficial for the times you would use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scrabler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I use my SoS as much as I can when I MT. True the DBoTW's agro alone can't touch the agro of using a weapon offhand but once you make enough agro to stay ahead of the raid you don't really need more.  The shielding and AC gain from a shield is worth more than the lost useless agro to me.</div></div><hr />

Choas Cry , anyone know where it drops?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can drop off mob in Qvic who drop Chaos Runes and Inkuta as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Using a shield results you losing Warrior DPS, unless your warriors actually go through the trouble of not using the best weapons while not tanking (and not havintg DBoW or Fleshbiter on main hand hurts survivability too since it's got a huge amount of AC).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mordi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Shields are for knights as far as I'm concerned personally... I don't really care about any possible statistical benefits :P<br />
<br />
Give /shield to the paladins too while you're at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>AragmarBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">all they have to do is make shields able to proc when bash + put an anger 3 aug on it<br />
<br />
--or--<br />
<br />
<br />
Steal another idea from DAoC and put a reverse proc on the shield of anger 3. Such that it has a chance to proc when you are hit.<br />
<br />
The second idea while seemingly less controllable would also keep agro down on SAs since you have to get attacked to get agro from the shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One way they could improve shields IMO is to get rid of the retarded furious bash crap.  Who cares if you're bash is 50%, 60%, or 70% increased in hate?  They could add a new line of worn hate modifier on shields only, that stacks with EoA, so your main hand's aggro proc is enhanced abit, off setting the aggro loss from DPS/proc of off hand, for the price of gaining a better survivality chance.  I'm sure it'd take abit of modifying, but it would certainly make shields a respectable option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
while an interesting idee, it would need, in order to make sence, that we are actually capable of blocking anything with the shield. Otherwise it would be strange to see a piece a woodin our hand procs when we are smached on the head :).<br />
<br />
but yes it would be interesting, it should be suggested on EQ live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">or add Block AAs ! or something yea...!</div></div><hr />

<br />
or what they can do is create a new way of increasing aggro: <br />
there is weapon aggro based on its potential Domage. What not giving to shields a hate based on the potential domage avoided. thus it would be usefull only when being smashed. <br />
explanation with an exemple :<br />
BigTank_01 face BadAss_01 with his weapon and his shield. everytime that BigTank_01 swings his weapon he gets x1 more aggro on BadAss_01.  every time BadAss_01 &quot;swings&quot; at BigTank_01, BigTank_01 gets x2 more aggro on BadAss_01. x1 being the normal hate linked to BigTank_01's weapon, and x2 being y1*mod1 with mod1 being the recouse's hate linked to BigTank_01's shield (based on its AC for exemple) and y1 being the hate linked to  BadAss_01's &quot;weapon&quot;.<br />
<br />
Flaws :<br />
1. we must define mod1 from shield<br />
2. we must define y1 cause mobs don't wield weapon (at best they have one as graphic).<br />
3. why not applaying this way of thinking to all kind of potential domage avoiders (normal AC gears, shielding, avaidance, disc, ...)<br />
4. it would go against the current &quot;def nerf&quot; as it is based on an aggro reduction from potential domage reduction.</div></div><hr />
