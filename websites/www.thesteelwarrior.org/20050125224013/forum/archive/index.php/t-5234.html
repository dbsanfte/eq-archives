<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a ps2 a month or so ago. So far I am not impressed with the games I've tried on it. Mine came bundled with GTA: Vice City which I played on pc and it hurt me just to look at it playing on TV. I've tried so far Onimushu; Tenchu; FFX; Burnout 2; Dynasty War 4; BalGate:DA; Silent Hill;<br />
<br />
Those were not bad, but from what I've read from reviews these are suppose to be the best of the best for ps2 and comparing them with best of PC titles like Baldurs Gate; Hitman; Diablo; Mafia; American McGee's Alice; Dungeon Keeper; Monkey Island games; Fallout series; Giants: Citezen Kabuto; Half Life; Heavy Metal: FAKK2; Icewind Dale; HomeWorld; Neverwinter Nights; BalirWitch games; Septerra Core; Silver; The Longest Journey; Thief; Tropico; StarCraft; as well as countless others that surpass what I found available for PS2. It makes me sad.<br />
<br />
So help me out :) Recomend me something good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Xenosaga, and I've heard Kingdom Hearts is good as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lord of the Rings : Return of the King<br />
<br />
Hands down. Spent endless hours plugging away at that game.<br />
<br />
Bounty Hunter was a trip.<br />
<br />
Medal of Honor was really well done, imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend of mine gave me this list of some good PS2 games. This might help you choose. Kingdom Hearts, Armored core 3, Baldurs gate: dark alliance, Blood omen 2, Suikoden III, Maximo: Ghosts to Glory, Time Splitters 2, Red Faction 2, Splinter Cell, Dark Cloud 2, Silent hill 2, Sky odyssey, Mark of kri, Onimusha 2, Rayman 3, Escape from monkey island, MDK 2 armaggedon, Timesplitters, Tenchu : wrath of heaven, Dark cloud, Kessen, Kessen 2.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd recommend NFS Underground, Splinter Cell and Max Payne 2 as I am playing/played these on PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a curious question:<br />
<br />
Why a PS2? You can play the same games better on the PC, and if you already have a PS2 controller, you can get a USB-PS2 link.<br />
<br />
/cough<br />
<br />
Call of Duty<br />
<br />
/cough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kingdom Hearts is a great game, defiantly a must have.<br />
<br />
Tony Hawks Underground is another good one, if you like mindless sk8terdoodz stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why a PS2? You can play the same games better on the PC, and if you already have a PS2 controller, you can get a USB-PS2 link. <br />
You can't rent PC games. That's the one thing I like about consol games, renting them before buying. If you don't like it, take it back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">because I left my computer when I moved cities and if I move it and set it up in my house again I'll be on computer again as soon as I get back from work. I am trying to acquier other hobbies now. PS is just there when I feel like nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
BTW about Kingdom Hearts isn't it a kids game? I've read about it but seems like its Disney flowery shit for kids or am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are people who only play videogames on a console and use their PC's for work etc. The reason; playing games on a console is relatively cheap, you don't need to upgrade teh damn video card, ever, and every game thats released is guaranteed to work smooth 100%. Good strategy, yes? But I know PC gaming has lot more quality and I just don't feel easy with the little gaming pads I just can't squeeze my fingers onto so I upgraded and got a P4 2.4 ghz with a Geforce FX 5900 last summer hoping that I will have saved myself from the wrath of upgrading for another few years. So far its working great for me as I expected. <br />
<br />
The only game that tempt me to buy a console for is the Tekken and the Soul Edge games. Too bad I could never feel comfortable using a gamepad controller and so I usually get pwn'd by friends playing Tekken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lord of the Rings Return of the King is very good. Also if u enjoy sports games any of the EA stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can get into it, I the latest release in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series (I believe its VII) is excellent.<br />
<br />
Everything else has really been mentioned. Don't get Soul Calibur for PS2, because Heihachi is a little shrimp and Link owns him anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, though I know they're technically PSO games, the re-released Final Fantasy series (Origins, Anthology, and Chronicles) are great pieces of nostalgia.<br />
<br />
Xenosaga only if you can stomach the cut scenes. Pretty game. Long cut scenes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend -<br />
<br />
-Onimusha 1 &amp; 2 (2 moreso as it's much improved)<br />
-Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven (fun stealth/ninja game)<br />
-Metal Gear Solid II Substance (more options than MGSII)<br />
-Ratchet &amp; Clank (fun/silly shoot-em-up)<br />
-Dynasty Warriors IV (best beat-em-up I've ever played)<br />
-NBA Street 2 (like NBA Jam but better)<br />
-Final Fantasy X (still the best RPG on the PS2)<br />
<br />
I recommend Silent Hill and Suikoden only if you've play their respective predecessors. Both make a lot more sense that way. Also, Suikoden III utilizes save files from Suik II, which utilizes save files from Suik I. So yeah, long game =) Suik IV is on its way as well.<br />
<br />
Kingdom Hearts is not an easy/kid's game by any means - there's dark/adult themes throughout. There are however Disney characters everywhere. I suggest you try it out, might surprise ya.<br />
<br />
Talic's right. Just about any of Koei's games are good if you like RTS or fighting.<br />
<br />
That should keep ya busy for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard that, for platform hoppers, Jak II is *really* good as well.<br />
<br />
Lots of support for Kingdom Hearts. Its worth it, especially with a sequel coming out in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jak II is really nice but its to damn short :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so is Kingdom Hearts a kids game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought a PS2 for Tekken and Gran Turismo, and those are still the only games I play on it.<br />
<br />
GTA3 / GTA:VC are both awesome, but thought they were much better on the PC.  Same goes for any FPS type game, while I'd love to sit in the lounge and play them on the TV, PS2 controller has nothing on a mouse for those types of games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casai, I'd go as far as to say Kingdom Hearts is no more sappy than any of the more recent Final Fantasy instances. All around it does a good job of appealing to an older audience, but it does have its frustrating moments.<br />
<br />
'Cause really, who *didn't* want Cloud to kill Goofy?<br />
<br />
Its definitely worth getting, the new sequel looks very impressive (much darker, like Square took a bigger hand in the game's overall layout than they did in the first one) and the first installment was a good romp with a great battle system. Once you get past Goofy and Donald, its a damn fine game. Not great, but good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Talic! I'll check it out.<br />
<br />
Eoden I cant agree more with you. My ps2 came with gta:VC and I just cant bring myself up to playing it after playing through it on PC and forget all FPS games for me too. Its just way too frusturating on the controller for me. Teken and Burnout rock thought :) Looks like you and I like same shit so whats so good about Gran Turismo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Connir</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Baldur's Gate II was realeased yesterday. Wondering if anyone got it and what they think of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Dark Alliance series tears ass.<br />
<br />
Can't believe I forgot about Gran Turismo. It's the most realistic driving simulator out there, perhaps not just on console. It's a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woojed</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I work at Electronic Boutique, and heres the lowdown on good games for the Ps2<br />
<br />
Need for Speed Underground = Best racing game out now. Period<br />
<br />
Manhunt = Goriest and most F$#@ up game ull ever play.<br />
<br />
Final Fantasy X-2 = Way better than X.  Goes back to ol skool.<br />
<br />
NFL Street = Good fun sports game.<br />
<br />
Madden 04 = another good sport game.<br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings, Return of the king = One of the best multi-player/single player game out for adventuring.<br />
<br />
GAMES YOU SHOULD GET WHEN THEY COME OUT<br />
<br />
Champion of Norrath = Already hailed one of the best games of 2004, DO NOT buy Boldors Gate 2, wait for Champions of Norrath, it is SOOO much better.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps bro, I love my ps2 =)<br />
<br />
If anyone else has questions, lemme know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakor</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought DBZ: Budokai 2 a few days ago, and I like it. It's kind of annoying on the Story mode because it takes forever, and some parts are really stupid. Solid fighting game, but it doesn't follow the animation too closely. <br />
<br />
Soul Calibur 1/2 are hands down the best fighting games money can buy. <br />
<br />
If you like racing games, I'd recommend Midnight Club 2 and the street-racing Need for Speed. <br />
<br />
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater: Underground is a very, very fun game. <br />
<br />
Summoner 1 was a solid rpg/hack n'slash. The .dot hack series is also pretty entertaining, but very repetitive. <br />
<br />
Devil May Cry is a fantastic action-packed game, and you can get it for like 20 bucks, so pick it up. Chaos Legion looks promising, but I haven't tried it yet. <br />
<br />
Dynasty Warriors 4 is one of PS2's best games, and the Onimusha series is up there also. <br />
<br />
If you like &quot;mech&quot; type games, Zone of Enders 2 is probably the best one you can get for any system. My friend told me Armored Core series was another insanely cool game also. <br />
<br />
Good thing to do is just go to Electronic Boutique and check out the Used section for PS2. Loads and loads of games for dirt cheap. I have tons of games just lying around from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh ... speaking of Electronics Boutique ... hello from your freindly EBGames salesperson ... and im a gamer too ...<br />

<br />
Devil May Cry (17.99 used, 19.99 new) great hack and slash 3rd person.<br />
<br />
Devil May Cry 2 (17.99 used) Not as good as the first, but looks better.<br />
<br />
True Crime, Streets of LA (44.99 used. 49.99 new)<br />
<br />
Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 2, Came out this week, a must buy, the last Black Isle/Interplay game ever produced. (44.99 used, 49.99 new), they wont be making too many copies.<br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (44.99 used, 49.99 new)<br />
<br />
Final Fantasy X-2 (44.99 used, 49.99 new) Good buy if you liked X<br />
<br />
Soul Calibre 2 (34.99 used, 39.99 new) best fighting game ever made, hands down.<br />
<br />
Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty (9.99 used, 19.99 new) greatest hit title, very very fun game<br />
<br />
Splinter Cell (24.99 used, 29.99 new) i think ... one of the best 3rd person games you can find.<br />
<br />
SOCOM (14.99 used 29.99 with headset used) not worth buying new, as the sequel is out already.<br />
<br />
SOCOM 2 (44.99 used, 49.99 new) SOCOM on crack.<br />
<br />
Tony Hawk 3 and 4 (17.99 used, 19.99 new) both great games, 4 is better than 3.<br />
<br />
Tony Hawk: Undergroud (44.99 used, 49.99 new) plays just like 4, with a few more quirks ... great game as well.<br />
<br />
any of the WWF Smackdown series.  <br />
<br />
Kingdom Hearts (17.99 used, 19.99 new) if your a FF fan, youll like KH, dont be intimidated by the Disney license, its a great RPG.<br />
<br />
Ghost Recon (17.99 used, 19.99 new) if you like war sims, good game, but short. 1st person squad based.<br />
<br />
well, thats all i can think of off the top of my head ... and its in the middle of the night ...<br />
<br />
Oh ... dont forget ... at EBGames ... to pick up your GMR Discount card ... 10% off all used products for 10 months, and a subscription to GMR magazine (games reviews and comming soon) valued at 55.00 shelf value, for only 10 dollars.</div></div><hr />

Got through the first few levels and then said 'fugg it I'm getting the strategy guide' plus you see all the other characters from the FF games, a lot from FFX, but a few from 7 and 8 as well..,, though I have yet to see someone from 9.. but I haven't gone all the way through the game yet</div></div><hr />

I liked FFIX...it was a needed return.<br />
<br />
Soul Calibre 2 (34.99 used, 39.99 new) best fighting game ever made, hands down.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd contest that. <br />
<br />
If you want some fun times, get Capcom Vs SNK 2. Seriously, this game is deep.<br />
<br />
Gogo Iori/Rock/Geese N-Groove!</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW if any Dynasty Warriors fans reading whats the best DW game out of 4 that are out? I think I kinda liked 3 better then 4 beacuse the missions had a lot more variety iirc.<br />
<br />
Baldurs Gate 2 - is it better then first one? BG:DA was not that great I thought. There were very little skills and dungeons were not even random so replay value is a bit lacking.</div></div><hr />

All games that are required to be a complete person.</div></div><hr />

BTW thanks to those who sugested Kingdom Hearts and Xenosaga as well as FF9 awesome games! Beaten all of em now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still a big fan of the entire Need For SPeed games; they all have their fun. NFS3 has a lot of cars i designed myself; right up to the driving and competitiveness of NFS:HP2 is downright fun. I mean fun as in the driver's AI is pretty damn tweaked. For street action for them tuner cars NFS:U is quite fun as well. Well worth paying full price for<br />
<br />
Besides that....the classic Tekken 3, 4 and TTT is awesome for chopem'up fun along with Soul Calibur 2. Awesome fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlckMg</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, since getting a PC I've pretty much restricted my console gaming to racing and tournament fighters...sports are good as well, but uh...they're not my thing. But in the areas where I have an opinion to offer-<br />
<br />
Racing is like everyone said: GT, NFS:U, Midnight Club 2...<br />
Fighters: SC2 is fun and all, but I find VF4Evo to be superior. 2D are still my favorite though...CvS2 and MvC2 both have a special place in my heart ^_^ and the Guilty Gear games are just beautiful to behold.<br />
<br />
Oh and Kingdom Hearts is best of FF + best of Disney = you win. (Final match at the arena is the best, expect to lose a lot hehe)</div></div><hr />

You pussy!<br />
<br />
SC2 owns j00! you just can mastah teh guard break!!111oneone!!<br />
<br />
no really, the fun is in weapons master mode, and then finding someone that also has it, good to have a rival.<br />
<br />
DC 1 and 2, and if you can stand to loose a few pounds get DDR (even tho the songs are old, the PS 1 version is a bit better gameplay wise than DDR max, DDR max is hard!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed Champions of Norrath (CoN) and Baldur's Gate : Dark Alliance 2 (DA2) both.<br />
<br />
However, I wish CoN used DA2's interface and ranged attacks. One of the major failings of CoN is that aiming is pretty damn difficult (unless there's a special method listed in the instruction book, which I didn't get with the rental). With DA2 you had unlimited ammo, and an &quot;aiming&quot; line for firing. With CoN, it's all guesswork.<br />
<br />
However, CoN supports up to 4 players, and has a much higher replayability (since the levels just keep going up). DA2 probably ends when you beat the game, since there's not too much to get, ability wise, once you max out a few key skills on each char.<br />
<br />
Lastly, CoN allows you to play duplicates of the characters - you can have 4 male barbarian warriors if you like. DA2 only allows one copy of each of the 5 pre-named, pre-determined chars to exist at once (thus your pal can't import his awesome favorite necro to your game if you're already playing the necro).<br />

Man, if only these games would meld into one :(</div></div><hr />

it doesnt even measure up to Diablo which spawned this action rpg genre in the first place. The replay value is 0. Not that many skills and no random generated dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baldur's Gate I &amp; II for PC are just different than Diablo - not so constant clicking, more questing/strategery/npc development and interaction. Yah, there are no randomly generated maps, but the core game has ~80 hours of gameplay for even the fastest player. There's a bunch of mods too, lots are excellent. The expansion features mods done by a senior designer, so yeah.<br />
<br />
One complaint about BGII is it's very buggy, gotta patch it but that's easily solved =)</div></div><hr />

Dark Cloud 1 &amp; 2 are both good I think so it's may seem childish but it's fun.  If you like Blood and Gore my god Manhunt fuckin rocks.  Grand Theft Auto 3 is always fun for a good hour or so :p.  I'll play any RPG I love them more than any other platform.</div></div><hr />

SC2 owns j00! you just can mastah teh guard break!!111oneone!!<br />
<br />
no really, the fun is in weapons master mode, and then finding someone that also has it, good to have a rival.<br />
<br />
DC 1 and 2, and if you can stand to loose a few pounds get DDR (even tho the songs are old, the PS 1 version is a bit better gameplay wise than DDR max, DDR max is hard!)  <br />
<br />
Soul Caliber 2 is deep, but 3D fighting isn't in me. CvS2 is just great for me. Can't wait for SNK's take on it ^^;;</div></div><hr />

yah I was talking about BG:DA<br />
the BG games that came out on PC rock and some of the best RPG ever made no doubt.<br />
<br />
BG:DA is a Diablo wanabe. The only thing that BG:DA has done better then Diablo is graphics. The gameplay, re-play value, character development lacking big time. BG:DA can be beaten in under 10 hours on normal/hard mode by someone who just picked up the game and set out to clear every monster on the map. After beating it with 1 character there is no desire to do it again with another. The only thing I really liked about BG:DA is the Gauntlet mode. That was rocking good.</div></div><hr />

BG:DA is a Diablo wanabe...(few good points)  <br />
Well yeah. It's not fair to compare Diablo with DA though, totally different games on different systems. Even the PSOne Diablo has more replay value, but generally you must go multiplayer and backtrack like mad before getting to a good spot.<br />
<br />
Also Ninja...do you play Guilty Gear X2? If not, you should - best 2D fighter out now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gladius . AMAZING game! It's worth buying outright. My only complaints are there aren't enough random weaponry. There is alot to use in the game, but it would be nice to see random weapons enemies would leave behind that would be better than anything store bought. And side quests were sort of lacking.<br />
<br />
Everquest Champion of Norrath Great game. A complete rip off of other games. Namely Diablo 2 and Baldurs Gate DA, but still a fun game. The randomness of the weapons from D2, with the playstyle of BGDA. Well worth renting, if not buying.<br />
<br />
Grant Turismo 3 If you haven't played it yet, you need a slap. This is the best racing game EVER! It is more a racing simulator than a game, and worth every penny. There are no cheats, no codes. It's hard. It's everything a racing game should be! If you need super combos and secret moves to appease your A.D.D. addled bain, this game isn't for you.<br />
<br />
Dynasty Warriors A MUST RENT!!!!!! This game is so much fun, any of them. Although #4 is the latest one, IV for those not roman numerically inclined, they are all a blast! There is also Romance of the 3 Kingdoms and Dynasty Tactics, all of which are based on the same chinese heroes but different playstyles. <br />
<br />
Amoured Core These games are great fun to play. Who doesn't like giant robots duking it out? You can completely customize your mech and duel with your friends. TONNES of weapons to choose from. You can make the light zippy stab you in the back type mechs, or the large hulking kill you in 1 shot type mechs, or anything in between. Huge replay value on this game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dark Cloud - man I find this very boring repetative and having to exit to towns to save sucks balls. Also there is no story and weapon upgrades althought cool are useless so far since I am able to kill normal mobs in 1-2 hits and that super dupper weapon seamed to do jack shit for dmg on the boss mob.<br />
<br />
.Hack -  this is damn awfull game. the equipment system is damn confusing as well as ally AI basicly non existant. Mobs that have ability to kill off entier party by puting them to sleep or some over shit (mele doesnt wake you) paralyzing or whatever. Also considering that those things prety much only can be cured by items and you have some patheticly low amount of them you can carry... Leveling up doesnt really mean much for character power and thats one of the main points of the game as far as I understood. The only good thing is its over quick. I beaten part one in like 7-8 hours thats with a bit of screwing around. Also did I mention that you have to clear whole dungeon before final boss and then there is no save before fight!</div></div><hr />

Dabbled in it a bit, not really a GGX2 fan, but it's got its good parts. I just play CvS2 because it has the most competitors I find.  I ain't doing TOO well though now that I tried to swich up my team to A-Sagat, Sakura, and Iori.<br />
<br />
Guess I should just stick to N-Iori, Rock, and Geese...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's got the Disney stuff going on, but don't let that convince you that it's some sappy kid's game. It's got the best attributes from all of the Square RPG's (even quite a few cameos from FF# characters).<br />
<br />
And, as everything from Squaresoft turns out, it's quite the eye-candy.<br />
<br />
I recommend it.</div></div><hr />

Armored Core 2 - fun lil action/sim game exactly same as mech warrior series on PC. Althought controling it with default PS2 controler is pain in the ass</div></div><hr />
