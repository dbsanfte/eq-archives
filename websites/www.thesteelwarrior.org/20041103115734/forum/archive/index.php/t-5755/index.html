looking to put GBoS in primary with an anger3 proc on it, so i guess i'm really only asking btw the latter 2 of the 3 as per aggro.  i know the OSoW will have better dps, but i was wondering how the proc stands up on aggro vs the CHSD.<br />
<br />
if you had to make a combo out of these 3 weapons .. which 2 would you choose, where would they be (primary vs offhand), and if you dont mind, plz explain why =).<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never used OSoW but I do use the other 2 and I find that CHSD actually better aggro than GBoS, both have angerII augments on them. From what I hear aggro from OSoW is minimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I've never used a CHSD or OSoW but I do use a GBoS and it works pretty dang good for aggro.  Oh well to my point of posting, even w/out exp w/the latter two weapons I would lean towards the CHSD simply because if I recall correctly the proc on OSoW is a DD/ac debuff, so nothing more than a spiffy Frostbringer imo.  So I'm leaning towards the CHSD but keep in mind I've never used either.  Goodluck w/your decision Aka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OSoW is better than &quot;minimal&quot; aggro. The ac reduction of the proc drives mobs wild (frostbringer anyone?) and it is one of the warrior-usable aggro weapons that has a proc rate higher than 2/minute in primary. If I had to chose between my CHSD and OSoW, I'd go for the bigass scimmy every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so nothing more than a spiffy Frostbringer imo <br />
<br />
Is this an insult?<br />
<br />
The frostbringer was the staple warrior weapon for a LONG time.  A spiffy frostbringer would be a giant compliment for any weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use GBoS in Pri and OSow in Sec and it works quite nicely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CaeoenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This was my DW agro setup for quite awhile:<br />
<br />
OSoW/CHSD<br />
<br />
Never had a problem with agro.  In fact the OSoW replaced the CHSD in my primary slot.  Those who question its agro abitility probably haven't used one.  My past experience with a frostbringer are what convinced me to spend the points on the OSoW after I found out the proc was an AC debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, the main competition for frostbringers were things like jade maces and lamentations hehe, but yea for it's day the frostbringer was a great warrior weapon.  I know I used mine for a long time, and I was actually proud of my dual jade maces when I upgraded to the frostbringer :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drachnyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want aggro don't use the Obsidian schimitar of War unless you aug it.. The obsidian shatter proc is not much if any aggro.  However for Dps the OSoW is perfect with the Great blade.  So if you are having trouble with teh aggros switch out the weapons /nod.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Drach, the OSoW proc is pretty good for aggro. To demonstrate how much mobs hate having their AC lowered, go find a bored druid that has even their first ac debuff spell (can't remember what level they get it at). Have the druid chain this spell for like 30 seconds, and then try getting aggro without using taunt. It will take you a while, I assure you. There is a reason the frostbringer was one of the best aggro weapons back in the day, and it wasn't because of the 12/22 ratio.<br />
<br />
I had CHSD/Ichorflow, got the OSoW, and now mainhand it with the CHSD in secondary. In my experience, this is a better, more reliable setup than CHSD/OSoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">CHSD is 450 agro and GBoS is probably somewhere around 450 to 550 agro.  GBoS is better dps though and that gives you more reliable agro in the long run.  So if it was me, I would put GBoS with anger 3 in main hand.  I would put OSoW auged with anger 3 in off hand for maximum dps and more reliable long term agro even though the anger 3 auged CHSD might be better short term agro in off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OSoW easily. better damage, better stats, decent agro for offhand. when i used CHSD i was never really impresses with the agro ability, even tho it was my first real agro weapon. OS or CHSD should be a no brainer. a couple warriors in my last guild uses that combo before they got their BoCs. even with anger2 on either the GB or the OS, they make very good weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As most people have mentioned, the AC debuff aspect of the OSoW is actually a fairly decent agro generator.<br />
<br />
That said, my usual DPS setup (that's right, I have a complete lack of a good two-hander, but that's another story) is a Twin-Blade of Sorrow in Primary and Obsidian Scimitar of War Secondary (because the Twin-Blade proc is next to no agro, so good when I'm not tanking).  Additionally, the proc rate on the OSoW in offhand is extremely low, even with maxxed offensive pre-GoD AAs, so just something to consider when choosing your weapon layout.<br />
<br />
That said, simply by switching them around and putting the OSoW in primary, my agro-lock jumps significantly.  It's still pretty difficult to obtain agro unfortunately, but that's because I lack Anger augs I think.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Might I add, that I don't foresee the OSoW ever outagroing the CHSD, unless you were to Anger 3 Aug the OSoW and do nothing to the CHSD (or can CHSD not take Anger augs?)  Anyway, thought I'd add that because re-reading my post, it sounded sort of like it suggested otherwise.<br />

the proc rate on the OSoW in offhand is extremely low, even with maxxed offensive pre-GoD AAs<br />
<br />
OSoW procs 25% more than just about everything else.  If you put it in your off-hand you'll get ~1.25 procs per minute instead of ~1.  Most people should put OSoW in main hand to get an additional 0.5 procs per minute instead of 0.25 in off-hand.  Sure, the amount of agro from the proc may be less than some other procs, but it is still significant agro and most of the time we're looking for an earlier proc which the OSoW provides.<br />
<br />
The only weapons I'd main hand over OSoW pre-Sol Ro+ are BBotE or Bloodfrenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">you can put anger on a CHSD, but there are better weapons, some easier to obtain, or just drop more commonly. personally, i wouldnt put anger on anything less than 15 damage 20 delay or similar. there are so may weapons floating around at the 15/20 range, that it would be a waste of points to augment someting that's easily upgraded. at least not worth the points for anger3 on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lol shoulda known I'd get burned by Haass (and thanks Haass I deserved it cuz I worshipped my Frosty).  Ok lemme clear that up, Frostbringer was and IMO still is a terrific weapon, but I don't know how it would stack up w/the proc on a CHSD which I did however state in my post I had never used.  I never meant to put down the Frostbringer or the OSoW but I'm not sure how it would stack against a pure hate proc.  Actually you shouldn't be hurting too badly w/either weapon but once againt his is just my personal opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Quest is right. I have OSoW in main and BoC in off, both with AngerIII. <br />
<br />
The OSoW is listed to proc 25percent more often, and I am sure (no parse though) that its inate proc is like 500ish hate give or take 100ish. <br />
<br />
I havn't used the others but given I put the BoC in offhand..... <br />
<br />
<br />
Also OSoW is not highly sought after, I am sure i got it cause they thought it was worthless (heh)....</div></div><hr />
