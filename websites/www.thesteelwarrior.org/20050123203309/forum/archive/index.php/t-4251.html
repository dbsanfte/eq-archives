I have retired my monk and have decided to play a warrior. I took most of the gear and threw it on my war. I was wondering if its bad for a warrior to use padded armor.<br />
<br />
I've been using it for since level 1, and i dont notice anything different in taking damage as the mobs get tougher. I've seen people say that plate takes less damage but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
Ill post a magelo when i get off from work. These office computers cant load magelo.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />

<br />
Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't look at armor &quot;type&quot; ... just look at its stats.<br />
<br />
AC, hit points, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Things like Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves, Spider Fur Belt, Clattering Bone Necklace, Padded Steel Woven Belt, Barbed Dragonscale Boots ... they are all popular items with monks.<br />
<br />
But they are all also very usable warrior items, that I have seen a lot of warriors in their 50s use.<br />
<br />
The BENEFIT you currently have being a warrior is that you can wear all that stuff your monk was wearing, AND you still have access, or rather a CHOICE to wear plate mail armor when it becomes available to you.<br />
<br />
So, in other words, you'll be fine using your monk's old gear. Just upgrade your gear as you normally would have. Everything will work itself out in the end.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, for your level, with that magelo, you're FINE. You're better than fine.<br />
<br />
It'll take you quite a few more levels to obsolete that gear.<br />
<br />
From here on out look at upgrading the lowest AC items first (your blood weave bracer for instance).<br />
<br />
And just take the gear as it comes.<br />
<br />
Though maybe a new offhander would help too. (Let me guess, you had Goranga club on the monk? Heh.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck. You should crack quite a few heads with that setup.</div></div><hr />

If you have an extra few hundred plat, consider replacing your legs, arms, and bracers with more Crustacean.  You can camp it in the bazaar...common drop.</div></div><hr />

No lol. Got rid of that club when he was lvl 55. My monk off hander is his fist. 30/14 i think. I use a corrupted shissar ulak in his primary. 2hb as my main wepon, hardcore mob reposites hurt to much with fast weaps :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow just checked allakhazam.com NICE stamina. i will sell the legs and bracer and get the arms and legs. But my Dex will be low. Any suggestions on what Item I could replace to get more dex?</div></div><hr />

In time, when you need the Dex, you will have it, but dont focus on anything but Stamina, HP and AC for now<br />
<br />
WHen you achieve 1200+ AC, and 245 Stamina Unbuffed, start looking to replace gear based on RAW HP only ... most times, the other goodies will come with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the stamina thing...Yes, reach 245 once you are level 65 and have spent your AAs to raise your caps to 305. Before then, up to level 60 you'll cap at 255, so 205 sta will do you nicely with a Shaman buff from a &lt; 54+ Shaman. Course, then you have to add 5 sta/level 61-65 though.</div></div><hr />
