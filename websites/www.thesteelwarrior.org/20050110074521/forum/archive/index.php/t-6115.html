<br />
this is some kind of real melee changes !<br />
<br />
<br />
you could have expected that some warrior stuff would have now +END on it... such as Helmet of Rallos Zek, vindic/eradic BP, Blade of Carnage,...<br />
<br />
<br />
well, i guess that SoE does not agree with me :/<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks SoE, i'll go claim hybrid stuff to get some more +END items.. f*cktards !</div></div><hr />

Those would be: Re-stating most of the changes made months ago. Nerfing CHoS. And fixing the rec level damage bug (supposedly, havent tested myself)<br />
<br />
But yeah, once you take into consideration the entirety of the &quot;melee part 2&quot; patch, you realize it sucks even more.</div></div><hr />

I guess it's just us high ends that really benifited from the added END to items. I got 2670end on my gear. <br />
<br />
i thought so... i was thinking, maybe be, better/higher level warrior stuf would have more +END...<br />
<br />
after thos thoughts i just stared at my weapons : BoC + SoBW.<br />
BoC = &quot;hard&quot;  to get, raid content (well for my guild it's a raid encounter ^^)<br />
SoBW = farmable with 1 group around 60's<br />
<br />
BoC = 0 END<br />
SoBW = +45 END<br />
<br />
so yes, that's a &quot;melee change II&quot; and not the &quot;melee enhancement II&quot; i was expecting :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exeter</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would also expect that warrior only gear would enjoy the greatest + END changes.<br />
<br />
My 2 handed Ornate blade has +170 Endurance (WAR only)<br />
<br />
On gear that is SK usable - it seems the added endurance bonus is equal to the previous mana bonus the gear had.<br />
<br />
That's a nice benefit for us - it's always been a drag using gear that while warrior usable - has that mana bonus we could never use.  Now it seems +END has been added mirroring that mana bonus.<br />
<br />
Now for some END regen gear :D</div></div><hr />

Makes me wonder what a Necro needs the end for.  Might be a better idea if SoE were to make it equal or 1/2 of the hps a item gives instead of mana.  That way mid to lower end wars get a better boost out of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It must be, because I got around 600 endurance, and I have average gear for a non-uber 65 warrior. I could understand giving you double the average Joe since your other stats are double us, but 4 times as much? You still share the same reset timers as we do. I wonder why there is such a gap.</div></div><hr />

Added more Endurance to existing items.<br />
<br />
Looks like its still in the process</div></div><hr />

Well, what I really hope is that they put it on Tribunal and nothing else, mwuhahahahaha.</div></div><hr />

Necro's need the endurance for jumping!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing what they did for round one of +END was just run a script through the item database and:<br />
<br />
if (item.mana)<br />
   item.end = item.mana;<br />
<br />
I suppose that was just done to get some +END out there, and they will be tweaking as time goes on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blade of Carnage is usable by bards, rangers, paladins and shadow knights and has no mana, so I can see no end there. But Hvy Rubi Girdle and HoRZ are classic warrior only items that need to have +end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Endurance is the same amount as the mana on most gear but there is some warrior only gear with it as well.<br />
<br />
For instance Raex armor (warrior elemental armor) 130 Endurance on it even though no mana on any of it. Raex legs have 140 endurance on them and I assume the BP would have 140 endurance on it to.<br />
<br />
Kizraks legs I had before I got Raex last week had 60 endurance on them even though no mana.<br />
<br />
So, yes End= Mana on items but you can still have Endurance on items with no mana.<br />
<br />
And what Ornate  2h sword is warrior only btw? Are you talking about the one from po fire General (lesser one)?</div></div><hr />
