<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys<br />
<br />
Below I have listed my magelo profile. I have been wondering what is left for me to buy for upgrades in the Bazaar. What I can think of so far is:<br />
<br />
Helmet of Rallos Zek<br />
Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />
Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites<br />
Kizrak's Greaves of Battle<br />
Iron Cog Earring<br />
Tear of the Rainmaker<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79331<br />
<br />
If anyone can think of other buyable upgrades please list them here. Also - how would you prioritize the upgrades so I can help deciding what to go for first?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
<br />
Azahg</div></div><hr />

<br />
just as rare if not more so, and more expensive is <br />
scalecracker<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27949<br />
<br />
kick ass range item and also allow you to replace your CoF with a real back slot item.<br />
<br />
either of those items would cost you a pretty penny so you may want to put in a price range when asking these type of questions:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the suggestions - price is not a big problem but the rarety sure is - never seen either of the 2 items mentioned for sale :-(<br />
<br />
Which of the items upgrades available would you go for first?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm too lazy to look em all up and compare em, but farscale armor might be improvement in some slots aswell, dont see much of it for sale on my server, but since you seem to be in a time guild perhaps some ppl have some laying around or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, Farwater plate is nice - never seen a single piece for sale though :-(<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thulian Visage of horror is what people tell you when they read allakzam for tradeable.<br />
<br />
That item has not dropped in 10 killings of the dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, so I worked my way through the list:<br />
<br />
Helmet of Rallos Zek *Done<br />
Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites *Done<br />
Kizrak's Greaves of Battle *Done<br />
Iron Cog Earring *Done<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle *Done<br />
Tear of the Rainmaker *Decided it was hardly an upgrade to bloodmetal<br />
Crystallized Acid Bracer *Havn't seen one for sale in 2004 yet<br />
Thulian Visage of Horror *Have never seen one for sale<br />
Scalecracker *Have never seen one for sale<br />
Farwater plate armor *Have never seen any pieces for sale<br />
<br />
This leaves me with no other bazaar upgrades?<br />
<br />
I am currently working on getting a decent amount of LDON points - what would you suggest - start adding 40hp augs or replace any of the items with ldon merchant armor?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd swap the kizrak legs out for the royal attendant legs and then put whatever augments you want in it.<br />
<br />
Edit: or just put a 40hp aug in the kizrak's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">edit: NM was looking at wrong magelo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless you have a prayer of getting a Raex's BP any tiime in the near future, I would get the LDoN BP first. Get the 40hp vendor aug for it, then start hitting Tipt for augments, put the 30 hp/end plus either the 30 hp/mana or AoB aug on it to make one kick ass BP for 0 plats. While you are farming Tipt, be sure to get a Bracer of the Heartstriker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68603).<br />
<br />
As for spending more LDoN points, I would start by getting 5x 10ac augs first. Then I would get:<br />
<br />
1 or 2 bracers depending on Tipt drops<br />
arms<br />
booots</div></div><hr />
