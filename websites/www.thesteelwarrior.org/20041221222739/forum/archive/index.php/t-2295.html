my warrior is now almost level 49 and I was wondering how much AC I should have at least so I dont die in the PoP or somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say at least above 1050?  AT LEAST.  I might be wrong but I had 1100 by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1050 sounds like a reasonable number, but rememeber that hp's are more important than AC.  Maybe 2500ish hp's for most tier 1 zones, possibly lower for starting in PoJ.  Those are not hard numbers, playing alts I have seen 2k DE SK's tank fine doing PoN/PoD/PoI trash, but it got hairy at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hah.  Uh, no.<br />
<br />
Back in the day (Right after Velious came out) I was wearing a mix of Cobalt, Indy, and Guardian, which is still better than most of the 49's you see running around today.  My AC was 835 at 50.  Gotta remember that from 42 to 50, you gain 0 AC due to defense, so your AC kinda stagnates in that area.  After 51, it starts climbing up real nice as you've got some chances for good gear upgrades and your defense starts climbing again.  <br />
<br />
You don't need anywhere near 1k ac to do stuff that level 50's do.  There's still plenty of content that people tanked with 700ac before Cobalt came out, and there's no reason to worry about it.  I'm sure you're fine at whatever you're at.</div></div><hr />

Good, cause i only have around 850 because i have still mostly only crafted armor. Everything is too expensive for me right now to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rule of thumb I use is 20 AC/level, which would indeed put you behind the curve. I was too back then. <br />
<br />
If you can I would suggest geting to hate and the arean in Kael.<br />
<br />
Then again I am behind the curve too, only 1246 (?) AC at 63, though I break 1300 comfortable buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pff, silly &quot;curves&quot; based upon ficticious numbers aren't something to worry about.  You've got a major issue from 42 to 50 and that is that you don't gain any defense skills at all, and you're still leveling relatively quickly (Leaves little time to earn plat/loot for upgrades).  You're not gonna gain a whole lot in the way of AC in that area because it's not really economically feasible based upon the good places to level in your 40's. <br />
<br />
By the time you're 60, you should have slowed down the leveling pace enough for your gear to catch up (ie : plenty of time in kael/POG, plenty of time in places like Seb making money off gems, etc).  You can start worrying about AC as you approach 60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Haass I have to say that I came up with my rule of thumb by playing, and noticing I was either tanking well for my level or taking a beating. The break point seems to follow 20/level. <br />
<br />
Will you not be able to tank at less? You will, you just wont have a many hits at min and more at max. The biggest place I noticed this is breaking a1000 AC and the front of Seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on what you're killing really.  You can walk around in the old world at 850 ac at level 50 and you're king of the world.  Move to PoN and get your ass whomped.  Going by your formula, a 65 tank should be at 1300ac, but you couldn't do shit in the elemental planes with 1300ac.  Just because you have X AC doesn't mean you're going to be able to function everywhere as well as you do in some places.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people have rules they made up, but there are just as many exceptions as there are rules.</div></div><hr />

He specifically mentioned PoP, and I still think that 1050 is a good number to shoot for.  He might not make it, but it is a good goal.  Thankfully, if he does start in PoP, PoJ is where he will probably start, and it will not matter as much.  As I mentioned earlier, HP's are far more important then AC, so I would not sweat an Ac goal nearly like I would getting your hp's up.</div></div><hr />

Hm i love that. If you speak with one warrior he tells you AC is the most important thing, if you speak with another he tell you STR is it, and if you talk to a third person he tells you HPs are the most important thing.<br />
Its kinda annoying that many people think about what is important differently. Its not so easy like having a Druid and u put everything you have in Wis gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An average non twinked war will have 850-900 Ac at level 50.<br />
<br />
Should you find yourself here join a guild that does Thurgy armor raids in Kael, like Plate House, and get upgrades. <br />
<br />
I am pretty twinked out since this is my 2nd char but at 50 my AC was 1050ish area and my hps were 3k unbuffed. I have an almost complete set of RZ cultural, some Ogre some Human.<br />
<br />
Having Thurgy gear, which is actually pretty easy to get now a days, will put people just higher than this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trouble is, the proponents of ac and hp are both right. You need both in the long run. But, like Haass said, it all depends on where you're fighting.<br />
<br />
In PoP, an 850 ac tank is probably going to get their ass handed to them, so they need a whole bunch of hp to back them up. On the other hand, if you go to LGuk or OS, you'll probably be just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember feeling quite under ACed for OS at 900, and did not feel I was good at it until I broke 1000 and some of the fron mobs min shifted (so that there were more min than max hits). 850 is good for original, not RoK.</div></div><hr />

haha. Only very stupid druids would do such a thing.<br />
<br />
All classes have to balance various stats, not just warriors. In fact, most classes have more variables then warrior.<br />
<br />
If you think a maxxed wisdom druid is better than one with a mix of wisdom, mana, HP, AC and let us not forget focus effects (which sometimes come on pieces with otherwise sad stats) ... you have fallen for the hype that the only thing every druid is good for is root/rot and quading.<br />

<br />
I know then when I was running 900-950 AC unbuffed I could handle the arena, but I'd get my head kicked in with 1050 AC (~1100 buffed) in PoN.<br />
<br />
If you are DPS, STR is the most important thing.  All the HPs in the world won't save you from a deficient AC - know a paladin then went high HP/low AC and I had a much better survivability with high AC/low HP.<br />
<br />
You have to get a sense for how much AC you need for the content you are doing and maximize HP while keeping HP over that level.  I'd say over 1000 is fine for non-bosses in Velious, 1150 for early boss mob tanking in Velious. 1250 is the Velious softcap.  AC doesn't mean jack in Luclin, and the more the better in PoP - not that I spend a lot of time there, so I don't have a sense of it, but 1175 seems good enough for PoN/PoD/PoI.</div></div><hr />

With that said I have not had too much problem tanking mobs anywhere except in PoD I did need many heals.. prolly to many imo. Other than that though.. as long as the grp was balanced everything was ducky!<br />

Hm sure a druid needs a least 1000 AC... I see Duids tanking all the time.....<br />
Anyway my point was that I know what i must do to make a druid kinda good. <br />
In case of the warrior it seems every player has a different opinion about which stats are the most important ones.</div></div><hr />

That makes me feel better now beause as I said I`m running with 49 still mostly with crafted armor stuff around. But I`m starting to upgrade now as soon as i can afford it. But that will take a while.</div></div><hr />
