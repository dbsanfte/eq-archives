<br />
Nexus Scions(One in Great Divide works great, plus you can work on Coldain/CoV faction when mobs wonder near you)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, he does, but warrior DPS with a bow is not that hot hehe.  I have shot him hundreds of times with a primal bow back in Velious and never even dropped him to 99%.  His regen is more than enough to overcome somebody plinking arrows at him unless it's a trueshot ranger or something :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I found out that trying to find a practice mob is almost impossible, all the old ones don't work anymore, can throw at a Scion for hours and not get a skill up, they guy in Innothule Swamp can't be thrown at, and the guy in Warslik Woods is no longer rooted, so instead I just find a group in OOW somewhere and ask to throw at their mobs for faction and practice. It has worked very well for me as I am getting free faction and getting decent skill ups at the same time.<br />
Thanks for the input though I will keep going this way from now on.</div></div><hr />
