<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, Y'all,<br />
<br />
I've been floundering around a bit lately when trying to decide what slots most need my upgrade efforts. I could use some advice on which 2 slots I should really devote my attention to. My magelo is in the profile on the left side of this page.<br />
<br />
In terms of where I'm coming from: I'm the main tank of a casual guild that fields 8 people on a good night with an average level of 63 or so. I'm also currently the best equipped tank in our guild alliance, so I tend to be the MT on our pick-up raids. At the moment, our targets are fairly modest. We'll be trying Statue of War in the next week or so. Also, I intend to remain at 65th level while helping a number of my guildmates reach 65 (which means places like Proving Grounds are right out...). My group has all expansions, so that isn't an obstacle (except for flags and level considerations).<br />
<br />
Slots that seem particularly weak to me:<br />
BACK --&gt; I've been working on Loyalist Shield for more weeks than I care to remember. I only need Valdanov's ashes to finish up.<br />
CHEST --&gt; If things go well, I could end up with Breastplate of Eradication in the next few days, but assume I don't.<br />
HANDS --&gt; I love the haste on my gauntlets, but the AC is weak.<br />
<br />
I look forward to your input, Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd shoot for the Five 10 A/C augs from Everfrost LDoN's. <br />
Amygdalan's chain mask from Cazic Thule for your face. <br />
Hornspiked shoulder plates from PoN <br />
Keep trying for those ashes.<br />
<br />
All of that would give you a nice A/C and Hp boost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">10 AC augs are 510 from BB, not EF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Either way, the 5 of them cost 2550 LDoN points. <br />
I've currently got 108 banked. <br />
At 51 points per adventure, that's 48 successful adventures' worth of LDoN (on normal setting).<br />
<br />
Wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doh thats right they are from butcherblock. My mistake. It's a long grind but so is everything else in the game. There are the 5 AC ones for less points but i'm not sure which Theme they're from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Those 5 AC are 150 each from EF.<br />
<br />
And true on the grind aspect, Osserkon. I think if I choose the LDoN grind route, I may pick Tak and go for some Royal Attendant gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Latomier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Could someone please take alook at my Magelo and give some advice on what i should upgrade next too..TY...my Stats are off on my Magelo srry...my  Stats right now with only Bo9, Fo7, BSS and Kazad are HP-6772, AC-1300+ and ATK-1200+..i cant remember off hand what my AC and Atk was exact.. :) and thats at lvl 58...i cant wait to get to lvl 70.. :D But like i said i do have a couplse more spots i want to replace and was wanting a few ideas wether Buyable or Questable...TY in advance :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Strength of the elements <br />
<br />
it's an easy shoulder quest and it's 100 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a new OoW cloak out there that you can get on my server for around 60k.  Alot of money, but prices will probably drop since i see alot of them and they are atunable.  The 115 hp are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't get the Amy mask, instead I would get the Flawless Steel Mask from Sirens Grotto.  It has 20 AC and 55 hps, a much better bang for the buck.  Also, I would ditch those gloves for something better.  If you arent going to complete the Loyalist shiled quest, you could get the haste cloak from Hard EF adv.  <br />
<br />
Your BP is not that bad.  Its not the best, but its decent.  That said, the LDoN BP would still be a huge upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps your guild could kill Yelinak and you could get the haste guants.  That would upgrade your gloves and haste in a one fell swoop.  <br />
<br />
I would ditch the helmet you have and get a Helmet of Rallos Zek if possible.  Or Heck, you could do BB advs and buy the 36 percent haste aug, put it in the helmet, and ditch the gloves for something better.<br />

<br />
I concur with this. If you can deal with the grind, hard to go wrong with the BP.</div></div><hr />
