<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zondelfinni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow warriors...<br />
<br />
      I am thinking about taking a group of guildies to kael to work on some champs armor....<br />
<br />
      My question to you nice folks is, exactly how many &quot;intellegent&quot; people do you really need to work over the arena... Slow kills are fine, I just would like to know minimum requirements... From my perspective, if you got a tank, damage dealer, healer and slower, most places are good to go, some slower then others... As of right now we got 60 warrior (me) 60 aa's if that matters, 58 monk, 56 cleric and a 53 shaman... Now I know the shammy could use some more levels lol, but i feel are group can handle allmost anything solo pulled...<br />
<br />
     Once again, I am more interested in your opinion as to which minimum requirements are to hug the wall in arena and attempt to solo pull armor dropping mobs... Not so much worried about my group, cuz we can allways add a rogue or 2... thks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would recommend two groups for kael arena ( I hate slow kills when I am farming ;) ) With some form of charm to handle adds.<br />
<br />
I guess you could do it with nine. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know people have farmed kael with less people however they had vastly better gear/aa and were basically just plat farming.<br />
<br />
Oh BTW this should be in the battlefield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just need a little CC and you'll be fine...bard or enchanter should be sufficent.<br />
<br />
i'd go with 2 groups though just to be safe; when you start pulling the cleric mobs things get a little dicey if you get an add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rogue friend of mine, at level 63, took a 65 shaman bot and was factioning in arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just wanted to toss in my 2 cents worth.  I fought in Kael Arena with myself and my buddy back when our toons were mainly level 50 with one group at the 54ish mark.  We had pretty long fights and a semi tough time in the arena.  We were an odd arangement of 6 warriors, 2 clerics, 1 enchanter, 2 druids, 1 monk.<br />
<br />
Now, I routinely hit the Arena with 6 people tops, usually 5.  My toons are 57 war, 59 enc, 56 clr, 57 dru, 57 nec and sometimes either or both of 55 mnk and 49 shm.  When I bring my shammy along he doesn't cast on anything, simply there to buff everyone else.<br />
<br />
I am able to pull singles in the arena, no problem with the warrior.  The only area I cannot do without a monk is the Kallis &amp; 2 PoZ setup.  I cannot pacify them as of yet, I think at level 62 the enc pacify type spell works, not 100% certain.  I have not needed to pacify anyone else, except when breaking into the arena.  I can fight 2 mobs at the same time, but prefer to pacify and single pull.<br />
<br />
Here is some data from my last kael raid (my toons leveled and I brought 58war,61enc,58nec,59clr,49shm for this raid), with the number of mobs killed and what they dropped.  This is a semi-typical 'raid' considering the number of armor drops.  However, I have had raids this long with zero drops, so keep that in mind.  My single group can clear left and right sides of the arena and if another group breaks/clears kallis &amp; friends, I pull the two other giants in the alcoves, all before the arena starts to repop.  If you bring two groups then you should be pulling the insides of the arena area and maybe even some from the temple area.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also need to start killing in Kael for faction and armor drops ...<br />
<br />
Is the Arena the only place where armor drops?  The &quot;Bank&quot; also seems to be a popular camp spot ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well,<br />
<br />
The arena is a decent spot, plus if you move into the temple area the drop rate increases.  The bank is the normal 'solo' / mini group area.  It can be done solo or perhaps just two people, depending on class &amp; levels.  The drop rate on the bank is nowhere near as good as the arena, but it beats not getting drops.<br />
<br />
The other popular spot is the Plate House aka Icehouse (i believe) depending on your server.  It is basically a cycle you start by chatting to a dwarf in the house (he's part of the coldain ring quest, if memory serves me).  You basically get mobs spawning and as you kill one another spawns.  I believe it is six waves of mobs, each wave getting harder and harder.  You can also evac out and restart the cycle if it gets too hard.  It has been a long time since I've done it so I'm hazy.  But searching on Plate House / Icehouse should get you the details.  I did a long post on the old message board, be dammed if I can remember all the details.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My usual trio is 57 War, 62 Cleric, 62 Necro we handle arena just fine.  And have been doing arena since I was 55 and the Cleric was 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The 4 people you have listed are fine for the arena.<br />
<br />
The shaman will have trouble slowing a couple of types of mobs, but it will be entirely doable.<br />
<br />
Of course, i'm basing this upon the fact that i'm a 60 warrior with around 60 aa's...however I don't need champs.  If you're in a position where your gear is severly lacking, you may wanna wait until the shaman can slow everything.<br />
<br />
I can duo the arena with my toons if I want, I just have no reason to at this point.  4 people is plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zerar_Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is a druid/monk combo im my guild that duo's the arena and plate cycle areas to farm MQ items for lower level guildie alts and some cash. I spent a little time there myself and got a few pieces, which sadly some I still wear. (boots) .... never mind the fact that I have a belt, and a bracer with more AC.... but that's besides the point. Champion's pieces aren't too bad, but I think that if you have a good force... like your 4, you should be able to handle the arena with just the 4 of you. Worst comes to worst... and you can just ghetto mez (read: root) the adds, and pick them off one at a time. An enc. would be a nice addition to that group, and mana regen, real mezzes, and possiable charms would do wonders for that combo.... just my 2cp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jonnas Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kael arena is really trivial these days. Last time i did it, we had 57 warrior (me, decently equipped) 55 SK, 56 cleric, 53 shammy, and did fine. kills are kinda slow, but it's easy and good for those who need faction. If you have a small group, don't enter the arena, pull to the corner near the ramp. oh, and watch out for adjutants, they are annoying. my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Corroded Breastplate x 1<br />
<br />
was that plate or chain?<br />
<br />
anyways yeah it's definately possible with 4.  will be hard but possible and expect slow kills and alot of crap drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like everyone else said, you can do Kael Arena with four or five.  I've done it with 5, no one higher than 60, no problems at all, and that was pulling right inside Arena, none of this down the ramp crap.<br />
<br />
That said, it's a little easier with a chanter (or maybe a bard) along.  If you're pulling inside Arena, unless you are very careful about the spawn timer, you're going to get an add now and then.  Charming the add is really the easiest way to handle it.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I'm beginning to think that plate BPs from Kael are some kind of myth.  I have spent a triple digit number of hours in Kael, and I've never once seen a plate BP drop, or a silk robe either for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It took almost 2 years of on and off kael farming for my regular group to finally get their BP's, but they all fell in a pretty quick amount of time (like, within 2 or 3 months)....Plate BP, Plate BP, Chain BP, Leather BP and Silk Robe for my necro.<br />
<br />
That being said, I would really get your arses to 60, and give TOV a try if all you're missing is BP's.  We've spent 1/10 of the time in TOV as in Kael and pretty much all we're missing is 2 plate BP's for the same group.  You can do TOV with 1 group of 60's too, no matter how much the pansy 'raid guilds' say otherwise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Corroded breastplate is always plate armor.  The chain armor says corroded chain in the description.<br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of chain armor drop in Kael the numerous 'raids' I've done there.  The plate gauntlets are pretty common, while the breastplates I've only managed 2 so far.  I think I've managed to get 2 full sets of chain in the same number of raids.  About 1.5 full sets of plate armor as well.<br />
<br />
I have seen 3 pieces of leather armor and perhaps twice as many silk pieces drop.  I wish more leather would drop, hell, I'd go for a silk chest piece as well.<br />
<br />
If you need plate armor badly, I'd give the plate house a shot (aka ice house).  I haven't done that many cycles, but I know way back it used to drop a ton of plate.  I suppose by now the drop rate is much lower, but considering the level of the mobs in the waves your odds of getting drops should be good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">drop rate in the arena is simply horrid, i wish i knew HoT in tov wasnt that hard before i farmed the fool out of the arena. <br />
<br />
Halls of  testing can be done by a group of 60s, 2-3 groups makes it less tedious and drop rate is 10x that of kael with better ac/stats. well worth your time if possible to round of some ppl and give it a go. it takes some learning, but not too bad. <br />
<br />
1. without a 60 shaman or mage to malo with, i wouldnt bother though. just too hard to land slows.<br />
<br />
2. dont drag corpses in front of the door UNLESS its your own corpse.<br />
<br />
3. its possible to get singles the whole time, just takes a little practice on the break.<br />
<br />
you can duo arena anyday you can get a cleric, ToD or something helps, but not even absolutely necessary. group you listed is fine, but if you can round up the ppl for tov, its so much better. do a few /w all &lt;whatever class you are missing&gt; and see if you can make it happen. wont be able everyday im sure, but should a few times.<br />
<br />
heres a link going over the basics from the old board<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did it with one Group I hear with PoP it is Duoable but i not sure<br />
<br />
Our puller was a 62 chanter LOL he pacified then pulled the warrior went withherechanter would pull he would fire 5 arrows and run back with chanter then turna nd shoot more arrows that usually got aggro then we got  it slowed ASAP <br />
<br />
Basically the key is single Pulls and Slower and Mezzer we cleared whole Arena and had nonstop pulling 60 Warrior was Mt and 56 Shaman was Main slower and we had 3 mnks although none of them even attemtpeted pullign we had ALL single pulls til we gt boad and told chanter to pull all 3 yes 3 PoZ and we killed all of them easy we did this for abotu 4 hours and got 1 plate drop which went immediately to me as MT had SS armor. It is easy Slower and single pulls is the main aspect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">anyone can do single pulls in the arena.  you don't need any special spells or tricks, they all are far enough away to single if you want to.</div></div><hr />
