The problem that I am having is that I can not zone into Vxed due to not having trials 5&amp;6 and the proving grounds since I am not level 70.  Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's my understanding that the only requirement currently is to be lvl 60.  I have not gone yet to confirm this, but others ahve said they can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DRGNUSMC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks.  I seem to have been misinformed on the zoning issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't really MQ any of it, well maybe some parts but most you have to be at that stage of progression to loot the pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anybody 60+ can get into Vxed.  No trials are required (and vxed itself is actually trial 5...it wouldnt make sense to require trial 5 and 6 to do trial 5)<br />
<br />
I know you can zone into MPG at 65.  I'm not sure if a 64 can or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DRGNUSMC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">k guessing I need to get to 65 then for MPG.  Great</div></div><hr />

First, none of the 1.5 quests (all epic for that matter) are MQ'ble. Primarily this is because you have several pieces cannot  be looted unless you have reached that point in the quest. The other reason is that Korbuk won't talk to other classes and returns the items they turn in. so you have to loot all items.<br />
<br />
Second, if you are unable to zone into Vexxd you need to get someone who can to get the event. They can piggy back you into the event.<br />
<br />
However, before that you have to realize that the quest code is set up that you do everything in order. I assume because you haven't done step 5&amp;6 you don't need to go to Vxxed because Blackfall won't be up even if your group could zone in. And besides, if he did spawn and you killed him you couldn't loot the item.<br />
<br />
Third, you don't need to be level 70 to get into MPG. The zone level restriction only applies to Riftseekers zone and that is level 69 so far in this expansion.<br />
<br />
They, SOE, set this quest up pretty well (except for somethings I'll discuss another time). You have to do everthing in order. So don't try to take short cuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also Korbuk will not take one,2, or 3 items if he needs mroe you have to hand em all in at once. or they get returned to sender</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DRGNUSMC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">k Thank you all for clearing that up for me.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure?  I thought that in order to get the correct instance with the Borer, the warrior had to begin the event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You also do realize the epic 1.5 has a required level of 65, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Knive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone can get the expedition, as long as the warrior has the correct flag the borers will be up. Can confirm personally, druid friend got expedition and they were all up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tellis_Maelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Are you sure?  I thought that in order to get the correct instance with the Borer, the warrior had to begin the event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knive pegged it. SOE wasn't that anal to make it a requirement that only the warrior with the flag for that part of the quest could get the event.<br />
<br />
However, I do believe that before your group mate gets the event, the warrior needs to be in the group. This would take several iterations to prove/disprove and it's just easier to not worry about it. <br />
<br />
I wasn't first to zone in but our monk shouted inc as soon as I zoned in, fd'd at my feet  while letting it chew on me a bit.<br />
<br />
As a funny note, our enchanter charmed a mephit and we used that thru the second Blackfall Borer. As we were starting back (some repop) one of the ukun's ran (Selo's+ speed). The pet chased after it. We we ended up evac'ng to inzone and dragging a party member. The funny part was that the enchanter no longer had the mephit as a pet (she died in back wash) but while we were med'ng after cr the old pet and that ukun kept running back and forth (from unkun spawn point to inzone and back). The Ukun fleeing and the Mephit in hot pursuit. This went on until we rooted the ukun on the way by. But I digress.<br />
<br />
The most important thing about this part of the quest is that you, the warrior, are (is) flagged for the trial.</div></div><hr />

Well it never hurts to start early.  Right?!?</div></div><hr />
