<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My bro recently started a Iksar warrior, I tried to hook him up as much as I could but I forgot a lot of the early game stuff. <br />
<br />
Should I get him some Honed Ykesha's (12/22, no one is selling or making the 12/21 cultural version it seems on TT). He is only 23 now and using 2 Lamentation's and appears to be doing well with that setup.<br />
<br />
Do the Ykesha's proc that early, or is it a level 45 thing?<br />
<br />
Should I just get him a Wurmslayer, I seem to remember people saying that thing should last to level 45 or so.<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about the armor too much right now, he has about 1200HP and I think 600AC already which I guess is pretty good for a 23 warrior. <br />
<br />
Does hate still drop that iksar only armor as much as it used to? I figured he could hang there and loot any rotting armor that no one needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well the figures that were thrown around when compairing WS to other weapons, things like 12/22 were not twink material. Nor will you loose that much DPS as you rocket though the levels by not having a wormy. I have made it (quite happily) to 63 without ever using a wormy.  If you are looking at spending big money I would look at getting a good (or excellent) 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also never used a Wurmslayer, I think I was using Lammies pretty early as well and I did OK :)<br />
<br />
I'll look into a better 2hs when he gets higher, right now he has a Mithril 2 hander for skill ups. I don't have much money to spend on him, personally I think I have done enough for the punk, but its fun twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ain't nothing wrong with a mith 2Her; especially for twink-related purposes. there's not many 31% haste items that sell for under 1000 platinum and the ratio on it ain't &quot;that&quot; bad.<br />
<br />
save the coins for him for when he can use the bigger weapons later in his 50's.....snag him whatever weapons you can that are decent ( them yaks will last to his 60's+ ); keep the mith 2Her; grab him a ketchaka koro mis for 2H blunt skill-ups; some kinda cheap piercer ( shaded dagger should be relatively inexpensive )and just keep at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Shikarii, I figured he would be good with the yaks for a long time. Do you know what level they proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">38 IIRC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">prob the same as the SSoY; 38 would be my guess too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it's 37</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The smithed Yak's proc at 35.<br />
<br />
I have use the Honed blade of the Ykesha 12/22 and the Vengeful(Zek) 12/21 they both proc at 35. not 37 not 38.  They proc at 35.  I was very excited when it proced at 35 =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats good to hear, he is leveling fairly quickly, and I just found a smith that made 2 Fearful Yaks for him 12/21. As far as we know its a server first :)</div></div><hr />
