my stuff is not the be all / end all but i considering myself doing well atm. i would like to raise my dex and hp some more , without nuke'n my other stats. can any1 give some opinions on what armor i could purchase that would be considered a nice investment in compairison to what i have.<br />
unfortunatly im agnosic, so the diety armor is a no-go. ( continues to kick myself in the ass). i would also like to know of some armor that is no-drop that i could obtain from drops or quest , but within the capabilities of a 55 warr and a 46 cleric. <br />
<br />
<br />
any opinions or suggestions welcome, and as always, thanx ahead of time to the ones that can help out . stay cool every1 . -DoC</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earring of the solstice would be a pretty decent upgrade too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure on exact upgrades but I'd say forget focusing on your dex, and your hp is good for your lvl, the area you're lacking in is AC mainly because you have a lot of chain/leather pieces that while they have good sta/hp lack the AC of plate.</div></div><hr />
