this weapon is nice a HP ratio AC off hand alternative to the EoE and it looks like you borrowed the wand of your enchanter GF ...<br />
I wish not only casters get some cool looking toys with particules effect and so on ... Man please SoE give us some nice looking weapons to weild The Magic Wand from alice really doesn t make it ...<br />
Congratulations delicate wood elves females tho and openly gay male in touch with their feminine side ( i heard that it was too gay for some gay tank gatherings even tho ) !!!!!<br />
 well on the bright side , in HE Illusion with a robe you can easily pretend you re an INT caster and sneak into their Nerd Geeky parties and listen to some high end boring caster stuff you d get a headache from ...<br />
Where are you War Hammers ? axes and swords !cleavers and maces !!! Are SoE guys all playing Wizzies and chanties so much they wants us to dual wield steins and Magic puff Wands soon ? <br />
RARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bought one the other night and I think if I had known what it looked like before hand I would not have wasted the dkp. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh well, guess I can pretend I'm a bard or something now.<br />
<br />
I dyed my armor pink to go with it. :p<br />
<br />
By the way, I am a female wood elf so guess I can get away with it... but I'd prefer something that looked a little more threatening than the tooth fairy's wand myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe they can add a weapon that gives you a limp wrist and a face-slapping movement when you attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also were you saying they were making the staff female only? or we you suggesting only females would want one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think he meant that only Females would want one well because look at it I know I wouldn't be using one :p</div></div><hr />
