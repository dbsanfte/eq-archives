<br />
Can someone give me a good rundown on how the Velious armours work? Basically what I am concerned with is, if I try for one armour, am I making it very difficult to get the others (faction wise)? If that is the case, which set is the better one to get? I've seen the chart comparing armours, but I wanted some outside advice too. I know i am a long way away form this, but I am starting to hunt in Velious, so the questions have been coming to mind.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are three types of Velious armor for Warriors.  Champion's, Myrmidon's, and Warlord's.  Each armor requires a different faction in order to complete the quest involved.  Champion's armor requires good faction with Thurgadin Dwarves,  Myrmidon's requires good faction with Sky Shrine Dragons and Warlord's requires good faction with Kael Giants.<br />
<br />
The quest drops for Champions drops in Kael, in the arena, around the bank, and at the plate house (or ice house as some call it).  The ones for Myrmidon's drop in the Halls of Testing in the Temple of Veeshan and the ones for Warlord's drop in the West Wing of the Temple of Veeshan and uncommonly off the yard trash in the North Wing of the Temple of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
The faction necessary for Champions is only high amiable iirc while for Myrmidon's and Warlord's ally is required.  Since Kael Giants are on the exact opposite faction to both Sky Shrine Dragons and Thurgadin Dwarves, you pretty much will be KOS to Kael Giants to do either Thurgadin or Sky Shrine quests and KOS to either Sky Shrine Dragons and/or Thurgadin Dwarves to do Kael quests.  Gaining ally faction with either the Dragons or the Giants is usually a pretty long involved process, not to be taken lightly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chances are you will start your quest armor collection with Thurg armor. It is the easiest to get and the faction is cake to get. Most people progress from dwarf faction to dragon faction since killing giants gets you both. This means you will upgrade from Champion's to Myrmidon's since it is the path of least resistance.<br />
<br />
Once you have gotten to the point of killing dragons or when your guild decides to no longer be on a particular faction, you might want to replace some pieces of Myrmidon's with Warlord's. Doing the faction switch is not hard, but it is annoying and tedious.<br />
<br />
Also, the cultural armor is a very good alternative in many slots. Unfortunately you are agnostic so you cant wear Fierce Heraldic, so you will be stuck wearing Brellium (dwarven made). While a little harder to find Brellium than FH, the price is usually a bt lower and the stats are still pretty good.<br />
<br />
The best suit of armor will be a mixture of Myrmidon, Warlord, and Brellium in your case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">deity armor is better than either myrm or warlords except the gloves and bp. warlords is better(most slots), but only for tank classes and harder to farm. pretty sure u will go the the myrmidon route unless you can get some deity armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd even go as far as to recommend the champ  --&gt; myrmidon route of armour due to a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. faction work is easiest ( opinions may vary )<br />
2. relative hunting grounds lower level<br />
3. timesinks of faction work not a problem with Thurg/SS<br />
<br />
Warlords Armour arguably is the best of the 3 Velious quested armours for us Warriors; but the faction work, hunting grounds, and travelling to the zones for a casual player or even the semi-dedicated player may be a bit too overwhelming. Although if you make it through the countless armour farms for champs/myrmidon; you'll know what kind of time/dedication is required to go the Giant Faction route and even be theoretically possible to start taking your first steps through ToVN. <br />
<br />
Besides; Dozekar is reason enough to stay CoV aligned for a while if he's an option. Also think Bracer of Benevolence; Draconic Pauldrons, Ability to kill Vindi/Statue/etc. without correcting major faction hits; and even just to roam WW without worrying about the wandering dragons. which later on when the gang is about ready to end the armour farms; you can start whacking them along the way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some other reasons to follow the progression as well as I envision it was intended by the Dev team.  Going Thurg--&gt;Skysrhine--&gt;Kael is a time consuming endeavor but its difficult to go any other route (not impossible, just difficult).<br />
<br />
Kael is easy to start in, mobs are relatively easy compared to the other two alternatives and you work on faction for Dwarves and Dragons at the same time.  By the time you are tired of Kael, your guild will probably have some necessary upgrades for melee and casters to be able to survive in HoT (halls of testing, easiest wing of ToV).  The Dragon faction you recieved up to this point allows you to walk past many mobs that would probably wipe out your groups without the armor you have gotten as well.<br />
<br />
In HoT, people usually get their first dose of the AE reality that will forever play in most high level encounters from then on.   This armor though IMO is the best you will get quest wise from Velious.  Sure the Kael turn in armor is better for tanks but I can get 10 x the amount of casters to go to HoT for SS armor because it is better for them than Kael.  Also, the Kael armor isn't that much better for tanks anyway.<br />
<br />
Kael turn in armor usually happens as a result of farming NTOV/WTOV for named and the items they drop.  Few guilds I would imagine farm it for the sole purpose of farming armor.  One fortunate byproduct of farming WTOV/NTOV for named is that you gain Kromzek faction in the process (needed for the Kael turn in).  Also, the yard trash mobs drop the armor like my plate BP.  But most guilds wouldn't be able to farm NTOV/WTOV without having, the AC/HP/RESISTS/INT/WIS/MANA from the SS or Thurg armor.<br />
<br />
The game has changed some since I was last in TOV, the cultural armor being the most significant IMO.  This may have changed the game significantly as to the progression I am not sure.  But, if I were wearing full cultural I probably wouldn't try to farm the quest armor though either.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, most guilds need some of the Thurgadin armor to survive HOT to get SS armor.  Then they need the SS armor to survive getting the Kael armor (which is a smaller upgrade to melee than Thurg--&gt;SS was).  The faction issue also plays a role in it as well.  Casters generally want SS armor.  To get Kael armor for melee, you hurt your COV faction needed for SS armor.  This caused some major issues in the guild I used to belong to.<br />
<br />
If you check out my profile you will notice I wear one piece from each of the quest armors so I do have an understanding of what it takes to repair faction for them.  Kael wasn't bad when I did it, took me a week or so of soloing in Skyshrine and some in GD for dwarf heads.  I was KOS to Kromriff and Tormax but allied to Kromzek when doing turn in.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my rambling but I hope some of it makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can always kill giants to get ally to drags then kill dorfs to get ally to giants, it's what i'm working on doing now  <br />
<br />
Sounds good in theory, but it doesn't work that way.<br />
<br />
Giant faction is made up of 2 groups...Kromzek and Kromriff.  Kromriff is for the most part, useless.  Kromzek is what all the quest mobs are on for Armor.  Killing dorfs only raises Kromriff, and as such, is useless.  There are quests you can do to raise Kromzek, but IIRC, they has a negative faction hit with CoV.<br />
<br />
So if you're doing that, all you're doing is eliminating dorf for no reason.  I don't belive you can be ally to both dragons and kromzek (IE, able to quest both armor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqin</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been implied but this isn't so much an individual choice but a guild decision.  I used to see a few people shouting in Kael trying to put together pickup groups for plate drops but that was a long time ago. So unless you have some serious bank to purchase MQs you'll need your guildies to get any of Velious armor.<br />
<br />
PS.  If you level in Velks hang onto those gem drops which are needed for the quest armors. I'm kicking myself now because I need some and the bazaar prices are 3x what they should be D'oh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So if you're doing that, all you're doing is eliminating dorf for no reason. I don't belive you can be ally to both dragons and kromzek (IE, able to quest both armor).<br />
<br />
Correct.  The best way to get ally to Kromzek is to kill dragons, lots and lots and lots of dragons.  However, usually by the time you're in a position to be farming the drops for Warlord's, you're killing lots and lots of dragons to do it.  Unfortunately killing dragons does nothing for Kromriff faction, which can make actually doing the quest kind of annoying, since Kromriff giants prowl around and near the path to the Kromzek quest NPC.  So having Kromriff faction is nice to have, because it makes getting to the quest NPC easier, but not required for the actual turn in.  Therefore killing Dwarves doesn't really help much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a guild that is just now starting ToV other then HoT.  We can do HoT all day long, and have used it as a great training ground.  First we went to kael, got thurg armor for most everyone, Vindi BP for main tanks, then headed off to HoT, kicken it around there for a few months, almost completed SS gear for those who need it, and soon will move to other ToV wings.  With the deminished tradeoff between SS and Kael the natural and most common (I would reckon) run is Thurg (very decent compared to most droppable bazaar stuff), SS (about another half better with more raw HP) and finally mixture of Kael, diety and no-drop specific items.  SS and Kael is a piece by piece comparison of which is better, but Kael usually wins out due to AC.  anyhow there are my 2 cents. (definatly look into Draconic Paul and Beno Bracer, DP are so damn good for the effor to get)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got plate greaves in WToV on a raid a few months ago as well as some gloves and bracers.<br />
After playing with my magelo i decided that the loss of significant hp to gain a minor AC boost wasnt worth it to me.<br />
If you really want to work that much on faction then do it, but i'd only consider the warlords bracers and arms 'upgrades'.<br />
Btw. changing between dragons and giants is easy if your guild is doing Sleepers key mobs and Kael named.<br />
Getting coldain/dain faction back if you want to finish ring is a completely different matter.<br />
I was killing a lot of giants on AoW/KT raids to get both factions up again but it still took a lot of time.<br />
Finally got my 8th ring yesterday after being kos to coldain for almost 5 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible to go straight to Westwing armour and can have it's own benefits.  West wing mobs give +Kromzek faction as you gain armour.  Therefore you can go in KOS to Giants, come out Ally *AND* have armour.  As opposed to CoV where you need to kill in kael for faction then kill in HoT for armour.  Or I assume (though never did) to a lesser extent kill Kromrif for Coldain faction then Kromzek for armour.<br />
<br />
Our guild at the time of Vellious release went pretty much straight from Kunark with some BPs (Think we killed trak 10 times before Vellious) and the rest in original Planar armour to West Wing ToV and managed to do it fine.  Just 1-2 complete wipeouts :)  Yes it takes dedication but if anything it's easier to do now then then due to higher levels, better buffs, and the fact that most dragons are permakilled on servers giving the dragon's lair a great pull spot and CR spot.  (Just be aware of when the dragon is due!)<br />
<br />
The real question though becomes is it worthwhile?  Not sure of the caster point of view, but from the Warriors, Heraldric Plate is better then anything in Vellious except for the gloves.  (I went to CoV faction just to get the 90hp HoT gloves.)  <br />
<br />
If you can farm cash instead of farming armour you may find it to be a better time for your guild.  Outfit your guild armourers with lots of blue diamonds from the low end PoP zones and they'll outfit you with armour as good or better then Vellious stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A major issue with WToV tho is if you are KoS CoV getting there is a pain unless you have a non-KoS mage to CoH there.  <br />
<br />
If you are non-KoS CoV you can just run in to HoT and start farming.  Nowadays I constantly see ppl farming HoT, but only see full out raids in NToV and WToV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Went in there with a group of friends a couple of weeks back.<br />
<br />
Group was: <br />
60 Warrior tanking (well equiped a full SoL defensive AAs)<br />
60 Cleric<br />
60 Rogue<br />
62 Beastlord<br />
62 Enchanter<br />
65 Shadow Knight<br />
<br />
We had one unlucky wipe but CR was a breeze there, and got a couple of armour drops so all in all was a good evening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now my next question (kinda along the same line) is: to be in complete fairness for the people I group with (who I expect to help me get any peice of armour I want LOL) which should we do first for these group members: (I know this is out of scope really, but here goes) A Wizard, Druid, and Bard, possible adding a Rogue and an Enchanter.<br />

*politely reminds everyone that even after 3 years of playing this is still my highest level character*<br />

I did Kael Arena with two groups initially.  We had the following:<br />
<br />
6 - Warriors - MT was 55 with frostbringer/wavecrasher and junk armor (cobalt at best, enameled black chestplate and the like).  2 warriors at 53 and the rest 50/51 tops.<br />
2 druids - 1x54 and 1x52.<br />
2 clerics - 1x52 and 1x54.<br />
1 enc - level 55<br />
1 monk - level 52<br />
<br />
We had a decent time in there, killed fairly slowly but we did pretty well.  Pulling two mobs would end up in a wipeout most likely, but we got a lot of singles as the mobs are setup like that in the arena (good spacing).  I would say we cleared about 7 or 8 mobs in a cycle.<br />
<br />
Now I do arena alone with<br />
1 war - 56 with swiftblade of zek/shortblade of lightning, 22AAs adn full thurgadin armor<br />
1 druid - level 55<br />
1 enchanter - level 59<br />
1 cleric - level 58<br />
1 necro - level 57 (amazing damage output on her, the necro make a huge difference for me)<br />
1 shaman - level 48 (casts on nothing, just there for buffing and sucking what little exp you get there)<br />
<br />
I can now clear all single pullable mobs in the arena, so that would be ~10 mobs before respawns (just enough time).  So, yes, the arena is easily doable with a single group.  It works out best if another group camps the other side of the arena and you have a monk so you can pull/split the Kallis trio.  This allows you to get another 2 mobs on the sides and if creative pull Temple area mobs (not for the faint of heart).<br />
<br />
What to get for the intermediate levels?  I would save your pennies and get PP to purchase some cobalt.  The arms and boots are great items and you'll hang on to them for a bit.  Technically, the cobalt arms are better than Thurgadin arms due to the shielding buff (AC wise).  You could also shoot for some Hate raids and try to get armor that way.<br />
<br />
Of course, being level 35, you're pretty low, hehe.  Try hitting Temple of Droga for some fast experience, but you'll need a monk at that level plus a really really solid group.  I think Scarlet Desert was some pretty good exp around that level too.  Not to mention hitting Guk with a good group.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your adventures,<br />
