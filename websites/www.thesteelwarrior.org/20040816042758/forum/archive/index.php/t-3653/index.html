<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DreganMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There seems to be 3 major problems warriors which have been addressed in the forums:<br />
<br />
1. Aggro - SK/Pal can snap aggro, and lock it in rock solid, while maintaining almost completely the same level of hps/mitigation warriors possess.<br />
<br />
2. 2 warriors useless in a group - A second warrior brings nothing to a group but light DPS, and an offtank if you've not got decent/any CC.<br />
<br />
3. Defensive - Over powering when used, negates the worth of any/all other disciplines.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Snap aggro is a SKs job, it's a class defining ability and, IMO,  should not be messed with, so I won't be addressing that here. Which raises the question, what can a warrior bring if he can't taunt as well? Our class defining ability of course, continuous long term mitigation...and more.<br />
<br />
These 3 issues can all be addressed by altering the discipline system. By splitting disciplines into 2 categories, styles and disciplines. <br />
<br />
Disciplines<br />
Fortitude<br />
FellStrike<br />
Mightystrike<br />
Charge<br />
<br />
Styles<br />
Aggressive<br />
Evasive<br />
Defensive<br />
Precision<br />
Fearless<br />
Resistant<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Styles:<br />
<br />
A fighting style would last until that style is changed. Obviously Evasive and Defensive are WAY too powerful to be left unchanged, so defensive down to around 20-25% mitigation and evasive by the same margin. The disciplines can be used at any time however, and share timers. This would allow the warrior a few &quot;fun&quot; little toys to play with, whilst not removing any of their essential abilities.<br />
<br />
The downside of this change is obviously the lack of mitigation MAs now have on raids, and would require all the mobs to be re-tuned. The addition of two additional styles would negate this fact. <br />
<br />
The first additional style would be akin to shield, but would stack with the defensive of a different warrior and absorb the additional percentage required to equal the old defensive amount. (obviously allowing more than a pair of warriors to do this should be prevented)<br />
<br />
The second addition style would be a sort of evasive based shield, working on reflecting the targets blows rather than avoiding them.<br />
<br />
The addition of these abilites would require some re-strategizing during raids, but I don't think that's such a bad thing.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Re-Working a Warriors Role<br />
<br />
I think it's time the warrior class progressed from simply being tanks and only tanks into team players, such that they become a value to the group with them other than being able to absorb damage, thus I propose some additional styles which may allow the warrior to fill these roles. The penalty for these styles being active is that their increased mitigation is from defensive, or increased self atk from aggression would not be present.<br />
<br />
Grapple: Get up in the mobs face and tangle with them really close, holding them in position, allowing others to strike the mob with greater accuracy (obviously this use against 'boss' encounters should be somewhat limited)<br />
<br />
Assisted Thrust: An offensive style, focused upon a rogue, and allowing our backstabbing little buddies to do increased damage from behind.<br />
<br />
Maybe throw in something to offensively team with monks as well as other warriors.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Upside:<br />
-warriors bring something to groups no one else brings<br />
-tanking stacks, and stacks with SKs/Pals without negating their aggroing abilities<br />
-warriors become team players, not seperate entities to be there and be healed<br />
-no itemization<br />
-SOE won't have to rework encounters, and it wouldn't take them too much work to revamp the discipline system alone.<br />
-gives 2nd/3rd/4th Warriors in raids something to do rather than trying to create auto-follow/attack keys so they don't have to do anything but hit one button<br />
-changes of this type can be adopted by Monk/rogue class also currently suffering imbalance<br />
<br />
Downside:<br />
-need a new interface window for quickly style swapping<br />
-adding in some distancing effects for the new teaming styles and it could make things a little trickier in raids (is this really a bad thing?)<br />

<br />
As much as I like the idea (which I do), I don't think they'd work on the old disciplines.<br />
<br />
Which is sad, since I like our disciplines, to some extent.</div></div><hr />
