<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night during my assasination adventure I was not MT because of a 39 warrior in the group. So, we get to the target and chanter lulls the room. Target is pulled by MT and he engages for about 3 secs and I come in. Then the MT got mezzed(Screaming Terror I think), and the target starts hitting me for 30's-110 a couple times per round. I was dying pretty fast but the cleric saved me and we won. Anyways, that got me thinking that I needed better gear. The MT was hitting for over 100 (he had argent protector). While waiting for missions I farm mammoths and spiders in everfrost and make about 170pp an hour. I was wondering what upgrades I could get within the 1k mark.<br />

My magelo is here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=744031).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check out my Magelo - I am on a low budget like you. I'd suggest looking for Crusty pieces for AC and Sta. Perhaps some of those AC/HP rings, even my Barbed Ringmail was in the 1k range.<br />
<br />
Ciao,<br />

how much did your rings cost you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want to try and add +HP/AC/sta items to increase your tanking ability. The 6AC 65HP rings I have seen as cheap as 350 on Povar, your server prices may vary. Crystal Spider Eyes for face are 8AC and 35HP, have seen for 350 as well. Check out even the lowest level plate class armors in Butcherblock camp. If you're doing a lot of LDoN you might save up for a piece or two if they are Iksar useable as well. Skull Shaped Barbute for head is nice for quite awhile, about 100PP, but again, no idea if Iksar wearable or not. The Barbed Ringmail would be a nice upgrade for you as well. I wore mine until level 55 when I got lucky on a Moktor BP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tree Weave 200-300 pp maybe little more ac more str<br />
1-2 Velium Fire Wedding Ring(s) rest of the 1k<br />
<br />
best thing though. hit the baz. at this lvl you are looking for stats as shammys are not maxing you out.<br />
<br />
most important things to you at this point should be sta, followed by raw hp, then dex.<br />
<br />
what I did when I had 1k or 2k was hit the baz. put in class race and max price would be 1/4 of the money i had. sta would be the limit to stat.<br />
<br />
arrange by stat and start working your way down the list. <br />
<br />
Did this with a buddy of mine that hit 52 and still had 80 sta. upgraded him by 40 sta, 30 str and a buttload of ac and a few raw hp.<br />
<br />
cannot go wrong with doing that.</div></div><hr />
