Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

After we left another guild tried a while but gave up too.<br />
<br />
Some riddles we knew we had the correct answer but even though monky did the right thing we still got &quot;footsteps&quot;. Blargh, definately bugged atm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eitsekur</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had limited success in the past couple weeks getting the door to open. I play an SK so all I have to do is FD before I click and the golems aren't a problem. Generally Yxtta's empty on my server so I can trigger things to my heart's content without getting anyone else killed either.<br />
<br />
From observation, although the &quot;correct&quot; answers don't work at all at the moment, you can still open the door up through brute force methodology. That is, if you keep clicking statues until the golems stop spawning (&quot;The magical aura has faded&quot; when clicking a wrong answer, instead of the spawning message and appearance of golems), and then just click every possible answer for each riddle, you'll eventually get a correct answer. <br />
<br />
For some reason occasionally a statue that didn't work one time will work again if you press it later, so if you press every statue and get no correct answers run the circuit again, and usually on the second or third pass you'll get something. If however you go three or more times around with no correct answers, things are bugged. This has happened to me a few times, especially when the &quot;Of Trushar I am loved the most...&quot; question comes up, but I did manage to get past it last time. I believe that after a certain number of clicks, even after the golem traps have all been disabled, a trap will spawn. It's probably near 50 or 100 incorrect clicks for another trap, but you can spam click wrong answers. After that happened to me last time around, I managed to find a statue that registered as a correct answer, and eventually opened the door up. So, I'd surmise that getting another golem spawn after you've triggered all the initial ones resets the answers, or something strange. It's also possible that the respawn of triggerable traps is based on passage of time, i.e. after 15 minutes or so a trap becomes active to trigger again.<br />
<br />
Once you've got the door open, you could conceivably park a mage (does CoH work in Yxtta?) or a necro (with holgresh beads) inside on the right side of the ledge just past where the ramp folds down, and create a summon or CoH chain to get people inside, although I'll leave the specifics of that sort of operation to others to deduce.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: although the riddle ring is hopelessly bugged with regards to working as intended, it's still possible to open up the door to the primals area, if you're set on getting in there. It'll take you a while though, and if you can't FD or otherwise avoid aggro from golem trap pops it's going to be a major pain.</div></div><hr />
