<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diggums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I took a break from the game for a bit and recently decided to come back.  Only problem is I lost alot of the links I had to all sorts of stuff.  One such link was a link to an equipment list.<br />
<br />
This list was more of an item spreadsheet really.  It was alphabetized by mob name.  Under the mob it would list all the items that it dropped.  Next to each item it would show all the stats etc.  I have not been able to find it anywhere or anything that I find as useful.  I had it imported into a custom spreadsheet that I was able to sort, search etc, make separate lists, print them etc.<br />
<br />
If anyone has seen this or has the link would love to get it again.  If not what equipment lists do the rest of you use?</div></div><hr />
