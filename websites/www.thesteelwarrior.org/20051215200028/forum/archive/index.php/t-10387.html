<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mady</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll ask my question first and then give some background on what I have tried.<br />
<br />
Running a lvl 14 Dark Elf hunter (also have a 13 lvl Orc warrior).<br />
<br />
Is it possible to travel by foot to Stormwind in Elwynn Forest from Menethil Harbor. Stormwind is where I have to go to train in 1h and 2h sword (or at least it's the only place I know of so far).<br />
<br />
I ran the Wet Lands to Ironforge/Dun Morogh but couldn't find a pass through the mountains to the south. Tried to get into Searing Gorge, but gate is locked, and don't have the quest for the key (if I can even do it at this lvl). Went back into Loch Modan to Thelsamar and found my way south into the Badlands, but pretty much got my ass spanked a short way in. <br />
<br />
It irks me that I can't get there and train swords. I can train axes in Ironforge (can fly there now), but I would like to start working on swords. Daggers and staffs are maxed for lvl.<br />
<br />
Enough of my rambling...any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran my 14 Druid from Darnassus to Stormwind before.  Quite tense running through Wetlands...I had to sacrifice a gnome mage at one point to avoid a mob.</div></div><hr />
