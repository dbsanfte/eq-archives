Is it mostly Warrior drops or all kinds of drops? Trying to have some firepower to have my guild go there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most common drops are for the Thurgadin quest armor.  If you can take Vindi, you can get a nice BP for almost any class that can wear it, and some good boots too.  I'm guessing you probably can't do AoW, if you've never really taken your guild to Kael before, but if you can, Statue and AoW both drop some pretty decent goodies.  And don't forget Tormax.  <br />
<br />
Would really help to know what levels/gear your guild has though.....</div></div><hr />

I just am new to the game. I have been playing for 4 months. And dont know how to go about asking them to go on a raid for my own selfish reasons. But as a 54 Warrior I cant go there by myself. And I hear finding a group there is not easy either. But if I ever want to get really good gear then I have to do something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude, just tell them you want to go for some armor.  What is your guild doing now? What is adverage lvl of guild?, How many in guild? Do you plan on doing HoT? If so you cansell them Kael on faction. Also, what server are you on, I am doing faction there and care less who tags along. With a little back ground we could give you better answers. Your guild, according to you, may be past Kael or not yet to Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kremib</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK mostly we are working on Epic Quest raids. We did Plane of Sky this past weekend. got the Mage drop on Island 7. We have Over 100 Members but I would say probably 30 to 40 that are active(Play every week). Almost everyone has a toon in the 50's with a few that are in the 60's. Out MT is a 65 Warrior but outside of him, All the other tanks are in their 50's. I think they have done Kael before and I am not sure if they want to go back or not. I guess I will just post and ask. Are there any other place that are going to drop good armor for Warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With that crew I would find out if they have faction for HoT in TOV. Need faction with COV to do it. Can raise that in Kael. Check the armor link on this site.<br />
<br />
Kael is CHAMPION'S ARMOR<br />
HoT is ARMOR OF THE MYRMIDON<br />
<br />
Can see the difference there.</div></div><hr />

Thurg=Champion's<br />
SS=Myrmie</div></div><hr />

Dude ask about fighting in Kael, I should have told him armor that he would turn in within Kael, NOT.<br />
