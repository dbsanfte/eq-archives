<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tildorf</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does taunt skill work? I’m sure this topic has come up a few times on this board. I have read a number of posts elsewhere attempting to explain how it works. My understanding is that when you get a successful taunt you are “moved” to the top of the aggro list with no aggro points. A friend of mine thinks there has to be aggro points involved or taunt would never work. He says that a successful taunt gives you one more point of aggro than the person currently at the top of the list, thereby placing you at the top of the list. That makes sense somewhat but I’m sure there are other factors involved such as damage, anger procs, spells, proximity, etc. I was hoping someone could shade some light on this question - can someone give me a clear answer?<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

That's why the search feature is nice...  But anyway, taunt moves you to the top of the agro list +1 if it's successful.</div></div><hr />
