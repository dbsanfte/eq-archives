<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MillohEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 60 halfling warrior, looking for some cheap gear upgrades for HP/sta mostly.  Have about 2500pp, plus SS gaunts MQ soon (so can sell/trade SCHW) but will then need another haste item.<br />
<br />
<br />
magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=382005) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cloak of the Maelstrom owns the chetari shield and its around 1k.<br />
<br />
Definetly replace that jagged band with a 6/65 ring. They are cheap.<br />
<br />
Putrid Belt of the rotting Hide runs about 1.5k and owns chitinous belt.<br />
<br />
Might be able to get a clattering bone necklace for 2.5k depending on your server.<br />
<br />
If you have dragon faction get some friends together and do the Draconic Pauldron and Bracers of Benevolence quests. Theyre both easy and give a nice reward for the effort it takes to get em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, since you have limited funds, quests and easy drops are your best friend.<br />
<br />
Like Dalbe said, since you are on SS faction, the Bracer of Benevolence  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1255) and Draconic Pauldrons (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2277) can be done EASILY, like all 3 in a day(matters if the scout is up or not, dunno repop time) Just need a group to do them.<br />
<br />
Also, Veksar for the MANY named that you can farm all at once, especially at the shop keeper camp(i believe this is the one), which drops a very nice haste item called Soulscream belt (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65570)<br />
<br />
Also, in Droga, the king and Overseer(both quite clsoe to each other) drop a nice 1handed combo with nice stats to boot. The <br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62186) and the Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188) are the weapons, both procing nice DD+*STUN* aka GREAT aggro.<br />
<br />
All of these could be EASILY gotten in a week, witht he same group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MillohEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sooooooo.....<br />
<br />
Thanks to your advice, i did some pricing and figuring in the bazaar and on Magelo, and with those quests and some trading, my magelo would look more like this:<br />
<br />
Adjusted magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=382005&amp;alt=112867) <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice all, and if theres still any holes overall, please let me know what else to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, looks MUCH better, gained 700 hp =)<br />
<br />
Also, i would replace that cloak with greater pernicity cloak, obviously later because the price will be lower and it is not as important atm<br />
<br />
Also, the Soulscream belt is nice to camp, 31% haste+10 sta+30 hp is NICE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MillohEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So its advisable to replace the no-stats Cobalt arms and boots with the lower AC enchanted dwarven plate pieces?  <br />
<br />
<br />
The +14sta on the dwarven plate is really nice, and the clicky buffs on the cobalt dont stack with HoS, but losing that AC is painful, at first.<br />
<br />
Thanks Cen for the vote of confidence!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think all looks good.. definitely the +14STA is a must.  IF  you can afford keep the clicky and put it on to click buff then replace with dwarven when ready to go!</div></div><hr />
