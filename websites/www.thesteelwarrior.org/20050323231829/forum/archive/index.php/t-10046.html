<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys, <br />
<br />
Am playing a defensive oriented talent war hit 43 and these are my thoughts if others care to comment.<br />
<br />
A) I've heard all the comments defensive vs offensive, my conclusion is it all depends how your gonna play the game.  If your gonna end up soloing most of the time and tag along pick up instances then ya offensive is the way to go and then respec to defense later on if you wanna raid i guess.  Not sure if Offensive Builds can tank high lvl instances (50+).  I have a semi perma group so it kicks butt to be able to do instance 2~3 lvls higher then us (being defensive) but i gotta say soloing for quest as a defensive tank on the later lvls is just PITA.  Even with a 30+ Dps weapon it just takes forever to kill 40+ mobs *sigh envy offense tanks* defensive tanks rarely die solo (unless they are dumb) but it can take forever to get a quest done.<br />
<br />
B) I have 1 pt in shield block but starting to wonder about the usefullness of the shield block ability.  Yes yes i know about the block+revenge combo, but for those who have done extensive instances that are higher lvl then you or on par have you guys noticed aggro issues?<br />
<br />
My groupmates aren't gimp they are high dps (rogue shaman, mage), basically my issues become aggro related rather then tanking related.  Against instanced boss mobs 2+lvl higher wars cannot hit a barn which forces me to chug a rage potion to start things off with a Sunder right off the bat ( else it can tank a loooooong while) and proceed with a few more sunders before rage and aggro manages well.  I guess what i'm trying to say is there's not enough rage to be able to keep up with shield block in a group situation.<br />
<br />
Even when crawling, it's usually sunders and mainly demo shouts to keep aggro on me and occasionaly using revenge (whenever it pops) along with bash vs casters, and battle shouts etc..  there is nothing more annoying then an early shield block and you lose aggro to your groupmates  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So debating atm if shield disc line is even worth investing atm, with only 18 talent pts remaining there's a lot of hard decision ahead, any views on this?  Did anyone test you Iron will?  I know 15% doesn't sound as much but since i play an orc with the racial mod it would add to 40% wondering if it's justifiable to put 5pts into it.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote just WTF were they thinking with rogues, their ability to dish out dmg vs 2lvl+ higher mobs is just retarded imo.  Heck my rogue friend soloed the first 2 instances of Scarlet lastnight at 45 and got Herod (3rd boss) down to 25% which leads me to believe it will be 'soloable' too in a couple of lvls.  Like talk about imbalance. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, WoW isn't avaiable yet in europe thus I don't now much about the actual field. However when reading the offencive vs defensive thread, I was under the impression that one of the advantage of the off builds is the fast rage-generation. Moreover everybody tends to say that talents aren't game breaking and that a war is still a war no matter the talen he chooses. Thus I wonder why you don't just start the fight under fury stance to build aggro fast (you don't have an off. built thus you on't be has pruductive as the off. builds war however you will stay under fury just to get some rage fast) and then with TM you switch back to def stance with enougth rage to start some revange. Your healer will just have more work at the beginning but everything should be fine after some revange.<br />
So have you tried it ? and do you think it can be a tactic to try ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's an interesting thought Yoda one that i was musing about myself recently, Fury offers the 2 things i use 99% of the time  while crawling in an instanced which is mainly sunder / demo shouts.  Though not sure if it offsets the actual 'taunt' and shield bash vs caster not to mention taking on more dmg.  The ability to hit multi is useless in this case as CC from sheep or sap becomes critical when tackling higher then your lvl instances.  I'll definitely give it a try but i doubt it's more efficient then defensive.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, my problem was not rage generation vs chaff mobs, that i can do just fine, it's the fact though that whatever rage i get gets spent in sunders and demo shouts and ocasional revenge.shieldbash/battle shout etc..  Simply put the 10 rage cost of shield bash is just not effcient in a group setting.  Which questions me about spending further pts into the shield line talent wise.  It works well enough against the boss since you get a little buffer time to get your rage up but in a crawl it's next to useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-19-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use shield block frequently when tanking elites in between sunders, it can really cut down on DPS, especially when combined with Demoralizing Shout.<br />
<br />
Little OT, but:<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen the aggro on Demoralizing Shout? Seems like it does more for aggro now than it used to!</div></div><hr />

My general guide for warrior tanking elite bosses :<br />
+3 - easy<br />
+4 - moderate<br />
+5 - very hard<br />
+6 - incredibly hard<br />
+7 or more - impossible<br />
<br />
My groupmates aren't gimp they are high dps (rogue shaman, mage), basically my issues become aggro related rather then tanking related.

I guess what i'm trying to say is there's not enough rage to be able to keep up with shield block in a group situation.<br />
<br />
As a general rule of thumb, if it hits hard enough to warrant using shield block then having too little rage is the least of your problems. Also note that shield block also provides a small amount of free aggro if you have a shield spike.<br />
<br />
With a boss 2 levels higher you should be having zero problems. If you are in difficulties tell your friends to go easy until you have a few debuffs on the boss. <br />
<br />
Even when crawling, it's usually sunders and mainly demo shouts to keep aggro on me and occasionaly using revenge (whenever it pops) along with bash vs casters, and battle shouts etc..  there is nothing more annoying then an early shield block and you lose aggro to your groupmates  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If you are fighting a single mob and it isn't doing significant damage then shield block is just wasting your time. <br />
<br />
As a random tip, shield bash also provides a very significant amount of aggro on non casters, costs little rage, is instant and doesn't have the irksome twirly animation of sunder 8)  This only gets better with shield discipline and is being buffed even further next patch.<br />
<br />
So debating atm if shield disc line is even worth investing atm, with only 18 talent pts remaining there's a lot of hard decision ahead, any views on this?  Did anyone test you Iron will?

<br />
Shield Discipline - at the moment no. After next patch yes.<br />
<br />
Iron Will - Personal  choice I guess - at 15% I couldn't justify it, but someone more PVP focused than myself might.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you can't solo the first two SM instance bosses (34 and 37 respectively) at 45 I would be very surprised. The main reason you see rogues doing this is that they can sneak past the huge piles of grey con trash mobs to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have a very warped sence of tanking, but consistantly grouping with a pair of hunters who are 3-4 levels higher than me, and seeing there ability to solo, I would say that a defensive build tank is not required in anything I have seen so far. <br />
<br />
Heck I don't even know how you can talk about tanking a boss more than 4 levels above. Taunt is resisted near 100% and I find it impossilble to steal agro off the bear in defensive stance. <br />
<br />
And with the design philosophy I have seen so far, with no class being requried, hunter pet + heal has to be a viable substitute for warriors. (And I am fairly much convinced that non-defensive warrior + hunter pet and a healer can tank anything, provide they can pop agro back and forth.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakan</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did my 5% to pary and +10 to defence and 10% more ac from worn gear and iam working on Last Stand and Improved Taunt other then that its all arms for me even with the changes to ms its still better then going full def unless you are lv 60 and all you do is raid hard shit where a shld is allmost required to live for most of the fights.<br />
<br />
hell ill even list the def talents i picked<br />
 Anticipation - 5/5 points <br />
Improved Bloodrage - 2/2 <br />
Toughness - 5/5<br />
Last Stand - 1/1<br />
Defiance - 5/5<br />
Improved Taunt - 2/2<br />
<br />
Maybe ill change to more def talents at 60 but atm i dont see the need.</div></div><hr />
