<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was woundering how I could upgrade my equipment. When I created the character deity stuff wasn't out at the time so im lame old agnostic. I have about 200k in the bank and could get a lot more if I sold some of my alts gears.  I was thinking of waiting till 55 and buying some ornate but im not too sure if I can afford the good pieces. Please help me...I want the best of out of my character, how can I? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your gonna spend cash in the bazaar try and do it on as many non-ornate pieces as you can. Heavy Rubi Girdle, Crys Acid Bracer, Warlords Gaunts, Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites, Mana Threaded Bracer, etc... Only beef i have with buying ornate is that once you buy it and do the combines its no longer droppable :(. <br />

Get as many droppable upgrades as you can so you can get some cash back when you loot better.</div></div><hr />
