<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so there's threads about this in the other forums for lowbies.<br />
<br />
But my question is, has anyone found a place where you can plevel a War in SolRo/Elementals etc that is better than a normal 6 person exp group in exp per hour, etc???<br />
<br />
I've done testing in BoT, Tactics, PoD, PoV, PoS, and HoH with pleveling myself.  So far the best exp per hour has been in BoT Spad.  This is with a cleric and shaman to plevel with.  I used to get 7% for every kill, this was nerfed though.  Tactics was about 2-7% per kill, really strangely random for the same kills.  Now BoT is like that a bit too, like 3-6% per kill.<br />
<br />
It turns out now that it's faster for me to exp in a group than I can plevel myself (part of the solo nerf and group exp buff).<br />
<br />
Obviously you can't always find a group, but with the changes it still seems like I'm wasting my time when I try to plevel myself.  I've been getting about 1/2 of the exp I got before the nerf.<br />
<br />
Not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, since it's really a nerf on solo classes, which warriors are certainly not part of.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences.</div></div><hr />

(150AA FT15 cleric, 300AA FT15 ench, and me at the time).<br />
Pull , MoK , Tash , Slow , DoT , DoT , DoT , DDench , DDench.<br />
And nuke once in a while with the cleric. (its VERY TIRING)<br />
<br />
The problem is u loose too much time during pulls.<br />
(Duo with a ranger would own, i did it with a rogue)<br />
<br />
Still the XP is godly.<br />
<br />
With Cleric+Shaman you should be able to easily go below 1 AA per 25mins in a full group at castle 1.<br />
<br />
Get 4 DPS class + 1 puller (plate is ideal).<br />
<br />
Have Puller+DPS pretargeted on the shaman.<br />
Use the good old &quot;You Agro you die&quot;.<br />
<br />
And grind away.<br />
The xp should be absolutely godly (dont bother slowing)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand your dilemma.  <br />
<br />
Since the recent group exp upgrade I have found its certainly easier to group up and grind away the hours.  It really is easier on the player, as you don't have so many things going on etc.<br />
<br />
As for the best spot to powerlevel yourself, I think you will find the Field of Gib(sp?) in Fire pretty unbeatable.  If I can stay awake there I remember snagging 13-15% per kill ungrouped, and I don't think that has changed.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there is a way to exceed a full group's exp with the 80% bonus and the divide by 5 instead of 6 deal. Mobs at castle 2 are the highest exp per mob you can get in PoF - solo they are now good for around 14.5% per kill. In a full group of 6, they give a little over 5% per kill. If you go healer/tank + 4 DPS classes you can kill at a very fast rate - even faster than quad kiting. With good groups at castle 2, its not unusual to do an AA in 20 minutes or less.</div></div><hr />

I duo it all the time with just a cleric, its really really easy and the mobs dont have as much hp as the mobs in fire.  <br />
<br />
Plus if more peeps come along you can just add em and speed things up, exp is about the same with 2 peeps as it is with a full group there because you kill so fast with a full group.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Plane of Earth zone in is fast, mobs dont have much hp, its doable easily with 2 peeps, and the zone clicker is right next to ya if things get funky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That pretty much answers the original poster's question about PL'ing.<br />
<br />
Grouping seems to be the better deal these days.<br />
<br />
Same to better XP, much less strain on you, the player keeping the various boxes going at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got to pull which takes time, you got to med .. this also takes time, and you got to kill the mob. Then theres resses, rebuffs, etc etc. If you can do one mob in 2 minutes, its still 30 minutes per AA, and i think 2 minutes per mob (while not impossible) is extremely hard to do. The real number of AA's in a good group is probably closer to 1.5 in an hr at the second castle.</div></div><hr />

The real number of AA's in a good group is probably closer to 1.5 in an hr at the second castle. Just because you can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done. 2+ AA an hour is not hard to do in castle2 with the right group. If you know what you are doing, you can kill everything at tables, all 6 mobs right outside tables, and 4-5 mobs from the AMY area before repops. It takes 18-19 mobs to ding an AA so 19-20 mobs per spawn cycle is plenty to ding every 20 minutes.<br />

<br />
A group that is put together with castle2 in mind (big DPS) can keep a kill rate of a mob every 60 seconds or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal groups can't come close to 2 AAs/hour, by normal I mean you actually have a healer, some number of melees, and classes that aren't focused on just doing damage.</div></div><hr />

The best is a bard+healer and 4 DPS, but we have done SK, Pally, and even all casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2/hr is a decent group, 3/hr is doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well currently I'm getting around 1 per 2 hours... I still need SolRo for Fire, I guess the exp there must be much better than PoE.  I did PoE today for an hour and got about 1/2 an AA, if that... course we had like no DPS... war, pal, cleric, ench, druid... <br />
<br />
In SolRo it's about the same, we kill more mobs, but the exp per kill is much lower (similar to PoV).  Maybe 1 AA per 1-2 hours... this is with 2 mages, rogue, ench (dc pet), war, cleric.<br />
<br />
Still though, I can't get much over 1.5 AA per hour while pleveling, if that anymore... used to be able to get 2-3 AA per hour doing it.<br />
<br />
Problem lately has been getting groups though, there's almost always 5-10 lvl 65 Wars LFG on our server during any sort of 'normal' US playtimes.  Last night there were 11 lvl 65 players LFG, of those 6 were Warriors.  98% of the time the elemental planes are either empty or the 1 exp group there is full.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting.<br />
<br />
You know what's missing from all of those group makeups?<br />
<br />
Yup, you guessed it ... an OVERLORD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought a War in the group was sort of implied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your Warrior<br />
A puller (plate is prefered)<br />
4 random DPS<br />
<br />
+ Shaman (have targeted macro for the 4 others)<br />
+ Cleric (have targeted macro for the 2 plates)<br />
<br />
You wont be able to beat that, exept with a godly C2 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I wasn't specific enough ... replace bard/pally/SK with war or any other class that can live long enough to pull a mob. The original poster wanted to know how to crank out the most AAs possble on his warrior, I told him. Since he is boxing a shaman that apparently does not matter if he gets exp, he can even do 5x DPS + war/sham with the sham outside the group, the exp would be even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The best is a bard+healer and 4 DPS, but we have done SK, Pally, and even all casters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judging by that quote, the presence of a warrior was not implied.<br />
<br />
4 DPS + Bard + Healer = 6 people.<br />
<br />
Unless you counted the warrior as DPS?<br />
<br />
And the phrase &quot;all casters&quot; ... when coming from a caster, led me to believe you were referring to ... well ... an all caster group.<br />
