<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard a rumor from a few people I know that the elemental planes will soon be opened to non-flagged players.  They said SoE do what they did with CoD, PoV, and BoT and make them open to people that meet a certain level requirement.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm wondering if someone has a solid link to some information that I haven't seen about it..... also, if one wants to be time flagged they will no doubt need all the tier 1-3 flags regardless correct?  Thanks for any info~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah rumor is my guess as well.<br />
<br />
Better xp and single groupable opportunities exist in OoW.  EP is out-dated unless you are raiding, and the only benefit it would prove is for all the &quot;wanna-be raid guilds that haven't finished running the pre-EP stuff.<br />
<br />
The drawbacks would outweigh the benefits.  Would be a big slap in the face of all the blokes out there who are just now breaking into EP's after a year or more of flagging and backflagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I'm asking is because this upcoming weekend is the big one for backflagging all of our new members for EP and we need everyone in attendance to kill all the necessary mobs.  People are saying that it won't be needed because they will open EP's soon and we can all raid there anyway........ but our long term goal is Time and to do that we need the smaller tier mobs anyhow.  Thanks for the replies, still looking for a link if it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is probably coming from the new back-flagging quest that SoE is adding on.<br />
CLICK HERE (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=development&amp;message.id=1959&amp;no_redir=true)<br />
**EDIT** forum was deleted, anyways the devs are putting in a quest-based system to recieve flags for players in guilds that have beaten that step in progression manually to ease the pain of backflagging. This apparently will ONLY work if your guild has beaten that step otherwise you wont recieve the flag upon completion of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats impossible. unless they do a check of your character flags vs the guild leaders flags or something similar there is no way (as far as i know) to track which events a guild has done, short of a message board heh. i'm guessing it'll be alt quests which give access/aa/charm like the quests for tactics, cod, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's simple.  Certain mobs drop an item they never dropped before.  (Hopefully semi-rarely).  It might also decide to drop it if there's members in the raid that aren't flagged for that zone.<br />
<br />
The members without the flags loot those items, which allow them to do the backflagging quests ala OoW type quests (can only get the quest or any of the rewards if you have the item).<br />
<br />
Very simple.  As far as I'm aware of, this is how it works in Citadel of Anguish, except perhaps without the quest part.  I dunno about that.</div></div><hr />
