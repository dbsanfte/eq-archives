<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-16-2005, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a little annoyed because I sepnt 6 hours in a BRD group/raid only to lose dreadforge retaliator roll to a Paladin.  It might be a long time til I see that again, being as I only have time to do instance on Sunday and rop rate is good but about 25%, and might have to roll against someone else for it which I always lose.<br />
<br />
So I am looking into alternatives to it that are easily obtainable.  I really want to use sword, especially being human, but there aren;t any good slow blue 2H swords that are obtainable.  Barbarous Blade is good, but I would find myself in same situation as dreadforge.  So I am looking at doing this.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of respeccing for sword spec and picking up a Massacre sword at AH.  It would at least be an upgrade from y Executioner's axe, which I have had since level 43.  Its slow, so it would be good for instant attacks.  I could get it if the strength, and its single attack damage would almost equal a dreadforge's single attack damage, or I could get it of the monkey for at least +.75% to crit and 150 HPs.  I have a lot of strength gear putting me at over 250 strength, so a little loss in str would not be too big a loss.  Since Massacre is really the only good slow 2H sword, I could pick up whatever sword is best at the time and switch to Massacre for instant attacks.  If i cannot get a better sword, I can do the quest for warblade of the caer darrow, giving me a good auto attack sword and a good sword for instant attacks.<br />
<br />
I really am in it just for fun, and if this is not optimal, that is ok.  I do not have time to do instances constantly for better axes and reaper is a ways away too.  With only 3-4 months before I deploy to Iraq again, I think I will do this just for the fun.  And it would give me the freedom to PvP more for the PvP rewards, and not worry about trying to get better weapons.  I will not be the greatest warrior, but the game is about fun anyways and doing 6 hours in BRD just to lose out on a roll and the prospect of having to run it many time its not my idea of fun.  I can just use the swords until I either get reaper some day or a better axe from MC if I ever get to do that and win on a roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-16-2005, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a Blackhand Doomsaw (pole-arm) from Warchief Rend in UBRS. It's performance is almost at par with a reaper. Dreadforge Retaliator is a sweet weapon too. I would go for one of these if I were in your situation. To me +5% to crit is very valuable which a sword spec unfortunately can not provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-16-2005, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to go sword until I can get one of those weapons.  I can only do instances on sunday because of work and family time with my wife on Friday and Saturday.  That means really 1 or 2 instances week and at that rate it might be a while until I can get either of those 2 weapons.  That way I will not get upset at losing itmes like that to a Paladin and having fun at same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-17-2005, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I went ahead and did it.  I am now carrying a Massacre Swrod of the Monkey.  All I have to say is wow for sword spec.  I am loving it.  It seems to proc quite often and in does proc off of weapon abilities at least.  I had it proc off of MS many times last night.  Nothing better than doing Mortal strike which activates sword spec giving you back about 10 rage and extra damage.  It was even better when it procced one time and 3 damage numbers sprung out of the mob's head.  And its great when it procs on a charge, immediately giving me the rage I need for MS.  One thing though, it never seemed to miss or be parry/dodged/blocked.  That may be a bug, may be intended for balance sake against other specs, or maybe I just have not seen it yet.  I haven't seen it proc off of other non-weapon ability attacks, but that does not mean it doesn't.  It is unlikely though.<br />
<br />
I love this spec and it makes me sad that there is no other blue sword I can really look forward to.  There are upgrades, but for pure burst damage through instants, the Massacre sword matches or beats if its of strength the Barbarous Blade, Warblade of the Caer Darrow, and Typhoon for burst damage potential.  The only real burst damage upgrade is from MC.  So that means I will end up respeccing again whenever I get Dreadforge Retaliator or Doomsaw.  Considering that I do not have time to do instances much, perhaps Blizzard will see it in their hearts to release a slow sword on the level of Reaper or Dreadforge that is obtainable without going into MC.<br />
<br />
On another note, I tried something different with Fury.  I dropped peircing howl and improved demo shout.  Fights go too fast in PvP to worry about demo shout, and peircing howl never seems to help me.  It never seems to help me escape and I never seem to have a problem chasing people down without it.  One problem I did have thoguh was keeping Battle shout up, particularly in raid pvp.  So I picked up the last point in Battle shout and Booming Voice.  3 minute Battle shout helps a lot with that and am glad I have it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-17-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all know slow weapons get higher AP bonus per attack than faster ones.  The highr your overall AP, the more this is exagerrated.  I recently switched to sword and picked up a Massacre Sword, a 3.8 spd sword with about 45 DPS.  If you are familiar with my work on Single Strike Damage or SSD, I wanted to compare the SSD of Massacre to Dreadforge and Doomsaw.  http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=11552  What I found out was surprising.  <br />
<br />
My base AP is 618 and I have a Massacre Sword of the Monkey with 16 agi bonus and 17 stm bonus.  Also compared is a Massacre of Strength with +26 Str<br />
<br />
At base AP - 618<br />
Massacre Sword of the Monkey, 3.8 spd - 341.7 SSD<br />
Massacre Sword of Strength, 3.8 spd - 355.9 SSD<br />
Dreadforge Retaliator, 3.7 spd - 358.2 SSD<br />
Blackhand Doomsaw, 3.5 spd - 343.5 SSD<br />
<br />
With Battle Shout up +231 AP for 849 AP<br />
Massacre of Monkey - 404.4 SSD<br />
Massacre of Strength - 419.6 SSD<br />
Dreadforge - 419.3 SSD<br />
Doomsaw - 401.4 SSD<br />
<br />
With Battle Shout and Blessing of Might, +231 and +223 AP for 1072 AP<br />
Massacre of Monkey - 465 SSD<br />
Massacre of Strength - 479.1 SSD<br />
Dreadforge - 478.2 SSD<br />
Doomsaw - 457 SSD<br />
<br />
When fully buffed with a battle shout and a blessing of might from a Paladin, I would have a higher SSD with a Massacre of Str than with Dreadforge or Doomsaw.  The .1 and .3 faster speed of doomsaw hurt them that much for single strke damage against Massacre.  I would not say Massacre is a better weapon, but it shocked me how close it cam in terms of damage potential.  I will not argue the merits of sword spec vs axe spec, because after using sword spec, I think its about even.  Dreadforge and Doomsaw are better weapons, but not by  much in my opinion.  The only thing going in the Doomsaw's favor is the proc which can be devastating, but its placement in the arms tree for specialization leaves something to be desired.  The dread forge gains some damage over my massacre of the monkey and 1% to parry, but the agility and being human brings the crit bonus of sword up to match the 1% of Dreadforge, and the sword adds 170 HPs.  So it seems to me to not be that big a difference, and that I should start working my mining and saving mats for reaper than wasting my time in instances only to lose rolls to paladins on weapons that aren't that big of upgrade.  In pve raids I would use sword and board anyways and I lose some soloing ability do too Massacre's lower DPS.<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind this is that I think SSD is more important for warrior than DPS, because of burst damage.  In PvP you rarely get to sit there and auto attack someone.  You are almost always cc'd in some way with small windows to do damage in.  It makes DPS almost totally irrelevant.  Not entirely, as you might get an extra swing in here and there, but enough to make up for raw damage you get from slow high damage weapons.  In this regards, a green weapon, the Massacre Sword, seems to stack up respectively well against some highly touted PvP weapons, because its slower than them.  <br />
<br />
Its kind of silly really.  Its an old argument, but blizzards instant attack system really hurts a lot of high end weapon, there should be no way a 45 DPS sword should even come close to the damage capability of high end weapons.  Instants should really be based on DPS*4 so that the fast rare weapons would actually be useful to have.</div></div><hr />
