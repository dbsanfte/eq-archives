BoC + anger3 and CHSD<br />
<br />
guilds SA has this combo<br />
<br />
Club of Mad Reaseracher+ anger3 and BoC.<br />
<br />
<br />
will these 2 guys with 0 bane weapons be able to hold aggro?  i know that simply swinging these weapons without procs provides some aggro ... but are the procs + swings enough to negate the lack of dmg?<br />
<br />
guild is moving on seru very soon and need to know if we need our tanks to have seru bane weapons to hold aggro.</div></div><hr />

Not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never hurts for the MT's to put out a bit of DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just a question tho .... would unaugmented seru bane weapons be a step back in aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes it would be.<br />
<br />
Augmented too.<br />
<br />
Non bane weapons still generate the same agro as if they were hitting normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">stick with the aggro set up, only times i ever have trouble with seru is if he lands a 20 second stun early on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">how resistable is that stun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would agree best bet is to use their normal agro combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get your MT close to 500 MR and you can resist the stun. And with Incite fired off every 30 seconds your tank should have no problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't bother with bane to tank him (or any bane-only mob). It's a waste of your time farming the pieces and a monstrous step back in agro.<br />
<br />
And if you're seriously contemplating augmenting Seru-bane weaps then you have spent altogether too much time in LDoN :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah emp and seru should be tanked with non-bane Agro weapons IMIO.  BoC / BF / hategiver what ever you can get your hands on.  For seru in particular I would let the MT tank for a long time before having the other melees engage, and I would even wait until seru is at 90% before the nukers start blasting away.  Due to the stuns seru puts out agro can be strange on him sometimes and usually if he pulls over to the casters he will wipe the ride</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bane weapons are far superior aggro than pure hate weapons...<br />
<br />
Waiting till 90% till nukers can start nuking?  Maybe if you go the pure hate weapon route.  I use Bane mainhand and offhand whatever I've got with a nice proc.  Melee and nukers can start right in after a few moments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">shai, bane and non bane generate the same aggro based on the max possible damage but not if it actually lands. and at 500 MR you should resists about 4/5ths of the stuns, but some will definately land</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bigchest is 100% correct.  The agro on a 15/20 bane weapon with no proc and a 15/20 non-bane weapon with no proc is exactly the same.   Now I can see using bane weapons as the MT if you want to make the fight a tiny bit shorter and you are low on numbers, but your agro is going to be asstastic.<br />
<br />
Also the waiting till 90% for the nukers to engage is mostly for the &quot;special people&quot; that are in every guild.  Basically seru is a complete wuss, once you have him in position clerics can heal the MT for hours at a time with no chance of death.  The only way to wipe on a seru raid once you get him into position is for the &quot;special people (aka overnukers)&quot; to get agro from the MT and pull seru to the casters and agro the outside guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heyas-<br />
<br />
To make the fight totally trivial, have your MT beg/buy/camp a few 10 shot instant-cast snare items, glands from FG or scepters (lore) from the warrens.  Burn 5+ on the pull, and another every min or two, and you have a nice fairly unshakeable aggro lock that is somewhat nuke happy idiot proof (note, doesn't work vs. low health aggro!).  Incite is gravy, add in a nice big DS and bane or non-bane weapons = doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What's Seru's dps like?  Anyone ever parse him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have 3 parses of him doing 167dps (i actually bothered using discs as soon as they popped up), 257 and 260ish. All lowish number kills, so the parse was fairly long. His dps is really subpar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm, sounds like that'd put me right to sleep!  The elemental minis are spoiling me, haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yeah its really pretty low, last time we did him we had so many clerics that we were running a 5 second rotation and me rarely going under 70%, they didnt want to slow it down b/c all the chain clerics ended up FM when seru died</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i've heard that a single talented cleric can keep a solid tank up without running oom, and that single groups sometimes run in and pop him (though it does take a hell of a long time to chew through his hps)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Could perhaps be done, but why would u want too. If your 6 man group can solo Seru you don't need any of his loots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i'd wager that seru's torque is an upgrade for lots of people ... 20 all saves + 100hp/mana is hard to turn down ... then there's always twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think seru melees for 700 or so and can flurry, but he is disease slowable and his attack isnt too high.  Also if he has the BBB he will wield it and that lowers his DPS even more.  If he doesnt have the BBB he will use his sword of truth with its bane humanoid and other insane stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've been doing this fight a lot lately.  Position is everything as they said.  Once the chain gets going we can go forever.  I usually run the chain at 6-8 seconds but we did it once at 12 seconds (9k buffed tank) and although it scared me a few times the tank didn't die.  <br />
<br />
I usually start with everyone in the chain then let druids drop out and start nuking once I know we are stable and everything is going smoothly.  If we ever had more then 3-4 clerics show up I'd prob let some of them melee too.  Anything that makes that LONG fight shorter is a good thing.  :)<br />
<br />
Hard part is getting started.  Once he's where you want him and you have good agro then the rest of the fight is just staying awake long enough to kill him.<br />
<br />
(I realize this isn't the cleric board but someone asked about DPS and to me that means how fast does the chain have to go.  Sorry if this isn't helpful.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i would say clerics meleeing isnt a good idea since the AE curse is somewhat of a bit of a pain in the ass. if they had furious hammers of zek, rgc, and could completely maintain themselves then it would be worthwhile but not all that much help</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't everyone have melee running in and out to avoid the curse?  We always have someone curing the MT and everyone else runs out of range right before AE then back in to fight right after.  <br />
<br />
Agree that clerics meleeing isn't going to help much it was more of a joke then anything.  If we had extra clerics (I wish) they can't nuke cause he's too MR so I really would send them in with hammers.  Anything to get me out of the chain faster. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">our melee sit around and kill repops, timing the curse in the hopes that someone procs on seru seems like alot of work for very little gain</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have some bored people to make enough bane weapons to worry about running in and out of the AE.  Haven't fought him for 9 months or so, but back then we had 3-4 at the most and one extra cleric could keep them up easily if they were in the AE.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt' say that.  That earring is 25 AC, which you won't replace until time, and his breastplate is the best in the game short of Raex, which a lot of people that have been in Time for months still don't have.  You'ld be suprised how many plane of time flagged people are running around in Vindi breastplates.</div></div><hr />

It is really stunning the lack of good breastplates there are - Seru, Aten, Ornate (kinda), and Rathe.</div></div><hr />

This is part of the reason I farm BoT tower mobs whenever I can. A bunch of people in our Elemental guild feel they are above it, but wtf?<br />
<br />
It's not like BPs just up and replace themselves once you set foot in elementals and beyond.<br />

<br />
Why not just mez the adds?  If you kill em, ya run the chance of the MT going low health and getting summoned away from seru by the add.  Sucks when that happens, as seru comes along for the trip and does his annoying AE...<br />
<br />
A massive DS on the MT, and maybe a bane bow for a ranger or two helps speed up the fight considerably.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">me being summoned in low health aggro has never happened either b/c <br />
<br />
a) serus dps sucks and he rarely sends me into low life aggro<br />
b) the meleee kill adds far enough away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Guess you have never been double summoned. Ill give the example: tank gets to 20percent =&gt; add summons tank =&gt; seru summons tank back =&gt; tank gets stuned for 20secs and curses =&gt; add runs to tank =&gt; heal hits tank =&gt; add returns to attacking other melee. As you see no issue here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">That might actually happen sometime if Seru had more DPS than a kriger, which he doesn't.<br />
<br />
Many such aspects of this fight that were crucial 2 years ago are easily ignored these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">So even tho non-bane weps won't hit Seru, they'll still proc as normal for agro purposes ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, Batem.  I just wanted to confirm that procs keep going off as normal, as we're also looking at doing Seru.  Do you get the &quot;is immune to the effects of your blow!&quot; message, or something along those lines then, as opposed to just getting a bunch of messages indicating you missed Seru a crapload of times ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I have my misses off so i ony get proc messages<br />
<br />
No there is no immune to non bane weapon message that I am aware of</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yes, you get a message saying that he is invunerable to your attack if not using a bane weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I finally got all the reports and shards for my arx key last night!<br />
<br />
Before I had my own key, I went on a couple Seru raids and remember having to fight up to a maze inside the Arx.  I think I remember the way to the maze itself, but once we were inside I just remember following the leader along a thin and windy set of passages to a teleporter that took us near Seru's room.  Now that I'm about to start leading my own raids here, I'm interested in this maze.  Is it just a series of passages, or are there teleport pads like in the Skyshrine maze to make it confusing?  I can't really find any information about this maze, so I assume it must not be a big deal to navigate, but any information would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">When in the maze take all right hand turns.  You'll hit dead-ends, just backtrack and take the next right.  Do this until you reach the teleporter.</div></div><hr />
