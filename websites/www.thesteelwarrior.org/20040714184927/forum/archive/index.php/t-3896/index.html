<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Parsed the first half of our PoTime raid today. Thought maybe someone would find some real-world numbers(as opposed to katta banker parses) interesting.<br />
<br />
Proc damage included.<br />
<br />
Pet damage included in owners damage for pet classes. <br />
<br />
DoT damage NOT included.<br />
<br />
Total Damage is the most interesting number.<br />
<br />
DPS = Total Damage / Total elapsed time(From DA / WS until mob dead). <br />
<br />
Thus the DPS reported here are typically lower than EQCompanion/YALP reports and cannot be directly compared, since those parsers divide with the time since YOU did your first damage.<br />
<br />
All mobs were killed Vindi/AoW style in a corner.<br />

What makes you say that? Do you have similiar guildwide parses showing a different distribution? If so I am curious in seeing it.<br />
<br />
I am reasonably sure my own damage is correct, as it matches up with yalp/eqcompanion once I subtract any DS damage. Of course neither of these mobs give a good picture of warrior dps, as there is offtanking involved in TT/Saryrn, and for VZ we needed to not grab agro prematurely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Our necros often crank out 300+ DPS on uber mobs.  1 thing is TZ and VZ for sure are fights where your melee cant just turn on attack and AFK (unless you do them different than us maybe).  So those classes without aggro control will have lesser DPS to avoid pulling aggro off the MT.<br />
<br />
CT and Saryn for sure are fights where numbers should be pretty close to full out DPS from all classes involved.<br />
<br />
Note: This is just my perspective based on how we do time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stikka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On those fights my DPS suffered a bit due to using my new toy an Etherial Destroyer in offhand. I usually use my 50 point tap augmented Ifir, but for fun and hoping to see some silly 750 (1500 crit) procs I used the destroyer in off. Clocked up a massive total of 3 (three) procs on all the fights including clobbering the Gods, Fake Vallons, Saryn adds and Terris adds.<br />
<br />
Compared to Ifir it procs roughly 1/20th of the rate in offhand with 305 dex and of course it is 16/21 as opposed to 18/19 of the Ifir so suffers a bit in raw damage output.<br />
<br />
Btw the cleric Chestar is a lot of fun and kindof melee happy, I bet most of you would like him. Frezzer always parses high, but is a real bugger for consenting after he gets summoned and splattered :D<br />
<br />
Plus do not forget that Timmoks parsed DPS is from the moment of Weaponshield and most of the melee do not even attack till 30 odd seconds later hence skewing the results somewhat.<br />
<br />
Our Paladins do a fair bit of group healing in Time, but parsed damage not far off Warriors which frankly is a surprise (no Greatsword of Chaos in RF and Timmok has only VDD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunatly this board doesn't allow HTML, so my pastes will be ugly, but heres a few from my guild.<br />
<br />
My guild does time differently from most guilds though.  We do not corner Tallon or Vallon.  They are walled to allow trueshot. (even though we long since have not needed trueshot to win)  Also walling allows the MT to be farther from the rest of the guild so Tallon's barbs don't hit people.  So Tallon/Vallon end up on the frame/ledge, making non-melee messages not display on my client, so I could only get melee on those.<br />
<br />
We also kill at least some adds before killing the god for every single god that spawns adds, which means the dps leaves the god to kill the adds, which means I do not get their entire damage in the parse.  This leaves only a few encounters to get a really accurate parse.  My favorite to use is bertox.<br />
<br />
For the sake of space and clarity, I will only paste the top 1/3rd or so names.  You wouldn't care about the dps of our new druid recruit anyway.<br />

Couple things to keep in mind.  Veruca has our only jagged dagger.  Too bad he slacked on our CT parse.  Gogo/sleepie using DoDs, except for the Tallon parse sleepie had some crap dagger.  Sleepie has shit for atk, shes new.  Coral's dps is usualy higher.  Dunno wtf he was doing.  He does 250ish when he wants to.  Numbers also do NOT include pet damages.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no excuse for a time dagger rogue with a bard to be doing less than 250 dps, on anything.  Any monk with a Shinai or CT stick with a bard should be doing 200+ on everything too.  (don't think my monks get bards more than half the time)  I have an even better bertox parse with my top rogue doing 325 dps, and a monk doing over 250.<br />
<br />
edit: typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's some insane mage damage... <br />
<br />
Also suprising to see SK's that high on DPS in a number of cases, since it doesn't even include their DoTs... they must really do a lot more damage than warriors... <br />
<br />
The Rogue, Ranger, Monk, Warrior, Paladin all look about what could be expected.<br />
<br />
Torrin, didn't you see his post about DPS and how he ran the logs?  Of course none of the DPS' will be comparable with other people's logs, only against those in his log.   I know that our wizards consistantly outdamage everyone else on our raids.  Only thing I hadn't seen is mages beating rogues/monks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Twitch Plz.   Thanx.<br />
<br />
hehehehehe.  <br />
<br />
Really, only group that should be asking for twitches and receiving them is healers.<br />
<br />
A necro's dps is neglible in terms of a raid's dps.<br />
((as is any single persons))<br />
<br />
Even his best case scenerio, he did roughly 3% of the posted damage ((probably less because other dot damage not included either))<br />
<br />
So in the 330 Second VZ fight = 100% VZ or roughly your guild<br />
doing 5,442 dps ((again a little low considering no one did thier<br />
dots)) while this necro was doing 219 DPS.  So approximatley 4% of the raids damage<br />
<br />
subtracting 219 DPS would leave the rest of the raid at about 5223 DPS considering total damage of 72558 your talking just<br />
under 14 extra seconds.<br />
<br />
Big question when considerng to twitch or not to twitch is simply<br />
does twitching healers buy the raid more time in healers keeping the raid up ((more than 14 seconds)) than the necros dps does in killing the mob.<br />
<br />
I'd say more often twictching does buy the raid more time<br />
then it hurts the dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Haha, Torrin, u should appreciate us a lot more now! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One thing - don't even bother posting DPS numbers. Forget about DPS because it is 100% irrelevant when trying to compare damage output across a raid, or more importantly across multiple raids. The ONLY thing that matters is the total damage output for each toon. While even these numbers are subject to differences due to the strats used by different guilds, they can provide a relative basis for comparison that can at least be quantified within a single raid.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to see how much damage the DoT classes are actually doing. After seeing some necro parses, I was quite impressed by their potential output. Necros can do some sick damage - they have the best mana regen AND the best agro redux in the game. Couple that with the fact that they can cast spells in all 5 magic types, their insanely mana efficient DoTs, and a pet that is good for a nice chuck of damage and you have an amazing amount of damage.<br />
<br />
IMO necros are by far the most under-rated raid damage dealers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">These parses fit with what I've seen a bunch of time.  Basically wizards that do not suck coming on top or very near the top.  When you factor the pets for magician they often come up very close to the top.  The time pet foci also give them a nice boost, something like 4k more dmg on a 3 min fight.  So let's say our top wizard did 65k, I often see our top magicians at 40k nuke, 14-18k pet depending if foci or not, and like 2k from their swarm.  On the same mob I got a parse from a necro who did around 57k dmg + a 7k lifeburn without pet.  With a pet that guy would probably have come up on top even not counting lifeburn.<br />
<br />
Then you have the rogues/uber monks, shitty wizards, etc.  Only exception to this is when a ranger trueshot.  Top warriors/rangers generally do around half the dmg of the best wizards.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, pretty consistent with what I saw.<br />

I don't see how you can completely ignore DPS. If one guild is more DPS heavy than the other, then a mob is going to drop faster, hence less total DMG for everybody in the parse.<br />
<br />
I agree that sometimes the accuracy of DPS is questionable, but I do not agree that you can totally ignore it.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how you can completely ignore DPS. If one guild is more DPS heavy than the other, then a mob is going to drop faster, hence less total DMG for everybody in the parse.<br />
<br />
I agree that sometimes the accuracy of DPS is questionable, but I do not agree that you can totally ignore it.  It doesn't matter how long a fight last or how &quot;DPS heavy&quot; one guild is over another because the raid as a whole has to do basically the same amount of damage (extra damage due to regen is the only difference) to kill the same mob.<br />
<br />
The reason DPS is completely irrelevant is because you have to use a common fight time for everyone - from the time the mob is engaged to the time it dies. That means that everyone other than the MT who is the first to engage is going to have the wrong fight time. You can't take in to account melees turning off attack to keep from getting agro, monks FDing, casters waiting until 95% to engage, time spend dodging AEs and other such variables that take away from the amount of time an individual spends doing damage.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the fight time, total damage in comparison to the others on a raid is the only effective comparison. When comparing 2 different raids, you want to make sure that they have similar total fight durations.</div></div><hr />

In now 8 complete PoTime clearings we had exactly one case where our clerics went lom - cause one RZ fight took way longer than usual + 1-2LD clerics , in that case the 2 of them who went really low got mana). <br />
Also we had not one but 4 necros there which according to your math shortened the fight around 56 seconds = quite noticeable.<br />
<br />
We do our share of the damage in the range of Wizards&amp;Rogues, wasting this damage just because your clerics miss FT is just plain stupid.<br />

<br />
Well first of all, my monks don't have to FD, my casters wait until 99% to nuke (the good ones), and the only aoe we dodge is quarm's.<br />
<br />
Second, DPS is totaly relevant for melee classes.  While I agree looking at the sum damage is the most important number, dps is still a very valid indicator for melee classes.  Multiply dps by duration and you get total damage.  If you look at dps you have to look at duration, though.<br />
<br />
And yes, necros are the most underestimated class in EQ.  One necro in my guild posts parses of 275-300 dps constantly.  And this dps is from start to finish with no gaps, so its relevant.<br />
<br />
Honestly I think wizards are an overestimated class.  The reason you see so many at the top is because they are so easy to play.  DoD rogues can near 300 dps, let alone jagged rogues.  Some of my necros beat wizard damage all the time.  Wizards are great until your other classes get geared, then those classes catch up.  Anyone ever seen a wizard do 100k in 300 seconds on a god?  I've seen a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Stikka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The twitch joke is a long standing one in RF, it is unlikely to ever die. :D<br />
<br />
Berty is a perfect rogue target as where we fight he is good for backstabs, Rallos is too apart from having to disengage to clobber the adds. Innoruuk sucks from a rogues perspective where we fight him and I have wound up in PoHate more than once when he fell. Quarm is a pain due to having a tiny hit box and those damn annoying adds that slow you.<br />
Incidentally to those saying that Timmoks parses are way off my own parsed DPS is usually only 10-25 higher than his whole of fight parses and that is down to the time difference.<br />
 <br />
I was glad when the ability to actually parse DoT's was introduced as I have a 65th shaman alt so had some idea of how vicious DoT's can be and was intrigued to see what a Necro can really pump out. Since the mobs buff slots were increased and the ability for multiple casters to stack the same DoT's the Necros have certainly taken a nice DPS hike.<br />
<br />
At the moment the only JTB's in RF are mine and Zwickels, but the rest have DoD's which don't fall far short (see Darizen's results). btw I had no Ferocity on any of the parses as 2 Beastlords can only do so much, but did have FA on all of them. 2080 attack or there abouts. Did play with Ethereal Destroyer a bit more, but I seem to have a dud one as it won't damn proc !!<br />
<br />
On Rallos we kill the adds as they spawn so parsed DPS is pretty meaningless as only MT stays on him 100%<br />
<br />
Overall the parses do show that Knights DPS is too high compared to Warriors or more correctly that Warriors DPS is too low compared to Knights. <br />
Monks as fundamentally a DPS pure melee should be a bit higher than they are and Rogues as full on DPS only melee really should be doing DPS at the very least equal to Mages and similar to Wizards.<br />
I do feel the pure melee classes have been neglected and require some attention as most of those parsed by Timmok are using top end weaponry and still fall well behind casters who have a full spell book which is so easy to get. <br />
Warrior weaponry in Time is sadly lacking as to date we have most of ours still using BoW, a few SeWS and 1 VDD. 1 MT has been using DBoW and Bloodfrenzy instead of his BoW recently, but from my perspective he appears to suffer incoming DPS spikes somewhat and I am not convinced that it is an improvement over his old faithful BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Why so much hate Torrin? Some wizard MB you as a child?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You're all going to hate me for saying this, but I have the exact opposite opinion of Stikka.  If anything, I feel rogue damage WITH TIME DAGGERS is too high.  Monk dps with a shinai is fine.   I would personaly double flying kick's damage, but thats it.  In fact, I think warrior dps is fine.  I out dps wizards in exp groups.  I do 185 dps for god's sake, thats damn good for the best defensive class in the game.  I so no reason why tanks should out dps any non-enchanter robe class over any amount of time.<br />
<br />
As for knights, they do a bit too much damage (SKs more than a bit), but I'd rather nerf the hate generation more than anything, along with the retarded high hp from itemization.  If they want to aggro the shit out of mobs, they should have to pay a higher mana cost.  They should not be able to aggro EVERY SINGLE INC a shit load.  They should be able to do &quot;burst&quot; hate, much like a wizard is supposed to do burst damage, but less over long periods of time.<br />
<br />
There is no way in hell rogues should be doing wizard burst dps.  (yet they do)  Wizards eat every aoe except quarm dots, and inno's worthless aoe.  And quarm has a mana drain aoe to compensate.  AoE ramp is easily avoided.  Rogue melee is unresisted.  Rogues slaughter wizard damage in longer duration fights.  Everything is corner tanked.  Even when they arn't, we don't have much trouble.  Rogues take hits a lot better, and aggro less.  Rogue utility owns wizard utility.  In the game's current state, I'd rather guild a rogue over a wizard easy.  DoDs are basicaly free to any rogue recruit now a days.  I was surprised when they upgraded the time daggers.<br />
<br />
Again, this is my own personal opinion based off parses I did myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Why so much hate Torrin? Some wizard MB you as a child? <br />
<br />
I have no &quot;hate.&quot;  I am debating my side of the issue.  Please quote where I flamed you.  Apparently you think everyone who disagrees with you hates you.  Btw did I mention I've played a wizard since day 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">LOL<br />
<br />
Seriously Torrin, you need to lighten up. It was a joke. Notice the obviously feeble attempt at humor with the reference to MB? I stopped debating a couple posts ago. I couldn't care less what the DPS number is, you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Err, Torrin... SK's are supposed to do more damage than Warriors, as has been proven quite a bit our melee is right where it should be when compared to high end Warriors (78-81% depending on mob your parsing and wether the Warrior is using DW or not).  Looking at Timoks Bertox parse the Warriors are parsing at 116-136 dps and the SK's are parsing at 115-153 dps.  It doesn't appear that any of the SK's died early from looking at the total damage values so I'm going to assume they were alive, on Bertox we have two tap's aviable to nuke with only the first hits for 470 every time and the other hits for 330 however is partially resisted by Bertox when his resists go up, the average for that tap during the fight is ~260, each of these can be used once every 14 seconds (including cast time), also we have zev's bite once a minute for an amazing 200 damage (3.33 dps), anyways those two taps will be providing 730 damage every 14 seconds or 52.14 dps add the damage from zev's and youre at about 55.5 dps, subtract that from the SK damage and amazingly our dps drops pretty low, lower than that 80% actually, of course you need to add about 15% back onto the dps to compensate for melee that casting was costing us and it's still to low.  Not saying SK's need to be doing more but it definatley isn't to high all things considered.<br />
<br />
Also, would you care to go into more detail about our aggro generation abilites?  You're already capable of generating more aggro than me over time (how much time is fairly random from 10 seconds to a couple of minutes depending on how proc's are going, but it does happen).  My aggro spells were stealth nerfed once again last patch, and the spells designed for us to use to taunt are 100% worthless (you could dual unaugmented jade mace's with no proc buffs and taunt off me chaining my current intended hate spells because they were designed with a linear increase instead of exponential... which just doesn't work when everything in EQ increases exponentially every level).  Warrior aggro generation is pretty damn good already with top weapons, so I wouldn't really be complaining about that area if I were you, it's almost at that 100% aggro lock I see Warriors complain about Paladins having and being to overpowered with having.  Actually, with some of my guilds Warriors it is like that there are encounters now where Wizards chain nuke from the start (starting casting their nukes as mobs are inc even), Rogues with the top weapon combos never having to hit evade, etc... it isn't like this with all Warriors mind you (just our top two actually) but it does happen.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm sure I'll get flames for this for being an &quot;Evil Overpowered Knight&quot; (c. Furor 2003), a dumbass, or one of 100 other things.   Have fun.</div></div><hr />

Rogue melee is unresisted. Rogues slaughter wizard damage in longer duration fights. Everything is corner tanked. Even when they arn't, we don't have much trouble. Rogues take hits a lot better, and aggro less. Rogue utility owns wizard utility. <br />
<br />
I must take issue with you over these statements.<br />
<br />
1. Our wizards never go OOM or even close to it, their DPS is not burst it is consistant and constant. Those with concussion pants literally never stop casting. On raid mobs with rare exceptions Wizards always parse significantly higher than rogues.<br />
2. Rogue melee is resisted, I hit no more often than any melee class ie 60% ish and miss the rest, plus of course I get riposted when mobs turn or are not cornered, Wizards do not suffer this at all.<br />
3. Yup I do tank better than a Wizard, but in AE rampage situations the only way I can avoid taking the hits is to not melee.<br />
4. Kindly explain exactly what utility Rogues have over Wizards apart from the obvious ability to drag a bunch of bodies. I cannot gate, I cannot invis others, I cannot levitate myself or others, I cannot transport people about in groups or remotely via Translocate oh and I cannot solo 1 blue mob let alone 4 at a time basically non stop.<br />
<br />
Rogues are the melee equivalent of wizards being damage specialists.<br />

From a Warrior perspective I still feel that Time itemisation lacks badly weaponry wise as there is no really top weapon to compare to the other melee classes offerings. The DBoW in my opinion is sup par and is not a 2h so damage spikes are an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well Brael, I have a darkblade + EoE with anger 3s and a Raex BP, and knights can still aggro off me at will, unless I happen to get lucky with procs.  It may take them more casts, but they can.  Last time we did CT, a knight held aggro without my holding back more than a 10 second wait with this setup.<br />
<br />
If you played LDoN much, you'd realize the value of aggro-on-demand with the death counts.  Also, notice the &quot;weapon shield tanking&quot; thread right next to this one?  You think knights would have to use WS?<br />
<br />
As for dps, I have logs of SKs doing up to 200 dps without harmtouch on very short duration fights (2-3 mins) using their 1h from terris, on raid boss mobs.  Granted I don't see that much on most stuff, but for a tank class, you dps pretty well.  I could whine about HT being extremely valuable and enabling SKs to outdamage most dps classes on mobs like coirnav too, but I won't.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised you picked my post out of the pile from here.  I'm actually more passive than most warriors when it comes to knight nerfs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">1. Our wizards never go OOM or even close to it, their DPS is not burst it is consistant and constant. Those with concussion pants literally never stop casting. On raid mobs with rare exceptions Wizards always parse significantly higher than rogues.<br />
<br />
Thats odd.  My wizards go oom in about 3-4 minutes on mobs that have no mana drain dot.  A few weeks ago my top wizard was commenting how he went oom on Tallon of all mobs when I tanked.  Although my point was refering mostly to exp groups, or longer fights such as time trials.  In my high risk missions with 80-90% uptime, my jagged rogue quite literaly is worth 2 wizards worth of damage.<br />
<br />
2. Rogue melee is resisted, I hit no more often than any melee class ie 60% ish and miss the rest, plus of course I get riposted when mobs turn or are not cornered, Wizards do not suffer this at all.<br />
<br />
Melee dps is very consistant.  Wizard damage can vary from mob to mob.  Take Lord Gintolaken as probably one of the more notorious examples.  Also in high risk missions, mobs resist some.  (fire in miragul's a good example)<br />
<br />
As for riposte, I can't remember the last time I saw a rogue die from it.  Dunno what to tell ya<br />
<br />
3. Yup I do tank better than a Wizard, but in AE rampage situations the only way I can avoid taking the hits is to not melee.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to be in any way insulting, but AoE ramp can and is avoided all the time.  If its hitting you, try shrinking and clicking off levitate before you inch into max melee range.<br />
<br />
4. Kindly explain exactly what utility Rogues have over Wizards apart from the obvious ability to drag a bunch of bodies. I cannot gate, I cannot invis others, I cannot levitate myself or others, I cannot transport people about in groups or remotely via Translocate oh and I cannot solo 1 blue mob let alone 4 at a time basically non stop.<br />
<br />
Well, first, soloing isn't really utility.  I wouldn't consider ports much of a utility anymore.  I box a wizard and sometimes I'd rather run to a pok book than fetch my warrior with my wizard.  The massive dps loss of taking a wizard over a rogue for exp groups certainly wouldn't be worth it.  I'm kinda surprised how rogues don't value shroud of stealth.  I couldn't count how many raids would be undoable without it, or how much time its saved me.  Also, ports can be cast by another class, whereas rogue stealth is unique.  As for invis and lev, well I suppose thats a matter of opinion.  I don't consider them to be anything special, but thats just my view.<br />
<br />
Rogues are the melee equivalent of wizards being damage specialists.<br />
<br />
Rogues are the specialists of LONG TERM dps, and wizards short term.  Wizard dps drops like a stone after oom, but rogue dps is infinate.  In my opinion rogues should not do as much as wizard burst dps for this reason.<br />
<br />
From a Warrior perspective I still feel that Time itemisation lacks badly weaponry wise as there is no really top weapon to compare to the other melee classes offerings. The DBoW in my opinion is sup par and is not a 2h so damage spikes are an issue.  <br />
<br />
While I agree there could be an in-between weapon between the BoW and DBotW+EoE, I am fairly happy with my DBotW + EoE combo currently.  I DO think the riposte junk needs to be looked at though.  2x the ripostes is just silly.  I also feel like it &quot;costs too much&quot; for a warrior to need to get both an EoE and two anger 3s to make the combo a viable replacement.  I'm not sure how you'd fix this without making the combo a little too potent, though.</div></div><hr />

Depends on which school your wizards subscribe to. Some wizards chain draughts some chain SoS. Personally I prefer SoS when I box one which will indeed kill your mana pool fast even with SCM3 FT15 Mana Conservation 4 and 6k mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sscaley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Unless the mob has some very volatile aggro (debuffs, ae aggro enhancers etc) I dont really see why anyone would chain draughts over SoS.</div></div><hr />

YOu would use draughts for the resists.  I swear I get 50% resists on quarm using SoS with my wiz.  No joke. People knock draughts because they lack the DPS of the big guns, but when you get a mob that is resistant even after debuffs, draughts STILL land for full the majority of the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless the mob has some very volatile aggro (debuffs, ae aggro enhancers etc) I dont really see why anyone would chain draughts over SoS.  Exactly. Due to the damage being spread out a bit more, draughts are great for controlling agro. The agro from a single SoS &gt; 3x draught by a pretty good margin. Any time that it is vital to not take agro, draughts are by far the superior choice. Being able to do a steady 220-250 DPS with very little fear of agro is a pretty nice option.</div></div><hr />
