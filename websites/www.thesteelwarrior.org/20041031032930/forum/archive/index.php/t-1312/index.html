<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a link to, or willing to share info about the lore between the Dismal Rage and the Freeport Milita?<br />
<br />
Some of the Paladins in the NFP tunnel, refer to the FP Militia as working for the Dismal Rage, but before I got my faction up with FP Militia, they said they wouldn't have anything to do with my &quot;gang&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just curious about the lore regarding the Dismal Rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have any links at the moment, but there is a reason why Freeport is the city at war. <br />
<br />
It involves the all of the Freeport class guilds, some vampires on Faywder, the dark elf guilds having a hard on for Freeport, Qeynos not giving a damn due to a sibling rivalry that threatens to hand over complete control of the humanity into the hands of a tyrant and an ongoing war in the commonlands.<br />
<br />
Oh and of course; sex, dark magic, plat, and lies...</div></div><hr />

Within an abandoned warehouse in the slums of East Freeport can be found an entrance to the dark underground. Here, followers of the Prince of Hate gather under the name Dismal Rage. This unholy alliance is led by six guildmasters. Venox Tarkog Leads the Clerics, Konious Eranon the Enchanters, Heneva Jexsped the Magicians, Opal Darkbriar the Necromancers, Pietro Zarn the Shadow knights, and Nexvok Thirod the Wizards. The Dismal Rage openly oppose the Knights of Truth in North Freeport, and support the Opal Darkbriar Faction. Opal Darkbiar has her hands in many things evil going on in Freeport, and her relationship to the Arcane Scientists as the wizard guildmaster makes people wonder if there are two Opal Darkbiars, which may be her plan.<br />
<br />
I guess anything to snuff out the pallies of N Freeport...Sir Lucan &quot;used&quot; to be a paladin-in-training, but after the paladins left to fight some war against the dark elves(again, all from memory, i may be of here) Sir Lucan became corrupt and tried to lead Freeport into being &quot;his&quot;; not a part of the paladin structure that N Freeport witholds to this day.<br />
I know now when a paladin goes to complete his fiery avenger thingy, you first kill the &quot;livE&quot; sir lucan; than after you kill him he turns into an &quot;undead sir lucan&quot;..which leads me to believe his conversion to a shadowknight/necromantic schooling...<br />
<br />
food for thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Qeynos is all about Antonius Bayle's leftover followers and Kane Bayle; his corrupted relation that is trying to turn the followers of karana and rodcet nife into tools of bertoxxolous and destroy the farmlands of the karanas into a barren wasteland. I don't think there's many ties left to freeport any longer besides The Steel Warriors' that remained in Freeport after it was first founded and most returned to Qeynos after the war at nektulos forest.<br />
<br />
They couldn't give a rats ass about freeport methinks. They're too busy trying to outdo each other to dominate the lands there and the main shipping routes through the karanas and to odus ( the bridge :D ).</div></div><hr />

It has always stood, or at least has stood for so long that no one can prove otherwise. It has the biggest harbor in the known world. It’s the largest city, the richest trading post, and the most powerful military stronghold on the continent. A city split between two public factions and a dozen hidden ones, it has been called the City of a Thousand Alleys, the Great Market, the Free City of Humans, and the Sinking Ship of Antonica, as well as at least a dozen less favorable epithets. In previous ages it has been called Wielle, Haven, and Landing. Today it is known as Freeport, and it is the greatest city in the world.<br />
<br />
Freeport is a city of contradictions. It controls hundreds of miles of land, but doesn’t consider itself a kingdom. More money flows through its gates than any other nation, yet many of its neighborhoods suffer crushing poverty. It was established by dark elves centuries ago, but now it welcomes most travelers. It was once ruled by orders of paladins and clerics, but now they can’t walk openly along most of its streets. It’s the one city every adventurer wants to see, but it levies huge taxes on outsiders and rarely cares when visitors to its streets disappear. Though no race is forbidden to enter the city, the common residents’ hatred of dark elves, ogres, trolls, and iksar is so great that the militia guards sometimes kill such non-humans on sight. Despite this, the militia’s leader is part of a secret dark elf conspiracy, and in some places within the walls the Teir’Dal still operate openly.<br />
<br />
People who have never seen the walls of Freeport tell stories of its gold-lined streets and open bazaars where all races gather peacefully to do business, but the reality is quite different. The city’s streets are cobblestone at best, and often little more than wagon ruts in muddy paths. Non-humans do own businesses in Freeport, but bigotry and prejudice is as common there as in any other civilized land. Despite these failings, however, Freeport truly is a wondrous city, for nowhere else do creatures from as many lands gather together in one place. Its dangers are opportunities for adventure, and its adventures an opportunity for greatness.<br />
<br />
The importance of Freeport to the world at large has been widely debated. While it is inarguably the greatest port in the world, certainly others could take its place. Troops from its walls regularly patrol the Commonlands and parts of the Desert of Ro, yet no armies have threatened these lands in generations. A great crusade in the recent past (in historical terms) set out from Freeport to cleanse Faydwer of undead, but the effort was only partially successful and cost the crusading paladins and priests a great part of their number, as well as control of their home. No leader in Freeport has tried to extend his influence further in a hundred years, and most nobles assume such an effort would be doomed to failure.<br />
<br />
But it’s a mistake to think of Freeport as dying or dwindling. It is still the gateway to Antonica from the east, and its politics determine to a great extent who can operate freely on over a third of the continent. The forces of Neriak, Grobb, and Oggok are separated by Freeport, and none cannot make a bid to conquer Antonica as long as Freeport opposes it. Smugglers regularly undergo lengthy journeys to avoid paying Freeport’s dock fees, but they do so well out of sight of Freeport’s walls. The city has had its influence weakened and divided by recent events, but it is still a power to be reckoned with. Wise leaders watch the events of Freeport with a careful eye and ponder the question: Who shall rule the city’s future?<br />
<br />
The great port’s current ruler is Sir Lucan D’lere, self-proclaimed Protector of Freeport and Master of the Freeport Militia. His troops now patrol the Commonlands, supervise the gathering of foodstuffs that must be grown outside its mighty stone walls, and enforce the city’s laws and taxes among more than two-thirds of its inhabitants. The richest section of town, the walled neighborhood known as the Hill, is under the rule of two religious orders, the Priests of Marr and the Knights of Truth. Sir Lucan was once a member of both of these orders, but he betrayed his former comrades. A great hatred thus exists between these Sir Lucan and these ruling bodies, and it is only a matter of time before their conflict turns into open bloodshed. Should Sir Lucan be victorious, his alliances with the dark elves may well extend Neriak’s power. Should he fall, the holy orders would surely strike down those envoys of the dark elves already operating in and near the city.<br />
<br />
And if neither force survives? There are many ambitious groups who would enjoy great status if they were to take control of the city. The Church of the Dismal Rage would be able to encourage humans to worship the God of Hate openly if they could set the holy orders and the militia to destroy one another. The Coalition of Tradefolk might decide it is time the residents of Freeport governed themselves, and if they formed an alliance with the Steel Warriors they would have the military might to do so. The Academy of Arcane Science or the Ashen Order, or perhaps both together or apart, might wrest control simply to create a more peaceful city in which their studies could continue uninterrupted. Each imagined scenario presents the rest of Antonica, indeed the all of Norrath, with a different set of political realities.<br />
<br />
Time alone can tell who will ultimately rule Freeport. For now the city sits in an uneasy stalemate, while citizens and visitors try to get on with their lives. But everyone can feel the tension in the air, and a storm is brewing.<br />

most of it is from the pnp version but it seems to make more sense.</div></div><hr />
