<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You guys who are 30-40ish looking for a good PP camp i used to use Hadden and was geared way back when way ahead of my peers. The Fishbone earring he drops still sells for 3kish and that’s a lot at that level, hes on a 12 hour timer and spawns at the campfire next to the hut at the lake that’s straight out of the Surefall zone in Q Hills, its actually a bit to the right. You can time killing him and rack up good pp pretty fast =D I know I farmed him to hell until I had my Ykesha =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ryld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thought it was a 6hour spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">honestly who knows now that was like 3 years ago i killed him like clockwork on sol ro and saved up to buy uber ass Rubi BP and Yaks + FBSS. Might be 6 now, still an awesome way to get pp at smaller levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramirezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nice sig 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm fairly sure he's an 8 hour spawn, farmed him for my rogues eb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Curfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You've probably already verified the camp for yourself over the weekend, but when I camped Hadden, his spawn was 5.5 hours +/-20 mins.<br />
<br />
Also, he does not drop the fishbone earring every time. In fact, it's probably 1 in 10 or worse. I got the earring on the second spawn and proceeded to camp him several more times with no more earrings. Also, unless you are a fair amount higher in level, Axe Broadsmith and Rephas will add ... or so I've been told. I was high enough level that they didn't add.<br />
<br />
Also, Hadden comes with a minor Qeynos faction hit.<br />
