I don't know the exact recipies for barb cultural but I am working on farming components for Fierce Heraldic to supply a friendly smith I know.  It would prolly be rather easy for you to do the same with any cultural you can use.  Does take some money but hey if you can far the hard components for it, a few extra pp camps won't be out of your reach.<br />
<br />
I hope this may help in some small way</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wearing barbed ringmail until I got lucky and had a Gantu Moktor drop a BP in Umbral. You could kill them with the group you mentioned camping the entrance and pulling theminside the zone area. Stats are 36AC 15 str 15 sta and 15 HP. not outstanding by any means, but was an upgrade for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at 56 I upgraded my treeweave to a barbed ringmail for the price of 6k which was my 2nd biggest purchase ever at the time after buying a lammy for 8k when I was lvl54.<br />
<br />
My next upgrade was to a heavy rubicite BP (46AC, 85hps) which I got with a guild group in CT at level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your group could easily do Kael Arena or Icehouse cycle for thurg plate armor, which would be a decent upgrade, possibly farm armor for everyone. <br />
<br />
Gems you could get in Siren's Grotto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have a decent guide to PoH after they changed it?<br />
<br />
I hear it was turned into an exp zone of some kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go for cultural or try to farm a Champ's BP from the Kael Arena. Personally, if I had it to do over again (wearing Champ's now) I would stick with tradeable BPs until you can get Vindi or better. A cultural may not be quite as good as a Champ's, but when you do get an upgrade, at least you can sell the cultural.<br />
<br />
Since you are low on funds, I would gather enough ingredients to make 2-3 BPs. Do all of the sub-combines yourself or get a friend to help if you can't do them yourself. Then find a smith to do the final combine. Chances are really good that you will be able to get the final done free if you have enough to give the smith a couple other combines for himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah - get yourself ANY kind of a haste upgrade, even an FBSS. The 11% increase in haste &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stats on your current belt. Your group might even be able to camp a Soulscream Belt from Veksar. I would do this before I messed with any other upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since your Magelo shows you following Rallos Zek, either farming a little cash or gathering the stuff for a few combines is a very good way to go. A 51AC 80hp BP would be a nice improvement, and should last you a while. On my server they go for 12-15kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need a lot more upgrades than BP, and if you're strapped for cash and have a single group with the important classes (warrior/cleric/shaman...) then Veksar might just be the place for you. Here are some of the items that you could get that would be upgrades for you:<br />
 Darkguard Chestplate (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65519)<br />
 Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65529)<br />
 Dented Kunzar War Helm (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65537)<br />
 Kylong Darkmail Visor (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65526)<br />
 Kylong Shinguards (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65543)<br />
 Soulscream Belt (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65570)<br />
And these are just a few of the items found there. There's a bunch more that are warrior-friendly, plus other stuff drops for the rest of your group.<br />
<br />
Lately, my group has been doing Droga as well, and your group of mid 50's could do well there at the front area and exit ramp. Some nameds there drop some good gear, but there's also some good platinum to be had there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramelus</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a BP that drops in Solusek C now from a relatively easy named (one of the giants) that is decent, it's 40ish ac with 40hp or some such.  That would be nice for you.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  here it is, linked -&gt; http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22644<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could do the thurg plate cycle by triggering Doldigun repeatedly in Iceshard Keep (in Kael).  You can farm that pretty heavily for plate.  With one group at your level though, it might be a bit overwhelming, I know the last mob in the cycle at least is level 60.<br />
<br />
Or, you could go to DN and farm Phase Spider Carapaces, but expect to spend some serious time there.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kannan</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the info been wanting to try veksar but haven't had time to set it up. <br />
<br />
Done plate cycle twice with 2 groups back when i was 52 it was a pain and only got 3 drops and alotta whinning from the rangers ... waah why are we here we don't get nothing /smack.<br />
<br />
Oh well thats the past new guild new direction the reason i don't worry too much about haste is cuz I am rarely without a shammy<br />
and thought that haste items and the spells dun stack.<br />
<br />
But I did find a friend thats gonna help me get the Fierce Heraldic<br />
stuffs i just gotta go out and farm the items thats easy enough except for the blue diamonds wich have mysteriously slowed in drops in dulaks used to get about 6-8 in 6 hrs now rarely see 2 in 12 hrs.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for Info gonna get into Veksar and see what trouble i can come up with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzo</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I wore Crafted and MT'd Vindi with it at level 60... then I got his BP ;)<br />
<br />
As for gear upgrades... take your group, and go to Droga/Veksar. Soooo much loot there, and it is soooo nice. A lot of it has helped to fill gaps in taunt issues, pre-EB (see CHoS and SoBS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont bother with moktor, just head to acrylia caverns and kill primalist. his semi-rare drop is an ac38bp with some 45hps or so abd i believe 10sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kannan</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Zito heeh ya I am. If only the cable would stop goin out in my area i would have enough stuff for what i needed now.<br />
