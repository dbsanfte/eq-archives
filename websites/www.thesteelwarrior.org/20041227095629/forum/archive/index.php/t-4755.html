<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a very very major issue in high end tanking and many people are not taking it seriously.  Evasive is the single most used disc in plane of time next to unholy aura ^_^.  The new melee changes are very nice, but why do you feel the need to nerf the fuck out of high end warriors avoidance?  There is 0 reason to raise the refresh from 7 1/2 to 10 1/2, in fact it makes quite a few time encounters much harder than they previously where.  Unfortunatly 99% of the people who post here hang their hats on the luclin philosophy of always defensive and hps are much better than ac, dont belive me i will send you a parse of tt and saryrn dealing 850 dps while traditionalists who use defensive and no avoidance parse them at 12-1300.  Unfortunatly the truth in pop is that mitigation is everything, and 2300 ac makes defensive virtually useless vs the majority of mobs, not to mention that most time encounters are roughly 7-10 minutes, and the last few minutes where evasive would have recycled is the critical part of the fight.  I just dont understand the theory in nerfing 100% of the usefullness of evasive.</div></div><hr />

 Take a Valuum. They didn't fuck up anything. Test is for testing. You're not the only person in the world who uses Evasive or realizes it's better for many encounters. There's been lotsa posts here about it.</div></div><hr />
