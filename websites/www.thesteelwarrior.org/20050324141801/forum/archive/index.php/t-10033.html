When people say &quot;blah blah blah dual wield r teh 1337, shields sux0t&quot; that doesn't tell me a lot since they could be level five for all we know. <br />
<br />
I know I'm gimp, but my comp has been broke for about a week now so I haven't been able to play, on top of that I was leveling a shaman for two boxing since I was about to buy a new comp before it happened.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cattypult</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that it would be nice to have everyone state the level of their character when making recommendations since the game makes significant changes at certain points.   For example, I recommend DEX and AGI gear for an under 40 toon, going against the common line of thought, since you can generally survive to 50 on gimp gear and skill-ups are much more important than the handful of hp you will gain from STA gear.  I would not make the same suggestion to a post 50 character.<br />
<br />
Most players who post here are 65+ though, so it would be a moot point in most discussions.  Most posters here also have a magelo profile which would give an indication of their level if you look (hopefully it's an updated one).</div></div><hr />
