When they kill his mob, the pally can start turning my mob withing seconds. Even if iv procced EB/anger2 and TB 20-30 times. Is there a max value on how much higher than the rest you can get on the agro list? I find it hard to belive that a stun or two can do minimum of 8k+ agro.<br />

<br />
It is possible there is an aggro cap, there was an active thread on that some months ago. On a mob in Sol Ro, 2 stuns isn't going to turn a mob like that though.</div></div><hr />

Of course the pally need only be level 64 with no aa's till then . &lt;Laugh&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was the taunt button.<br />
<br />
It works both ways though.<br />
<br />
A pally can build up mad hate.<br />
You can tick him off for a few sconds witnh a taunt till he stuns again.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep aggroe and compete with the pallys all you need is 350 aa's and you should be able to hold aggroe. <br />
<br />
It takes time.<br />
You have to run him OOM first.<br />
That is hard :)</div></div><hr />

A while back I was grouped with a paladin in PoV and I'd be offtanking with a GoT, he'd walk up, cast FoL and it was like I didn't exist.</div></div><hr />
