<br />
I play late at night and sometimes have difficulty finding a group at 3-4amish.  Sometimes even during the day I can have troubles.  Would at least like the option to solo even if it's 1 mob every 20 minutes or something.<br />
<br />
Here is what I was thinking:<br />
<br />
#1  Snare/Fear then switch to DPS weapons--<br />
<br />
       Just bought a kunzar ku'whatever with the dark proc.  <br />
       Probably eventually upgrade to whip of ensnaring if this  <br />
       method actually works.  Gonna use the kunzar then when it<br />
       procs switch to the polished obsidian for fear.  Then after that<br />
       bust out the DPS weapons and tear the mob up.<br />
<br />
#2   Invest all my money into DPS weapons &amp; armor--<br />
<br />
        Basically just get a good haste item, good DPS weapons,<br />
        and better armor to increase my AC and HP (possibly<br />
        some regen BP in there somewhere).  Then just hope to <br />
        beat the tar out of what I'm fighting.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was pretty much all I could think of that would let a warr solo.  If anyone has ideas that actually work or something lemme know.  If neither of these ideas work I would appreciate any info so I don't go wasting any money buying snare/fear weapons and stuff.  THx!</div></div><hr />

<br />
warrs can solo; just takes a metric f**kload of gear + util's to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To add to what Shik said ... think about perhaps a Windblade to switch to once your Truncheon of Doom procs (BTW, ToD is an absolute must have for soloing purposes at those levels) ... think about perhaps an invigorate casting BP to use in downtime ... and try and get as much utility as you can get.<br />
<br />
Things like a really fast horse or JBoots or SoW potions or Run 3. They will help you escape when things go REALLY bad.<br />
<br />
Things like snare weapons, and the slow procs and stuff like DD procs to increase the damage you do and give you an edge.<br />
<br />
Self buff clickies. Self heal clickies. Self haste clicky like the eyepatch of plunder.<br />
<br />
All of these things will help the warrior solo.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
And remember, soloing as a warrior is slow and boring. It's definitely possible, it's just slow and boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely agree with the utility weapons comments.  A ToD is a MUST if you intend to solo.  I spend some time in Velks soloing spiders that way.  Get them slowed with ToD then dig out my Windblade to finish them off as fast as possible.  I used my bind wound to get past the 201 skill and when I got my BP from SS, that made it all the easier.  I don't solo too often, but that is where I spend most of my time.  Hope that gives you an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When my usual group-mates are not on, I have been soloing some in PoJ mostly for AA.  Sure its not the fastest AA in the world but its better than nothing.   As everyone else has said, TOD is a must.  If I don't get a ToD proc within first 30-40% of mobs life it usually means I have to take the death or train :( <br />
<br />
I don't have any other weapons with anykind of &quot;utility&quot; proc.   I do have a heal BP which helps with downtime. <br />
<br />
For me Warrior soloing is just something to keep myself occupied while I wait for my friends to log on.  Its just not efficient/reliable enough to do as a means of actual progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truncheon of Doom ... MUST HAVE for a soloing warrior<br />
<br />
SoW pots or Jboots ... sometimes its better to run away<br />
<br />
Click buffs ... Cobalt arms, Lodi boots, gobby ear, all increase your chances of stayin alive.<br />
<br />
Fungi if you can afford it for downtime regen.<br />
<br />
Gauze Press, or a couple of skinnin knives ... bandaids cut down on heal time.<br />
<br />
Decent DPS weapons, Windblade is prolly gonna be your best bet, nothing comes close to its DPS without high end mob drop no drop shit.<br />
<br />
Kunzar Kujuch, Snare whip (youve got this coverd already), as running mobs can be a pain in yer ass.  (i dont have a snare weapon, cause i never soloed much, but went to Seb few days ago to farm some cash, and got really frustrated when frogs kept runnin away, and i got aggro from another frog chasin it down), so im prolly gonna search around for one now.<br />
<br />
Clicky haste = your best friend, eyepatch is neat (damn lodi, spawn for me bitch), then you dont have to keep running to the group closest to you to bum a haste from their chanter or shammy.<br />
<br />
Visit the nexus before each soloing day, pick up some virtue or BoA, its always for sale, more HP = your friend, means you can handle things a lil easier.  or hit up your guild clerics.</div></div><hr />
