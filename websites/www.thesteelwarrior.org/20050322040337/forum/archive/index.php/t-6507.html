<br />
1) Start EQ patcher and deselect autoplay<br />
2) Open your Eqhosts.txt file in notepad<br />
3) Edit your file to say loginserver3  (it should be saying loginserver1)  In other words, change all the 1's to 3's.<br />
4) Save file<br />
5) Click play, Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Make sure you open the patcher before you open and edit the eqhosts.txt file</div></div><hr />

I used it last night to get on.  I will be changing it back when I get home.  <br />
<br />
What I don't understand is, why people are being banned, or the threat of ban being made.  It does not change Gameplay in any way shape or form (except if you want to count that your actually able to play).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I could understand a warning, but to ban someone for that without telling them prior it was a violation seems foolish from a business stand point.</div></div><hr />

Granted, it's not posted by a CSR rep but to have it on the boards for over a day and no official response not to do it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzme</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, in doing searches through the EQLive site.  I've found that only 1 person (that I found) has reported a threating of banishment.  Nobody else has stated it has happened to them.  I can only concurr that either it did not take place, or it was a mistake by a guide.  Surely (for as many people that used the fix), there would have been more posts out there stating they got the threat of ban as well.  When I get home tonight, I'm not going to change my file, as previously stated I would.  If I am asked to change or be banned, I will surely post it here.  Until then or if anyone else can post on here that they have been banned, I'll assume that it is not true.</div></div><hr />
