<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">06-09-2005, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a warrior alt.  He's 44.  I'm choosing abilities, gear, and playstyle to eventually be Main Tank for a raiding guild.  My alt was considered an excellent warrior in EQ; he eventually became my main.  As easy as it was to be a warrior in EQ, very few actually had the same skill I had.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's because I've been concentrating on my main mage too much, but I suck at playing my WoW warrior.  I can't yet manage to look back on an interesting encounter and say, &quot;That was the best anyone could have done.&quot;  I ALWAYS forget or fumble something.  Forgot to utilize my Rage properly, didn't use the right stance at the right time, didn't use the right weapon for the right enemy, didn't have the right ability available when I needed it because I didn't anticipate the need, forgot which stance had which ability which caused momentary hesitation, hit auto-attack when it was already on after targeting a totem, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
In EQ I rarely made any sort of error.  In WoW, I feel like an expert warrior would have done twice as well as I did or better.<br />
<br />
P.S. What's with people saying &quot;There's no point in Protection.  We use a Fury/Arms warrior to tank the end-game?&quot;  Ya, sure, a druid could tank end-game encounters in EQ if the rest of the guild could support it.  Is it not true that a Protection warrior would be better for tanking major bosses the first time your guild attempts them?<br />
<br />
P.P.S. What's with people saying &quot;Get level 60, and then talk.&quot;  Like having achieved level 60 in 5 days /played made them a class guru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">06-09-2005, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) a WoW warrior is more like an EQ bard. once you get used to the cacophony of juggling abilities, managing rage, and switching stances, you'll find that most encounters are fun, not overwhelmingly difficult. experience helps. also, end bosses hit you so hard that rage is in constant supply. often I have some rage left over, even though I dump 30 rage every 6 seconds with MS.<br />
<br />
for what it's worth, the fact that you're finding flaws and working to correct them is A Good Thing. <br />
<br />
2) granted, all else being equal, a Prot-heavy warrior will have a defensive advantage tanking anything, but IMO the returns are too small for the sacrifices. my guild's primary tank is heavy Prot and yes he usually tanks the first attempts on anything, but consider this - not too long ago, a guild on a PvP server killed Ragnaros with nothing but 31/20 warriors.<br />
<br />
also, a 31/20 (or even a 31/5/15 like myself) can lay the serious beatdown. get your crit % up and invest in a really nice 2h (like an Arcanite Reaper) and you'll compete with the rogues in long fights, especially if you can score multiple Executes.<br />
<br />
3) no, level in of itself is not the most quantifiable measure of skill and knowledge, but it is a straight number that can be correlated to some level of experience with the class. probably I've learned as much during 60 as I did in 1-59.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that BG's are out, I sense the end of the Protection warrior coming soon.  Which will probably lead to buffs for the tree, so that's probably a good thing.<br />
<br />
PvP is such an integral part of this game, and 10% armor, or 1 extra block or concussion blow or anything else in the protection tree just pales in comparison to shit you can pick up out of the other 2 trees.  I just had to respec again yesterday to pick up Iron will again (which IMO is now the best talent in the tree), and I still see no reason to drop Piercing Howl or Mortal strike for anything else in that tree.<br />
<br />
You NEED mortal strike to compete PvP.  You need the burst DPS to be able to put someone down before a heal can land, and if you can't, then the 50% cut on MS is usually enough to give you another try.  Axe/Polearm/Sword whatever spec also ends up being a gigantic chunk of DPS for you...how long did it take to get your last 5% of crit rate?   I find piercing howl invaluable being on a PvP server where gnome rogues and fags that jump around constantly (too much counterstrike I think) thrive.  Howl enables me to stop their crap without having to land a hamstring.  I'm getting old...I ain't gonna jump and spin around all over the goddamned place.  Get down here and fight me.<br />
<br />
With Iron will working now (SCREW YOU, KIDNEY SHOT!  SCREW YOU!), that's as deep as I feel I need to go in protection.  I've been protection. I couldn't do a damned thing.  Being arms/fury I've tanked just fine (with a shitty shield I might add, because I'm not motivated to get better) in Blackrock, so I see no reason to change.</div></div><hr />
