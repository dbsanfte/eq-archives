Using new modular items gained from dungeon adventures, characters are able to modify the powers and effects of their equipment, allowing for a tremendous amount of customization.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, implimentation aside (which I'm sure Sony will fuck up in one way or another), this sounds awesome if done right.  You can win a modular item, which seems kind of like a dye, and then bond it to current armor.  Finally we will each get to have (mostly) unique armor.<br />
<br />
What are ya'alls thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as the effects don't get crazy I would enjoy it. Probably they will be limited to small stat, ac, hp and sv increases.<br />
<br />
 I think if they inlcuded something that upped dmg or lowered dly it would really mess up some stuff. Like top-end rogue weapons w/ 1 dmg increase and 1 dly decrease would be a hefty difference, also think of top-end ranger bows, 1 dmg inc, 1 delay decrease, then they juice up a single arrow the same way ( Endless Quiver ). <br />
<br />
As a non-raiding warrior, I am getting close to running out of possible upgrades without changing guilds ( I dont want to do that ). With this system I could still 'upgrade' if the drops were reasonably attainable but not over-powering.<br />
<br />
GL to SOE, cause implementation of this is gonna be hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My bet is the best modifying you could do would be like adding a Level 1 PoP-Flag charm. (2ac +1stats +1resist 10hp/mana)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding from what I read, and of course I could be wrong, is that you would be able to add the stats a certain peice of equipment is lacking.  The write up on the website includes a little more than just what Vigdis quoted, not much, but a little.  For example, you might finally be able to add some str, sta, or hp to those cobalt pieces that have absolutely nothing.  I can't imagine though that they will allow you to upgrade more than a couple points of anthing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) Impacts on traded goods; will it upset the value of existing goods?  Will items that have been modulated be tradeable?  Will modulating a tradeable vs no drop be any different? Will a modulted item be considered &quot;un lore&quot;?<br />
<br />
2) Will it be stats/resists affecting or will it actually add effects (i.e. + dodge) and/or clickies (see invis etc)?  If it adds anything more than stats/resists there is potential for gross mayhem to class balance and/or the space time continumum (ok perhaps I exaggerate)<br />
<br />
3) Will it be possible to &quot;demodulate&quot; from a piece of armor? If not then will the &quot;modulating devices&quot; be tradeable?  If the they are not demodulatable and not tradeable the utility of these will be quite low (each person would need to be certain of applying it to exacyly the piece they already owned...a very limited capability)<br />
<br />
Seems to me if this is done wrong it could really have a bigger impact than they might realize.  My suspicion is that the modulation will be added as a charater specific ini related change and the base item in the database will remain unmodified (hence not tradeable etc).  Just a guess from an &quot;easiest path&quot; implementation point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinj</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flair's post hurt my brain. I'm a big stupid tank and that was little to in depth.. But seriously, the player base will find a way to reap mod items for all they can till SOE nerfs it. Same story, different day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember reading somewhere (don't ask me where, it's been a while...probably in some Dev Q&amp;A somewhere) that EQ2 will have items that can be modded, similar to Diablo's &quot;gems-in-the-hilt&quot; method. These would add some small stat or resist buff(s) to the weapon/armor, thus creating more unique items. I remember them saying that it would be a fairly easy procedure to replace/remove/upgrade the socketted gems.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that SOE is basically testing the feature in EQ so they can get an idea of how it works &quot;live.&quot; One other thing...if I recall correctly, the modular base items were new armors and weapons, not existing ones, so I doubt that would do much to the market for existing gear, other than the usual downward trend when something newer and shinier comes along.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My vote is that this crap is gonna be exactly like armor dyes, because it has to be.<br />
<br />
This isn't going to create an infinite number of different items in the game, because the game reads items off a database that tells it what they are.  What I suspect this is going to be is like the armor dye..you don't modify the armor, you modify the slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard rumors that it will work something akin to marrowind, collect a stone, trap some magic in it and have a NPC work it into your armor and try to exploit its power, fails are possible<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
if its placed on a slot, that would kick ass, and haass is right(on the database issue) i have my sources, but if you were to be a GM someday you can get any item you want via<br />
<br />
#summonitem #####<br />
<br />
everything in EQ is in a HUGE database that is searchable, manglo uses this to its advantage because the item numbers are stored in your system ROM untill you leave EQ, thats how it reads it<br />
<br />
altho if it was not by slot the could do it this way(morrowind system of hex'ing it)<br />
<br />
#####(item number) and the #####(modifiers)<br />
<br />
and it would be saved on you character like this #####_####<br />
so when you log it it first loads your item, then your modifers<br />
(hey they made bards, nothing could be harder to code IMHO )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuvian</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they will prolly make the item u mod no drop after,hope they do that :~)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Morrowind, thats called Enchanting, and if you played Morrowing enough, you know that skill is overpowering and breaks the game if you are not a serious player that has common sense :)<br />
<br />
So, if they use the same system here, it will prolly break the game unless some restrictions are applied</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Haass they wont re-work the data model for this.   But if they treat this like dyes it probably means that it will just be added to the character .ini settings on the server side.  Kinda interesting because it would be stuck against a &quot;slot&quot; and not an item.  That means no impact to trading, making dumb decisions etc but also means no true modified items.  Heh should be interesting.<br />
<br />
The morrowind model IMHO aint gonna happen.  In that model you have a soul gem, cast a capture spell, defeat a critter, have the soul then go into the gem and then use that gem to alter an item (adding a spell effect to it).  So with a little work you could have a sword that makes you invis and levitated permanently while equipped.  Also that sword would still be tradeable.  Heh kinda clear on why that aint gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why add it to a slot then, just add it to the base stats of the toon......</div></div><hr />

Not quite as exciting; on the other hand, then we wouldn't have to agonize over which peice of armor we are most unlikely to upgrade.</div></div><hr />

My god dude you need a reality check.  The promotion for Luclin included an all new Bazaar, and a new user interface, NEITHER of which came out with the expansion.<br />

They've been spinning stories better than politicians for 5 years now, I can't believe you're still blind to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something in the line Warrior Items grants +30 HP +2 STA and Paladin Item +20 HP +2 WIS +10 Mana.<br />

If the Modular Items are ALL / ALL the gap between Warriors and the other Classes concerning HP will get narrower yet again!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavariel Baenre</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been confirmed by the chat with SOE devs on Gamespy that the armor &quot;Augmentation&quot; does infact change the item itself. These changes are not like the armor dye system, infact he admitted that they had to rewrite coding for the entire item base to be able to handle this.<br />
<br />
To go on further with this, the changes made to an item are not permanent. You CAN take off an augmentation from an item however you must bear in mind that the upgrade reagent will be lost forver. Therefore you should think twice before putting that +10str/-10sta mod on your sword, for example.<br />
<br />
Also, the devs went on to say that the reward system is going to be on a purchasable system. From what I gathered from what was said, you can sort of &quot;buy&quot; the rewards based on your success through the dugeons. They didn't elaborate on it, however it does seem like you will have some choice in what loot you actually will be receiving from participating in LDoN events.<br />
<br />
Further more, the devs explained that there will be 48 new zones all of which you have access to participate in whether you are 32 or 65 for example. They went on to explain the hardware upgrades for this, and said something along the lines of 55,000 players can be participating at once. I could be wrong, will have to double check it when they post the logs.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, hope that clears the air on some things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW is all i can say, if items request that you kill something to gain something paladins are fucked, think about it, they need every stat except chaisma and int/wis ( one of the 2), if killing a stat for another makes the amount of change greater i can convert all that crappy mana plus crap into HP and all that wis/int into sta<br />
<br />
WOOOOOOOT (pray's that the case, that there has to be a sacrefice because it would give those that specialize more use than those that have to use almost every stat IE: hybrids)</div></div><hr />

Rough translation -- Camp your rewards just like the charms in LoY.  And who has a charm these days?  Oh that's right, it's the only charm worth wearing, the one from PoP flags.</div></div><hr />

just wait until charms have focus effects and flowing thought.</div></div><hr />

LoY has been out how long now?  And is there a single charm worth using in that expansion?  No, they added one to PoP progression that was ridiculously above and beyond what anyone else could get for that slot, and there is no middle ground, as usual.  You got crap, and you got uber.<br />
<br />
And as for me being a cynic, the only people I've met that aren't cynical about this company and the products they put out are the blind or people who haven't been playing long enough to know what's really going on.  Take a look at the last patch..they did ONE GODDAMNED THING, and it required an emergency patch to implement.  This has been going on for years now, it's no surprise when they screw up anymore becaue people expect it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yeksha was mainly for spell books and new code, as well as revnue to hire more temporary coders to help implement the new item database, expect to see charms as a quest reward for many future quests in many expantions</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail2149.html?story=2149<br />
<br />
No evidence yet of Class specific Augmentations, which are a must of course. Otherwise the gap between knights and warriors for HP and AC will get narrower still.<br />
<br />
The fun thing is that they also suggested you could upgrade an old banked item with this system. I first have to see this to believe it.<br />
<br />
The first thing i thought about when they came up with the idea of augmenting &quot;old&quot; items was the epic. But i think the warrior epic is one of the items you can't upgrade with this system, because of the fact that you can &quot;destroy&quot; it by turning it into a 2 hander or 1 hander. Maybe they should just upgrade those weapons for free, not that it really matters anymore for most.<br />

I'd probably set up the stat status and item storage code to use 2 numbers: a base item ID, and a 2nd number that encoded the 1-3 modifiers on it (or null if it's not modified).  Bingo, no massive DB bloat.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they allow much bigger modifications to nodrop items, also perhaps implement level restrictions on the strength of mods added as well.  Could also just slap the nodrop flag on any item with a mod I suppose... either way, they'll have to do something creative to keep mods from becoming massive twinkfests w/o nerfing them down to where they are useless (a.k.a. LoY charms).<br />

Hopefuly there will be FT, melee/casting skill, Vengance, and maybe even focus type augments as well.  Adding  +2 base damage to most weapons is very DPS upgrade, and I don't believe the ones shown on Alakazaam are the high end augments...</div></div><hr />
