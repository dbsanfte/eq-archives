My freind told me to kill these ogres in the Alterac Mountains but I don't want to waste all my time on killing these things only to get a couple gold out of it. <br />
<br />
My question is: Do any of you know where another great place to grind to get my mount??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crushridge ogres in Alterac Mts still give  decent exp at lvl 40 They are easy to kill. They drop a couple Silver, lots of Silk, occasional Green/Grey items that sell good, some Mageweave, and if your a miner the mining spots there are great. At your lvl not gonna find much better as far as cash/loot/minerals goes.</div></div><hr />

A good place to get both money and exp at lvl 40 is scarlet monistary.</div></div><hr />

There are Gnolls in Feralas that drop Greens, Mageweave/Silk, and cash.  Both of these are solid money camps.  Did these guys from 40-42.    You can also hit many Woves/Bears if skinning is your proffession.<br />
<br />
Do you have Skinning/Mining as your tradeskill?  If so you can try the Yeti in Feralas...there are Truesilver/Mithril &amp; Iron/Gold nodes in the caves and the Yeti skin for a ton of Thick Leather, drop 4-6s a kill and the occasional green.  AWESOME money, here.  Went from 30-ishg at 42, to 46 w/ mount and 100g in the bank in about 4-5 days of casual play (3-4 hours a day).  Plenty to kill.</div></div><hr />

You'll get tons of money from there. Loot all the sellable trash drops, and roll for green items that no one in the group wants to sell on the AH.</div></div><hr />

You are going to level a lot faster than you get cash no matter what you do so not buying the laughable upgrades will save you a lot of money. If you do tradeskills I also recommend putting those off until you get your mount.</div></div><hr />

No, you do need more than that, but not much.  You should see my trainer heh.<br />
<br />
You need one rank of Cleave, Overpower, Revenge, Disarm, Shield Bash, and intimidating shout and Thunderclap.<br />
<br />
Keep up on Charge, Shouts, Sunder, Rend, Hamstring, and Execute.<br />
<br />
The rest, can kiss my ass.</div></div><hr />

Keep, there shouldn't be any aggro guards near though.<br />
<br />
Doubt you can solo these at 40 but those goblin pirates in the Tanaris area by the beach drop good loot and can be duoed with a healer.  One of my priest guildies soloed there from 44+ and got an excess of gold so he bought me my mount hehe.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gash</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for replying all of you and I will check out all those locations. I do have a priest freind that said he would help me get the gold so maybe we'll do some scarlet monestary or taranis. Then Ill probably check out feleras. Well thanks a lot guys Im going to check those locations out soon.  :)  :)  :)  :)</div></div><hr />

These are nice too. There are 3 quests that can be done by collecting drops from them and they also drop a fair amount of vendor loot and elemental earth (which sells very well on alliance side cenarius due to inflated prices). I was grinding on them for half a level and made about 15 gold.</div></div><hr />

I've been wandering around trying a few different places, but I can't find any mobs with a consistant drop rate. <br />
<br />
Think it would be more worthwhile to farm lower level mobs or a instance? Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khalad</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just stumbled on the Ogres in Alterac Mts today and banged out 34 there. The silver feel freely but I only saw 1 iron deposit. There were others there so I just might not have been in the right area to see more veins.  Personally I'm more concerned with getting plate armor over a mount also. It does seem like a good place to raise cash at 39 or 40 as you'd smoke through the Ogres fast .</div></div><hr />

Especially if you're a smith...no point in sitting around waiting for Heavy Mithril until 44.</div></div><hr />

I already got my warrior with Plate armor for every slot availible so Im set for that.</div></div><hr />

Azshara/Winterspring appear to be quite popular with the rang-rangs, so try there first.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Crap this isn't NASIOC. I mean, I agree with what was quoted :P<br />
<br />
Elementals are easy to kill and drop stones which sell for a couple silver each, and the town is right nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">03-20-2005, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say grind instances. Blue drops sell really wel on AH, and plenty of other stuff goes well to vendor. Could duo something like gnomeregan or something with a healer perhaps, so you get more loot. I've never farmed and almost never kill for just exp, just been doing quests and instances, and atm doing really well as far as money for my mount goes. <br />
<br />
Farming could work for you, i've never tried actually farming in WoW, but it seems a bit too boring :P</div></div><hr />
