What the fuck does that have anything to do with hating Bush? I listen to mainly only punk, and I form my opinions by myself. And quite honestly, I think both Kerry and Bush are morons, but I'd vote for the lesser evil: Kerry.<br />

Of course, I live in Canuckistan, so nothing I say about this really matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I wonder where all the good reporters went, gone are the days where we have people that report the facts and show some self control, now all we have are these shallow witted asses selling it to us like they are gossiping around the water cooler, news should not be casual, it should be facts... I see this on cspan, I see it on CNN, I see it on fox news, hell I am starting to see it on PBS.... you have got to be shitting me you know?<br />
<br />
You know it is amazingly stupid to fall into that sort of bullshit that the media pushes you into, think for a second and you will see that they DO have their own agenda because they have share holders that could rip the company out from under them (such as bush having a controling amount of stock in fox news) if they do not favor certain people, the country is so divided it is unreal and it is sad when our pres said that he is a uniter not a divider....<br />
<br />
I would vote for nadar or one of the other parties if they had a chance, the sad truth is one group wants to drive off the cliff 50 MPH and the other group wants to drive off at 65 MPH, but the third guy just wants to hit the breaks and get back on the road but the other 2 clowns say he has no chance of being picked... and being the brainwashed sheep that we are we listen to them and refuse to vote any way but repub or dem.<br />
<br />
Main reason people vote for kerry is the following<br />
<br />
1) They think kerry is less evil, or at least may take us into a more comfortable evil.<br />
<br />
2) He will not inact the draft, no president does this in their first term because it is political suicide, and this is well known.<br />
<br />
3) Bush has been a pathological lier and has put rose tinting on every negative aspect, people are sick of seeing bullshit dressed up to the level of pretty bullshit. (as such, no one beleaves that he will not use the draft or that he has a real plan for iraq and health care... the reserves are putting in more time than the active duty military people in some cases, that is not the job of the reserves... back door draft is what I call it)<br />
<br />
4) Probibly knows that any tax cut for us will be overshadowed by one for the rich at the same time.<br />
<br />
5) Probibly knows that bushs brand of school improvements lead to dumbasses like me if you look at his &quot;great&quot; work in texas, and his strides in forgetting to fund no child left behind.<br />
<br />
I voted for nunya, nunya damn buisness. (and I am voting age thanks)</div></div><hr />

My thoughts exactly ... except i'd vote for Bush as the lesser of two evils.  <br />
<br />
Ps- Michael moore Spockmaster?  Talk about steaming piles of donkey-shit ... you really should screen the trash you're feeding your brain.  I don't consider myself a conservative/liberal republican/democrat at all ... but i know garbage when i see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fox and CNN have both made a few choice remarks about punk music stations, channles and listeners being anti-bush and anti-moral but they are just blowing smoke up some peoples butts, at least I know better than to beleave such assnine generalizations.<br />
<br />
As for M.m. I think dems and repubs hate him because he can overexpose any of their own dirty little secrets if they somehow garner his attention, I think liberals hate him because he is on the same side as them but he is the type that is likely to cause street fights and they do not want to take any real action to get what they want... his actions throw their cowardly squibbling into relief like a wood carving... I will say he does a good job of fact finding but I am not a fan of his spin, I am not a fan of any spindoctor and their spin.<br />
<br />
Honestly I love facts and hate opions when it comes to political things, enough of a derail tho.<br />
<br />
VOTE this year, it is important and if you want a third party, VOTE that way because those talking heads have no right to tell you it is a throw away, it is only a throw away if people beleave that.</div></div><hr />

It's more of the fact that most people who listen to punk (mostly the poseurs and the hype-hoppers) are ALL most surprisingly anti-Bush! It's the cool thing to hate Bush!<br />
<br />
That said, vote Nader! (or Stalin, if we can revive him.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume since you have a problem with the anti-bush people that you like bush yourself so I see it as my duty to point out how bad of a viewpoint you have on political scum.<br />
<br />
I find it sad I know more about bush, the carlyle group, the name under the blacked out smudges on bushs military records, and haliburton contracts than ANY friggin bush loyalists... the last time I went on a political rant I was not as well informed as I am now but as they say hindsight is 20/20, I just find it sad that the people who know the most about GWB happen to be his &quot;haters&quot; and not his followers.... it is because you are probibly sheep who will do anything while your being told to sit down and roll over at the same time while the talking heads, pill poppers and addicts fuel your hate for anyone outside your narrow view.<br />
<br />
the important thing is that people go out and seak information and not pull any &quot;burden of proof&quot; crap, I'll give you my sources but don't expect me to find a online archive of all documents, sometimes you have to go to that place called a library (you have heard of it right) and look thru their newspaper clippings, of visit a government archive and look at old documents and put two and two togeather... this is not a court system and I do not need to set it all at your feet, telling you where to go to see it for yourself should be enough... as long as you truely care to see what is there to be seen... most people use that &quot;burden of proof&quot; as a way to say I will not listen unless it is shitting on my doorstep and I have found, in verious ways and forums, that these people are beyond help.<br />
<br />
If you do not support him then I am sorry for jumping the gun, I just took the Nader thing as sarcasm and if you do not wish to talk politics then that is fine too, often I get hotheaded about such things and our guildmates may come by the forum at some point and we might piss someone off :P</div></div><hr />

I am voting for Bush and proud of it!!!   Kerry is a traitor like Hanoi Jane.  I say give me the biggest damn tax cut I can get.

<br />
Sure it will, he is safeguarding it by opening it up so that kids no longer have to pay into it with the same percentile as you do, as well as making a special SS for illegals that in many respects has more rights and flexibility than you and I are prevy to, but that is all I am going to say for now  :D <br />
<br />
Tho I do wish to know, how is kerry a traitor?<br />
<br />
I really wish a vote for a third party would do some good from me, I do not like kerry but I know the &quot;traitor&quot; angle is a bit overspun... I do not wish to vote for bush, or kerry but I do know what is best for the country and that is not four more years of the same fearmongering, middleclass gutting type stuff<br />
<br />
(reason they are trying to do away with the middle class is to increase the amount of poor people so that they enlist in the army, looking to history that is what such action fosters... that and it makes money for &quot;united defense&quot; under the carlyle group backed by saudy&lt;.missspelled I am sure.&gt; hard money, which invests that back into hal. who gives a kick back to a few other groups that trickles into bushs pocket a few miles down the road, which I would go into further detail about but I do not have my &quot;anti-bush&quot; &quot;propaganda&quot; on hand *grins* but I am sure no one beleaves that heheh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vick</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Listening to punk doesnt make anyone a punk more than it makes them a hick. People have lost the true meaning of punk with the blue spiked hair and stud's on every piece of clothing possible. Its nothing more than a state of mind. If you dont have that state of mind dont worry about who does. I agree with what someone said about the Poseurs favoring Kerry which proves they are poseurs. If its a mass favor of the &quot;punks&quot; to vote Kerry then they are conforming. <br />
<br />
I happen to feel Bush should finish what he has started even if he has shagged up over and over again. Why would anyone want to deal with learning a new persons ka ka when you already know what to look for with Bush. If a draft comes and you get drafted its your fault for not being in school or holding a full time job. If your still living at home off your parents working part time at Mc Donalds and waisting your life away you deserve to be Drafted to do something constructive with your life. However i do feel the draft is a bunch of poop and against our basic freedoms, it would serve its purposes. <br />
<br />
I just really dont feel like dealing with John Kerry on the news everday repeating &quot;I served my time in the army. And i got a purple heart. Infact i got three.&quot; Who cares what people have done in the past. People are focused on that instead of the ka ka that they &quot;plan&quot; on doing. Again, we all know what to not expect from what bush says he'll do. Why give up a broke in wallet for one thats gunna do nothing but chafe your ass for the next four years?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
 By the way the whole &quot;doing away with the middle class&quot; thing sounds like your saying the government is hiring a bunch of hitmen to go to the Rural Areas of the US and killing everyone who makes a moderate living. They can Tax all they want but the middle class will always be there because its the shagging middle. At most there can be a new definition of middle class. And by class i mean how much money the family takes in. For as long as there are people who take in millions of dollars a year and people who live on the streets there will always be people taking up that middle column.</div></div><hr />

Well I care when a guy gets personal favors to dodge military service, is a c- student at Yale, was wild ass coke addict with DUIs and used to blow up frogs as kid with firecrackers.  <br />
<br />
Also I care that over the last 4 years he has followed a path of reckless budget deficits (something that is more liberal than conservative).  I also dont like the fact that there are still substantial parts of Iraq that the American military fears to tread.  Letting a c- student run the country is a bad mistake...posturing cant make up for competence.  But hey Costa Rica and Poland are part of the grand alliance!<br />

If a draft comes and you get drafted its your fault for not being in school or holding a full time job.&quot;<br />
<br />
First of all, you say &quot;anyone&quot; so that means I can reply.<br />
<br />
Its like gangrene, cut off the foot before you loose the leg.<br />
<br />
As for the draft they DO NOT take the common vagabonds and dropouts first, your uninformed.<br />
<br />
There are 5 levels to the draft, people who have passed highschool and are single are in section 1, and section 5 is convicts to give you an idea.<br />
<br />
They start with section 1 and move to section 5, taking a certain percentage/threshold before taking people from the next section.<br />
<br />
Basically they prefer decently educated men to dropouts or convicts, but keep in mind drop outs are not in group 5. they do not want to intrust a gun or information(or information they might overhear) to someone of questionable moral standing or someone who is stupid(and in many cases with drop outs) or mentally unstable, tho I do not mean this as a broad generalization with the schools in the shape they are in dropping out is almost preferable.<br />
<br />
&quot;something constructive with your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
My life is my property, my liberty and my right to happyness<br />
<br />
Drafting me robs me of my liberty, that is slavery and because they take something I do not consent to giving that is also theft because my body is a result of my time and effort, and a result of time and effort is property... I think the same law we beleave in should make this clear that the draft is not right for americans or our country.<br />
<br />
As for contructive, I do not count bombing and shooting civs as constructive because I am robbing others of their life, murder and theft in one bullet... it takes part of your own soul with it as it leaves the chamber... if you have any friends on active duty, ask them how it feels to shoot someone, even if they make it out of iraq they are scarred for life.<br />
<br />
As for the war itself let me point out a few facts<br />
<br />
1) as far as terrorism goes, we had less active troops at any one time searching for osama from sept 11 to now than we have in an active NYPD day/nightshift.<br />
<br />
2) in feb 2001, several members of bushs cabnet were asked about iraq, condie along with a few others said that iraq was NOT A THREAT and was not making WMD's, nor did they have the ability.... they changed their story fairly quickly didn't they?<br />
<br />
3) Iraq has never directed a threat agenst our soil, never killed one of our civs or made a move to attack us EXCEPT for desert storm, which I may remind you was us sticking ourselves in harms way to save our buddy's in the oil business because they were cutting us a better deal than the OPEC people<br />
<br />
4) We have not found anything that we said we went in to get, and that we were sure they had, we have also not proven a link between terrorism and iraq, this was all in bushies head and he rose tints it and tries to play it off as us removing a dictator, which he now says was the original intent<br />
<br />
As far as that last bit goes, yes we removed a dictator but come on folks....<br />
<br />
Their army was destitute, they were all doing fairly well compaired to some of the other places... not saying well enough but I am saying there are more pressing dictators to topple, iraq is a clownfish in a sea of sharks when it comes to power and threat and his justification is lacking.<br />
<br />
As for purple hearts, thats the talking heads.<br />
<br />
They have brought up iraq again and again because it is a hardpoint with voters, people speaking for and agenst him bring it up and he hardly ever mentions his medals from what I have seen... I am sure he did not repeat it as many times as bush's &quot;americans are safer&quot;x37(or was it 47) crap.<br />
<br />
Our actions have probibly gotten alot of fresh blood into the ground as well into the terrorist training camps, not to mention our global confidance is at an all time low.</div></div><hr />

I think the same law we beleave in should make this clear that the draft is not right for americans or our country.<br />
<br />
So if I disagree with taxation, it is now theft, because it is the taking of my property without my consent?  Some might argue that the draft is actually a form of national obligation, similar to taxation.<br />
<br />
-edit- edited to add what I think is an interesting side note.  A number of countries have enforced military service, such as Israel and Switzerland.  I find Switzerland interesting, due to their long history of neutrality.<br />
<br />
As for the war itself let me point out a few facts<br />
<br />
1) as far as terrorism goes, we had less active troops at any one time searching for osama from sept 11 to now than we have in an active NYPD day/nightshift.<br />
<br />
I'm just curious, what IS the number of active officers on an NYPD day/night shift?<br />

For one, it is in Farenheit 9/11...tapes of Colin Powell among others saying that Iraq had no WMDs and was not pursuing them in Feb 2001.  Try a google or LexisNexis search.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, first off, I think many folks disagree with taxation too.  We are just thrown in jail if we refuse to follow through on it, heh.  In other words, we don't have much of a say.  But we DO have a say in enforced military service by voting for a President that will not enslave us and (hopefully) not stupidly entangle us in international battles without the support of strong international allies. <br />

According to Powell - who later promised we'd find WMD in Iraq - Saddam &quot;has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power against his neighbors.&quot; All because our sanctions against Iraq have worked, at least according to Powell in February of 2001.</div></div><hr />

Tax does not = draft<br />
<br />
I could say many reasons why but the first and most basic is, tax does not apply to just one sex, and it does not go away if you happen to be in yale, tax is fair in most cases and if it isn't someone is there to fight it (watchdog groups)<br />
<br />
As for the feb 2001 footage, it was eather CNN or MSNBC but one of them has a website that is a footage repository and you can find most speechs on it, some of it you have pay/write in for if it is exceedingly popular because of bandwidth constraints. <br />
<br />
As for active NYPD staffers I'll go look, be back in 20 min as I need to shift thru some papers for it.<br />

Books to read for ninja and zito: stupid whitemen by MM(sure you know what that stands for) and the best democracy money can buy by greg palast, then watch F. 9/11 (sure you know this one too :P)<br />

Maybe read the 9/11 report put out by the panelists? must warn you bush removed 13 pages regarding the saudys (which is also why his military records are &quot;black marker&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 There are currently 39,110 police officers in NYPD. This is the total number of Police Officers, Detectives, Sergeants, Lieutenants, Captains, Deputy Inspectors, Inspectors, Deputy Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs, and Bureau Chiefs budgeted for fiscal year 2003.  <br />

Don't think that osama is the black sheep eather, he is can be spotted at the weddings of his family members LONG after he was supposedly cut off from the family (that is what the family head has been saying when caught on camera) right up until sept 11<br />

Actually Gerick, no I'm not happy with something THAT official.  In that transcript, yes Powell does say that sanctions had been working, that Iraq had been crippled by them in their military programs.  However, he does not say Iraq has no WMD and is not working on them.  What he says is that they have been unable to develop them, not that they have stopped trying.  He also says, as does the rest of the administration, as did Clinton, and many many other people, that sanctions hurt the Iraqi people as well as the government, and could not be continued indefinitely.  In that same transcript, he also alludes to the fact that Iraq was selling oil outside of the oil-for-food program for additional hard currencies, and at other times he specifically stated that it was feared that these additional monies were being used as funds, or were planned to be used as funding for additional weapons programs.<br />
<br />
As for your comments on taxation; again, not a valid argument.  Who's to say that the draft will apply to only 1 sex (if it occurs, which I personally doubt)?  As well, tax usually DOES go away if you're in Yale, as you aren't earning enough to pay tax.  Some might argue that, like taxation in your opinion, the draft IS fair.  If you are undergoing education, or working in an occupation valuable to the nation's interest (while any occupation is valuable imo, some might be considered &quot;more valuable&quot;) you don't get drafted.<br />
<br />
One other thing that I'd like to mention, that I missed in my other post;<br />
<br />
3) Iraq has never directed a threat agenst our soil, never killed one of our civs or made a move to attack us EXCEPT for desert storm<br />
<br />
What about the Iraqi support of Palestinian suicide bombers, who most definitely included Americans among their victims?  Or a post-Desert Storm quote from Hussein, &quot;American and British interests, embassies, and naval ships in the Arab region should be the targets of military operations and commando attacks by Arab political forces&quot;??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, first off, I think many folks disagree with taxation too.  We are just thrown in jail if we refuse to follow through on it, heh.  In other words, we don't have much of a say.  But we DO have a say in enforced military service by voting for a President that will not enslave us and (hopefully) not stupidly entangle us in international battles without the support of strong international allies. <br />
<br />
You are also thrown in jail if you don't follow through on being drafted.  You also have a say in taxation by how you vote. For example, I'm quite sure I can dig up a candidate who would propose/has proposed banning all taxation.  <br />

Iraq sold its own oil, they hold it and they should be able to do with it what they needed to and because they could not thousands of children died before the age of 5 due to water related issues as well as bad food (I can also dig up some numbers for this as well)<br />
<br />
Things could have gone on without issue, we could have even dropped the sanctions and improved relations with iraq by giving them a hand and looking alot better in the face of the world, maybe even have had a real backing to fight terror.<br />

Then why did you use the movie as a proof instead of saying Condi and powell said with their own lips. Using a one sided movie as proof is pretty unconvincing. <br />

As for your figures of NYPD vs Troops, what were you trying to say in this? I thaught it was you that was against bush and &quot;his war in iraq.&quot; Sounds to me like your saying we need more troops there. <br />
<br />
In my opinion its good that we went and found out that there were no &quot;WMD&quot; in Iraq because before we went we had no clue what they had and only knew that we werent on their Favorite people list. Yes its a sad thing that we lost Americans (not murderers as your portraying them to be) and its sad that we had to resort to killing some of them to protect Americans. <br />
<br />
Had we not had gone, people would still be voting against bush because he took no action for what has happened to America in the recent years. You say no to a c- yale student. I still say that c- average while doing coke and partying every night in Yale is more of an achievement than what were doing here and am proud that we have a president that will defend us and Kick some ass when it comes down to it.</div></div><hr />

Sales tax at the point of sale are a result of state government, not federal, no?  As for the paycheck thing; sure, Uncle Sam gets a cut, so long as you are over the minimum level (which many/most students are not)<br />

Oh FFS Gerick, use your head.  The program was widely known as the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; program.  That was NOT its only use.  All humanitarian supplies were included.  While the program was far from perfect, it was also widely abused by Iraq.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) in feb 2001, several members of bushs cabnet were asked about iraq, condie along with a few others said that iraq was NOT A THREAT and was not making WMD's, nor did they have the ability.... they changed their story fairly quickly didn't they?<br />
<br />
Did I say movie? did I say transcript?<br />
<br />
<br />
No I had simply put up what I knew, they did  say it.<br />
<br />
The fact that it is in the footage repository of CNN and MSNBC, that the government has transcript of it, prove that it DID happen.<br />
<br />
Simpley because moore had said it does not make it an automatic lie<br />
<br />
as for As for your figures of NYPD vs Troops, what were you trying to say in this? <br />
<br />
Context my dear fellow, if you skipped over that the context was the war on terror, facing osama and yes, I was saying we needed more troops after him NOT more troops in iraq, despite the smoke and mirrors used to try and make a link between the two, they are not the samethe war on terror has mutated into a perverse thing indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;because before we went we had no clue&quot; <br />
<br />
Bullshit, in feb 2001 we already knew the truth, bush just saw where his ratings went up after 9/11 and his work agenst osama so he decided a war might be the next best way to keep us in terror so that we trust him and give up rights for false security, he would tell us he can stop us from falling in the tub if we would beleave it and with as little funding as no child left behind is getting I am sure our kids will be that stupid  ;) <br />
<br />
&quot;Had we not had gone, people would still be voting against bush because he took no action for what has happened to America in the recent years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ummm.... IRAQ IS NOT THE WAR ON TERROR!!!111(intentional)<br />
<br />
He went to afghanistan, got rid of the taliban hardpoints(not the group) and moved on is just about hte size of it, afghanistan is a country not a city in iraq, get a map already<br />
<br />
see how easy it is to slip into that paradime? how much you have been indoctrinated?<br />
<br />
&quot;Kick some ass when it comes down to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
hey I am all for that, but it did not &quot;come(s) down to it&quot;<br />

He is to heavy handed for the power he is given by the people, never forget that WE give HIM the power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes its a sad thing that we lost Americans (not murderers as your portraying them to be) and its sad that we had to resort to killing some of them to protect Americans.&quot;<br />
<br />
No shit I have friends overthere who are on extended duty, I know em thru everquest and every last one of them tell me about the bullshit they pull overthere to keep them past their contracts, as for murderers.... you light up (shoot) anyone and you are a murderer, but that does not mean it was an unjust slaying.<br />
<br />
&quot;To protect Americans&quot; is funny because you know what? iraq has not made an attack on us, we were the aggressers in this war no matter what you use to help you sleep at night, there were other paths we could have taken and we ignored them.<br />
<br />
I find it funny he said on fox news awhile back &quot;these are the guys that tried to kill my daddy&quot; <br />
<br />
What an interesting take, seeing as we were the ones going into a fight that did not directly effect our soil/troops/civs<br />

It had to be abused, people need more than food water and blankets and locking down their natural resource is not and was not fair any way you cut it, we had a monopoly.<br />

I understand what you mean tho and your right, as long as we back Israel we will have problems... I guess I would be hated if I suggested we stop backing Israel, besides the saudys own 8% of america (moore was wrong, its not 7% its 8) which is one of the larger slices if you compair it to the money other countrys invest... so its not like it would kill our econemy.<br />

<br />
Agenst us?<br />
Proof please(document numbers), and/or links if you can.<br />
<br />
Like yourself, I'm kinda lazy when it comes to digging up quotes, but it's quite widely known that Hussein paid 25k to the families of suicide bombers, as well as provided training for groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, who included americans among their victims.<br />
<br />
Ummm... minumum wage is the lowest you may be payed and they may take a cut of that, beleave me.<br />
<br />
While I'm not sure of the exact cut-off number, to be below the taxation line, I'm quite willing to bet that a student working part-time (which is about all most students are able to do), especially at minimum wage, would fall below this line.  If I'm not mistaken, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but are school expenses such as tuition not also tax deductible?<br />
<br />
It had to be abused, people need more than food water and blankets and locking down their natural resource is not and was not fair any way you cut it, we had a monopoly.<br />
<br />
As for providing supplies there were many people who just went without post-iraq war, you use YOUR head and look at a map, OIL WAS IT FOR THEM they did not having good farming soil to make a profit from, they did not have enough fish to make a profit from, all they have is oil, the program was not perfect so iraq did what it needed to take care of the flaws it had.<br />
<br />
My god, you really are that... uninformed.  Abuse happened in the form of supplies of humanitarian goods that were shipped in being resold for hard currency (why were these goods sold for currency, Gerick?  To buy ... more humanitarian goods?)  As well, distribution heavily favoured the Iraqi military (hey, we're peaceful, but we're just gonna let it be known that if you sign up for the army, you're going to be eating more and living better than the next guy... ), as well as areas of the country that were loyal to Hussein.  Also, Iraq tried to import goods that were not allowed under the program.  If Iraq truly &quot;did what it needed to take care of the flaws it had&quot;, then perhaps Hussein would have sold some of the vast amounts of gold/art/loot in his palaces, or distributed some of his semi trailer loads of hard U.S. currency to ease the plight of his people.<br />
<br />
As well, Iraq is considered the &quot;cradle of civilization&quot;, eg. the area from which the first known complex civilizations came.  This occurred because the area is extremely fertile for agricultural production, and could support large populations.  It's estimated that in the 11-12th centuries, before the area was decimated by the Mongols, the area that is currently Iraq had a population of anywhere from 13 million to 29 million, which is well above the current population there today.  All this was done with crude, labour intensive methods of agriculture.  So yes, Iraq today, using current technology, is more than capable of feeding itself, or at least would be, had agriculture not been so hugely neglected in favour of the oil industry which provided Hussein with hard currency.<br />
<br />
Why would it not be possible? come one tell me and stop being cynical.<br />
<br />
Saddam's aim always was to grow in power and crush his enemies by whatever means possible and/or necessary.  Ya know, little things like gassing entire areas of the civilian population that were opposed to his rule, supporting terrorism, torture and vast human rights abuses of opponents, invading foreign countries, etc.  The only things stopping him from carrying on with this lovely tradition were the sanctions, and the threat of more direct violence.  Removing the sanctions would have given him free reign to rebuild his military, which you can rest assured would have been the first and only priority of his.</div></div><hr />

You're talking about Fox News being biased, yet you get your ideas from Michael Moore and Al Franken?  It's good for a young guy to be interested in politics, but if you're basing your opinions on that kind of propaganda you're not learning, you're just listening to people who tell you want you want to hear.<br />
<br />
If you want real news, unbiased and comprensive, try www.economist.com  I doubt you have the attention span to read that stuff, but just keep in mind that listening to Moore and Franken, you are not forming your own opinions, you are being told how to think but a couple guys who only want you to hear one side of the story.  The same could be said of right wing guys like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh of course.<br />

It's easier to listen to people who reinforce your beliefs, but a really intelligent person will seek the truth and not what you want to believe, and read intelligent commentary that challenges your ideas.</div></div><hr />

Just so you don't get lost in the argument, this entire bizarre debate came up because Gerick noted that a draft was taking away his liberty and you then compared the loss of liberty to the loss of money.

All this talk about the draft is making me laugh my ass off.  Guess who it was that purposed the reinstitution of the draft in the House of Repersenatives.  A Black Democrat Congressmen of New York (Believe Harlem or Queens) Rangle, oh by the way he didnt even vote yes on his own bill.  It went down in defeat I believe it was approximitaly 3 votes yes, and 420+ no.  There is 435 Seats in the House of Repersentatives but not all of them was present at vote so not positive off the top of my head on total no votes.<br />
<br />
Voting is very important but please if you going to vote for Kerry stay home and dont vote :x !!!!  Any man that betrayed his country like John Kerry doesnt deserve to be Commander in Chief.  Also not sure who stated that Kerry was in the Army that is incorrect he was in the Navy.  There has been no proff that Bush ever did Cocaine.  No one has came forward with credible proof that he had.  Also you can not call him a draft dodger for him joining the Texas Air National Guard he did serve.  If you going to be criticial of Bush on how he served then also be critical on former President Bill Clinton who did everything he could to get out of the Arkansas National Guard.  Bill Clinton also sent American Troops to foriegn Countries for Armed Conflict.  Not one time in Clinton doing so did he ever go before the United Nations to get a resolution like Both George H Bush 39, and George W Bush 41.<br />
<br />
Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Reagan, Newt Gingrinch, Oliver North, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Bob Dole, Zel Miller (yes i actually mentioned a Democrat), our all better to admire as heros over that Michael Moore.<br />
<br />
Oh also President Bush is the true President not Al Gore.  Bush won all the recounts in Floridia ever done.  Electorial College elects the president not popular vote.  That is done to protect the smaller states so California, New York, Floridia, Texas dont get the only say in the election.  In order to be President you need to win 270 out of 538 Electorial College Votes.  To get the number of Electorial College add the total number of House of Repersentatives (435) + Senate (100) + Washington DC (3) = 538.  Need a majority so it is 270 total Electorial College.</div></div><hr />

 One of the funniest things ever is watching the obviously politically naive attempt to fathom how our legislative branch works.<br />
<br />
 - They will tell you that someone voted against funding the military. They'll never tell you that in the middle of the bill to 'fund the military' was a tax break to Enron or an additional couple billion in pork projects or a stipulation that all left handed Swedes are blocked from voting. It's almost like they expect it comes up to this:<br />
<br />
 Senatorguy1: K, next on the bill is Military Funding, 87 Billion. All in favor?<br />
<br />
 Reallyrespectfulhonorable Senatorguys 2 through 57: Aye!<br />
<br />
 Senatorguy1: All opposed?<br />
<br />
 CommieAmericahaterleftwingyliberaltype Senatorguys 58 through 100: Nay!<br />
<br />
 - They will tell you that someone voted for a tax increase, when what they did was vote for a 5% tax cut when the other side wanted a 7% tax cut.<br />
<br />
 - They will tell you that someone wasn't 'doing their job' by voting NO on a bill that passes 98-1. These people are the same ones who most times 'forget' to vote for judges/referendums/etc. when they come up in special elections.<br />
<br />
 Anyways....<br />
<br />
 The facinating thing is the attempt to use the Winter Soldier testimony against Kerry - 'ZOMG he lied to Congress BANZ0RZ!!1!!!111!' - when most people have never read the testimony!<br />
<br />
http://www.c-span.org/vote2004/jkerrytestimony.asp <br />
<br />
I would like to talk, representing all those veterans, and say that several months ago in Detroit, we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged and many very highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia, not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command. <br />
<br />
It is impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit, the emotions in the room, the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam, but they did. They relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do. <br />
<br />
They told the stories at times they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, tape wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the country side of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war, and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country. <br />
<br />
We call this investigation the &quot;Winter Soldier Investigation.&quot; The term &quot;Winter Soldier&quot; is a play on words of Thomas Paine in 1776 when he spoke of the Sunshine Patriot and summertime soldiers who deserted at Valley Forge because the going was rough. <br />
<br />
We who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now. We could come back to this country; we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in Vietnam, but we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, no reds, and not redcoats but the crimes which we are committing that threaten it, that we have to speak out. <br />
 <br />
<br />
To be plain, he NEVER said HE committed a war crime.<br />
<br />
 The fact is, Bush and company told lies about the threat from Saddam Hussein to get authorization to go to war. They lied about solid links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, they lied about nuclear capabilities, they altered testimony they gave to the UN. They deserve reelection no more than Richard Nixon did - since John Anderson isn't running, Kerry gets my vote for that alone.</div></div><hr />

I brought up the taxes debate Vigdis, simply because of Gerick's argument.  He noted, as you say, that the draft would take away his liberty.  He then stated that liberty = time/effort, which he then said made his liberty = his property.  He then stated that as taking away his property (his liberty) without his permission was illegal, it became theft.  Thus my comparison to taxes, which are also obviously property.<br />

You're right, it usually IS funny.  I completely agree.  However, to me it shows an inarticulate, not very well spoken person, but not an idiot.  Must be the redneck in me, but let me translate for ya.<br />
<br />
1) Eg. the docs/ob-gyns aren't being allowed to practice what they love doing, what they studied numerous years for.<br />
<br />
2) Poking fun at himself, while standing by his convictions, a simple &quot;fuck you all, you know what I meant, and I stand by it&quot;<br />
<br />
3) LOL this made me laugh, no translation needed... yep, that's one that would make a lot of ppl shake their heads<br />
<br />
4)Eg. we're gonna bust our asses trying to think ahead of our enemies, trying to figure out what their next move might be.  This &quot;bushism&quot; in particular was one that was in my mind when I wrote in my earlier post how most of his sayings are easily interpreted.<br />
<br />
5)Halfway through his sentence, he couldn't decide if he wanted to use he/she or him/her.<br />
<br />
6)We've already cut off relations with Iran, and imposed sanctions, so that's not an option we can use.</div></div><hr />

George W. Bush, however, signed a law that completely bans partial-birth abortion with no exception even  if the mother's health is at risk by carrying that baby to term.<br />
<br />
Zito, I really don't care what percentage of abortions are from rape/incest or threaten the health of a mother's life, it's wrong to portray them all as being done out of &quot;selfishness, convience, and personal choice.&quot;  <br />
<br />
And by the way, SA is a wonderful place to volunteer at, I've done a fair share with them esp. around Thanksgiving when they distribute dinners.</div></div><hr />

But really, i AM ashamed to have loved a president who had 2 teens stabbed and then run over by a train, then murdered witnesses, and then had Vince Foster shot in the back of the head and then had them crash the plane.  Because, of course, Hillary Clinton being a lesbian and all, she had an affair with Foster and then had him murdered to cover up another scandal... :rolleyes: <br />

Why doesnt the father of the child get a choice?  The father has no choice at all after the baby is concieved.  The Father can tell the mother to have an abortion.  If she does not have the abortion that father will have to pay child suport if they dont marry.  Or if the father wants to do the right thing and marry the women that gets pregenat and she doesnt want the baby it can be aborted?  So how is it right that the women gets the choice and the male either looses a child or looses cash if the baby is delivered.  Of all the abortions each year how many our because of rape or incess?  If it is a pregnancy by rape or incess the sin is not on the women victem.  But with the abortion she is now commiting murder.<br />
<br />
What is the diffrence between a partial birth abortion in the third trimester and bashing the brains of the baby once fully delivered?  So if by that logic Petterson should plead guilty to performing a partial birth abortion with out a medical license.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The father had the choice to either &quot;dip his wick&quot; as Kailyn put it, or to abstain.  If he made the choice to have sex, he's made the choice to deal with the consequences of his action, and that includes child support for 18 years.<br />
<br />
Yes, a woman has a right to get an abortion even if she's married and can have the child.  Morally, I am against that, but I would never dare to presume to ban that because people have different circumstances.  I'd far rather someone murder their child in the womb than pull an Andrea Yates and murder them in early childhood.  I'd rather see a girl have the right to kill her embryo, the product of herself and a rape by her father, than force her to bear it to term with no choice.<br />
<br />
In an ideal world nobody would need an abortion.  To me, the act is reprehensible in most of the situations it's used in but it's crystal clear to me that the choice needs to remain.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Uh, I really don't know what you're on about, but lemme put it to you in words you can understand.<br />
<br />
Bush signed a bill that bans all partial-birth abortions.  That means, Curumtiny, that if the mother is going to have severe health problems or die by having the baby, abortion is still not allowed.<br />
<br />
That kind of black-and-white thinking can get pretty hurtful. <br />
<br />
And with that, I'm out of this thread.  These things never convince anyone to swing one way or another anyhow.  Whether you're pro-Kerry or pro-Bush, middle-of-the-road or whatever, the media will ALWAYS be either liberal or conservative and issues and statistics will always be twisted to support your point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like yourself, I'm kinda lazy when it comes to digging up quotes, but it's quite widely known that Hussein paid 25k to the families of suicide bombers, as well as provided training for groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, who included americans among their victims.<br />
<br />
As for paying 25k, wasn't that during the time we moved into iraq? you expect any nation to just give up?<br />
<br />
As for training, we trained the taliban's father groups, most of the taliban members themself and so on to get rid of the russians.<br />
<br />
Tell me do you think people just forget what they have learned once they serve their purpose? of course not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While I'm not sure of the exact cut-off number, to be below the taxation line, I'm quite willing to bet that a student working part-time (which is about all most students are able to do), especially at minimum wage, would fall below this line.  If I'm not mistaken, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but are school expenses such as tuition not also tax deductible?<br />
<br />
there are deductibles yes, but even minimum wage kids in school have to pay tax right out of their paycheck, but the system may give them foodstamps or something if they happen to live on their own instead of with their perants or something similer... but they still pay income tax because they have an income<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My god, you really are that... uninformed.  Abuse happened in the form of supplies of humanitarian goods that were shipped in being resold for hard currency (why were these goods sold for currency, Gerick?  To buy ... more humanitarian goods?)  As well, distribution heavily favoured the Iraqi military (hey, we're peaceful, but we're just gonna let it be known that if you sign up for the army, you're going to be eating more and living better than the next guy... ), as well as areas of the country that were loyal to Hussein.  Also, Iraq tried to import goods that were not allowed under the program.  If Iraq truly &quot;did what it needed to take care of the flaws it had&quot;, then perhaps Hussein would have sold some of the vast amounts of gold/art/loot in his palaces, or distributed some of his semi trailer loads of hard U.S. currency to ease the plight of his people.<br />
<br />
Gold, art, loot?<br />
<br />
Look at how many homeless there are, how many unemployeed and people who do not have jobs, and have not for so long they can no longer appear on the unemployement count (which is something bush uses to screw with the jobs lost/created numbers)<br />
<br />
Does bush open up his family's wealth to the public? has any rich president done that? NEVER that I can recall so before we call the pot black lets look at ourselves.<br />
<br />
Thats all I have to say about the opening of private stores of wealth... when I see it here then I will beleave others should do it to.<br />
<br />
As for selling some of that, a government runs on cash so he had to make enough money to keep his administration going, as well as buy other things as people can not survive off of just food water and warm blankets, the sanctions would have caused a rebellion if followed and that is probibly the point.<br />
<br />
People need enterainment, people need electricity, people need sports idols and prospects, they need education (I am sure a teacher would want cash after a certain point, they would not have room for fucktons of food)<br />
<br />
How is all this payed for? by having an income via the state/country<br />
<br />
Also as for gold and art being sold off, some of that is not allowed as it falls under the trading with the enemy act signed by teddy, which was used as a model(along with other acts/bills) for the sanctions placed on iraq<br />
<br />
As well, Iraq is considered the &quot;cradle of civilization&quot;, eg. the area from which the first known complex civilizations came.  This occurred because the area is extremely fertile for agricultural production, and could support large populations.  It's estimated that in the 11-12th centuries, before the area was decimated by the Mongols, the area that is currently Iraq had a population of anywhere from 13 million to 29 million, which is well above the current population there today.  All this was done with crude, labour intensive methods of agriculture.  So yes, Iraq today, using current technology, is more than capable of feeding itself, or at least would be, had agriculture not been so hugely neglected in favour of the oil industry which provided Hussein with hard currency.<br />
<br />
They could support that back then, but currently much of their land has mines in it, their farmable land is shrinking as the desert area's expanding, on top of that the recent oil expantions are poisoning the water that would be used in farming by leeching into the groundwater.<br />
<br />
so currently, it would be possible to farm sure... but those eggplants are probibly poison.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Saddam's aim always was to grow in power  and crush his enemies by whatever means possible and/or necessary.  Ya know, little things like gassing entire areas of the civilian population that were opposed to his rule, supporting terrorism, torture and vast human rights abuses of opponents, invading foreign countries, etc.  The only things stopping him from carrying on with this lovely tradition were the sanctions, and the threat of more direct violence.  Removing the sanctions would have given him free reign to rebuild his military, which you can rest assured would have been the first and only priority of his.<br />
<br />
growing in power is the same as growing in wealth, and any nation wants that.<br />
<br />
Gassing people? china had done it too(not doing that currently) and north k is doing it too and they are far more dangerous but we are pussyfooting around with them.<br />
<br />
My point still stands that if we are going to go into atrocitys then we need to smell the coffee here, there were worse dudes out there<br />
<br />
The only things stopping him from carrying on with this lovely tradition were the sanctions, and the threat of more direct violence.<br />
<br />
how can you be so sure? he controlled his own country and attacked a friend of ours, show me where he was some mighty gangus con in training, knocking down country after country.<br />
<br />
  Removing the sanctions would have given him free reign to rebuild his military, which you can rest assured would have been the first and only priority of his<br />
<br />
umm yeah... any nation with something worth money would want an army buddy, when america no longer has one then you can tell me it is the right and just thing to do.<br />
<br />
I am saying people do change, I mean hell bush was a cokehead and a drunk up until he hit 40 and he was able to be president,<br />
<br />
We could have had alot less death, alot less confusion and a better world if we would have successfully gotten iraq into the UN and made them a world partner, and anyone that knows the culture overthere knows you do not back them into such a large change as that... meaning we could have helped them a little bit and made them think of us as friends before offering the choice (which we never even offered in the first place)<br />

the forms of dyslexic error are:<br />
<br />
when remembering something in your head you:<br />
<br />
Switch the first two or last two numbers such s 234 becomes 243 or 543 becomes 453<br />
<br />
words that you do not know switch when reading aloud such as:<br />
<br />
the big ass dog becomes the ass big dog<br />
<br />
when type/writing:<br />
<br />
You commonly switch vows and constaninits (this is the one I suffer from)<br />
<br />
You switch words or double words whiles working in a hurry, such as the the person is an ass, or what is is the answer?<br />

<br />
1) Birth may kill the mother.<br />
2) The baby may be forced on the mother by a rapist, like a father in law and having it will make her feel like she does not even control her own body... mothers in this situtation are prone to killing themselves.<br />
3) baby is extremely retarded, I am talking no legs and 70% braindead<br />
<br />
&quot;sin is not on the women&quot; take your bible off my balls buddy<br />
<br />
Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NAB (this is the law of &quot;gods&quot; people, not god himself)<br />
<br />
If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.<br />
<br />
What kind of lunatic would make a rape victim marry her attacker? <br />
<br />
Deuteronomy 21:10-14 NLT<br />
<br />
Suppose you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God hands them over to you and you take captives.  And suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her and want to marry her.  If this happens, you may take her to your home, where she must shave her head, cut her fingernails, and change all her clothes.  Then she must remain in your home for a full month, mourning for her father and mother.  After that you may marry her.  But if you marry her and then decide you do not like her, you must let her go free.  You may not sell her or treat her as a slave, for you have humiliated her.<br />
<br />
(more of &quot;gods&quot; people at work)<br />
<br />
I am christain by the way, but I know when people use the bible for their own ends and what hell it brings.<br />
<br />
As for that cow standing up in the debate and demanding that her tax dollars never go to abortion... newflash! the woman has to pay for it with her own money, along with her health insurance from work!<br />
<br />
If you have the government medicare... most likely you are to old to even have children anymore<br />
<br />
We need to acknowledge that not ever abortion is the same and we need to stop treating them that way, if a mother will die from having it and the government tells em tough shit they are probibly just going to ram themselves into the corner of a desk or take a flight over to a country where they may get it done, it will happen weather it is legal or not and I would at least like to see 1 life make it thru rather than both being dead... and in most cases with back ally abortions and with mothers dying during labor that is the case.<br />
<br />
As for types of abortion I say it is still killing a child any way you do it, whatever has the least chance of killing the mother would probibly be best and she has to live with what she has done.<br />
<br />
I also think that making laws based on beliefs is the worst way to make laws because it sets that swinging pendulm in motion that has recently slowed to a stop, religion Vs. athiests and that is one hell of a bloody, claw and tooth fight america does not need... we need to be united again.</div></div><hr />

Lets kill 30+ million unborn in the name of selfishness, convience, and personal choice.  I truelly hope Bush wins the election and able to appoint 3 to 4 more judges like Skillia, Thomas.  The thought of a Hillary Clinton as a Justice in the Supreme Court scares the living hell out of me.   <br />
<br />
Your a retard, the supreme court is not an activist group and anyone who wants to make it one does not deserve to run the coutry because it kills checks and balances and the fact we still have the patriot act and patriot act 2 coming proves that bush cares to little about personal rights<br />
<br />
All this talk about the draft is making me laugh my ass off.  Guess who it was that purposed the reinstitution of the draft in the House of Repersenatives.  A Black Democrat Congressmen of New York (Believe Harlem or Queens) Rangle, oh by the way he didnt even vote yes on his own bill.  It went down in defeat I believe it was approximitaly 3 votes yes, and 420+ no.  There is 435 Seats in the House of Repersentatives but not all of them was present at vote so not positive off the top of my head on total no votes.<br />
<br />
Get your head out of your ass, they can vote for the draft any time they want, just because this time was a no does not mean we all get a out of jail free card for the rest of our lives, the reason it did not go thru is because how bush pissed on our checks and balances to go to war<br />
<br />
Voting is very important but please if you going to vote for Kerry stay home and dont vote :x !!!!  Any man that betrayed his country like John Kerry doesnt deserve to be Commander in Chief.  Also not sure who stated that Kerry was in the Army that is incorrect he was in the Navy.  There has been no proff that Bush ever did Cocaine.  No one has came forward with credible proof that he had.  Also you can not call him a draft dodger for him joining the Texas Air National Guard he did serve.  If you going to be criticial of Bush on how he served then also be critical on former President Bill Clinton who did everything he could to get out of the Arkansas National Guard.  Bill Clinton also sent American Troops to foriegn Countries for Armed Conflict.  Not one time in Clinton doing so did he ever go before the United Nations to get a resolution like Both George H Bush 39, and George W Bush 41.<br />
<br />
How did John Kerry betray his country? no one wants to answer that... was it his statements? those were asked for by our country so that we could repair relations dumbass, they wanted him to say that to further our countrys efforts to repair world relations... was it his protesting? thats a right dumbass, and exercising it does not make him a traitor, to be a traitor you need to do something like blow up a chunk of your country, try to kill the president or give away secrets or something equally hanus.<br />
<br />
draft dodger? no<br />
someone who should have been discharged for poor conduct? yes. someone who should not have his military benefits? yes<br />
<br />
Have to pick this out.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you going to be criticial of Bush on how he served then also be critical on former President Bill Clinton who did everything he could to get out of the Arkansas National Guard.&quot;<br />

Clinton is not running asshat, so I do not need to bring up every damn president prior to 2000! I do not care what Clinton did and such arguements are as childish as &quot;Mommy I want 2 candies! No! But mommy that little boy got 2 candies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Reagan, Newt Gingrinch, Oliver North, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Bob Dole, Zel Miller (yes i actually mentioned a Democrat), our all better to admire as heros over that Michael Moore.<br />
<br />
Rush Limbaugh is a tool who is an addict and he spouts random shit that will bolster the stock in the blue chips that he has invested in, while kissing bushies ass, and any time he has a cross word for him (twice in 4 years?) he says it like a simpering mouse and apologizes, as for the other talking heads? Don't make me laugh as they just take transcripts of Rush's show and paraphraise.<br />
<br />
Michael Moore is a better REPORTER than all of the above because he goes out and FINDS the facts, he even has the forsight to get things before they become &quot;black marker&quot; such as bush's military records.<br />
<br />
My beef with Michael is that he harrasses people that he does not need to harrasses in order to make his movies, and that is assnine, I also do not approve of the spin he puts on his words or the condisending tone he uses in every thing he says and writes.<br />
<br />
heros<br />
<br />
The fire fighters that died on sept 11 are heros, not the clowns mentioned above bud, being a reporter means getting facts and getting facts is not heroic unless they had to crawl across glass or something, or they die while reporting from a warzone.<br />
<br />
Facing death is heroism and the fact that you regard any of them as such means you are quick to attach yourself to one side.<br />
<br />
Oh also President Bush is the true President not Al Gore.  Bush won all the recounts in Floridia ever done.  Electorial College elects the president not popular vote.  That is done to protect the smaller states so California, New York, Floridia, Texas dont get the only say in the election.  In order to be President you need to win 270 out of 538 Electorial College Votes.  To get the number of Electorial College add the total number of House of Repersentatives (435) + Senate (100) + Washington DC (3) = 538.  Need a majority so it is 270 total Electorial College.<br />
<br />
Idiot *sighs*<br />
<br />
All the news stations said it was gore except fox news because bush had a brother in there, he called it for bush.<br />
<br />
Then all the other news stations said that fox news said it was bush so he must have won.<br />
<br />
Then all of them checked on it to find out the real deal and found that ballots where missing.<br />
<br />
Then they found out 50,000 voters were held from voting by a purge list set up by database tech. corperation whos head CEO was also bushs 2000 campain lead, and was the first privatized voter purge EVER and it was pushed for by bushs brother, jeb. (by the way, these were legal voters that were held, who were also mostly poor black men and women, historically democrats... Now I know why the cencius's concern for race and income is important to voting)<br />
<br />
I could go on and on about this, point out the connections all the way down to the supreme court calling it for bush, but honestly my fingers are getting tired of lashing out at people who still think there was not at least a few flaws in that election.<br />
<br />
Just watch the election and the errors that are going to come up with the new mechines, since they leave no auditable paper trail.<br />
<br />
Excuse the ire dripping from my post, but all these non-issues and these simpering cries about Clinton(who has next to nothing to do with this election) just make me wonder why our country has not fallen in on itself.</div></div><hr />

Where in Democrat controlled presinks, where the Democrats controll names on the voting lists.  Also on those infamious Butterfly ballots in some of the presinks were made by a Democrat.  Dont blame Bush's for their blocking thousands of voters from voting. <br />
<br />
Furthermore when Floridia was called it was 8pm Eastern, while a part of the Floridia Panhandle which is in Central time still had another 1 hour to vote.  The Panhandle of Floridia is largely Republican.  Many of those Republicans were in line to vote at 7pm when they heard that Floridia was called for Gore at 8pm Eastern.  Many of those Republican voters then left never voting that night.  The fact is Floridia was called for Gore at approx 8:00pm Eastern.  Then later Fox News took Floridia off from Gore win to a wait and see.  Then it moved to Bush where it stayed.  Like it or not Bush won by 900ish votes, then by 500ish after all the recounts.<br />
<br />
Bush could of chalanged elections in other states in 2000 where he lost to Gore by less then 1000 Votes.  Bush lost New Mexico by approx 300 to 500 votes.  Bush lost Wisconsin by approx 1000 votes.</div></div><hr />

I shag up with my english, im not a genius, but i dont go around calling people stupid because they had a c- average in Yale. Hell i consider anyone who gets into yale pretty damn smart.<br />

People say that bush and his cabinet said that Sadaam wasn't a threat back in February of 2001. Ok fine they werent a threat but guess what. Hitler wasnt a threat to jews until he started killing them. Ka ka changes and can change over night. As you know mr all knowing person, we didnt go to war in February it was much later. Has the thaught ever gone through peoples minds that powerful people can decide to abuse their power over night and act on what they want instead of what is best for their country?<br />
<br />
On the same note people say that you cant trust bush yet you believe them when they say a country isnt a threat? Hi2u Hipocracy. <br />
<br />
Even if we did &quot;train taliban&quot; to hurt russia, Russia shaggin hated us. Yet we dont have the right to hate others for doing the same to us?<br />
<br />
You are correct by saying that Iraq can no longer grow crops productively because of mines and oil poluted resivoirs. But thats their own damn fault. They shouldnt have put the mines all through their country ruining their lands. <br />
<br />
Sadaam was a cum guzzling bastard child of Cher. He deserved to be taken out of power and i dont see what people have to back up saying Sadaam did nothing wrong. He abused his powers to gain the wealth that you say he shouldn't use to help his country. If he were smart he would have used it because he sure wont be using it now that he's in captivity.<br />

We back up Isreal and it does piss people off like said before. Said pissed off people take cheap shots at us whenever they can. Im not gunna link them to September 11th because i cant prove it nor can anyone because the commiters of the crimes are dead. No interrogation was possible and links between them and anyone else is 100% assumptions. But i do feel that it was of relations to anti-isrealite countries and sadaam was a supporter of them. We have taken one major terrorist out of the chair of power and we will take more because America doesn't put up with terrorism.<br />
<br />
America does put their nose in other peoples buisness when they shouldnt yes. Vietnam, Korea, and basically every single war America has been in has been because of this in one way or the other. You may say that America needs to stay out of other peoples wars but lets think back to when America stayed out of other peoples wars. Pearl Harbor ring a bell? America was going to stay out of World War II for as long as they could until We were bombed and noone bitched about retaliation except for the people under the shells. But now when a non military base gets massacred people say oh nos dont fuck with the middle east our gas prices will go up like omg.<br />
<br />
*new topic like omg* If Sadaam didnt have control of Oil reserves noone would have gave a ka ka if we stepped in, bitchslapped him and turned him into an unwilling cum recipient. Money is what influences 99% of peoples decisions. But all everyone is doing is shagging themselves over. People put in their mind that gas prices would go up with the war becuase of less crude oil to be imported and it showed the evil oil companies (OMG its no longer the presidents that are evil) that they could raise prices and get away with it yet has anyone seen any shortages? Im in the oil buisness and America has enough oil to last us indefinately. Oil isnt a non replinishing recource its just a recource that goes through a long process to replinish. Just like &quot;omg were cutting down all the trees&quot; grow up and go take a look at how much forests the world has. Stop spreading rumors cuz all it does is bends you over.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S Stop bringing up Micheal Moore. he's a one sided hussie and just waistes everyones time by talking about him. He has no influence in the world whatsoever except in people that are too insecure to grow an opinion of their own. Why not just come out and say Penn and Teller for president? it'd be equally stupid</div></div><hr />

I am already out of highschool and I actively seek out political information, and as the guy who supplys the &quot;stock&quot; for the army and the government with taxes(because I also hold a job) I am an employee of sorts.<br />
<br />
(think of me as a shareholder who wants his share of the profit sharing)<br />
<br />
As for whats going on in my own country I will admit I have a opnion that mirrors that of the british and canadian anti-bush/anti-carlyle group styling.<br />
<br />
As for what I have seen? lots and lots of memo paper, transcripts of offical speechs, electronic media and a plethora of other things well beyond Micheal Moore, but you go on assuming I am just another upity kid that knows nothing, but in this thread I have shown time and again that I remember my facts and dates (feb 24 2001 for example) and I am worldly enough to know things about more religions than just christain sects, but I do know quite a bit about our own...<br />
<br />
I soak up dates and facts left and right... sort of why I love these fights because it always unearths more information... so before you go insulting me you should perhaps provide more than opions? perhaps dates and transcripts? tho I will admit Vig dug up the linky before I could find it, I did bring it up... at least I provide a way for you to figure out why I am batshit crazy.<br />

I thought we were discussing oil, not my credentials.</div></div><hr />

Youve soaked up what they want you to soak up. Werent you the one that said that the media only tells you what the government wnats you to hear? Cuz whoever said that is right. Looking at whats on the news about politics will get you one side of whats going on. <br />
<br />
Noone knows everything about Kerry, noone knows everything about bush but we know more about bush and why take him out of office when he's in the middle of a war? Yes the war is still going on. Kerry doesnt know every agenda Bush had planned with whats happening in Iraq atm. Putting Kerry in office will just have waisted a bunch of lives because he wouldnt obtain the objective that they were put there for. <br />
<br />
And there cant be a discussion about oil with one person. You have to comment on it in order to discuss it.<br />
<br />
There is so much oil in Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming, Oklahoma ect that hasnt been drilled yet it would put Iraq to shame. Underneath Dallas atm there is a Horse Shoe shaped pocket going all the way from basically the center of Dallas looping down south and coming back up around Fort Worth but never really goes outside of the two city limits as far as we can tell. That is an insanely HUGE pocket of oil. But Dallas as a majority has alot of wealthier and older people who dont give a rats butt about making more money so they use their influences in the city to prevent drilling. Note that this particular pocket is covored by extremely hard rock and would take special Oil Rigs to work but it is very doable and would help alot to drill this but people chose not to. Granted its a special case because if it were under say Houston that well would be pumping already. <br />
<br />
However there is a reason for gas prices to be so high. The oil industry is extremely expensive to maintain. I currently work for an Oil Rig Moving company (We break down an oil rig, move it and rig it back up to pump more oil. Process takes about 3 or 4 days and we'll move the same rig every 2 or 3 weeks maybe more depending on how much oil they find. <br />
<br />
Now take into mind that ALL the oil that the world has used up in the past century have all been from very shallow pockets. The earth has layers by age. Oil is created by some process that i dont exactly know but it takes a long time to do. It will start happening shallow under ground and as the earth ages it gets lower and lower and gainign more and more oil. Until it reaches magma and starts the cycle over again. If weve only been using some of the shallow pockets then the deeper pockets house sooooo much more oil than we could possibly find a use for. People claiming we are running out of oil are ignorant. If we ever run out of oil it will be long past the time we are still using oil for vehicles. <br />
<br />
The reason i origionaly braught up Oil is because its a huge factor in presidential candidates as gas prices are so high, and it was  whether people admit it or not, a huge factor in going to war with Iraq.</div></div><hr />

There are a handful of fairly famous, outspoken liberal/conserative party radicals out there on both sides of the fence, and nothing any of them say can be given much credit.  If you're going to reference somebody, then refer to somebody respectable.  If the only person you can find who inferred the point you're trying to make is one of the afformentioned ... or someone quoting one of the afformentioned, then chances are there is a damn good reason why.<br />
<br />
If you want honest, unbiased news then don't turn your TV to Fox or one of the dozens of strongly liberal stations.<br />
<br />
If you want the truth stake yourself out in the middle and use some judgement and common sense.  Filter through the garbage both sides are tossing back forth.  If you only pay attention to one side or the other, of course you're going to see it their way.<br />
<br />
There's a show on Fox news called &quot;The No Spin Zone&quot;.  It's a great idea, but sadly it's still full of spin. <br />
<br />
I'm neither conservative nor liberal.  Quite frankly i think all of our presidential candidates suck ass ... including the small party ones.  For me it will be finding the lesser of evils and running with it.  I have little respect for our current presidents intelligence, but i have equally less (probably far less) respect for Kerry. <br />
<br />
IMO Kerry's only saving grace is that he wants to legalize stem cell research.  For those of you who know what stem cell research actually is you know it's a very benign practice whereby no future babies have to die and no real &quot;funny business&quot; is going on.  The problem is you have a hundred thousand jackasses out there who dont know what the fuck stem cell research is about and jump up on their soap-boxes.  What presents an even larger problem is many of these jackasses hold political office and/or are involved heavily in the media and are free to spread their uneducated horseshit across to the nation, thus increasing the opposition.  If i thought for a second Kerry could actually legalize it he'd have my vote in a heartbeat.  Sadly, though, i know it's pretty much impossible to do and he doesnt have the will/character so see such a sketchy thing through to completion.  Especially considering his past voting/lobbying trends of taking the easy way out and/or backing down from confrontational issues.</div></div><hr />

The differnace between me and most people in my age group is once I hear something that is damning of one side or the other I look into it, and make sure I am not getting a fact+spin but just the fact itself.<br />

Personally I think we are going to hell as a country but bush will get us there faster... I feel like ass for saying it but I would rather deal with that &quot;hell&quot; when I am over 35 when I can run for all of the public offices rather than when I am young and unable to run for anything so kerry will probibly slow down our progression at least a little bit.<br />
<br />
I feel that bush is like gangreen and needs to be chopped off but our only option for this is to use a bloody saw covered in AIDs.... we can live alot longer with AIDs/HIV alot longer than gangreen but it still is not the ideal solution.</div></div><hr />

That said, there is evil and bad things on both sides of the fence.  No party is perfect.  No person is perfect.  No one is even close.  Movies like farenheit 911 and people such as Michael Moore are dangerous because they present all of the bad with none of the good ... with a ton of ficticious deceitful &quot;bad&quot; tossed in to make their point even stronger.  The same movie could have been made of the Clinton administration and it would have been equally damning.  The same movie could probably even be made about your or me as well ... because most people have had their fare share of bad decisions and moral choices.<br />

The Economist is very conservative. Just most of the time it does not apply as they are english and spin our politics to their right.<br />
<br />
The economist is not right wing.  They are in favor of free markets, but besides that they are hands down the most unbiased source of news out there.  Also, they may be based in England, but they print at least twice as much news about the US as they do about any other country.  <br />
<br />
What, besides free trade and free markets, does The Economist believe in? &quot;It is to the Radicals that The Economist still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position.&quot; That is as true today as when Crowther said it in 1955. The Economist considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well asmore recentlygun control and gay marriage. <br />
<br />
I have quite a few fairly rabid left-wing aquaintances who agree with me that The Economist is one of the best sources of news there is.</div></div><hr />

Hehe ... that was actually rather nicely put.  +10 points  :D <br />
<br />
Bush had a hard first term in office.  FFS less than a year into his term what happened?  That's right the single worst national crisis since Pearl Harbor struck home taking out a significant National trademark.  What made it worse is the conspiracy leading up to it was wretchedly diffused all around the Middle east and they were pretty fucking proud of it.  Before you completely lambast our current president try to walk a few days in his shoes and consider the kind of mess he had to face relatively early in his career.  If his biggest sin was leading us to war against Iraq ... boo hoo?<br />
<br />
Bush-  Saddam we need to inspect your country for WMD<br />
Saddam- Ok ...<br />
Bush-  Um ... Saddam you're not letting the inspectors in<br />
Saddam-  I changed my mind<br />
Bush-  You signed an agreement.  We're coming in<br />
Saddam- No<br />
Bush-  Saddam back down or we're coming in forcibly<br />
Saddam- Yeah right (they'll never do it ... I've got a couple UN members in my backpocket).<br />
*reference Oil for Food administration<br />
Bush-  You asked for it ... here i come.  You have &quot;x&quot; time to back down.<br />
Saddam- *rolls his eyes<br />
<br />
*US invades ... Saddam is captured.  His sons are killed.  All attacks cease the moment Saddam's administration is ousted.  Surprisingly few non-militant casualties.  US works to get Iraq operational but are attacked daily by fundamentalists.<br />
<br />
I actually have few regrets that the war actually took place.  It could have been handled much much better though.  Bush had been given information that Iraq had WMD's.  Iraq had a history of stockpiling such weapons ... it was even a large problem during the Clinton administration.  So when Bush says let us in to check (the UN inspectors) and Saddam says no ... what would you have thought.  Saddam was on thin ice thanks to his atrocious past already, and violating this UN agreement went a little too far.<br />
<br />
Saddam needed to go.  It was interesting to learn of all the deviances within his regime, and how it spread out like cancer into other UN countries.  My only regret is that Bush senior and the UN didnt banish him 12+ years ago.  I wouldn't hang bush on the War ... but i wouldnt hang my hat on it as being proof that he's a reliable leader either.<br />
<br />
Anyways the point is this:  he had a harder first term in office than any president before him in a long time.   How would things have worked out with Kerry in the office?  He claims better, but given his past i can't trust that.  My guess is that there is no win to such a situation.  Either you go forward and piss people off or you stand back doing nothing ... pissing people off.<br />
<br />
That said, i still have 0 respect for his intelligence.  His only saving grace is that he stands by the decisions he makes, which is a lot more than anyone say for Kerry.  Given a better opposing candidate i'd not vote for him in a million years.  Sadly, no better candidate is to be found this session.</div></div><hr />

Of course he does.  So Bill o'reily/ anne coulter etc all.  They serve as a muse by which individuals find what they agree with and what they dont.

Something I always try to keep in mind is people may be on your side but they may just as harmful as any lost debates because of how they carry themselves, and someone may be the opposite side of what you may beleave, but that does not make them stupid, far from it.<br />
<br />
I have a question for some of you oldies that have been talking politics while I was still in grade school.<br />
<br />
What was liberial then? conservative? democrat? repub?<br />
<br />
What is it now?<br />
<br />
I know I can not ask something without offering my thoughts because that would be loaded, but my view is that we need to drop the lable baby jr. because they keep changing their shell as easly as a stock car (for those that do not know, you can pop the body off of one by just taking off a few bolts at the bottom, its like this because they get worn quickly and need changing often) so it really just makes calling someone a lib or conserv as much as an insult as calling them an asshole... at least that is how I see it when I do take a little time to watch the news... it always sickens me how they spit out these words with such venom and to make it worse, its changed so much in my lifetime that I do not know how they are trying to be insulting heh.<br />
<br />
I think F911 and PotC can be listed togeather because of the countraversy they bred at release, and again when they went to DVD, they go agenst the grain really.</div></div><hr />

He certainly is biased, no doubt about it.  Some of the points he brings up are somewhat interesting, but I'd want more information before forming a conclusive opinion as to their correctness.  One thing I did note is that he showed a lot of film footage of Bush.  From that footage I observed that Bush sure does come across like a first class idiot.  Half the time he opens his mouth you either can't understand what the hell he is saying or it's completely obvious he is clueless.  I imagine Moore went out of his way to show footage that would do exactly that, but it doesn't appear that it was a very difficult thing to accomplish either.</div></div><hr />

Everything that is caught on camera can bite him in the ass, and he has had to deal with that pressure for 4 years.<br />

Bush has siad that our military numbers can decease due to knew technology and it won't hurt us. Kerry, however, has said he wants to increase our military size by 40,000 troops. Where do you think Kerry will find 40,000 more people to join the militarty? Hello draft. So when you vote for Kerry don't come back her crying about getting drafted, having higher taxes, seeing minimum wage increased to inflate the economy and take another chunk of people from the &quot;middle class&quot; to the &quot;lower class&quot; as his socialist ideas draw us closer to a 2 class system resembling the old Soviet Union. <br />
<br />
However if I owned a big business I'd be in a hurry to vote for Kerry, he wants to rollback Bush's tax cuts to cut corporate taxes, i.e. Heinz corp. Kerry has also voted for every bill to open free trade and send American jobs overseas, so don't bitch when he sends your job off to Africa, wait you'll be in Africa also as a new draftee to the UN military thanks to Kerry so you and your job will be in the same place.</div></div><hr />

I'll chose a slow talkin redneck over a fast talkin liar that wants to raise minimum wage up to $7 or somethin like that just to &quot;stimulate the economy.&quot; If you want to stimulate economy make more jobs instead of pay people that work at mc donalds more. All he'll accomplish by raising min. wage is sell more car stereo systems, cigarettes and beer. <br />
<br />
He could take his min. wage idea and do so much more with it. Make jobs like county clean up services instead of making prisoners do it. Pay people that are desperate enough for jobs that will walk along the highway 10 bucks an hour giving jobs to those that dont have em, causing more people to spend money instead of the same people spending a little bit more, have lower unemployement rate and stuff like that.<br />

I fail to see any creativeness from Kerry or Bush with new proposals. OOO i'll raise minimum wage if you vote for me yeah like other people havent thaught of that before.

And don't fucking say the &quot;War on Terror&quot; because that's a fucking joke. The man doesn't believe there is a difference between Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden.<br />
<br />
And don't say &quot;Firmness&quot; or some bullshit to that extent, because when you're wrong, that's called &quot;Stubborn,&quot; and that's not an admirable quality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was born in texas, Grew up and went to school in texas and still Reside in Texas (Not talking Houston or Dallas or any city texas cuz thats a bunch of hick wanna be's. Small town true texas) I have very much a good idea of how real texans speak, accents and grammar, when they are around people they know. When a complete stranger walks up to you no matter what you want to make a good impression and you wont be like, 'well hows it hangin today thar partnar. Keel any buks lately?&quot; no your gunna use the best grammer available to you as thats how in your mind sets the best impression. Now when you are around friends and family you loosen up some and your true self comes out and every single person i know from texas uses heavy slang because thats what we grew up on. Bush grew up on slang and still uses it because Thats who he is. <br />
<br />
And thats what i like about bush. You can say he's full of ka ka and this and that but he has never hidden who he is. Sure theres lies and deciet mixed in but if you name me anyperson in the world who hasn't BSed around, lied, and anything your accusing him of then i will stand down. (And FFS dont say John Paul the Pope. Pope doesn't have a chance to lie he's to buisy locked in Vatican City molesting young boys. jokin. )<br />
<br />
Edit: BTW Stubborn isnt always bad. Get married and you'll see that stubborness has its benefits.</div></div><hr />

Not sure where your perspective is coming from really.  It's really skewed on many, many points.<br />
<br />

OMG OMG HES A CRIMINAL HE DID A LINE OF COKE! jfc c'mon. Cocaine is bad and all but give him a break. He grew up as a presidents son. Unbelievable Pressure was put on him his whole life.

He's been convicted of drunk driving in at least one of them.  Point is that you say he doesn't try to hide who he is, and that's a flat out lie.  Do some research instead of listening to the propaganda he tries to feed you and it paints a very different picture than the one he would have you believe.</div></div><hr />

I can try to answer your last two posts in part.<br />
<br />
You wrote:<br />
....wants to raise minimum wage up to $7....<br />
This is one of the &quot;issues&quot; for some of us. I have a challange for you. Eat, get/share an apartment, find transportation, healthcare, and save for that time when you can no longer work on $7 an hour in any urban area. It's funny how outrageous $7 an hour sounds - but would you live on it for the rest of your life?<br />
<br />
Oh, but people who work harder can do better you say - the poor deserve to be poor because they are lazy or stupid. If the pain of being dirt poor motivates people, then lets tax inheritance at 99% - I'd hate to see some kid not reach his full potential because mommy or daddy were rich. Let's set the Maximum Wage at $7 an hour for everybody including investors and get a super motivated workforce.<br />
<br />
$7 an hour is NOT excessive, that's a life of poverty sir.<br />
<br />
IMO Bush is meanspirited Rich White Trash. I detest what I percieve as a cowardly/bullying streak a mile wide in Bush (death penalty in Texas, tolerating prisoner abuse, etc.) and his politics.<br />
<br />
I feel a great kinship with Kerry. Having served 1968-71 I fully and completely understand why one might feel duty bound to serve and also duty bound to oppose the war after completing service.<br />
<br />
- Not the views of BB, just the guy behind the keyboard who along with every single member of his extended family is voting Bush o u t.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
Given the DEEP divisions in this country, it's a good idea to vote for YOUR favorite candidate.</div></div><hr />

No, he didn't learn a fucking thing.  He sealed both of his criminal records (containing who knows what else) because he's not a big enough man to stand up and admit it. <br />
<br />
Just like he's not a big enough man to say &quot;Whelp...we're fucked in Iraq.  I definitely didn't think this thru, and I'm gonna need some help from the rest of the world to fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, since we've backed out of nearly every international treaty since Bush is in office, that's not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
I want to see Egypt.  I want to see the pyramids and the sphinx.  But being a fucking American, my life is in danger if I even think about heading to the middle east right now.  That is fucking sad, and that is why Bush has to go.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Battleblade..../salute.  You and I have many differences, but it appears we share a common goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vick</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">$7 an hour is poverty. So is $10 and so is $5. I Eat, have an apartment on my own, have a truck, and pay for my medical bills as well as electricity, Cable, and gas and guess what. I currently make $8 an hour. How do i do these things at $8 an hour? I work my ass off, put in as many hours as i can and get alot of overtime. You can do the same at the current minimum wage. People that generally make min. wage are Highschool students and people who have no choice but to have a crappy job because of choices they have made in their life whether thats not try, not put in for raises, not find a better job if current employment is uneficient. People that are grown up have a family and have absolutely no choice but min. wage generally work more than one job and make things work. People that work min. wage min. hours and complain i dont make enough are the ones that will benefit the most from raising the min wage. what good does that do?<br />
<br />
Your right, bush favors the death sentence. this doesnt mean he goes home and jerks off to it every night. He simply has his beliefs that people that kill 15 innocent children deserve the same fate or whatever they do. He's not going out and saying hey you double parked its time to die.<br />
<br />
I respect that you served your time. I respect that Kerry served his and i respect that George didnt feel like serving in the army. Its all about choices. You are free to enlist and you are free to go out and get a job or go to college. Are you implieng that your less of a person if you dont go out and voluntarily kill people for your country? some people dont believe in any form of killing as its murder in their opinions and its self defense in yours. <br />
<br />
George W. Bush has made mistakes in his life. So did the guy that found out its not a good idea to eat shit. Only way people learn what to do and what not to do is through mistakes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who's a punk sir - Muhamad Ali who went to prison over his objections to the war or GWB who got free flying lessons and is directly resonsible for the deaths of 100's of thousands when he personally was no longer in any physical risk. GWB is real brave now, isn't he?&quot;<br />
<br />
not to sure what that has to do with being punk as Ali was conformed to a different belief by someone who convinced him to do so and Bush is a president who has to be conformed and open to others beliefs. Niether are punk but ok. Also by this statement your saying bush is a coward because he sends others into combat but refused to himself. So the coach of a football team is a coward because he's not in pads and out on the field? You dont have to play ball to know how to play and you dont have to have been in war to know how to start one. <br />
<br />
Bottom line its not only bush that started the war. A president cannot say todays a good day to invade russia and do it. He would get veto'd out by the houses via checks and balances. Obviously there was some valid reason for war otherwise it wouldnt have happened. <br />
<br />
Again going to the army is very respectable and going to college because you'd wrather get a solid education is respectable to. (yes i knwo you can go to college while in the army but i'd wrather my teachers not hold a gun) They are respectable because you made the choice to do either of which and niether should put you in any form of stereotype. you are the reason i had to put up with the &quot;my dad was in the army and can kick your dads ass&quot; shit going through elementry. Bad examples pass down to your offspring. Let them make their mistakes on their own instead of having them taught that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe ... that was actually rather nicely put.  +10 points  :D <br />
<br />
Bush had a hard first term in office.  FFS less than a year into his term what happened?  That's right the single worst national crisis since Pearl Harbor struck home taking out a significant National trademark.  What made it worse is the conspiracy leading up to it was wretchedly diffused all around the Middle east and they were pretty fucking proud of it.  Before you completely lambast our current president try to walk a few days in his shoes and consider the kind of mess he had to face relatively early in his career.  If his biggest sin was leading us to war against Iraq ... boo hoo?<br />
<br />
Bush-  Saddam we need to inspect your country for WMD<br />
Saddam- Ok ...<br />
Bush-  Um ... Saddam you're not letting the inspectors in<br />
Saddam-  I changed my mind<br />
Bush-  You signed an agreement.  We're coming in<br />
Saddam- No<br />
Bush-  Saddam back down or we're coming in forcibly<br />
Saddam- Yeah right (they'll never do it ... I've got a couple UN members in my backpocket).<br />
*reference Oil for Food administration<br />
Bush-  You asked for it ... here i come.  You have &quot;x&quot; time to back down.<br />
Saddam- *rolls his eyes<br />
<br />
*US invades ... Saddam is captured.  His sons are killed.  All attacks cease the moment Saddam's administration is ousted.  Surprisingly few non-militant casualties.  US works to get Iraq operational but are attacked daily by fundamentalists.<br />
<br />
I actually have few regrets that the war actually took place.  It could have been handled much much better though.  Bush had been given information that Iraq had WMD's.  Iraq had a history of stockpiling such weapons ... it was even a large problem during the Clinton administration.  So when Bush says let us in to check (the UN inspectors) and Saddam says no ... what would you have thought.  Saddam was on thin ice thanks to his atrocious past already, and violating this UN agreement went a little too far.<br />
<br />
 THIS is the problem I have with most undereducated about the situation right wingers on the subject of Bush - Saddam was not and never could have been from a logical point of view connected to the War on Terror or Al-Qaeda. He was a secular leader who was fond of jailing and torturing the very types of fundamentalist Muslims who join Al-Qaeda, and in fact he had recieved a fatwa from fundamentalist Iranian clerics because of his habits of destroying mosques and jailing religious types. To theorize that he would have provided Al-Qaeda with WMD is on the order of thinking that GWB would provide WMD to Algeria because, by golly, they hate France too.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, go back and reread the public intelligence, all the stuff that's been public and all the stuff that's been declassified about Saddam's WMD. You'll read a lot of 'We can't account for this' and 'This wasn't verified' and 'Chalabi's snakeoil salesmen said they've got a facility here' nonsense, which is a far cry - a FAR cry - from statements like 'We know he has them, and we know where they are, in the area of Baghdad and Tikrit', which is the kind of stuff the administration was saying.<br />
<br />
 Either way, it was nonsense for us to divert men and money away from the War on Terror when we could have used that men and money to catch the rest of Al-Qaeda in the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Now we not only have an unstable Iraq, we STILL have Osama Bin Laden free to commit more crimes, and we have a bunch of regimes 'making hay while the sun shines' and either acquiring MORE WMD (North Korea, a country who had them in the first place COMBINED with the ability to strike US soil with rockets) or racing like hell to get some before we're able to recover our military flexibility (Iran).</div></div><hr />

I've been looking for a place to show off, and something more appropriate hasn't popped up yet, so I guess this'll do.<br />
<br />
See this, Vick?<br />
<br />
You wanna know how much of a dent 7 bucks an hour makes in this monthly payment?  It's 2 full weeks of GROSS pay.  After taxes, it's closer to 3.  The only reason that I have this, is because (and I thought I'd never say this) I have a union job, where we FORCE the employer to pay us a working man's wage and not feed us this undercutting bullshit.<br />
<br />
Minimum wage is a fucking joke.  There's so much fucking money in America that it's not even funny, and it's a travesty and a half that we STILL can't get everyone in america up to a decent standard of living, or a fucking national healthcare plan.  My grandmother had both knees replaced, and has a host of other problems.  She's unable to work as a result of them.  None of her conditions, alone, is enough to qualify for disability.  Her health insurance ran out last month, and she is unable to to get state health insurance, because you have to have had no health insurance for at least 6 months before that, AND, it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.  Please tell me how much fucking sense ANY of that makes.  We can rack up 5 trillion dollars in debt dicking around in fucking Iraq, but we still have problems like this RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN FUCKING BACKYARD?  <br />
<br />
You just wait until your parents or your grandparents are in this situation, and you'll see how much fucking good Bush is doing this nation.</div></div><hr />

Kerry really scares me what he'll do to the US. Bush speaks with a southern accent and uses slang therefor most of the &quot;yankees&quot; cant understand him but I cant understand most of the &quot;yankees&quot; when they talk all fast gibberish. I'll chose a slow talkin redneck over a fast talkin liar that wants to raise minimum wage up to $7 or somethin like that just to &quot;stimulate the economy.&quot; If you want to stimulate economy make more jobs instead of pay people that work at mc donalds more. All he'll accomplish by raising min. wage is sell more car stereo systems, cigarettes and beer. <br />
<br />
He could take his min. wage idea and do so much more with it. Make jobs like county clean up services instead of making prisoners do it. Pay people that are desperate enough for jobs that will walk along the highway 10 bucks an hour giving jobs to those that dont have em, causing more people to spend money instead of the same people spending a little bit more, have lower unemployement rate and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I fail to see any creativeness from Kerry or Bush with new proposals. OOO i'll raise minimum wage if you vote for me yeah like other people havent thaught of that before. Give me a candidate that has origional ideas and i'll show you someone who's gunna get elected. Gore, Bush and Kerry all lack these thats why the 2000 election was close as well as this one. Lets bring back the good ole days of Presidential Assasination plz maybe the Vice Presidents will inspire us more so we can stop arguing over &quot;lesser evils.&quot; But i still stick by my saying. &quot;Why replace a broken in wallet with one that will chaife your ass for the next 4 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
We are a doe eye consumer country, we consume alot and that is how we have become such a high cash flow country but the recent slump in the encomeny has made the poor folks clam up with their money, raising it to 7$ would do quite a bit, also providing incentives to discontinue outsourcing in the form of tax credits will create more jobs, as kerry wishs too.<br />
<br />
I've seen bushs view of job making and its bad when he does not see someone as unemployeed once they slip of the benefits list...<br />
<br />
Wasn't it the repubs wanting to push in a bill that REMOVES time and a half overtime pay? why the hell should they want that? do they want unions to form again and start striking? (unless I am missinformed)<br />
<br />
I wish to know how &quot;real texans speak&quot; because I have been in austin/round rock and the areas there abouts for 17 years ( Have not been in texas my whole life, but I have been in texas as long as I can remember myself being able to speak )<br />
<br />
Bush speaks dumbass, not texan<br />
<br />
I know a few &quot;good ol boys&quot; who talk texan, small town texan but even they know any other texan is just as much a texan if not more, the good ol boys are the minority here so if anything, WE city folks are the standard texan.<br />

What about the workers at walmart? they BANNED unions, they can sue employees that form them but look where its gotten the workers there.<br />
<br />
If you get injured, you may not call 911 or leave the building until you sign a waver saying that walmart is not liable and YOU HAVE TO SIGN IT because it is in a claus of the contract you sign to work there... and it is written so that you can not understand it without a lawyer and what kid has a lawyer?<br />
<br />
Broken bone, crushed foot via forklift, missing a chunk of your leg because of a faulty air drill exploading while your working in the automotive section etc. all require a waver. (hence I boycott them now)<br />
<br />
And for what? 7.50$ an hour.... we need unions in some respects but there needs to be a balance to it... it is not good if the employees have all the say in what they do because nothing gets done and its not good to give company total control over their lives because they are out for profit and to avoid lawsuits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">osserkon</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two Quotes from todays paper: <br />
<br />
More than two-thirds of the people living in Australia, Britain and Italy, three countries allied with the United States in the Iraq war believe the war has increased the threat of terrorism. More than half of those in the United States, 52 percent believe the Iraq war has increased the threat of terrorism, while 3 in 10 in the US think it has decreased the threat, a view promoted by President Bush .<br />
  &quot; In the context of the presidential campaign in the United States, this is undenialby a blow for George W Bush, since it shows that a majority of Americans don't agree with the main justification for his policy in Iraq.&quot;<br />
<br />
You got that fuckin right<br />
<br />
Quote # 2 in todays paper: Different article<br />
<br />
The war in Iraq did not damage international terror groups, but instead distracted the United States from confronting other hotbeds of Islamic militancy and actually &quot;created momemtum&quot; for many terrorists, a top ( and here's the fuckin great kicker ) Israeli security think tank said in a report released Monday.<br />

YMMV <br />
<br />
I agree with you 100%...see my comment before I stated I work a union job.<br />
<br />
In fact, the guy doing my exact job on the opposite shift from me is the union steward...and man is he a piece of shit.<br />
<br />
The deal is tho, is that I would still be making 10 bucks an hour if it wasn't for the fact that my employer is union.  Jobs don't pay anymore.  They figured out that you can just get college kids to work there for a couple years, get paid shit, and then recycle and move on.  They never have to pay anyone 30 bucks an hour because they've been there forever, and they create an environment that supports that.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to the way society has degraded.  Fucking look at it...your father was probably the breadwinner of the family (If you're over about 20 or 25 anyway, sorry young'ins).  Your grandfather was probably the breadwinner before that.  Your mother and grandmother didn't need to work, they stayed at home with the kids and taught you good values, and how not to be a raving dipshit.  Now, the majority of people aren't paid a wage high enough to support their entire family.  This forces women into the workplace as a way to make ends meet.  As a result, the children go to daycare, or even worse, end up at home alone for a large part of the day..which leads to boredom, which leads to crime and it leads to drug usage.  <br />
<br />
Come fuckin on..the line is almost completely painted for you.  It's a straight shot from paying grown men 10 bucks an hour to juvenile deliquency.  <br />
<br />
I don't like unions at all.  They only benefit people who come to work and do the minimum amount required to keep their job.  The people who bust their ass get whatever is left over.  However, I do know why I am where I am today...and it's not because I'm busting my ass for a grateful employer compensating me accordingly.</div></div><hr />

So you all know, I make just under 7$ an hour my dad and brother who have been employed by the same man for years make about 15$ and they work their asses off for it, I've never seen eather of them have a day off and he scatters their vacation time so they can not take it (how can we have a family trip when he purposely does not allow them to take the same 2 days off?)<br />
<br />
Its crazy when they do 6 times the work I do, and in a years time I will be up to 8 an hour, makes it even more shameful....<br />

There is a lot of my life sucks blame canada attitude going around and i just dont see it. I havent been with a company for 10 years so i cannot say anything in regards to what its like to be there. I however work in a position where i see people get fucked around like that. I currently do payroll, purchasing, Hiring, dispatching, and general managing of around 25 employees at one of the largest Oil Rig moving companies in the world and the Oil industry is the worst at fucking people over simply because its all about profit.  <br />
<br />
I have an employee, been with us 5 years makes the same as when he started. No matter how much We try the main office refuses to send him a payraise. Its not fair but never while dealing with this situation have i said DAMN THAT GEORGE BUSH or have i thaught man if only Kerry was elected minimum wage would go up to 7 an hour and his situation would still be the same because when you get to a job that you plan on holding to support a family you wont be making minimum wage. If you are thenyou should look for a better job. <br />
<br />
I never said if you didnt talk a certain way you werent a texan. Im just saying that there are texans who talk like that just like there are people who speek perfect english and there are people who go on a game and use 1337 t41k. You cant sterotype someone by the way they speak is what im trying to say. <br />
<br />
We've had 4 years to see how idiotic George can be. I personally feel that Kerry isnt that bright either just has people telling him what to say (which bush does too but at least you dont fuckin fall asleep listening to bush). Kerry has that old man mentality that makes you want to fall asleep listening to him. Not a worse president for it but its boring as hell. The dinosaur guy off of Mrs. Doubtfire comes to mind when i see Kerry. <br />
<br />
But this is what makes America great. I dont have to agree with you and you dont have to agree with me. Ive put together my opinions w/o paying attention to all the destractions they throw out. This is how i feel. I'll vote for Bush and you'll vote for Kerry nothing at this point will change that. It might be because im a No good white trash hick that gets a good laugh at watching people not be able to understand the slang that ive learned throughout my life. Ive had friends die in the war, ive had friends come back alive. and the war might have beena mistake but not going to war woulda been a mistake too imo. Which would be bigger i dont know and dont care at this point. I want to see bush finish what he started. and Comparing 2 diseases that have nothing to do with eachother together wont change my mind.</div></div><hr />

Vick, pay attention.<br />
<br />
If what you say is true, and you do work for a major oil company, and make 8 bucks an hour, then I don't know how you can possibly vote for Bush.<br />
<br />
Your boss is gonna vote for Bush.  His boss is gonna vote for Bush.  His boss is gonna vote for Bush, but they're voting for Bush for a reason.  At the top of the ladder, that motherfucker is making a 7 or 8 figure BONUS check.  You're making dick.  Bush doesn't care about you.  He doesn't do anything for you.  The only thing he does is keep your company in business.  But that doens't benefit you either, because you can make 8 bucks an hour anywhere.<br />
<br />
Now I'm absolutely certain that you have been forcefed nothing but propaganda, because there is absolutely no way that you can be in the situation you say you are, and think the way you do.  It's illogical.  I'm sorry that the system has fucked you over so badly that you don't even know it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the bad play on words but Vick face facts, what works for you DOES NOT work for everyone, a small apartment may be 40$ a month in one place and 300 in another (newyork for example) <br />
<br />
You live in texas so you had it fairly good when it came to land value and property value, you live out in the small townish areas right?<br />
<br />
Smell the coffee here bud, 5.25 (min wage right now I beleave) can be just enough to get by here but it can be pocket change in a place like newyork and not everyone can afford to move.<br />
<br />
Simply put you do not think enough outside of your local setting to talk about making a living, you are to young to have life experiance and to bullheaded to go out and look for it, this is also why you see no problems with how things are being run, just because it is roses for you and yours(family for non texans :p ) does not mean there is not a problem with unemployement 2 towns over, money, work and time are not valued the same in every place, and land, food, water and shelter also have verying worth.<br />
<br />
I may be young but at least I have taken the time to learn about the world abroad.... you would be lost outside of your small town and I would probibly be lost too... but at least I would have a clue about whats changed.</div></div><hr />

salary.com puts the average annual salary to achieve a  MINIMUM standard of living at $17,500, other studies have placed that number as high as $19,000 annually, and I haven't seen any below that 17.5k mark. 60 hours a week is borderline inhumane IMO, and in most jobs simply unachieveable while still mainting proper health. And as far as busting your hump and clawing your way to the top through overtime? It's easier than ever for companies to avoid handing out overtime pay thanks to recent laws passed. Simply put MINIMUM wage does not supply for a MINIMUM standard of living, and this scenario gets even worse when you throw in having a family.  The fact is the cost of living and inflation have grown at  a more rapid rate than the minimum wage has increased, the last increase being 6 years ago and it being an amount the BARELY even pays for the increase in gas prices. The current rate of minimum wage makes it so those in poverty level currently will never be able to surpass that level under SANE working conditions.<br />
<br />
As far as unions go, yea they have (argueably rightfully) gotten a bad rap over the years, but simply open up a history book and look at the rights of the American worker pre-Labor movement and you'll have the answer of why they are a nesscecary evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I'd like to say that the problem I noted with Bush's communication is not how he says things, that is his accent is too difficult to follow, but rather what he says.  Sometimes the man has words coming out of his mouth that you can completely understand, individually as words, that make no intelligble sense what so ever.  He babbles.  It comes across to me as someone attempting to cover up for the fact that they really have very little or any clue as to the topic they're speaking about.<br />
<br />
Moving on to unions.  Unions have definite pros and cons to them.  In concept, Unions are very useful in counter balancing the tendency of management to take as much advantage of employees for as little money as they can.  That's of course part of capitalism.  If you don't have something to counter that, you end up with things like sweat shops where people are forced to work for 60 or 70 hours a week for $.50 a day and so forth.  Governmental intervention will only go so far, in as much as government tends to be heavily influenced by money, and corporations are the ones with the money.<br />
<br />
Where Unions begin to become detrimental is where they go from working to gain the Union members fair, competitative wages and benefits, to getting them wages and benefits that are absurdly high.  Sometimes to the point where corporations are forced to decide between paying Union wages/benefit packages and having any profit margin at all.<br />
<br />
That said, I believe Unions are pricing themselves out of the market, except in industries where they face no competition what so ever, like prison guards for example, and it's just a matter of time until Unions are a dinosaur.  Which is a real shame because when used correctly and reasonably, Unions can be a hell of a useful tool for workers to gain the compensation they deserve.</div></div><hr />

It's Nickel and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich.  The book is a about her basically giving up everything (temporarily) and working shit ass jobs for minimum wage in different cities around the US.  She generally works two jobs at about 5-10 dollars an hour and has a lot to say about living standards and minimum wage.

However it has been the trend since the labor union bubble burst in the 50's that the US goverment was slowly beginning to add protections  for the American worker. That is it WAS the trend until this began to recently reverse, with the American working beginning to lose rights in areas such as rights to sue for on the job injury/overtime  and recieving overtime pay at all.  Hardly a coincidence that these changes start to arrive when a Republican controlled Congress emerges. So we arrive at a situation where Unions are being squeezed out by the might of corporate America and the American goverment it self is reducing its aegis of workers. It seems favoring big buisness in the name of capitalism is the last true Republican value the &quot;Republican&quot; controlled congress holds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Essayist and cultural critic Barbara Ehrenreich has always specialized in turning received wisdom on its head with intelligence, clarity, and verve. With some 12 million women being pushed into the labor market by welfare reform, she decided to do some good old-fashioned journalism and find out just how they were going to survive on the wages of the unskilled--at $6 to $7 an hour, only half of what is considered a living wage. So she did what millions of Americans do, she looked for a job and a place to live, worked that job, and tried to make ends meet.<br />
<br />
As a waitress in Florida, where her name is suddenly transposed to &quot;girl,&quot; trailer trash becomes a demographic category to aspire to with rent at $675 per month. In Maine, where she ends up working as both a cleaning woman and a nursing home assistant, she must first fill out endless pre-employment tests with trick questions such as &quot;Some people work better when they're a little bit high.&quot; In Minnesota, she works at Wal-Mart under the repressive surveillance of men and women whose job it is to monitor her behavior for signs of sloth, theft, drug abuse, or worse. She even gets to experience the humiliation of the urine test.<br />
<br />
So, do the poor have survival strategies unknown to the middle class? And did Ehrenreich feel the &quot;bracing psychological effects of getting out of the house, as promised by the wonks who brought us welfare reform?&quot; Nah. Even in her best-case scenario, with all the advantages of education, health, a car, and money for first month's rent, she has to work two jobs, seven days a week, and still almost winds up in a shelter. As Ehrenreich points out with her potent combination of humor and outrage, the laws of supply and demand have been reversed. Rental prices skyrocket, but wages never rise. Rather, jobs are so cheap as measured by the pay that workers are encouraged to take as many as they can. Behind those trademark Wal-Mart vests, it turns out, are the borderline homeless. With her characteristic wry wit and her unabashedly liberal bent, Ehrenreich brings the invisible poor out of hiding and, in the process, the world they inhabit--where civil liberties are often ignored and hard work fails to live up to its reputation as the ticket out of poverty. --Lesley Reed &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This one of the fallacies continuely repeated by those who've never really been there.  Hard work isn't necessarily the ticket out of poverty, although it can be.  Often times hard work is simply that, hard work.  There is no guarantee that if you work harder you will receive the compensation that it deserves.  In fact, I've found that in my experience that often times the harder you work, the harder management expects you to work, with no increase in rewards.  If you have a donkey that can carry 300 lbs and a donkey that can carry 400 lbs, you tend to put the heavier load on the 400 lbs donkey, at the end of the day you don't give him more hay to eat.  And frequently employees are to management not much more than donkeys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some food for thought: <br />
<br />
For those of you who think raising the minimum wage to 7 bucks an hour will do a lick of good, think twice.  How will companies compensate?  Average prices will raise to compensate for the extra money they are shelling out to burger king employees.  Other low-end wages will need to rise to meet the new minimum standard, leading large corporations to raise prices a set amt across the board. Raising the minimum wage that much will have huge effects on the economy ... huge.  The poor man's dollar won't go any fucking further than it does today, and middle class americans are the ones that will suffer.  Their wages won't rise to meet with the new increased prices, at least not fast enough to avert any damage.<br />
<br />
Chances are, you take spending money out of hard working middle class americans and funnel these usable dollars into large corporations.  Rob from the working class to feed the rich?  Gosh ...<br />
<br />
I'm all for the minimum wage increasing to match inflation, but raising it in such obvoius leaps and bounds will only cause problems and fix not a damn thing. A happy meal + toy cost 4 bucks 10 years ago ... it costs something like 4 bucks and 10 cents today, and i'm pretty sure our minimum wage has increased to keep up with the ever-slow effects of inflation.<br />
<br />
You know those futuristic movies you see where a cup of jo is 15 bucks and an oil change is a couple hundred?  This is one sure-fire way to make that fiction a reality, unless they plan on making laws against companies raising prices (which sort of contradicts our present ecomonic system).<br />
<br />
It may not happen overnite, but greedy mega-business will miss that extra chunk of change and find some way of recouping some of its losses.  The question is ... who's gonna suffer the most?</div></div><hr />

Good question without an easy answer.  Lets take gasoline for example.  When I was a kid gasoline was somewhere between $.50 and $1.00 a gallon.  It was a big deal when the price of gas finally went over $1.00 a gallon and stayed there.  Now adays we're used to gasoline going up in $.15 and $.20 increments just because the seasons change, and usually it doesn't drop all the way back down to the original price for long, if it ever does.  So have the wages of oil companies increased that dramatically?  Has oil become that scarce?  I've not seen anything that indicates that wages for oil companies rise dramatically on a yearly basis.  And we've heard that oil is still very available.  So why exactly the constant increases?  Could it have to do with corporations attempting to make &quot;wind fall&quot; profits?  I happen to believe it does.  Except wind fall profits are supposed to be a once in a while thing, not something that happens year in and year out.  But there we are.<br />
<br />
Now, who are the ones reaping the advantage and what should be done about it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy answer:  either the oil companies here in America (got together and agreed to all raise prices to increase profits), or the countries from which we are buying the oil.  If they decide they are going to sell us less (they dont like us or they realize that we'll pay more for it) there isn't much we can do.<br />
<br />
I know gas station employee wages haven't increased.  I know jo-blow working on the low-end for oil companies wages haven't increased.  It's either the mega-million owners or the oil-producing countries.<br />
<br />
In any case, at the rate we (the Earth) is eating up our fossil fuel reseves, we'll need to swap to an alternate source within the next century or we're shit out of luck.  Go-go Hydrogen fuel cells!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell I have been to the Middle East on more than onbe occasion and I have found them to be quite Pleasant. Yes I did go to a little more modern country as in United Arab Emirates. I also found that Ssome European countries have disliked us more. I voted for Bush and I will again. Visited Europe during the Clinton administration to find more protesting against us than during Bush. Yes the last year some thing have changed, but other countries have quite a bit had dislike for us.<br />
<br />
The American lifestyle is spreading alot of the hate for us stems from that. People do not like US(Americans). They feel that the way we act, live, etc is influencing thier little uns etc and invading thier traditions and lives. Yes it doesn't help with the forcing of democracy on people/countries creating puppet nations but in the end Iraq will probably be better off than what they were 2 years ago even 10 years ago, same with Afganistan. <br />
<br />
Alot of countries have adopted similar constitutions as ours and people believe us, as in Americans, to be the cause of this epidemic. Russia changed thiers on thier own yes we may have influenced them but it was thier choice to change we did not stick a gun to thier head. This is happening all over the world and affecting what people are used to thus creating more hate for us believing we are the cause rather than a template.<br />

If other countries hate us so much why does everyone want to come and live here? Because of opportunity, and the hardline traditionalists of other countries feel that is threating thier way of life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those of you who think raising the minimum wage to 7 bucks an hour will do a lick of good, think twice.  How will companies compensate?  Average prices will raise to compensate for the extra money they are shelling out to burger king employees.  Other low-end wages will need to rise to meet the new minimum standard, leading large corporations to raise prices a set amt across the board. Raising the minimum wage that much will have huge effects on the economy ... huge.  The poor man's dollar won't go any fucking further than it does today, and middle class americans are the ones that will suffer.  Their wages won't rise to meet with the new increased prices, at least not fast enough to avert any damage.<br />
<br />
Chances are, you take spending money out of hard working middle class americans and funnel these usable dollars into large corporations.  Rob from the working class to feed the rich?  Gosh ...<br />
<br />
I'm all for the minimum wage increasing to match inflation, but raising it in such obvoius leaps and bounds will only cause problems and fix not a damn thing. A happy meal + toy cost 4 bucks 10 years ago ... it costs something like 4 bucks and 10 cents today, and i'm pretty sure our minimum wage has increased to keep up with the ever-slow effects of inflation.<br />
<br />
You know those futuristic movies you see where a cup of jo is 15 bucks and an oil change is a couple hundred?  This is one sure-fire way to make that fiction a reality, unless they plan on making laws against companies raising prices (which sort of contradicts our present ecomonic system).<br />
<br />
It may not happen overnite, but greedy mega-business will miss that extra chunk of change and find some way of recouping some of its losses.  The question is ... who's gonna suffer the most?<br />
<br />
<br />
This is actually a fairly old debate when discussing minimum wage. Is minimum wage  rising to match inflation or does the rise in minimum wage CAUSE inflation?  The answer is that both answers are correct. However,  your  logic  completely ignores the beauty of the free market system and Adam Smith's concept of the &quot;invisble hand&quot; of the economy. Yes a higher minimum wage will increase the earnings of the minimum wage earners, and yes the m aximum wage earners will increase prices to match that . However the middle class simply won't be left to pay the windfalll, the middle classes wages will invevitabley be increased to match the overall increase on the field. The key however is that NO MATTER the increase in minimum wage, the inflation of prices will ALWAYS rise slower than the minimum wage increases. This allows for a free market economy with some government constrictions to simply periodically right itself. And yes it willl eventually lead  to coffee costing 15 bucks, but everyone will still make enough to afford it. The thing with the large minimum wage increase now is that, minimum wage has never really been satisfactory in meeting the average cost of living, and it seems John Kerry has taken to platform of reforming that aspect.  Minimum wage is a market floor, one that affects the WHOLE market not just the wages of the minimum and maximum wage earners. Minimum wage and inflation are practically symbiotic, except for the fact that minimum wage changes are goverment mandated and thus instantaneous while inflation is propelled by many, many factors and thus a slower to change, so the system in a  sense will always balance out. Smith's invisible hand simply sometimes needs some slight nudging to make things a tad more fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you all know, I make just under 7$ an hour my dad and brother who have been employed by the same man for years make about 15$ and they work their asses off for it, I've never seen eather of them have a day off and he scatters their vacation time so they can not take it (how can we have a family trip when he purposely does not allow them to take the same 2 days off?)<br />
<br />
Its crazy when they do 6 times the work I do, and in a years time I will be up to 8 an hour, makes it even more shameful....<br />
<br />
Not sure if those numbers are still good for them tho because I do not ask what they make, could be a bit more nowdays<br />
<br />
Well who forces your dad and your brother to work for that employer?  Last time I checked this is a free country and people choose where to work.  Yes it can be hard to leave a job and hope to find a new one.  But it is there choice to work there.  For who ever was moaning and groaning about the injustices of those that work at Walmart for not allowing it to become a Union shop.  Last time I checked Walmart doesnt force people to work for them.  Walmart does not have a draft that forces people to work there, but instead Walmart employees applied and choose to work there.  Life is choices and not all choices you and I will make will come out all rosey.  <br />
<br />
Like it or not companies our in buisiness to make profit.  Profit is what allows big companies to give dividens, and better chances for there stock to rise for the investors.  They our not in buisness to give you as much money as you feel your worth.  If you want to be able to have vacations and best chance to be in controll of your life then become an entrepeuner (sp?) start your own buisness.<br />
<br />
I am a conservative Republican that only makes 9 dollars an hour.  I am married and my wife makes almost 10 dollars an hour.  I want the lowest taxes, no social security coming out of my paycheck as possible.  In the eventual hope that I do get a higher paying job.  My goal in life is not to pay high taxes, pay for other peoples social security, and welfare.  I want to take care of my self.  It is not the governements buisness to fund for my retirement in 34 years with the chance that Social Secuirty will still be around.  I want Social Security privatized or better yet allow me to take that money I would put there into a 401k program or other such program.<br />
<br />
I mainly want from this governement protection from enemies that would destroy this country.  When I look at Kerry and Bush I see it is Bush that will do the best job.  Do I like everything about Bush the answer is no.  But Bush will do the best job in defending this nation from Terrorists or other evil doers in my opinion.  If you disagree with me that is fine it is your right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question without an easy answer.  Lets take gasoline for example.  When I was a kid gasoline was somewhere between $.50 and $1.00 a gallon.  It was a big deal when the price of gas finally went over $1.00 a gallon and stayed there.  Now adays we're used to gasoline going up in $.15 and $.20 increments just because the seasons change, and usually it doesn't drop all the way back down to the original price for long, if it ever does.  So have the wages of oil companies increased that dramatically?  Has oil become that scarce?  I've not seen anything that indicates that wages for oil companies rise dramatically on a yearly basis.  And we've heard that oil is still very available.  So why exactly the constant increases?  Could it have to do with corporations attempting to make &quot;wind fall&quot; profits?  I happen to believe it does.  Except wind fall profits are supposed to be a once in a while thing, not something that happens year in and year out.  But there we are.<br />
<br />
Now, who are the ones reaping the advantage and what should be done about it?<br />
<br />
I don't think oil companies or other companies are actually making a huge &quot;windfall&quot; of profits to match the increases in prices of things.  They are making profits, in many cases record gross profits, but if you look at those profits as a percentage of business, or on a per-share basis, they haven't increased that much.  I think a big part of what has happened/is happening, across all areas of the economy, is that small companies are being squeezed out by the bigger companies to reduce their competition.  As a result, once the smaller companies are gone through either being bought out, bankruptcy, etc., the larger, surviving company(s) takes over their market share, and grows that much larger.  The larger a company is, that much more inefficient it is.  I speak from experience with this in the oil industry, and in the service industry.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine works for a company that services aircraft at the airport.  They do everything from some mechanical maintenance, to cleaning the aircraft after flights, loading luggage and in-flight catering, etc.  Several years ago, they were purchased by Hudson General, a world-wide company in the same field, currently known as Globe Ground.  When the takeover came into effect, staff at the shop decreased from 32 to around 24-26.  Meanwhile, front office staff increased from 3 to 14, which necessitated moving the front office to a separate location, increasing costs even more.  All this while still doing the exact same amount of work, servicing the same amount of clients, using the same equipment, etc.  Now, due to whatever reasons (my friend thinks, and I tend to agree, that the loss of flexibility in bidding/dealing with contracts is a huge issue), they have lost a large portion of their clients, and are down to 14 shop staff, with 6 front office.<br />
<br />
Second example, is my own.  I live in oil country.  I deal in scrap metals for a living.  A while back, I went to a surplus auction for a large oil company.  Literally hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment went very cheaply, for pennies on the dollar in some cases.  Not because the oil company had stopped doing business, but simply because they had decided they no longer needed this equipment.  Speaking both with other buyers there, as well as some oil company employees, I learned that some of this equipment had been deemed surplus simply because it had been purchased X number of years earlier, irregardless of if/how much it had actually been used.  In a lot of cases, equipment that was still totally useable and serviceable, was being replaced for no good reason.<br />
<br />
While it's very true in cases such as WalMart that their increased size/purchasing power can give them an advantage, I think in a lot of cases that advantage, and more, is pissed away through sheer bloated size.  (btw, speaking of Wal Mart...  a couple of my friends have jobs there, and absolutely love their jobs/employer.  I'm Canadian tho, so that might make some difference)<br />
<br />
On the minimum wage... I've lived/worked on $7.00 an hour, while living on my own and paying $600.00 rent.  It isn't easy, but I was able to do it.  It did motivate me to get my ass in gear and A) work harder/smarter, and B) get a better job.  I don't see minimum wage as being something that an adult/family is intended to, nor can they, live off of indefinitely.  I see minimum wage as being for jobs like McDonalds, etc., where it's usually kids working part time, or a lot of retired ppl, etc.  Call me cold-hearted, but I truly believe that each person's employment situation is of their own doing/choosing.  If you aren't being paid enough in your opinion, find a different job.  Get a 2nd job.  Take some night courses to upgrade your skills.  Do what you have to do.  Sadly, there are always going to be some people whom life shits on.  However, that's gonna happen no matter what anyone does.<br />
<br />
And that brings me to a minor rant.  I stopped donating anything to the local food bank charity a number of years ago, when I went there and saw the number of people whom were smoking while waiting in line.  If you can afford $10 bucks for a pack of smokes, you sure the fuck don't need a food bank to help you out.  Same goes for welfare.</div></div><hr />

Corporations are about the only thing more evil than goverments. YOu know until the Washington Post shined its light on Toyta's TN plant, they had not hired a perminant employee in 4 years? They were using long term temps--which is a great way to tutn a number of people into 400 lb mules--both temps (with the lie of we will higher you) and the perminant employes who know there are well quallified &quot;temps&quot; ready to step into their shoes should they falter. <br />

Making it your way--while admirable, is not likely. As for living wage, $10/hour barely covers it for Sullfolk County, NY. Partiucularly if you add in health insurance.<br />

$7.00 an hour Canadian or US? If Canadian than grats, you've been able to do what millions of Americans cannot. If US then /boggle, $7.00 per hour is right around what Kerry is proposing to raise it  - a liveable wage. And the belief that minimum wage jobs are held mainly by teenagers and the elderly is a common argument for opponents of minimum wage but is proven pure bunk just by examining the way the US economy and a capitalist functions. The economy is built and carried on the back of the lowliest minimum wage and close to minimum wage workers. They make up the base level of workers, and to suppose that this category is made up entirely of teenage and elderly workers is pure whismy. I need only to see the situation locally (Tennesee) where fast food chains have slowed the hiring of teenagers due to the fact that  they don't make good workers and being tapping the pool of adult Mexican immigrants that have begun to migrate to the area. Yes anyone theoretically can move to the top of a capitalist economy but no way can EVERYONE move to the top, some ADULTS and Famlies will simply always be having to survive at the bottom, even if its just temporarily. Thus an increase is needed to make this bottom rung capable to survive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, who are the ones reaping the advantage and what should be done about it?<br />
<br />
Refiners are getting the best of the deal. Do some math.<br />
<br />
A barrel of light sweet crude runs you around $50. They're 42 gallon barrels, so you're paying ~90 cents per gallon of crude. Now, not all of a barrel is good for refining into actual gasoline, there are other additives they have to put in it as well. Taxes are variable as well, but here's my breakdown: You pay around a buck for an unrefined gallon. They add some chemicals, most very cheap chemicals to store and buy. Taxes here in Illinois circa 2002 were 48 cents/gallon (Federal and State). The average gas station gets margins of around 8-10 cents a gallon, which is one more reason the owner doesn't want to hear you bitch about the price, he don't make dick off of it, he makes his profit off of getting you IN the store and buying pop and beer and shit like that.<br />
<br />
 So add it up:<br />
<br />
 Raw gas: $1.00<br />
 Taxes: $.48<br />
 Margin: $.10<br />
 <br />
 Price of gas, my town, today: $1.97 for Regular. Tell me they're not raking it in hand over fist, even after refining costs. Hell, check their balance sheets and see - they're all making damn near record profits.<br />
<br />
 Oh, and the minimum wage thing: Everyone's situation is different. Prices on the coasts are absolutely outrageous compared to the Midwest or South. Since I'm a cheap saving bastard type, I found a studio apartment here in N. Illinois and I pay $340 a month with all utilities paid.  :D</div></div><hr />

Partially true, but the price of gas/oil is based on a much larger picture than &quot;not enough refineries&quot; and &quot;lack of drilling rights&quot;. Oil is the lifeblood which powers the entire global economy and the price of it is far too complex to even fathom to calculate on a message board as it is pratically holisticly affected by economic, political and even social factors.</div></div><hr />

That's the other problem...<br />
<br />
People are way too optimistic about alternate energy sources at this point.   Yes, oil is bad to base the world's energy supply off of.   That doesnt' mean you get rid of it and then go 'ok, what now?&quot;.<br />
<br />
There's no current viable alternative, period.  It's not because of the &quot;greedy auto companies being in bed with the oil companies&quot;, it's because petroleum is really nice and flammable and it's efficiently flammable, thus it makes nice little explosions in your pistons, it makes for nice little fires to boil the water to create steam to turn the turbines to power the electrical grids.

There'll be a breakthrough, and different sources of energy will arise, but they wont' arise because someone wills them to or funds them to, they'll arise like every other technology that has revolutionized the world to date.... on accident, when someone's not looking for it.<br />

Pretending that we can will discovery or buy it is crazy, there'll be little steps and then one day WHAM, out of the blue... it happens.   Until then, the world does what takes the least effort and expense, and that which is already created.<br />
<br />
The energy issues won't be solved by putting billions of windmills across the land, that's fucking retarded, California is fucking littered with this monument to asinine optimism and clinging to the hope that by only putting a thousand more windmills they'll &quot;harness the power of the wind&quot;, absolutely asinine.   <br />

Hate to tell you, but animals didn't go extinct because of other animals, except humans.  I can't remember one animal eating too many of another animal to the point of extinction (except humans, again).  There have been some occurences, such as koalas who are populating faster than eucalyptus trees (their only source of food) can replenish themselves, but you know what? Koalas will starve and die. The ones that survive will go on.  It regulates itself.  Now, if we keep polluting oceans and rivers and streams, well.. shit, we pollute til everything dies.  That's us putting things where they are not supposed to be.  We're destroying things to the point of no return. Can we say dodo? Abington Island Giant Tortoise (1 left)? Yangtze River Dolphin (150 left)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and if we nuked the center of the earth and disrupted the current of molten earth beneath us, I'm preeeettty sure that would affect the electro-magnetic field of Earth, but hey, geology's not my thing, so I could be wrong there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Though, it is true, if we removed humans from the Earth, the planet would go on.  It'd probably be much better too.  I always liked the idea of killing off humans and leaving every other species alive .... Moonraker, anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent about 10 months abroad (2 semesters) back in 2001 and again in 2003.  In said time i studied in Oxford and a few other universities located in Great Britain (mostly oxford).  I spent a good bit of time travelling around the Drink (Med Sea) and continental Europe.  Non-Americans don't hate americans because of Bush but because of our lifestyle and somewhat predictable stereotypical personalities.  Now don't get me wrong ... a great deal of us do not fit into such stereotypes, but enough do that it has stuck world-wide.  On the same note tons of people abroad like Americans just fine, but enough don't that it presents itself a noticable problem while traveling.<br />
<br />
I've had rocks thrown at me in Bath, England.  Been cursed and spit on in the in the streets Paris, and been literally roughed up in Greece for no other reason than i was an American ... and people don't like us.  In none of these incidents was I doing more than trying to go from point A to point B minding my own business quietly ambling along.  It wasn't because Bush was our president.  We're genearlly loud, arrogant pricks.  You can tell after being abroad for 6 months when an American is in the vicinity, because you can hear them about 2 blocks away.<br />
<br />
Now, combine this stereotypical view of an &quot;American&quot; with the fact that we as a country have stuck our noses in everyone's business for the last 60 years ... often dictating what they as nations can and cant should and shouldnt do and you now have PUSHY loud arrogant obnoxious pricks who like to force their lifestyles and government ideals on you.<br />
<br />
Mix this with 1500 years of religious wars/disputes, the present-day Israeli Nation, the fact that our cultures are so vastly different, and very radical Islam and you're gonna run into conflict, often of the violent nature.  The world abroad doesn't hate us because of Bush ... they hate us because of who we are (which isn't really all that pretty when you think about it).  Bush may have reinforced this notion to the world .. but then again so has every president since World War 2.  It's who we are as a nation, so don't try to pin this on one man.<br />
<br />
Don't kid yourself ... North Africa and the Middle east have not been safe for the last 60 years, unless you're very good at disguising your native origin.  Bush is just the scape-goat of the year.</div></div><hr />

Employing the transcending irreverent defense I see.... That even if we rearrange all the little molecules that make up the planet that's still inconsequential in a broaddddd sense. Well I would call it pretty fucking consequiential to life and the Earth as we know it. Your right we could destroy human life and the planet would go on, thats besides the point by a long shot and infact defends the viewpoint you oppose. <br />
<br />
Here's a little history/science/math lesson- something, most think it was a meteor or several meteors, caused almost half the species of life on the Earth to blink out millions of years ago. Pretty big consequence no? Now here's the scenario- we  (humans) have enough nuclear power to blink out nearl ALL species of life on this planet through direct impact, enviromental changes, geological shifts, atmoshpereic changes and the posioning of radiation which would last years- all of those accompanying a nuclear disaster. Would life re-emerge? Maybe. Would the Earth's gelogicial structure remain roughly the same? probably (this is from this scenario based around pure suface detonations). Is this inconsequential? no. The earth has around 5-6 billion years before it crashes into the sun and is destroyed- life took a few billion years to form life, punting it back to square one or near square one for a few million years- pretty fucking consequential .<br />
<br />
But doomsday theories are a mere showing of the extremes, the simple fact that human impact and it's dire consequences is discussed daily in 7th grade biology classes is enough to show that you're viewpoint is among the crazed minority and/or groups of heavily intoxicated philosophers.<br />
<br />
That people can so clearly ignore science shown through experiments even our grade-schoolers can do is quite terrifying.</div></div><hr />

He hasn't  caused  the animosity, only made it visibly worse from my own experiences abroad.

Where in Democrat controlled presinks, where the Democrats controll names on the voting lists.  Also on those infamious Butterfly ballots in some of the presinks were made by a Democrat.  Dont blame Bush's for their blocking thousands of voters from voting. <br />
<br />
Furthermore when Floridia was called it was 8pm Eastern, while a part of the Floridia Panhandle which is in Central time still had another 1 hour to vote.  The Panhandle of Floridia is largely Republican.  Many of those Republicans were in line to vote at 7pm when they heard that Floridia was called for Gore at 8pm Eastern.  Many of those Republican voters then left never voting that night.  The fact is Floridia was called for Gore at approx 8:00pm Eastern.  Then later Fox News took Floridia off from Gore win to a wait and see.  Then it moved to Bush where it stayed.  Like it or not Bush won by 900ish votes, then by 500ish after all the recounts.<br />
<br />
Bush could of chalanged elections in other states in 2000 where he lost to Gore by less then 1000 Votes.  Bush lost New Mexico by approx 300 to 500 votes.  Bush lost Wisconsin by approx 1000 votes.<br />
<br />
and guess who called the election for Bush at Fox News...Bush's 1st cousin...id say thats a bit of a CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  Besides, what the fuck is with Fox setting the standard for all the other stations?  EVERYONE else called Florida for Gore until Fox decided that theyd call it for bush.  Then miraculously, all the other networks apologised and basically said &quot;oh fox said bush won so he must have, were sorry for not agreeing with fox&quot;</div></div><hr />

As far as impacting  the universe goes.... no idea where that came from as it's an entirely different set of boundaries.  You presented the statement that the human species had/has an &quot;inconsequential&quot; impact on the planet EARTH - I pointed out that no way in hell, no matter what school of science you follow, that is plausible. Link me the studies that back up you're point of view and I'll start linking mine. As far as this being a political point... no Idea where that came from....

<br />
You know Frodlin, you're an intelligent man.  Which is why I find it so hard to understand the point you're trying to make.  Are you attempting to say that it is simply impossible for mankind to so pollute and contaminate the environment to the point that the result is the massive dying off of large numbers of flora and fauna, including human beings?  Because I think the evidence clearly shows that on a local level, we're certainly quite capable of such a dubious accomplishment.  Lets talk Chernobyl and Three Mile Island to name two.  We can certainly go into the details of why the EPA has the Superfund which was established to deal with hazardous waste.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty easy to follow logical chain to believe that if we cause wide spread environmental destruction on a local level, that given enough repetitions of similar disastors, a much greater problem will develop.  Do we really understand the long term impact of the oil fires in Iraq, as an example?  No, not really, and I don't think you can plausibly claim otherwise.<br />
<br />
Yes, if given time the earth is quite capable of repairing most harm the human species could come up with.  The problem being however, would mankind survive in the mean time?  The answer seems to be pretty obvious that given enough build up of environmental damage, that it is unlikely that human beings in large numbers would survive.  Of couse in all likelihood some would, humans are a pretty adaptable species after all and would probably figure out ways to survive, even if only marginally.  But is that really the legacy that you want to hand down to your children or your grandchildren?  A world so polluted and contaminated by humanity that it can only support a mere percentage of the human population it once could and it will be centuries before it can again?</div></div><hr />

That's what your boy Bush is doing right now with his fundamentalist attitude.  Basically, he's killing people.

That's not at all the point i was trying to make. The point I was making, which was sidetracked, and for that I apologize, is that science and politics should be kept further apart than church and state.<br />
<br />
The absolute worst thing for science is the recent influx of well intentioned people into the academic arena with the lofty goal of &quot;making a difference&quot;, when that's precisely the opposite of what science should be, which is impassionate and impartial observation and recording.<br />
<br />
The worst thing for public policy is to have activist/alarmist scientists, people who can barely get tenure, much less sustain a lab on legitimate grant funding who fluff up their credentials sitting on public policy panels providing a false sense of legitimacy to the whole pile of garbage.<br />
<br />
It's a basic truth that industry, thus the economy runs on oil, because there's no replacement, not because of a lack of funding, but because of a lack of a realistic alternative.  That alternative cannot be funded into existence, it can't be voted for, and it is very likely that it won't be found by looking for it.   If it follows the trend of every other important discovery, it'll happen by accident while looking at something else entirely.  <br />
<br />
The funding won't come from a grant, it'll most likely come when someone identifies it as a viable alternative to fossil fuel, which everyone wants (except OPEC countries, who will basically fall into economic ruin and obscurity) and will be implemented like every other viable technology has been.  Purchase orders will be written, checks will be made out, and people will use.<br />
<br />
The person sitting in the White House when it happens will benefit but not because of anything he or she has done, but because they got lucky and were at the right place at the right time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
China and India are already Industrialized, and because of lax regulations, are significantly larger polluters than *all* of &quot;the West&quot; is combined.   It's really sad to see the collective guilt complex that people have about being relatively wealthy, when it's not wealth or technology that harms the environment, but a lack of caring.   <br />
<br />
I've travelled quite a bit in my life, and have learned from experience that we have an incredibly unreasonable amount of guilt here in the west.    We're actually pretty darned good at policing ourselves compared to many other places where a more Darwinian social structure exists.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I don't understand where you're coming from. If you think the planet will go on without us, you're right. If you think that we can not possibly exterminate all life from the planet, you're right.

<br />
Where I'm coming from is that I think it's important to be wise stewards of the home that we've been granted, but that doesn't mean to blow stuff comletely out of proportion with reality.   The planet may or may not be warming or cooling, the planet has gone through periods of temperature fluctuations a number of times prior, and none of that was credited to human intervention or existence.  <br />
<br />
It's very likely that a period of warming will not necessarily have the devastating results that a lot of people think it will anyhow.   There's a lot more to global temperature fluctuations and their ramifications than simply &quot;Ice caps will melt, sea levels will rise, Florida will be underwater, and the great plains will turn into deserts&quot;.<br />
<br />
What's often overlooked is the balancing nature of the drop in ocean temperatures based on the melting of the ice caps, and introduction of cooled water, and it's resultant cooling of the atmosphere, leading to an expansion of the ice caps... yadda yadda.   This topic is FAR FAR FAR too complex to show up on the news, or in some Stump Speech, or some special on the Discovery Channel.   This stuff is WAY over the head of any politician who is by nature a selfish pig seeking to feed from the public trough who will say anything to get elected, including scaring you, your children, your parents into supporting them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frod, it's an election year.  Every year we're told that everyone makes a difference.  These people are doing what they feel they need to in order to make their views known.  President Bush is a fucking oil monger.  That's not the direction this country needs to go.  It needs to move away, and it better move away soon.  <br />
<br />
It's a basic truth that industry, thus the economy runs on oil, because there's no replacement, not because of a lack of funding, but because of a lack of a realistic alternative. That alternative cannot be funded into existence, it can't be voted for, and it is very likely that it won't be found by looking for it. If it follows the trend of every other important discovery, it'll happen by accident while looking at something else entirely. <br />
<br />
No, it can be funded into existance.  Right now the best hybrid cars are breaking even with vehicles that people buy when they want to commute.  The problem is that all they can do is break even, and not surpass them at the moment, for a cost that is much greater than it's oil burning counterpart.  The problem is the cost barrier right now, because Joe Average isn't going to make up the 10 grand he forks over for a hybrid vehicle in fuel savings.  That's not enough to make most of the population switch to a more fuel conscience vehicle.<br />
<br />
The barrier lies in place because the government keeps it in place.  Bush funds shit that benefits his state and his oil, and he doesn't fun viable alternatives.  He funds programs to look into fucking BURYING CO2 in the goddamned ground instead of looking at reducing the output of it.  He doesn't care about viable alternatives, because what he has right now is making his family a LOT of money.  His view on the situation is skewed by finances.  It's real easy to stand on the outside and see where we should be heading to stop our global dependancy on foreign oil, but nobody wants to take the steps to do it.  It's not a lack of research, or a lack of knowledge or a lack of technology, it's a lack of funding, plain and fucking simple, because people don't want to piss off the people that are making oil at the moment.  <br />
<br />
The net result is that we're getting there, but we're getting there a lot fucking slower than if some dipshit in the Washington finally stood up for himself and said &quot;No, you know what, this is not the direction this country needs to be going.&quot;  It's not gonna happen with Bush, so I'll put my money on Kerry being able to do something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the problem with that position.  The occupant of the White House isn't relevant to technological advancement of specific applications.   <br />
<br />
Auto companies will make what sells.  They really really want to make cars that sell, and the one who makes the first eco-friendly car that's realistic and will have a favorable cost/benefit ratio will make a fortune.   The occupant of the white house doesn't matter to this truth, the number of consumers on dealer lots is what matters.   <br />
<br />
We had a diptshit in Washington for 8 years who wasn't beholden to oil companies and got no further than we are with the current dipshit, and the next dipshit won't speed up technology, he's not capable of it.   <br />
<br />
It really doesn't matter who's in the White House, Bush or Kerry, they're both idiots in their own right, but neither can or will do anything to solve or change the current state of oil dependence.   The only difference is that Kerry appears less biased toward the oil industry because he's never been part of it, whereas Bush owes his livelihood to it.   If it makes you feel better to have someone in the White House that can't be tied to the oil industry, then great, but dont' be under the delusion that he'll have any positive impact on the state of oil dependence in the world.  <br />
<br />
I happen to agree that the world is too dependent on oil, but I totally and completely disagree with the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;what will end it&quot;.  What will end it is some dude we've never heard of coming up with something on accident.   Hybrid cars will probably make a decent filler until that point happens, but won't have nearly the impact that you want to believe they will.  I suppose small steps are better than no steps, but I think you're putting your eggs into the wrong basket in thinking that politicians can succeed at anything but getting themselves elected.<br />
<br />
It's the rare breed that actually does stuff, the FDR's, the Hubert Humphreys, the Abraham Lincolns, and yes, the Ronald Reagans of the world are a breed that doesn't come along all that often.  It's far more common to have do-nothings like the Bill Clintons, Grover Cleavelands, George Bush 1.0 and 2.0, Chester T Arthurs of the world than the great ones.<br />
<br />
One thing is for certain, we will not have a great president for at least 4 more years.</div></div><hr />

I have that position.  Believe me, I'm not unrealistic about it.  I know damned well that the likelyhood of something changing in the administration is small with Kerry, but it's a fucking negative chance with Bush.<br />
<br />
I don't happen to agree with you however, that the president is powerless to move technology forward.  Kennedy was directly responsible for putting a man on the moon...an accomplishment which has not been bettered, or even matched, since.  <br />
<br />
Will Kerry be the next one to make such a powerful statement to science?  I don't think so.  But I really doubt Bush is going to do any good in the grand scheme of things at all, so I'd rather take the chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes you have to be happy you have a job, but that does not mean the employer gets to milk away your life and enslave you in poor encomic times.<br />
<br />
Also consider how it can be for those who live outside of city districts, you do the same thing Vick does by assuming there is just another job or line of work to move into.<br />
<br />
All of you, from asshat A to asshat B need to know that some of us have medical problems that require expensive drugs, and the funny thing about these jobs that do not pay enough for people to afford them also have the shitty health plans that do not cover them, how is someone to survive when they could be killed by an increase in flower pollen? or some poor guy who needs blood pressure meds? what about diabetics?<br />
<br />
Grow the fuck up and look into the area's of your mental peripheral vision and see the people who are not perfectly able to work 60 hours without having major health problems, look at the guy who worked so hard he ruined his knees or his back being a factory worker, or look at the guy who has spent the last 16 years as a modern smelter in the metal industry who can now no longer do the job he has spent all his life doing because fucking guy named huk aluk in some backwater hole will do it cheaper and our government allows it, and to top it off the son of a bitch wants to cut his head off if he goes to look for work over there!<br />

Hell a guy can have a missing leg, a fused backbone and no motor control in his fingers and not get any government aid because none of his problems alone would bar him from working, but of course they never look at problems as a whole.<br />

Bush said 2 years ago that outsourcing would just be low skill factory work and that americans would be able to move into high skill fields such as tech, now look where all our microchips are being made, now look where all our techsupport and programming went, now look at the best job option for me is some fastfood place.<br />

Even using a projected model of devastation (blanket coverage of the planet in a single nuclear attack, which isn't practically possible), all that would have to happen to make your statement bullshit is one living thing to live.   <br />
<br />
Let me guarantee you that well more than one living being would easily endure a nuclear attack of such a magnitude, even assuming that it were possible, which it isn't.   <br />
<br />
You make such a nonsensical overestimation such as this, then, quite humorously, call ME on it.<br />
<br />
My stance vs. your stance? The &quot;stance&quot; of your's I was arguing was what I quoted several times- that you said the human impact on the planet Earth was &quot;an inconsequential blip&quot;. <br />
<br />
The quip on nuclear devestation what is known as an &quot;example&quot;, something used in a debate to further a point, something you don't seem to be able to produce to defend your viewpoint. As far as the validity of saying nuclear war would be &quot;inconsequential&quot; to life on this planet (the original topic of contention) The US stilll has over 6,000 &quot;operationally deployed&quot; active nuclear warheads and 10,240 total. Russia, The United Kingdom, France, Isreal, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea- bringing the count up to 19,724 nuclear warheads, a good percentage of which packing near to above fusion bomb power. That count does not include low-yeild tactical nuclear weapons, rogue weapons, or &quot;dirty bombs&quot; that could be created from rogue nuclear material.<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter - The theory of nuclear winter in a  nutshell, which was backed by the US's own nuclear testing. Magnify it several times to applying to large portions of the Earth's surface, which would be characteristic after a large scale nuclear war (which would only use a tiny portion of that 19k number of nukes)- pretty fucking consequential I'd say. That's not even calculating the theoretical yield of even 50% of our nuclear weapons- which would release so much radiation into the soil it would veritable poison, rain would fall laced with radiation, and so much dust would be released into the atmosphere, if the initial heat of all those nukes didn't rip the atmoshphere a new one, then the dust would blot out the sun for years to come. Considering that the Earth really has no way of dealing with radiation naturally, other than enduring it's half life- I'm throwing out the really OUT THERE and WILD proposition that perhaps a lot of life on this planet would die should even a portion of our theoretically destuctive capability be realized. Life would go on, of course, but it would be forever altered- just as it was forever altered when half the known species blinked out of existence some 65 million years ago. Whatever caused that to occur, I assure humanity has enough power to mimic and magnify. Putting that in context with the fact the lifespan of Earth as a planet is finite, it would equal= consequential.</div></div><hr />

Your wrong about alternate fuel sources being hard to find, a local chemist here in texas had found that if you took a little plant based glucose, a little distilled water, a planium bar and some water just under boiling you could cause a hydrogen reaction around the platnium catalyst, creating more power than was taken to create it.<br />
<br />
The man was doing more R&amp;D to find a better catalyst than platnium for the reaction and guess what? a certain well know oil company payed him quite a bit to stop his work.<br />
<br />
Real wonderful world we have huh? the guy had basically made a 2 section fishtank that could produce what was needed for hydrogen fuel cells for pennys but I guess that was a threat to oil company wealth... all that was stopping this from being worked into a real powersource was a little more R&amp;D while they tried to prefect an enzyme to make it work quicker and more efficent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BossBeachBall</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Science and scientific advancement runs on money- funding, research grants and tax breaks. Could a president speed of the advancement of technology by simply dumping an idefinite amount of money into it? No. There are limitations and boundaries that simply can't be crossed with out time consuming research. However though, money is fundamental and can by increasing funds you allow scientists to purchase better equipment, fund more experimentation, and bring new ideas and thinkers into the field they are researching. Money can greatly speed up research to a given point- and the people who control a huge portion of money going to United States scientific research? The goverment and specifically the president who has the power to approve or veto any bill on scientific spending. So is the president in ultimate control of scientific research on a whole? No but he has the power to greatly speed it up simply with the power of the American dollar.<br />
<br />
That being said we should look and see that we really are extremely close to the end of the oil driven economy. Even the US goverment knows it, as they have had a plan for sometime to &quot;seamlessly&quot; integrate our economy with new power sources- in by their estimation, less than 40 years.<br />
<br />
Now I'm no fan of Bush's liberal spending policies lacking any fiscal responsibility whatsoever, but perhaps if we had even used a portion of the billions spent in Iraq to get us a little closer to weaning ourselves of the teat of foreign oil by furthering research in hybrid cars, nuclear power sources, and hydrogen power sources, we'd be better off. International policing aside- Western involvement in the Middle East will sharply decrease as the oil driven economy diminishes.<br />
<br />
And for anyone's information- Sometime this October Ford is shipping 30 of it's fuel cell Focus's to local govermental organizations for testing in the real world. Some small proof that even automobile makers have resigned that the oil driven economy is on the way out and are ready to embrace new moneymaking technologies.</div></div><hr />

It's interesting that intelligent people can have major differences of opinion on such things.<br />
<br />
I have an aquaintance who is working on String Theory. MAYBE he will have some impact on the world outside of the Ivory Tower, but most likely not. IF he does, it will be world transforming. Hopefully he's had a course on engineering ethics.<br />
<br />
Another acquaintance is a religious fundamentalist. Somehow he is able to reconcile a belief that God faked the fossil record with aggrement that God didn't fake electrical engineering and mathematics. Thankfully he doesn't think the world should be kneeling in prayer 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
A third acquaintence is a Priest. He has attended protests against the death penalty (and abortion - he holds ALL life sacred), for civil rights, against the pre-emptive Iraq War, occupation, and puppet regime. He (like poor President Jimmy Carter) has his sence of morallity and he applies it to the human condition and politics.<br />
<br />
People of good will regardless of their particualr beliefs can live at peace with one another. Your God demands that YOU follow his rules, NOT that you impose what YOU think his commandments are on me.<br />
<br />
The problem Frodlin is that the religious right has no interest in social justice and they apply their sence of moral outrage selectively. The Family Values campaign slogan sounds nice until you realize it's being used to dismantle public education, freedom of speech and association, and to attack other competing (in their minds) value systems  - they hurt families and they have no values. They are much like the Red Brigade clutching a Bible in their hands insted of Mao's little red book and go after &quot;godless&quot; secular humanists, OMG Liberals!!, and others using religion as a sword rather than a lamp to see in the darkness.<br />
<br />
Bush is not very bright and he has a value system that compells him to harm others and sanctimoniously feel justified. He's scary as heck to me - seriously. The Sword of True Belief wielded by the self-rightous is scary no matter who's doing it.<br />

When your God demands that you do things that makes other people cry, you best look to see if it's God or the Great Deceiver you are listening to.<br />

True as anything.<br />

Kerry's words on abortion are quite a bit better than the actions GW has taken based on what he thinks god would do, I want kerry to have the chance to practice what he preaches as bush has had plenty of time to do so... one might say more than he needed with all his vacation time.<br />

I'm ready for a new persons efforts, so thats how I am voting...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a member of the Air National Guard.  I belong to a ground radar unit (commonly known as GTACS).  GTACS units are generally stationed on Army and Marine camps.  I've already spent 2 years in activation and next year am scheduled to spend a 90 day rotation in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I was an Army brat and spent half my life in Europe.  Let me tell you, most of Europe has always hated us and always will.  Bush didn't start that trend.  I don't give a crap what the French think about us and what we do.  I've been there.  We could cure AIDS and the French would still complain about us.  They don't like us regardless of what we do.  There are some countries that liked Americans while I was there.  They still do.<br />
<br />
I hate politicians.  All of them.  In fact, the only politician I would trust to show any sense of honesty at all is Joe Lieberman.  I will be voting for Bush, though.  Not because I trust him, although I trust him a good deal more than Kerry.  Kerry is a hypocrite, plain and simple.  He votes to invade Iraq and says that Saddam is a danger to us, now he says that invading Iraq was a mistake and Saddam wasn't a danger to us.  He attacks Bushs war record, then says that military records shouldn't be used in a campaign.  At one point, he even said that his Senate voting record should not be brought into the election, which has to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Lets not forget that the UN spent 12 years telling Saddam that they would invade Iraq if he didn't comply with thier resolutions and he didn't comply.  Whatever the case was, we know for a fact that Saddam was torturing and killing thousands of his own people and the UN did nothing to stop it.  For that reason alone I'd say that getting rid of him was justified.  Maybe it could be done a little better, but at least he did it.  Would Kerry?  Or would Kerry have ignored it, as Clinton did?  Health care has always been screwed up and nobody has tried to fix it, including Kerry.  I don't consider that a factor here.  My biggest beef with taxes is the stupid crap it gets wasted on.  Millions of dollars went into advertising campaigns to make you feel better about buying an American made car (which doesn't even exist anymore).  Is that a good use of tax dollars?  We don't need more taxes, we need to quit throwing away tax dollars on meaningless crap.  Anti-smoking ads?  Guess what, they don't stop smoking.  It didn't stop me or anyone else I know.<br />
<br />
Also, everyone is up in arms about Bush being an Oil-man.  Guess what!  Kerry isn't any better.  Bush has oil, Kerry has ketchup.  Not really much difference except that Kerry is actually the richer of the two even if he pretends he isn't.<br />
<br />
The only things I would trust Kerry to carry through on are the things that should never happen (i.e. allowing the EU and UN to govern us - that would nullify the constitution and the Declaration of Independance).  I'm not so much voting for Bush as voting against Kerry.  And no, I'm not ignorant of Bush or Kerry.  I follow both of them closely.  I get to see the effects of Bush's decisions first-hand.  But the US grew complacent before 9-11.  We are on our toes now.  Under Kerry, I believe that we would grow complacent once again and we can't do that.  Kerry trusts the international community to handle bad situations, but history has shown that it simply doesn't happen and generally gets alot of people hurt.<br />
<br />
If you choose to vote for Kerry, more power to you.  At least you are voting.  I'd rather see Kerry win with 20 million people voting than Bush win with 5000 people voting.  At least people are showing interest in the future of the country.</div></div><hr />

When a complete stranger walks up to you no matter what you want to make a good impression and you wont be like, 'well hows it hangin today thar partnar. Keel any buks lately?&quot; no your gunna use the best grammer available to you as thats how in your mind sets the best impression. Now when you are around friends and family you loosen up some and your true self comes out and every single person i know from texas uses heavy slang because thats what we grew up on. Bush grew up on slang and still uses it because Thats who he is.  <br />

This is the silly part...you assume that this isn't true in EVERY OTHER PART OF THE US.<br />

In New York, CA, Idaho, Chicago, Tennesse, Arkansas, people act very much the same.  They all have slang, they all loosen up around friends, they all have a bit of superiority about people who live elsewhere.  Thinking you are so unique and different is an illusion.

Here's a situation for you.<br />
<br />
Your wife is killed.<br />
<br />
Someone in a position of power tells you &quot;That guy over there did it.  I've got proof.&quot;  He displays the 'proof' for you, which is kinda fuzzy...but considering the source that it's coming from, it's good enough for you.<br />
<br />
You want the bastard strung up.<br />
<br />
Later on, we find out thru DNA evidence, that the dude over there, really didn't do it, and that guy in a position of power had been lying to you all the while.  Stretching the facts.  Exaggerating what he had on the suspect.<br />
<br />
Is your anger towards the innocent man still justified?  Why?<br />
<br />
The same thing happened here.  Bush and his fucking cronies fed the senate absolute bullshit.  When you hear a claim from the most powerful man in the country that &quot;These guys are bad, they got lots of weapons, we have to get rid of them,&quot; you should probably take it seriously.<br />
<br />
After we look back on it, isn't it okay to say &quot;Okay, Bush is a fuckin douchebag.  He fuckin lied to us to promote his own personal agenda.  In that sense, it WAS a mistake to invade Iraq because he had zero justification for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't fucking understand why you people see this as a bad quality.  It's called hindsight...learning from your fucking mistakes so that you're not doomed to repeat them over and over again.  You apparantly want the man who has no remorse for making a wrong decision.  How is that better than this &quot;flip flop&quot; bullshit everyone claims?</div></div><hr />

Bush, however, signed a law that completely bans partial-birth abortion with no exception even  if the mother's health is at risk by carrying that baby to term.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me explain partial-birth abortion to you. The child has been carried full term, the child is being born, the doctor reaches in and smashes the childs head as it come out. The female goes through EVERY part of carrying the child and giving birth but the child is killed as it pops out of the womb. If she is going to die from carrying the child full term she will die durring a partial birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion, from a legal standpoint, is 2 inches away form murder. If the doctor doesn't kill the child at just the right time it pops out and is born then killed but there will never be murder charges brought up against one of these doctors.<br />
<br />
Yes, we need some exception for abortion, if the mothers life is in danger from giving birth the female should have the choice of preserving her life or giving the child life. If she is raped she should have a choice. However, the countless bimbos out there that use abortion as a form of birth control because they either a) can't keep their legs crossed or b) don't feel that using some type of protection is nessacary should be lined up and shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hmmm, Kerry has even said he had every bit of intel that Bush had so wouldn't that make Kerry just as guilty of being a dumbass and not able to tell that the CIA, FBI, and international intel were all wrong? Personally I blame Clinton, he's the one that raped the funding for our intel agencies and military. He's also the one who did NOTHING after the first NYC bombing, after the USS Cole attack and did not accept Bin Laden when he was offered him and Kerry sings praises about what Clinton did for terrorism. <br />
<br />
If Kerry wins the election you will see a draft, 15-20% inflation across the board(depends on how much he raises minimum wage), the middle class shrink and lower class grow(again how much depends on how much he raises minimum wage), higher taxes across the board, and several terrorist attacks.<br />
<br />
I don't like Bush, I would love to see him out office, but the only other option is Kerry and I really don't feel like getting drafted, having my taxes raised, having my money devauled dramatically, and lose more loved ones to terrorist attacks over the next 4 years.</div></div><hr />

Apparently Congress didn't. The information that the document purporting to show Iraq was attempting to obtain radioactive material was already known to be a forgery in Great Britain. GWB was urged (afaik) not to use it directly as &quot;evidence&quot; as it was at least suspect.<br />
<br />
As the damming thing is this - in the second debate GWB made a big point that we should be unwaveringly resolute, not to question. I'm afraid it's exactly this that caused marginal evidence to be collected. collated, and used to build a case in the first place - resolve by the President that there would be a case and there would be evidence to support it.<br />
<br />
In this case intelligence product that was demanded to be produced to support a pre-determined policy, rather than policy in responce to intelligence. The cart was leading the horse and that's how the Bush team wanted it.<br />
<br />
My problem is two-fold: OMG, how amazingly incompetent and unreliable is our intelligence community when they miss 9/11 completely and with 12 years to establish wether or not Sadam had WMD's they get it WRONG!!! They, the intelligence community are a clear and present danger to the continued existance of the US!!<br />
<br />
Either the case was puffed up (Bush lied) or we are in incredible danger because our intelligence community is profoundly incompetetant. Which is it?<br />
<br />
....and I find it more than a little suspicious how Kerry's change of opinion on the iraq war coincides with Howard Dean's surge in popularity in the democratic primary.<br />
I heard the former House Minority Leader (starts with an 'A', Contract with America) say almost word for word what you've said on a NPR interview. It, like the PROOF that Iraq had WMD's, is wishful thinking on his part, not truthfulness.<br />
<br />
The last resistance in Germany after WWII didn't cease until the early 1950's -there was limited guerrilla warfare until then. Even when you thoroughly defeat a country, there will be at least 10 years of resistance. Only a complete fool would invade without realizing occupation might last a decade.<br />
<br />
Again we are confronted with either concluding Bush's team has bad analysis, puffing up the information, or are optimistic.<br />
<br />
I think Kerry wanted to believe the President of the US when he voted to give him the option to use force. I think subsequently he has seen every reason to doubt GWB and be much more reserved about support. Not a case of following public opinion, but a case of &quot;Fool me once/shame on you Mr. President. Fool me twice....&quot;<br />

<br />
Yes there is, however the female can(and I know many that have) can go get an abortion at will and never tell the man she was carrying his child. The both, the male and female, make the choice to have sex. They know there is a chance there would be a child as a result and they should be willing to take some personal responcibility in the event that happens. Be it have the child and raise it together, one parent raises the child, give it up for adoption, etc.<br />
<br />
There are females out there who use abortion as their birth control. They will have about 2 a year instead of using protection and will never tell the father, if they even know who it is. In my mind that makes them no better then any other serial killer. I know girls who do this, am friends with them. I do NOT hate them for what they do, but I do indeed hate their actions. Their excuse is simple &quot;abortion is a legal form of birth control so I don't have to worry about getting pregnant.&quot;. Those are the people that feed anti-abortion people. The ones who do it over an over without taking any personal responcibility for their actions becuase they can always just go kill the baby.</div></div><hr />

Draft: The activation of the Resreve, National Guard, and very heavy use of contractors is already a bad sign. New enlistments in the Mass. Nation Guard are down 30% and attrition through railure to re-enlist is high enough for the Comandant to state that there's a major problem otw. Looks like Bush has set the stage for some military manpower problems for the next 5-10 years.<br />
<br />
Inflation: Energy costs is a leading cause of inflation. Perhaps you remember the inflation during the Carter years almost entirely due to gas prices? Check the price at the pump lately? Looks like Bush has set us up for inflation with high energy costs and funding a war while simultainiously lowering tax revenue (increased goverment borrowing is a second major cause of inflation). <br />

Terrorist attacks:<br />
Americans are being killed daily now in terrorist attacks in Iraq. Funny, I don't recall this being the case previous to the Bush administration.<br />

The Big Lie:<br />
From Iraq has WMD's, Kerry will cause inflation and terror attacks, and women use abortion as birth control (in prefernce to birth control pills, patches, and NorPlant),  all that's left is the Big Lie. Most people (including the US Congress) aren't expecting it and sometimes it even works.<br />

<br />
Troops dieing in Iraq is different then troops dieing in Bosnia, Somolia, etc under Clinton how? That's right, Bush got a congressional vote first, unlike Clinton. My friends that fought overseas under Clinton hated it, they were in a place they were not wanted fighting a war that had nothing to do with us. My friends in Iraq hate being there but atleast they know the paople want us there. We haven't found the big stockpile of WMD's we all thought we would, the current count is around 200 missles and a few hundred pounds of chemicals. Granted that is still more then enough chemical warefare to take out the entire west coast. <br />
<br />
The UN wants us to send tropps to Africa, Bush won't send our troops over there to get aids and bring it back to the US, but Kerry will in a heartbeat. You want the Africa aids epidemic on your doorstep vote for Kerry. This BS of doing what the world wants and not protecting ourselves is garbage. The idea that we shouldn't attack a country that hates us and can attack us is BS. Let's take a trip through history. Germany never attacked us, what happens if we stop after Japan surrenders and never go into Europe to fight Hitler? <br />
<br />
Base your vote on what you think will happen with Kerry or Bush in office, which will be worse for you, because neither is an ideal choice, this election much like the last is a case of lesser evils, but this choice is much clearer to me then 4 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious?  Aids is already in the US.<br />
<br />
<br />
 My friends that fought overseas under Clinton hated it, <br />
<br />
I am hoping these are different friends than the ones that you find reprehensible for having abortions 2 timers a year but still hang out with?<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be mean but you've used &quot;friends I know&quot; as substaniation for your last 3-4 posts.</div></div><hr />

Then at least there is no way he can contribute to the situation.<br />
<br />
As far as the rest of it is concerned, I'd respond, but surprisingly enough BB has managed to counter all the essentials in a very capable way.  No need for me to add more to that at all.</div></div><hr />

(WARNING GRAPHIC MEDICAL REPRESENTATION)<br />
<br />
http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html<br />
<br />
that shows how its done in textbook style (no real pictures)<br />
<br />
It is done because the head is harder to pass than the rest of the child, they make the skull collapse so that it can be pulled out, also some women can not live thru the labor time, the PBA can be done in under an hour as things are not left up to nature.<br />
<br />
Learn you battle ground before you spout bullshit ok ass? shockjock tactics do not work well when others are not stupid.<br />
<br />
As for moral objects go back a few pages ok? I have several qoutes from the bible of what people thought and did under gods name.<br />
<br />
word of advice<br />
<br />
NEVER THINK YOURSELF AS IMPORTANT AS THAT YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING GODS WORK, HE DOES NOT NEED YOUR HELP<br />
<br />
If someone else ends up in hell, oh well... I just wish they would give the child something so they do not have to die with such pain.<br />
<br />
Check for Intrauterine Cranial Decompression or D&amp;X if you want to be informed for a change.<br />
<br />
just so as we are clear so no one goes running to vote for bush it is preformed in the 5th month by the way, a little way over half the full term so it is not at birth.<br />
<br />
Also you mention clinton.... he is the one who started work on Intrauterine cranial decompression banning so as you know.... also he is NO LONGER IN OFFICE, SO THAT IS NOT A VALID DEFENSE UNLESS HE ANNOUNCES TODAY THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR OFFICE!<br />
<br />
Had to add that with an edit, the clinton defense is so damn stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You uh, didn't get my point.<br />
<br />
Let me explain it in words a 2-year-old like you can understand:<br />
<br />
Banning abortion totally, without regard to special circumstances such as the mother's health etc, is a black-and-white view that should not be espoused by the politicians making the rules.<br />
<br />
If you can't understand why that's bad, then you need to get a vascectomy and not breed, because the last thing we need in this country is more yahoo'ing idiots who can't read and enjoy plastering their views all over other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think the &quot;Bush is a idiot who couldn't find his ass with both hands and misled congress using bogus information&quot; defense would be more appropriate.<br />
<br />
So what your saying is the US congress can't see through a hoax fabricated by an idiot who can't find his ass with both hands?  That must be one brilliantly devious idiot to get 90% of the congress to vote on a war if it was obviously unjustified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me explain partial-birth abortion to you. The child has been carried full term, the child is being born, the doctor reaches in and smashes the childs head as it come out. The female goes through EVERY part of carrying the child and giving birth but the child is killed as it pops out of the womb. If she is going to die from carrying the child full term she will die durring a partial birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion, from a legal standpoint, is 2 inches away form murder. If the doctor doesn't kill the child at just the right time it pops out and is born then killed but there will never be murder charges brought up against one of these doctors.<br />
<br />
Yes, we need some exception for abortion, if the mothers life is in danger from giving birth the female should have the choice of preserving her life or giving the child life. If she is raped she should have a choice. However, the countless bimbos out there that use abortion as a form of birth control because they either a) can't keep their legs crossed or b) don't feel that using some type of protection is nessacary should be lined up and shot.<br />
<br />
It is just as much a man's fault too.  Men are so fucking driven by sex that sometimes women cant say no.  A lot of men do not like using protection either.  To put all the blame on the women is purely sexist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">brutul that man gets more support than a saggy old hooker.<br />
<br />
He has people like wolfiwitz, kenth lay, powell, channy etc backing him and helping him sound creditable.... ever wonder why they appear on TV more than he does? its because he can not sound creditable without a support staff and that is why he is bombing in the debates</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Afaik, any missiles  or munitions found were already known to inspection teams - except 1 or 2 shells were found buried that may have contained Sarin. Other than a bag full of Castor Bean Seeds (seeds you used to be able to pick up from Burpee, Castor Beans are a ultra fast landscaping plant) I'm unaware of any massive quantity of *cough* WMD's.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, it's as Saddam said - they didn't have them. Although he was concerned that you can't prove a negative, he allowed inspections to resume until it was obvious they were cataloging sites to be hit in the upcoming US invasion Bush was determined would happen.<br />
<br />
I didn't like Saddam, but how much confidence do you think he had in diplomacy when the US President makes up bald-faced lies about Iraq buying weapons grade uranium in Africa and states them to a gullible world?<br />
<br />
My God sir, the US captured Chemical Ali and Saddam himself. Is it even concievable if there were WMD's they wouldn't say something after a year of being in 'stress positions, having food and light manipulated to cause mental break down, living with a bag over their head, had having water pumped up their nostrils while interrogators bounced on their chest and diaphrams' by 'consultants who do to the nature of their &quot;work&quot; it's difficult to establish the identities of??<br />
<br />
The best reason for voting for Bush is as a skin-head neo fasist acquaintance said, &quot;You oh so smart liberals have all the good jobs while we fix cars and mow lawns and you felt soooo superior. Bush is OUR President and now we're running things. Pay back's a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
I want my country back sir. Let Bush return to blowing up frogs with firecrackers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, Kerry has even said he had every bit of intel that Bush had so wouldn't that make Kerry just as guilty of being a dumbass and not able to tell that the CIA, FBI, and international intel were all wrong? Personally I blame Clinton, he's the one that raped the funding for our intel agencies and military. He's also the one who did NOTHING after the first NYC bombing, after the USS Cole attack and did not accept Bin Laden when he was offered him and Kerry sings praises about what Clinton did for terrorism.<br />
<br />
Why do people believe everything that Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity spew out of their mouths?  The Sudan did NOT offer us OBL, the FBI and CIA investigated the man who came forward with the info and found that he was lying.  The Sudan has been one of the countries that has welcomed terrorists and al Quaeda throughout the years and harbored them, why the hell would they give bin Laden to us?<br />
<br />
PS, the man that came forward with the information, Mansoor Ijaz, now has a job as a foreign affairs analyst at FOX NEWS.<br />
<br />
And Clinton did plenty of stuff against terrorism.  How about thwarting plans to blow up 12 american jetliners simultaniously, plots to kill the Pope, and plans for attacks on the UN headquarters, FBI building, the Israeli embassy in washington, the LA and Boston airports, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, &amp; the George Washington Bridge.  How about stockpiling vaccines and drugs, and increasing the overall antiterrorism budget?  How about the fact that after the 1993 WTC attack (which many people have blamed on him even though he had only been in office for 36 days before the attack) he found, arrested, convicted and imprisoned the men responsible?  How about that after OBL attacked our embassies in Africa that he signed an Executive order authorizing the assassination of OBL (which O'Lielly and Hannity consistently claim that he did not do, but should have).  How about after the USS Cole was bombed, he had his head of antiterrorism draw up plans to eradicate al Quaeda.  That man was Richard Clark.  Condi asked him to stay on when Clinton left because his plan was so good.  how about the fact that Bush APPROVED AND USED Clark's plan after 9/11 happened.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at Bush's antiterrorism record:<br />
<br />
1) After taking a monthlong vacation and ignoring intelligence reports that an a highjacking of US planes to crash into buildings was in the making, and that the FBI had noted many suspicious men enrolling in flight schools over the country, he allowed the largest enemy attack on US soil to happen.<br />
<br />
2) Using Clinton's plan to get rid of al Quaeda and the military that Clinton had built (the claim that Clinton allowed the military to deteriorate was another lie.  Bush said that he had to rebuild the military before it could be used: Bush's military budget and plans did not go into effect until October 2002, a YEAR after we kicked the crap out of the Taliban.  Looks like Clinton's military did pretty well, eh?) he got rid of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, he let OBL and most of the Taliban government escape.<br />
<br />
3) Fed congress and the american people bullshit about saddam's supposed WMDs (in Feb of 2001, as was said before, they had said that Saddam had NO WMDs and was not capable of making them and that he was not attempting to get materials for them), he invaded the soverign country of Iraq, instead of concentrating on getting rid of al Quaeda and finding OBL.<br />
<br />
Hmm...quick comparison:<br />
<br />
Clinton: Prevented many terrorist attacks, stopped genocide in Kosovo<br />
Bush: Allowed 9/11 to happen, invaded 2 countries, allowed terrorists to escape.<br />
<br />
Its not that hard to see who did a better job, now is it?</div></div><hr />
