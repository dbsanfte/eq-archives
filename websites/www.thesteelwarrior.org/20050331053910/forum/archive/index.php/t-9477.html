My question for this Font-of-All-Knowledge is where is best for raising Dranik Loyalists?  I'm shooting for ~75% or better of the mobs giving me DL faction bumps.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Fairly sure there's almost no dragorns in them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought it odd that killing dragorns there gave Loyalist faction, but yet they do as i discovered this week, to my surprise.<br />
<br />
Can camp plenty of those along with the usual kyvs, ukuns, etc. Not to mention the usual ph's and nameds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arganax</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone confirm that a kill is the same +faction regardless of the lvl of the mob?  Just wondering if I would be better served killing in DS while lfg or just beating on a groups mobs in WoS or MPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ichkabibel2</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can't confirm it but a few hours of shakerpaging in DS gave me 2 faction upgrades, so even if they do give lesser amount per kill the fact they're extremely weak and shakerpagable makes up for it... plus you can get a 15hp aug random off trash &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I went to Bloodfields and slaughtered for 4 hours, I'm now apprehensive. The bottom line is all mobs in every zone give same faction per kill, you might as well kill greenies in DS if you want the fastest faction.<br />
<br />
I tried the earthshaker in DS but no matter how hard I try I can't round up more than about 30 mobs, how the heck can you get enough to instafrag them all Ichkabibel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ichkabibel2</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the western part by bloodfields has alot of mobs close together, pretty easy to round up a good number.  then i start with furious disc (with all the double riposte AAs) to get them started, then ramp.. usually its enough to kill them all.  if you get soe and roam around the first area you can also get a pretty huge amount, just takes a while and is reliant on how many ppl are in the zone hunting.</div></div><hr />
