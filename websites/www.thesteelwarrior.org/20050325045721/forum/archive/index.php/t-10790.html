<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to get my faction up for the Tier 1 OoW armor. It is currently Kindly. <br />
My question is, if I kill a green mob and then kill a DB mob and both give good Loyalists faction, will the DB give me more faction than the green or is it the same no matter what. Also, in a group, If a mob gives like 50 faction (Just for example), and the group kills it, is the 50 faction split between all group members evenly or do all 6 get 50 faction each? <br />
<br />
Trying to find the fastest way to get to Warmly and trying to understand how this works. <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fastest way, getting a group. <br />
<br />
Here is a list of zones, and mobs you can kill for faction.<br />

So if you have the items for few pieces slaughter greens, else I would go with DB and get some experience and lot less monotonous.  Group size doesn't matter either.  If a group is killing 50 at once and you bandage one of their members and they kill them all you will get 50 hits even if you aren't grouped with them.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a bunch for the info.. Looks like I will have my arms sooner than later .. One more thing, with the Kyv Heart turn in for faction, is it also 1 point of faction per heart or is it more? It's not like I get 10-15 hearts a session but i would like to know how many points of faction per heart (If Known)<br />
<br />
Thanks again..</div></div><hr />

I personally didn't test it so I have no real clue if that is accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.. 10 would rock!! Can anyone confirm/discount this please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't tell you what the actual faction number is, but I box a cleric and did so for all of my factioning, he got every faction hit I did but he did not do any faction turn ins.  I did several turn ins, to include seeping murkglider fluid, feran skulls and insignia.  When I hit warmly he was still indiff.  I haven't done any more turn ins for faction, but I've bumped to max ally since then and the cleric is still at amiable.  They may not be incredible faction, but doing the turn ins do help alot.  AEing in DS helps alot too... grab a cleric to heal you, go pull a metric buttload of nocs, ukuns, and kyvs, then kill them (DS and AE spells help alot here, as do buddies with PBAoE spells and effects)</div></div><hr />
