<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solrar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In another thread - http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8721 - someone mentioned:<br />
Also take into consideration the fact that OOW aa's seem to revolve around reducing offhand damage taken. It seems OOW will reduce 2handers effectiveness which is depressing to 2hander addicts.<br />
I'm feeling a bit dense...  Can someone spell out the meaning of this for me, please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only way this would make sense is in a PvP setting.  Also, the part about Omens of War reducing the effictiveness of 2handers is just silly.<br />
<br />
I don't know what that poster is thinking, but I just feel confused after reading his post.  Since someone just broke into elementals they should hold out for that awesome 1hander from the elementals and a basalt bulwark????????<br />
<br />
It's best to just sometimes skip peoples posts if you think they are full of nonsense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess you could say that putting in a lot of dual wield AAs is &quot;reducing 2hander's effectiveness&quot; using the same logic as people who say giving paladins defensive would be a nerf on warriors.  The fact that the last two warrior aggro weapons and allegedly the epic are all 1-handers and the OOW AAs are mostly for dual wield means that 2-handers will be a less optimal choice for warriors than they used to be, even though they are not any worse than they were before.  You could definitely say the BoW is not the no-brainer it used to be because of LDoN augs widening the gap between 2-hander and dual wield aggro and better-ratio 1-handers with higher delays narrowing the DPS gap and making ripostes less of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The AA's in OOW look to be increasing effectiveness of DW combinations.  I see no decreasing of anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What i would like? AA for each fighting style (2h, DW, Shield) to make them all the same results, no 2H kings or such...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>haddion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I made that post in the sense that OOW seems to be more centered around to duel wielding.  They listened to people's complaints about offhand damage taken from higher teir pop and beyond.  This is there attempt to fix it but what I don't see is anything much in the way of a 2hander.  This is all just my opinion and it may be nonsense to you.<br />
<br />
Two handed weapons have terrible stats in my opinion compared to duel wielding 2 weapons.  The one advantage of 2handers seems to be that a lot have high ac.  You still lose out on a lot of agro, simply to the fact you have more procs and the db is applied a lot more in duel wield.  In the end, at the top of the game all the weapons are also 1handed.  There is no 2hander equivilant to the Brutish Blade of Balance or DBotW.<br />
<br />
So in my opinion, 2handers are a worse path to follow gear and aa wise in the long run.  If the OOW aa's turn out to be really nice in reducing off hand damage taken, then there will be even less of a point in using a 2hander over duel wield.<br />
When you make dw so much better compared to using a 2hander, that is &quot;reducing the effectiveness&quot; to me.<br />
<br />
This is all speculative cause no one has any idea if those AA's in OOW will change or how useful they will be.  I am always open to other peoples opinions, and I still have a lot to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2H weapons outdamages equivalent DW counterparts in virtually all parts of the game, and you only need 1 weapon instead of 2.  That alone is enough incentive to use 2H weapons.<br />
<br />
Anyway Greater Sinister Strikes is there to balance the fact that 2H weapons get higher damage bonus than 1H weapons.  At level 70, a delay 28 2H has a damage bonus of 41, up from 35 at level 65.  Compare this 1H DB goes from 13 to 15.  If you assume the average 1H has a delay of 20, then 2H weapons do (6/2.8) ~= 2 more DPS from 65 to 70 versus (2/2) 1 more DPS for dual wield weapons.  <br />
<br />
Slippery attacks and shielding resistance are nice but hardly break the balance between 2H versus DW, no more than Punishing Blade or even Flurry (Flurry is better on 2H than 1H because you can't flurry on offhand) breaks the balance between 2H versus DW</div></div><hr />

This certainly wasn't true for plane of time.  I don't know if anybody's parsed the BBoB/Tacvi Offhand vs the Great Maul of the Mighty or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's because there was no phase 5 warrior usable 2hander.  BBoB isn't the same level as Great Maul of the Mighty either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Regardless, it's the best available to warriors at the time.  There may be a super warrior-useable 2-hander in Tacvi somewhere, but my money is against it.  The BBoB is already enough dps to make a lot of rogues cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only the Rogues that don't have a DDoN yet.  The ratio might still be lousy compared to many other classes' options but Tacvi Rogues are putting out some impressive numbers with the end-GoD weapontry.  Naturally the lesser-equipped Rogues are way, way, way off these figures though.<br />
<br />
On the original topic though, I do hope 2-handers get some love for Warriors.  Somehow I prefer a tank with a big damn slow(er) but punishing weapon, and it isn't just for Furious.  Of course aggro issues would need to be resolved through a proc-mod or something though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solrar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I appreciate all the answers and especially from Haddion trying to explain his overall intent.  This, in particular, is the most confusing thing for me though:<br />

The aa's will reduce offhand damage?  From the mob?  I don't see what that has to do with determining the type of weapon I wield...  Reduce the damage taken by the mob from *my* offhand?  How is that advantageous to dual wielding then?  Do you mean that the nice AC bonuses that usually come with a 2-hander will be &quot;less effective&quot; if a mob's offhand damage is reduced?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, that's what I mean.  Melee dps is going through the roof with Tacvi weapons.  Tacvi warriors are gonna do close to the dps of a time-geared rogue, and the Tacvi rogs will just be disgusting.</div></div><hr />

The aas will cut down on ripostes and damage shield damage taken when you swing with your offhand, which reduces one of the downsides of using dual wield.</div></div><hr />
