<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">03-29-2005, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing this little walk-thru to help those pre-60 get some great guantlets without spending lots of gold in the AH.  You will be going after Cragfists of the (http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=9410)  [insert your desired mod here].  They have about a 50% chance of dropping off Ancient Stone Keeper (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=7206) in Uldaman.  He drops a mail shoulder item the other half of the time.  The hints will be written from a warrior's perspective.  My recommended level to start going after these are 45-49 with 3+ in your party, or 50+ with a friend.<br />
<br />
Uldaman is in Badlands, which is South of Thelsamar.  Easiest way to travel there for Alliance sided chars is to take a griff to Thelsamar and run/ride due SouthEast of the griff master.  For our purposes we will be using the backdoor entrance which is located a short ways east of the center of the zone, in a small cave.  There are a few 40-42 Elite troggs outside the cave, but they are easily dispatched.  Continue into the cave until you reach the instance zone in.<br />
<br />
If you will be reseting the instance to take multiple shots at the gloves, you will need the person who started the party to run into the instance first.  If you don't get your guantlets on the first run, you will need to reset.  Run back outside to the trogg cave and disband your group.  Have a different person, other than the last party leader, re-invite and run into the instance first.  This should respawn all the monsters and our target.<br />
<br />
As you step into the instance you will see a large set of doors up some steps.  Opening the doors will reveal your first challenge, the Obsidian Sentinal.  You will want to charge this guy and then back-pedal until he follows you into the starting corridor where you entered.  Debuff him with Demo. Shout first and begin to sunder him down.  At about 20% health intervals, he will shrink and spawn a shardling.  Best way I found to handle these is Demo. Shout when the shardling appears to get some kind of aggro on it and to reapply Demo. Shout to OS.  Switch targets to the shardling and quickly dispatch it.  Those have low hitpoints and fall easily.  Another option is to just ignore the shardlings except tossing a Demo. Shout and/or Tclap when they appear and killing OS first, then dealing with the little ones.  This is fine too, but just causes some confusion.<br />
<br />
Past the sentinal are a few dwarves.  If you are 50+, you can charge the two dwarves on the right ledge.  After killing them, you may choose to hop off the small overhang by the corner to avoid dealing with the other 3 dwarves.  If you are below 50, you will ignore the two on the ledge and charge the group of 3 dwarves.  They are linked, so don't bother playing it safe with a ranged pull.  The dwarves will cast one or two heals each then run in fear.  Make sure to hamstring them and apply Mortal Strike if possible.<br />
<br />
Heading farther into the instance, the tunnel on the way to Ancient Stone Keeper [ A.S.K ] has a few semi-static spawns of either basilisks or bats, usually 6-8.  Nothing special about these, just mop-up and press on.<br />
<br />
You will come to a fork in the cave with a small alcove on the left, this is where the fun begins.  On your left, up the ramp, are 6-7 non-elite dwarves.  They are linked like the 3 earlier in the instance.  Charge a close one and back-pedal to the fork in the cave.  Dispatch of the warrior class dwarves first, they are gray in color.  The mage class, white in color, cast weak spells and are of little threat.  Be sure to Demo. Shout the pack once you stop pulling and toss a Tclap in get a little more aggro on each.  Just have your party assist you and kill one by one quickly.  Healers will pull aggro on their first or second heal, fortunately the dwarves don't hit hard, so don't panic.  If you are really unlucky the roaming Stone Sentinal might come with this pack.  He wanders over by them occasionally.  If he does come with them, lock aggro down on him first so he's not hitting your healers and then go about killing the dwarves, saving him for last.  Most likely tho, if your group is below 45, this will cause a lengthy corpse run, but at least there is a long respawn timer on the stuff you already killed.<br />
<br />
Once those are taken care of, move to the top of the ramp and watch for the roaming sentinal.  Wait until he starts walking to your position.  Charge him well away from the dwarves in the room.  Fully sunder this 44 Elite.  Nothing special about these except mass hitpoints and AC.<br />
<br />
There will be one more pack of dwarves in the room.  Very similar to what you already killed.  Wait for the other roaming sentinal to leave the room and pull the dwarves.  Now, the majority of the room is clear and we're ready to pull A.S.K.<br />
<br />
Walk down into the middle of the room and pull him straight over the little bench in front with a ranged weapon.  Pull him back to the top of the ramp so that no other pathing monsters will join the fight.  The fight is not that complicated.  You will be snared and silenced, if you are in melee range, 90% of the time.  After you have pulled him and are running to the top of the ramp, use Bloodrage to get some rage for Demo. Shout and Battle Shout.  Use Battle Shout when you get back to your group and hit Demo. Shout right before A.S.K gets his first hits in.  I say this because 99 times out of 100 you won't be able to shout for the duration of the fight.  He will cast some small whirlwinds which do the snare and silence, along with about 20dmg a tick each.  They are unattackable and not really a threat, just annoyance.  Fully sunder him down.  He is just a beefed up version of the sentinal you fought prior.  Lots and lots of hitpoints for his level, similar AC to the sentinals.  His normal hits are the 150-160 range and come relatively slow.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you'll get lucky and he'll drop you the Cragfists.  If not, run back to the beginning and try again.  The average time for the runs will be 15-20min for the 45-49 party and 10-15min for the 50+ duo.  My fastest run was just over 5min with a 60 Paladin and Hunter guildmates helping.<br />
<br />
Is he soloable?  Most likely not until you are 55+.  On my best attempt at him solo, when i was 53, I got him down to 25% or so.  I used sword + board + defensive until I got him fully sundered down.  I popped Shield Wall right after Demo. Shout and landing my first sunder.  Once he was fully sundered, I switched to 2H + Battle Stance to beat him down.  I had to use a major healing potion when he was at about 40%.  After that, it went down hill.  I hit a 3 swing miss streak.  He got a couple 300+ crits in and I was ghost.  I tried soloing him 8 times with no success.  Would love to hear of a pre60 soloing him tho.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps guys.  Have patience.  It took over a dozen runs for me to get a pair with a good stamina mod on them.  I attached a map with some positions on it.  Best of Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otherwise your healer gets silenced, and even worse, takes damage from the whirlwind that wastes mana.</div></div><hr />

I went in there on the weekend 3 boxing with 46 war, 46 priest and 42 mage.<br />
I was really just there to go talk to the enchanting trainer nearby ASK and decided to poke my nose around the corner to see what was there.<br />
I managed to get ASK down after 2 or more tries.  The respawn is really long.<br />
Good to know he drops worthy loot.<br />
I'll have another go!  Thanks for the post.<br />
I got some crap off him that my priest disenchanted.<br />
I fought ASK with the mage and priest up the hill at max spell range and war and ASK at the bottom.</div></div><hr />
