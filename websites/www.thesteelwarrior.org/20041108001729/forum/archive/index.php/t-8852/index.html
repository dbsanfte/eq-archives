<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever since Ive been stationed in Okianawa Ive been grouping with a much different crowd.. And to be honest the late night crowd is completely retarded...Ive only recently really started doing LDONS.  Well, in the past two weeks Ive died 11 times in them..And my tank is well equiped and I like to think I do my job well.  The puller brings em to me, and I commence to grab aggro and beat the crap out of them..<br />
     This has been the typical situation..<br />
<br />
(sk) Hey folks, I got one, bringing it in.<br />
(me) ok..just remeber to FD far enough away so we dont get hosed.<br />
(sk) sure, whatever.<br />
     Not about this time, the 1, the sk pulled is in all actuallity 3 or more.. Not only has he pulled to many, but he usually FD's about ten feet from the group at which time the Mage sends in the pet.. Then panics and calls the pet back..  Ofcourse the mobs then go beserk and aggro on the rest of us and its go time.. I usually cant get out in time, the cleric if we are lucky enough to have one buys the farm as well and its a whipe.<br />
     So, Ive switched to playing my lower level SK, whom Ive groomed after my tank except that he has FD, which saves atleast him from the total whipe.  I really cant wait to get back to the states where I can be a bit more choosey on which groups I want to LDON with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While being a late night player does restrict your choices, dumb players are not restricted to late night play.  I can only play late, but I've managed to gather enough friends now that I can usually field a large enough portion of a group to be confident in it's success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When Im in LDoNs, I usually pull, unless there's a monk or a bard, or if Im with my Shammy friend, he can single pull the entire dungeon with the pet trick, Necros can do the same, pull with a pet that cons green to the mobs, and you can single a room with 7 mobs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use the people you know whenever possible.<br />
<br />
The guildies i regularly do LDoNs with are used to my 4-6 mob pulls and we do pretty well.<br />
<br />
A ranger dying on a pull like that is better for the group than what your sk did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My normal LDoN group, (I only do about 4-5 a week) consist of 65 Warrior 65 Shaman 65 Ranger 65 Cleric/Druid 65 Mage 65 Wizzy/Chanter. The Shaman pulls, normally 3-5 mobs per pull, and does the CC as well when the Chanter isn't there. As long as you know your group and know what everyone is going to do, you should have no problems. We roll through an adventure in about 35-45 mins, usually right before raid times while we are all bored. But of course I only group with guildies and people I trust. Has been a long time since I did a regular pick-up group in LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aamen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At lvl 52 if you can't handle 3 mobs in camp then your group has serious problems.<br />
<br />
Based on your example, most of your group should be able to solo any 1 mob, including you, the magician (!), the sk, and the cleric.<br />
<br />
If you're in that situation again, I would get the proper buffs and take over pulling.  That way, you can better maintain aggro on all inc mobs.  If your group does not respond to instruction then I would leave and put them on ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warhead42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Living in Korea, I can completely and totally sympathize.  I was trying to get into an LDoN earlier this weekend and got an invite for a group from someone I'd never grouped with before.  It was a slow day, so I accepted it.<br />
<br />
Group Makeup was myself, SK (whom I'd grouped with before and didn't like), beast, necro, druid and wizard.  Already I'm a bit leery about the whole thing, as we had no real healer and only ghetto mezz (screaming terror) for CC.<br />
<br />
When the wizard doesn't nuke, the necro doesn't CC (or even off tank adds with the pet, beastlord guilty as well) and the druid doesn't snare in Takish-Hiz, I tend to get a little irate.  I think the SK was the only other person in the group who was actually doing his job correctly.<br />
<br />
They had the nerve to call me the ass, too.  If people want to think of me as an &quot;elitist&quot; because I expect people to know a little bit about their class, then yeah, I guess I am one.<br />
<br />
My best suggestion is to befriend anyone who's competent and plays around your time, and group with them whenever you get the opportunity.  Even then, it's hard.  I spend most of my weeknights plat farming.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oriflame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same shit happens with me in Turkey.  After the grp wipes the 3rd time, I leave grp and proceed to elementals.  There are many folks i wont grp with from sheer stupidity.<br />

Yes, I am a wizard.  Give me a target.</div></div><hr />
