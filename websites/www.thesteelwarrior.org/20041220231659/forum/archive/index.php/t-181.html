<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone got any anecdotal (since it's pretty hard to parse) on whether this actually effects procs (specifically EB) or not? Effect is *supposed* to increase the agro on bash and spells, but no other focuses effect procs at all (proc avatar with a buff duration enhancer for example - no effect). Focus items also usually 'glow' when they effect an action, but my Aegis of the Earth is distinctly non-glowing. Has anyone seen any evidence either way on whether the focus actually works?<br />
<br />
I kept fine agro on Xeg last night after swapping it in, but I'm interested to know whether that was solely due to the unmodified mainhand. Doubt it'll effect the specific instances I use the shield in, but I'm still interested whether it atually 'works'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its speculated that Furious Bash effects are broken. One of our warriors use Aegis of Earth and struggles to keep aggro with a Bloodfrenzy + Aegis. My guess is the bash part may work, but is too small to make a difference and the spell hate (Enraging Blow) is ineffective. Its pretty much impossible to test if its working correctly or not. Who knows.<br />
<br />
With established aggro, it would probably be pretty nice for the stats and beefy AC. He should get the next round of tanking Fennin Ro to give it a go, but FR is damn easy to hold aggro on.<br />
<br />
*edit* And Boub, its not DD increase effect on the shield. Lucy lists as Spell / Bash HATE modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it but it seems to work better at keeping aggro than gaining it - so the boost in aggro isn't greater than what you would get from spells so if your not on top of the aggro list then it doesn't seem to be as useful as a nice EB proc - but once you get a successful taunt and assuming the cleric CH, the shaman or enchanter debuff, or the wiz nuke doesnt land immediately after the successful taunt - it seems a few good bashes are better than the hate generated from a second non-procing weapon - actually, I recently upgraded so now I have a BF/SOD combo and a FB 4 sheild seems to build aggro AFTER I'M TOP ON THE AGGRO LIST better than those two.<br />
<br />
Regaining aggro - procs work better - taunt is still the best although I only have about a 50% success rate on Experience mobs.</div></div><hr />
