<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using an unusual loot splitting method lately that no one has had any complaints about. We either do the 'stair camp&quot; in RSS fire side (4 PH) or the &quot;ice camp&quot; in RSS ice side (5 ph). I prefer the ice side but a bard puller/spilter is necessary whereas on fire side my warrior can pull its so easy.<br />
<br />
At the start each person choses a catagory from one of 4.<br />
<br />
Level 69 Runes<br />
Level 70 Runes<br />
Items<br />
Experience<br />
<br />
So if you are in the Exp group you get no loot (unless eveyone passes) BUT you are getting 6percent AA per kill and 12 toons kills mobs in 24ish seconds. So you can get 12 percent AA a minute (on SZ yours will be 20percent less).<br />
<br />
Some people are maxed out on AA (Like my cleric has 400plus AA and everything I could get for him is total trash at this point so I no longer keep him in the exp group) but want runes (everyone wants level 70 runes lol). <br />
<br />
Although no one has ever pass on a rune, items are passed on often (if its not your class its waste to roll, or like me I have most everything that drops), and when those who choose items pass then it opens up for a roll by anyone.<br />
<br />
So like 6 people chose that super exp of 12percent AA per mintue during up time (downtime is low cause with 12 toons killing a mob you need less dps per toon) and then 2 on rune70, 2 on rune69 and 2 on items you have a 50/50 shot of getting a rune70 if it drops and that was your choice. Compare to all 12 rolling for the rune under other systems.<br />
<br />
People are very happy with the fact that they can focus in on what they really need.<br />
<br />
For example Cill our Mage came 3 days in a row choosing level 70 runes and got absolutly nothing, no exp and not a single item. Then on the 4th day we saw our first level 70 rune, and she was the only person who choose rune70 and its all &quot;grats Cill&quot; with no roll and no one complaining that she got the only level 70 to drop all week.<br />
<br />
All and all a very fair and resonable loot system when you have more then 6 in your group. <br />
<br />
Also another edge is that doing the ice side (2 romers that can pop in camp) with 12 toons is way easyer then doing it with 6 toons, so doing things with 12 toons does open up your possible targets more, AND you never have to turn LFG people away, people send me a tell and I reply &quot;sure come on more the better, and if you have friends 69 or higher tell them to come also!&quot;<br />
<br />
Next time you are looking for group and they say &quot;we already have 6&quot; you say &quot;Hey check out the The DeathWalker 7-18 toon loot distribution system!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah because when I think of pick up groups, I think of sitting on my ass giving them l33t exp while I occasionally get a shot at loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Informal pick-up mini-raid sorta deal. I think its a nice way to think outside the &quot;6 person grind&quot; box that we've all grown accustomed to.  Great way to include friends when ya have more than 6 of you on.<br />
<br />
This model could also be useful for content that your 6 person group could not tackle alone.  A solid way for people to see content that might technically be above their gear level, thereby earning potentially huge upgrades. Your example of RS is great, and it could be applied to any Omens zone. <br />
<br />
Getting people having fun rather than /lfg = good<br />
Getting upgrades you couldn't in 6 person group = good<br />
Seeing newer and tougher zones = good<br />
Getting out of the &quot;box&quot; that EQ can feel like at times = great<br />
<br />
<br />
just make sure everyone knows exactly how it works prior to start and you're golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did something similar to get my Ground Murkglider eyes.<br />
<br />
I OOCed if they were rotting to let me know (Yeah right)<br />
The group at Blind were all good friends but their warrior was really sub par for the task and they knew me from the PoP open raids I used to tank.<br />
<br />
Warrior already had his aug and just wanted to grind his defensive AA.<br />
The last thing I need is experiance at this stage of the game so I tanked outside of group.<br />
<br />
It was kinda cool cause I didnt have HoTT so I had to pay attention a bit more than normal. War got his XP, i got my Ground Murkglider eyes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also keep note that the puller is instructed to pull only mobs necessary to get to the named or named/ph. No pulling mobs just purely for exp that dont help clear to a named. So allthough the exp group is raking it in, the items/runes people are also well served by the fact that all 12 poeple are trying to pop as many named as is possible.<br />
<br />
If you think that the exp people have the edge then take exp heh... lots of people will be more then hahppy to have first shot at runes or items froma 4 or 5 PH camp with 20 mintues pop on mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really need 12-18 people in RSS your not there to EXP anyway. <br />
<br />
Granted, if you need 12-18 people to kill named there the loot must be great for your gear level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to be frank you could simply have two seperate exp groups clearning only nameds and collectively distributing the loot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could but then you might pull two mobs and one group wipes and the other suddenly finds two on them... or you might argue about KS if both groups want exp....<br />
<br />
The more people you have the less likely you are to die, there is just no quesiton about it. Ya I could 6 box solo fire side but then I run out of cleric mana or wizard mana or warrior endurence and have a lot of down time, and sometimes the rng is going to let the mob do max damage 6 times in a row and no single healing is going to do anything about it. <br />
<br />
And doing ice side with wanders and possible 2 mob pulls and the like with only 6 toons, even all non boxed is going to result in some deaths and long cr justs eats up a ton of time. Or as you say you are using 6 toons that are so well geared that nothing that drops will be of interest. Its not that you absolutly need more people but more people is just more efficitent and a better use of everyones time.<br />
<br />
The number one complaint on most every class board is &quot;I can't get a group&quot; with this system its &quot;Sure you can join and bring all your friends! - the more the better!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zannuk</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could form a raid and get watered-down exp for all... 3% AA is still decent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You wont get 3percent AA with a 12 person raid on a same mob that give 6 poeple 6per AA cuase there is no grouping bouns...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 6 box ice and fire, why bring anyone along when ya can keep all the loot, and all the exp?<br />
<br />
Seriously, I don't see the use for this method. If your single group can't hack it there, you don't belong there.<br />
<br />
You may think you do, but if 6 rounds of attack makes it so no single heal can save you, then you deserve to die.<br />
<br />
The worst scenario for a single mob is when one of those roamer is an enchanter and hasted it. Which if you are a good enough tank you can simply use quick heals until its slowed and then resume using Cheal.<br />
<br />
I do Riftseekers with a single healer, and zero downtime, because my toons have the gear to do non-stop pulls. I have the gear to tank it.<br />
<br />
I rarely get any items I need, beside the augs, which I completed every set there were for me there. I'm getting nice items for my twinks bot, and for some of my friends. Nice runes, and awesome AA exp.<br />
<br />
I must admit that if an opposing force on your pvp server wants to mess with you, its got to suck zoning in with 6, and finding yourself faced with 12-18.<br />
<br />
Unless its a single bard who brings the entire place to visit your camp and then FM to laugh at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think its a pretty neat system. you get what you want, if you dont like it, dont do it. If you cant do it with 6, but with 18, that doesn't really mean you dont belong there, it just means you need 18 people to stay there. <br />
<br />
Oh and really, if the loot is for twinks, and you never have any downtime or risk of dying, i'd say if anyone doesn't belong its you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neat system, but i'm curious how you run out of endurance?   Do you use stonewall a lot or incite multple times a fight?<br />
<br />
I'd just 6-box it if i were you, though i know it can be frustrating.  After all, wizards are abuot the least friendly dps additions to a group in RSS.  A decently equipped melee will hang with them in average dps and never need meditation downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tooby,<br />
<br />
First of all, Riftseeker is a place where no matter how much you want to think you will not die, you will die.<br />
<br />
However, After having spent so much time there, I've learned how to cope, it is a very brutal place, with extreme risk, I still from time to time have to hit the exodus hotkey, or do limited CR. I've been lucky to learn enough about the place to avoid full CR for a long while, doesn't mean it can't happen anymore.<br />
<br />
As for the loot, since I'm 6 boxing, and deciding who gets the gear, I finished my aug set way faster then anyone could dream of in a pick up group set up.<br />
<br />
I've tried the pick up group set up, and as you know, every fook'ing caster and their friends want those damn hp augs, they don't care for the mana one, but if an hp aug drops, you can bet everyone in group is rolling on it.<br />
<br />
So, by 6 boxing, I finished my whole set of augments, my enchanters full hp aug set, my cleric I gave the mana augs, the wiz the mana augs, and the runes were spread so that enchanter finished his 69 mez ASAP. Cleric got 3 69, 2 70, enchanter got 1 70. Wiz got 1 69, sk got 1 69.<br />
<br />
I've often made room for guildy and got them wonderful hp augs, since I'm mostly done with them. I don't mind bringing guildy, as they are part of my familly.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure you know just how frustrating it is to be at a camp for 7-8hrs, and lose every roll because every hrs the last winner is bailling, and with a new person the rolls are once again starting fresh. So its easy to lose tons and tons of rolls no matter how hard you try and farm those augs.<br />
<br />
The set up Sam has is quite good.<br />
<br />
I've just noticed tho, that &quot;mains&quot; will go berserk if a twink wins loot over them, so my solution is to simply do it alone, no one to chat with, and the CR is mine alone to do, however, there is absolutely no bitching when loot drops.</div></div><hr />
