<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">None, as far as I know. An illusion might help, if you're agnostic. Otherwise, it's handing in a ton of sarnak berserker braids. Of course, even if you're an evil race you have to turn in quite a few of the braids. That one quest is, as far as I remember, the only way to gain faction there.</div></div><hr />

You would need to buy yourself a pair of Puppet Strings  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3656) to charm the dude and do the turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Munku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What about Ornate Velium Pendant? With Alliance? Could that + dark elf illusion or something work?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, puppet strings.<br />
<br />
As far as illusions go, gnome just as good as dark elf, ogre, troll, or anything else you might consider &quot;evil.&quot;  Diety is more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you do decide to go with the puppet strings make sure to have someone mr debuff the crap out of the captain since his mr is way high. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">pretty sure they nerfed charming the foreman a few patches back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can also go and kill kunark dragons and VP mobs for faction. Thats prolly not an option at lvl 48 thou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember back when i was farming Guk faction for my wood elf crown, a druid cast Feral Pack on me when i was mid amiable faction and i jumped all the way up to warmly. Provided it hasnt been changed (i havent had it cast on me in a while) you can get a druid to wolf ya and it might be enough to raise fac high enough to do the hand ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'd be careful with wolf form in kunark... i remember a ranger or druid getting beat up by the locals of firiona vie for turning wolf next to the bank.<br />
<br />
oldworld had wolf-form faction boost though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">pretty sure they nerfed charming the foreman a few patches back...<br />
<br />
There was a rumor going around to that effect, but it's bogus. You can still charm him, same as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hola-<br />
<br />
The person doing the &quot;quest&quot; turn in (giving the npc the jade) MUST be the person that charms him, since amiable faction is needed.  You *might* be able to have someone else charm then use the thurga faction mod neck to get to amiable, but I wouldn't bet on it.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the very BEST way to get non-kos (max ally in fact) in OT is... to get your VP key.  MASSIVE faction boost/hits from killing in the &quot;new&quot; VP, can go from max kos to max ally in OT in a single night's zone xp farming session.  Probably not an option at level 40 tho,  but I don't think the hammer procs till level 50 anyway...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dry Sapara definitely won't talk to you until past level 48... from what others said it sounds like level 55 required for VP entry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Won't work.  He has to be your pet. Can't be amiable to your friend's pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fastest way to up your VS faction is killing dragons - the ones in Veeshan's Peak and especially Faydedar.  I say 'especially' because even the spawnable Faydedar for Druid epic gives a hefty faction hit.  For the ambitious, get your own Froglok essence from Ulump and spawn Fayd yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i did the turn in with puppet strings a month or 2 ago. my OT faction is as bad as it could possibally be. i had a chanter and shammy friend bomb his MR before i used my strings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, K- I've never a tried faction mod spell on another player's pet while dueling them... didn't think it'd work, but wasn't sure.  Neck clicky to precious to waste on testing, tho I suppose I could have tried it with my twinkie bard.  Did know they'd fixed the charming-someone-elses-pet thing a long time ago, but wasn't sure about other spells.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">haha... well I tried charming the foreman with my 52 necro for an hour straight yesterday, even with tash orb I couldn't land it. considering the foreman is 50 or so i'm not surprised since I couldn't land tepid deeds on him with my old 65 warrior. at least necros get a -1000 resist charm later!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The foreman has a lot of MR.  Some friends charmed him with puppet strings a week or two ago and even at 65 with tash it took 3 charges.  Bring all the debuffers you can get to come along if you're gonna use puppet strings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd just turn in braids.  Decent xp at your level, and kinda fun.  Was especially fun for my Gnome on a PvP server.  Actually even in your 60's turning in the braids gives a little AA xp.  The added bonus of this method is you will be loved when you hammer into the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When I did this I was bored and wasn't even sure it'd work, it was awhile ago.<br />
<br />
Without MR debuffs, it took 8/10 charges to land the charm. You definately want the debuffs.<br />
<br />
A little warning about this hammer, they recently changed the landing point. Now, if you fall into the hole in the boat you can't get back out. Barbarians, anyhow. It's impossible to run through the sides of the hull like  you used to be able to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I got this hammer in my 40s, then at 63 or so I decided to do the chardok quests for a spirit wracked cord (See magelo for stats).  Anyway, it ruined my VS faction fighting in Howling Stones for the spirit wracked urn.  The point of this is that faction in OT doesn't really matter, you can ruin it after you get the hammer and you won't get attacked when you port in.  The skeleton on the boat is indifferent and you can jump off the boat and swim around the wall of the oupost to the PoK book.<br />
<br />
This hammer has saved me many a time =)  click off haste, weild the hammer, get a few mobs, hit furious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Did this quest like 2 days ago. I sware i droped 10k this past month for gate potions, friend told me he got some puppet strings and he owed me some cash that i let him barrow for a Earthshaker.. told em it would be payed if he would let me use the puppet strings , so we headed to OT.. got guild leader (enchanter) give me Charisma max that can i get.. and Debuff the Foreman.. friend got agro.. i clicked puppet strings (got it first try) and handed  the jade  in.. and got my OT hammer, was pretty easy. now i can use it in Sol Ro tower :)<br />
<br />
PS: I had shitty Faction with the outpost.. im a Troll and i had good faction.. but sadly too many damn Rangers and Druids ask me for help on VS and VSR.. so i got KOS pretty fast.</div></div><hr />
