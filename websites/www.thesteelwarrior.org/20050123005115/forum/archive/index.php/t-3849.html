<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ichorflow was a wierd weapon..... but it is on the high aggro weapon list but as more people report on it i'm thinking it should come off.<br />
<br />
a lot of bards and rangers really like it due to it's 'low' aggro proc. <br />
<br />
i'd go with the CHoS or SotB..prob CHoS first than Sot a close second.<br />
<br />
if anyone has an ichorflow can ya post some results of it please ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, a little bit of history here... BACK IN THE DAY... yeah back in the day... there weren't any Copper Hammers of Striking, Swords of the Bloodsworn, Cord Hilted Spiked Driver, or Great Blades of Storm that could be attained with any bit of ease whatsoever. And by ease I mean 1-3 groups. <br />
<br />
The supposed weapon that defined warriors in Velious was Jaelen's Katana, a 14/19 1HS with an 80 hp lifetap. Of course there was the Sceptre of Destruction, but that required ST key access and for the sleeper to be sleeping. There were VERY few agro weapons period (you also couldn't offhand the red epic sword at the time). <br />
<br />
Move on and your list looks something like the epic, Blade of Carnage v2.0 (it wasn't always 15/20 with an enraging blow proc), and the VERY hard to get, rare, and new weapons from Luclin, inside Ssra - Blasphemous Blade (which didn't always have a proc), Hategiver, and Bloodfrenzy. When the list we were talking about was made, it was made with everybody in mind. If you couldn't get any of the weapons I just mentioned you'd of course have to settle for something else. Ichorflow was a weapon you might have to settle for. <br />
<br />
Ichorflow at least had SOMETHING going for it besides pure DPS. Every little bit helps. It's not on par by today's standards for agro generation, but when it was added to the list, it was much better than what anybody could buy or readily find available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in Luclin I duoed in akheva with a warrior using ichorflow and me using my willsapper.  Aggro jumped back and forth between us all the time, based on who had procced last.  I would have called the Ichorflow very close to the same as the willsapper.  I think CHoS and SotB would probably be better than either of those weapons.  Both the willsapper and ichorflow are probably &quot;low aggro&quot; by today's standards, but they were the best us po ol waryas without SoDs could get :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe the old BBoTE sucked so much. I remember the day it was upgraded, the wars in our guild who had looted the 13/18 piece of crap were soooo happy :)<br />
<br />
Ichorflow used to be an ok weapon, now its severely outclassed - stil looks cool tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've continued to decline ichorflow on raids due to it in my eyes bieng lower in aggro then my current weapons, but realised I had no actual facts for it other then speculation so thought I'd post here.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i remember right it used to be better aggro, but they downgraded the aggro on some disease dots or something, and as this had a disease dot it got aswell downgraded. As Brutul says it used to be around same aggro as Willsapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does add disease counters.  I can't remember whether it was before or after the disease thing that we were grouping.  Was sometime in Lulcin.<br />
<br />
Either way, there's better aggro weapons that are easier to get these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was before the disease change, I remember the posts... infact you said it was near willsapper aggro =p...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, whats with the poopoo'ing the aggro of the Willsapper?  Everything we compare here is all based on the aggro generated by a Shammy/Enc casting SLOW!  Slow is HUGE aggro and the Willsapper procs like nuts, I see 3-5 procs per fight on average.  No I haven't parsed it, Im lazy, but I can't recall ever having it not proc on a fight.<br />
<br />
As for Ichorflow, can't comment, haven't used one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have ichorflow in my bank. It has been banked for ages, however when I wielded it I had no aggro problem. I can safely say it WAS good for aggro or enough I guess. Dunno now tho after they changed disease counter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antaran</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Willsapper owns still, I MT with Willsapper as only aggro weapon and have done so for a long time and it works fine.<br />
<br />
When exping I sometimes have a hard time holding aggro if there are no dex buffs available, if i have a dex buff then I'm fine.<br />
<br />
And the proc is so friggin handy that its not even funny, I often land a 35% slow on raid force mobs before they are slowed by a shammy/chanter/BL whatever.  Last time was when I tanked Aary and willsapper slow was the only slow that would land (had no shammy)<br />
<br />
Same thing with exp groups, I most often land slow before a spellcaster does and that has saved me from sudden death a number of times and generally helps out in a big way.<br />
<br />
I love my willsapper to death and its awesome aggro, only downside is that it has low HP's and is piercing but thats nothing compared to the benefits imo.<br />
<br />
Do not belittle this weapon, its awesome aggro.<br />
<br />
/Derail off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Willsapper!!!!!  *licks the blade*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my friends druid has a willsapper  /eye   :D<br />
<br />
( i laugh every time i see it )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was never really impressed much by the Willsapper :(. It definately does not have the same agro carried by a 65 shaman or enchanter's highest slow. It probably procs about as much as any other weapon though which means it doesn't proc when you need it :p. I do keep it for utility these days though. I use it every now and then in a tight spot.</div></div><hr />
