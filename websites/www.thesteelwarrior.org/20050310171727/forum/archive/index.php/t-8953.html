There are newbie threads from time to time if you look for em in the arena though.  As far as the abbreviations go, there is a post to help you out with them here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4604).<br />
<br />
Try to ask specific questions and there will undoubtedly be people who can help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used casters realm (eq.crgaming.com) to learn the skills and stuff about warriors when I was starting out.  The info there is a lil outdated but still applies for the lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There arent any (my guess) real newbies around here.<br />
Some are coverted people, others are new warriors.<br />
<br />
The problem is the biggest part of the community is 2 to 5 year old.<br />
Thats people that started and were at your level ages ago.<br />
When EQ was a totally different game so all the things they<br />
experienced &amp; learned back then, arent valid anymore.<br />
<br />
But feel free to ask , i'm sure you'll get whatever help people can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Real Noobies rarely find the board. And yeah the game has change an amazing amout in the last 5.5 years since I was a low level warrior. I do have a number of lower level charactes, but having one 65+ changes the whole low end game too--I mean I can casually twink and don't spend nearly the time learning the lowbie game that those who have to go though it the first time do. <br />
<br />
On top of that, just Tuesday, they change teh lowbie game yet again with the mission system so almost none of us have any sort of idea wht that is like.<br />
<br />
I guess the two peices of advice I can pass along is 1) get a magelo for when you want to look at your char and gear off line and 2) good rule of thumb is keeping AC &gt; 20* level is a good thing. Three good links--other than these forms here-- are http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and http://lucy.allakhazam.com/ and http://eq.castersrealm.com<br />
<br />
The first Allas is good for quest and mob info the second a great tool for looking up stuff if you already know the name. (And a great way to find out the DoT a mob just hit you with should be cured because otherwise it lasts 55 minutes.) Alla's should only be visited with a popup blocker installed. <br />
<br />
Castersrealm has some nice basic info that I go back to all the time even though I know where all the class sites are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll always get some sort of answer, either from other newcomers or from the greybeards. I'll probably wade in. I've played EQ for less than two years and still recall sharply the joys and pains of the first 30 levels. <br />
<br />
Welcome to The Steel Warrior, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalem</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there campdog, I'm playing a new warrior as well.  I've been hanging around EQ off and on since it was released.  I've got 1 high level character, and 2 others in their 50's.  I've never been in a raiding guild so quite a bit of the conversations on these boards go over my head  ;) <br />
<br />
My first ever EQ character 5 years ago was a warrior.  I dropped him after only reaching 13.  The game really has changed so much since then.  It took me something like 6 weeks to get to 13 back then.  I hit 27 last night with my new warrior and I just rolled him last Friday the 10th.  Being twinked really changes the game quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll be posting a few questions of my own to you veterans.  Equipment, dual weilding, agro management all that sort of stuff  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're guilded with your main, use the warriors in your guild as mentors. Or use the guide on caster realms, like someone else mentioned.<br />
Your best bet is play your warrior for a while, collect some questions and post them here. : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">campdog</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was obvious from the postings that this was a HL bunch and I hesitated to ask newbie questions for fear of being ignored. I can see from the replies I got that this is a much friendlier crowd than I expected and I thank you all for your input. I'll certainly be back to ask any questions that arise as I progress. Right now at lvl 6 I guess it's just hack and slash. Good hunting everyone and I'll be seeing ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess for some basic tanking stuff--<br />
<br />
Treat everything like it reposts for 10k. NEver give the group the front of the mob.<br />
<br />
Always give pets the back of the mob. If no pet casters, let the rogue get back. Generally I find that the rogues are smarter than the pets. The will learn to follow the pets (:-p). <br />
<br />
If you are backing a mob into a wall, turn 90 so that you are going parallel to the wall. If you are heading for a corner, jump into the corner before the mob gets there.<br />
<br />
Levels seem to go so fast (particularly in PC) that you don't have time to cap your skills. Pick one or 2 that you will try and keep maxed.  The skill stops at 40-50 and 60-65 will let you get your laggin skills up. <br />
<br />
Unless you are uber I can almost garentee you that you will spend quality high level time with the droga pair--Copper Hammer of Smiting (CHoS) and Sword of the Bloodsworn (SotB) so having 1hs and 1hb is a good thing.<br />
<br />
2h will likely be a Warmasters Bladed Staff (if you have the plat) for a while.<br />
<br />
And don't forget those early level trians for new skills!</div></div><hr />
