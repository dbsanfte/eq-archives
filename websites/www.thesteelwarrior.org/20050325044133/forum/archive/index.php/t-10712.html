<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure they just all have to be dealt with,  it's the point of the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's based off Health IIRC.  They all have to be dealt with.  One thing I'll give you is that your not gonna hold aggro on the snake cause she blurs, so put several Knights on her.  Once you get it all figured out the event is really pretty trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it last night after a couple months off, it wasn't trivial with 4 clerics and 35ish in raid for us, but it wasn't bad either, we're at Inktu'Ta level or so.  Just had to accept some casters were going to die to the golems basically, things went slow enough we rezzed most of them back in during it though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very fun fight.   The snake is a pita but as others have said, once your kiters get it down it's money in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">things may of changed recently then, our prior attempt had snake and goat coming active at 70% then groundpounders at 50%.<br />
<br />
This time, goat was like 75% snake at 70% then ground pounders at 69%<br />
<br />
we know we have to deal with em, but what we had planned was to peel off rhorious since he's easy enough to heal through and get the goat and snake, then just kite the pounders while rhorious is burnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the battle master himself is stupid easy  the adds are actualy more diffcult then the main mob.<br />
<br />
kiting is important here gotta keep the golems off your raid the rest can be delt with.<br />
<br />
some of the kiters have reported that they were able to get the golems to dearggo somehow.  its only happened a couple times so not too sure on that point.<br />
<br />
since im usualy no where near the kiters don't quote me on that.  but the golems are important in terms of if you don't deal with them they will toss you and your raid all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost everything in this event memblurs constantly.  Just have to be able to constantly reaggro them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Goat and Rhorious do not Memblur, but the rest do. Keeping aggro on the golems sucks though, that knockback sucks, specially if they mem-blur themself right afterwards. We are like 8/13 for this event. Its a pretty difficult event if someone screws up(LEts golems get to clerics, off tanks for goat/snake die, rhorious gets knocked to cleric, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Control the knockbacks and it becomes substantially easier to hold aggro on the golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naerron</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we have a pally trianing the snake, a knight + cleric + shammy on the goat, rest of guild on BM, we kill BM&lt; and shammys kite ground pounders, after BM dead we burn snake, then ground pounders, then goats, its a real easy event for decent loot and spells.</div></div><hr />

Why waste the time?  Two - three good bards can handle it all.</div></div><hr />
