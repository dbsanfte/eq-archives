<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im not sure if this is the right place to post this... but does anyone have any idea how to PL a lowbie shaman? I'm creating one on another account soon to play with my warrior, but I'm not sure how to PL a non-melee class (druid DS rocks!). I have access to a 59 cleric to help, and a 37 druid. Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Treat him just like a melee.  Shaman can tank pretty well.  Go for AC/hp with his gear over wis/mana.  Shouldn't have to do anything differently than you would with a melee class, at least until mid levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get em a fungi, a bitching spear and a shield and give him your haste item, thorn him or use the cleric DS and go to town.  <br />

Shamans are actually really durable.  I needed an ogre shaman to imbue some jades for me, and talking to people isn't my strong suit, so i PL'd one to 29.  Took about 24 hours /played, and I wasn't trying real hard.  You're gonna want your shammy's defense maxed when he hits 40 anyway, so tanking is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In good AC gear (totemic or better), your shaman will actually be a half decent tank until about lvl 24 or so.  After that you'll want to start trading AC gear for wisdom gear, because your fighting style solo will be root/dot/run/re-root, and your role in groups will require you to get as much wis/mana/regen as possible to keep up with buffs/slows/debuffs/dots depending on what your role in the group is (Shamen are extraordinarily versatile).</div></div><hr />

Actually, you can effectively tank up to low 50s in old-world zones.  Properly equipped (which can actually be done fairly cheaply now), a shaman's a slow tank, but still a tank.  My shaman's been played both ways (wisdom and root'n'rot, and AC/HP/In-the-face) and HP/AC ended up being the route with less down time and more fun.  <br />
<br />
Fun &gt; all, ya know.  There are a lot of shaman who swear by their GEBs and WIS gear.  Whatever works best for them.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this:  If we warriors can tank it unbuffed and unaided, so can a shaman once it's slowed.  Shaman get as much use out of HP and AC items as we do.  I just wish STA meant as many hp to them as it does to us (roughly 3hp/STA).  I still tank a lot, particularly if there's a gimp ST in the group.  Frequently, my dog and I can have the critter near dead when the rest of the party offs theirs.<br />
<br />
The Shaman's Crucible (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/) should be able to help -- if you can ever get shaman to agree on anything!<br />
<br />
You can also join serverwide.crucible:crucible if you have any questions in-game.<br />

/em removes his bear suit and puts back on his plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I gave up tanking with my shaman I didn't have a really good slow spell yet, and I was getting my butt handed to me when I tried to tank.  Also, because I was in mostly totemic, and didnt distribute my starting points as well as I could have,  my low wisdom was making me get really frustrated in groups, especially where I was the buffer and the only healer.  My current setup at level 40 is focused on wis/mana/hps/sta in that order..so my AC makes tanking for my pet cause me more downtime than I'd like.  But I can still do it if slow lands, and since my main is a warrior it's a welcome change for me to be able to kill something without it ever laying a hand on me. :)</div></div><hr />

AMEN!  Whatever/however makes it most fun for the person playing.  I built my shaman like a warrior -- back when Verant said they were &quot;tanks that could cast&quot; -- I know exactly how you feel!</div></div><hr />
