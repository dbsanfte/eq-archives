I've been killing mobs in barindu for months trying to get some FT2 rings for my other toons, and have never seen one single rare drop from any mob until yesterdays patch.  I saw two of these earrings last night within about an hour, both from decapitators.  Get em while they are hot I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been trying to get that thing for awhile but no luck so far. :(<br />
<br />
Such a boring camp too hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is it possible for my wizard to solo for that thing, and then log to my war to loot... maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't been there since they retuned the GoD zones, but preretuning (hmm too many prefixes) I'd have to say it would be tough and not very efficient.  Luckily the mobs there don't summon.  However, the mobs used to hit for 600-700 with that annoying 600dd proc.  There are around 6 different types of mobs that can spawn, 2 types are casters with pets that hit for 300s.  You can only reliably single pull the first 2 or 3 static spawns and any of those spawns can have a mob/pet combo.  All the mobs can be pretty resistant and there isn't much room to kite.  I was able take one down solo as my druid, but I had to get close enough to take some hits sometimes so it wasn't very safe.  Second mob I tried killed me. :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went there today to kill an hour on my lunch break, and I didnt see the earring drop, but I the caster ring did drop.  Both are supposed to be rare from anything in the zone, but that is the first I have seen of either in about 15 hours hunting there.  <br />
<br />
The mobs are a little easier now, but one thing I did notice, is that when they de-tuned the mobs, they must have forgot the pets!  The warmedic pets hit for more than their masters now!  400+<br />
<br />
Might have to head back to Ferubi and see if I can get the shoulders to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I fought there again last night for a couple hours, saw one more earring drop.<br />
<br />
Overall the mobs are the same as they were before, meaning that they rampage, flurry, proc Chaos Claws about the same rate, etc.   The major difference is that they dont hit for max as much as they did.   I see lots of hits in the 100's instead of for max now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was in there for over an hour yesterday with nearly two groups and didn't see the trash drop anything...named was up towards the end of our stint.  Yellow con, I *think* he was only doubling and on my gimp ass, max was 1k with the rest of his hits being nowhere near max.  Yeah, the atk gimping is noticible even in the lower zones, as was their innate procs.  Yeah, they still proc.  But they don't do it on 75% of their hits like they used to.  I never spent a lot of time killing mobs in Barindu pre-nerf, but from my past experience, that stuff was comparable to at least tier 3 PoP if not EP trash, and now it's gimped down to basically tier 2 stuff.  Anyone have a link of the ring, out of curiousity?  Work doesn't let me into Lucy =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bullfrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is there a specific spawn or area I need to camp?  I'm thinking about camping for one of these earrings.  Any advice would be helpful.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">got the earring today on the first kill on my main, logged on war to loot (whole grp was pretty much in time gear)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bullfrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Over the last few days, I've been camping this earring.  14 AAs at this camp later, still nothing.  It's random off anything in Barindu yeah?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I camped Barindu on saturday and sunday for around 7 hours.  I usually just sit in one spot and pull to there but after many hours that got old so I started crawling around the zone.  I cleared all the mobs in the NW corner, NE corner, everything by the riwi zone, and most out of the center of the zone before I gave up.  I didnt see one named mob, no rare drops, nada.  Very frustrating.<br />
<br />
To answer your question Bullfrog, I dont know.  I've seen 3 earrings drop, and all three came from decapitators.  I dont know if they only drop from decapitators or not.   BTW 14 aa's is pretty good hehe.  I drag my enchanter along with me and grab a DC for dps, and it steals damn near all the xp, so this camp is particularly unrewarding for me.</div></div><hr />
