<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading somewhere it was stated by a dev or such that Taunt is maxed 230 and that raising it to 252 would not do a thing since the game mechanics says Taunt=230=Max taunt ability, yet I see this <br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25995 <br />
which would raise taunt to 253, so I ask <br />
1)is taunt 230 actually max ability and raising it to 250 or 252 not doing anything?<br />
2)Is this so knights can raise their taunt (180 modded to 198) skill closer to a warrior once again shrinking the gap between knights and warriors?<br />
3) Or is this actually true and they can raise taunt to do more for warriors?<br />
<br />
I personally vote #1 &amp; #2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dunno if i'm dreaming but i thought they upped knight taunt skill to 210?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well $hit, after looking over, Knight taunt skill = 220, with mod that would be 242, or 230 if max is truely 230. <br />
<br />
1)is taunt 230 actually max ability and raising it to 250 or 252 not doing anything?<br />
2)Is this so knights can raise their taunt (220 modded to 242) closing the gap between knights and warriors taunt skill? <br />
3) completely useless to Warriors?<br />
4) Or is this actually true and they can raise taunt to do more for warriors?<br />
<br />
I personally vote #1 &amp; #2 #3, but I sure hope for #4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KaoraEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Taunt was increased (last year?) from 200 to 230 for Warriors and from 180 to 220 for Paladins and SK's.<br />
<br />
Im sure that a taunt skill raise would give us minimal results on our success rate of the taunt skill. <br />
<br />
Taunt needs to be revamped on how it works to be effective imo and a skill raise won't do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This what you were thinking of Garoar?<br />
<br />
Why is the Taunt Skill capped at 230 then?<br />
<br />
The mechanics are already based around the fact that 230 is the max, so it doesn’t really matter that it doesn’t go all the way to 250. <br />
<br />
From a dev transcript about a year ago, posted @  http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4899. Iono if it still holds true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanx Dogga thats the one.. so what do these boots mean ? you have to be PoTime enabled to get these, and I  doubt any warriors in PoTime would need a mod to max Taunt, so either its useless to us (typical) or taunt can raise more.. fug if I know.<br />
guess its only figured by a parse with these bad boys to find out like the last taunt parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I was in my mid-50's I had an opportunity to borrow a guildy's Pink Hat (aka Garish Head Dress - http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=7478) on a few raids.  At that time (bear in mind my taunt was not yet max'd out) it was a HUGE improvement to my taunt sucess rate.  Went from about 2/3 sucess to about 9/10 sucess on dark blue mobs (Kael arena specifically).<br />
<br />
I haven't done any comparisons since (I picked up one of my own in my early 60's).  I'll try it out sometime and will report if it has any effect, assuming someone doesn't beat me to the punch here.  Regardless, it is quite difficult to gauge a taunt sucess rate change due to RNG streakiness.<br />
<br />
Personally, I haven't taken the Pink Hat off since I got it - although I did dye it white.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would love a parse of this behavior.  It is not outside of the realm of possibility with &quot;SOE Math&quot; but it seems weird that a 10% Taunt mod would improve Taunt from 60% to ....?  Math dictates you go from 60% to 66%.  That isn't aweinspiring huge.<br />
<br />
In any event, I believe Taunt is powerful enough and fine where it is.  Bar none, there is no other skill in the game that when it works makes a monster turn on to you.  Everything else plays still plays with probability while successful Taunt just works.<br />
<br />
The difference between Knights and Warriors is that Knights never rely just on Taunt.  Beyond skill limitation, why do Warriors have too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually Aeka, a single successful taunt under certain circumstances might not even do that.  It's believed to do that, but this long thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811&amp;highlight=damned) shows that under some circumstances it may take up to 4 successful taunts(as successful as it's possible to tell, with the mobs responding to the taunt) before you gain agro.<br />
<br />
Also, the 10% mod would indeed only be a 6% change, if each skill point had an equal effect and it scaled perfectly.  But that's not true, the 10% increase is to your taunt skill (about 200 I'm assuming since he said it wasn't maxed), which I doubt scales perfectly with equal weight to each skill point.  An increase of about 20 points, putting you near the max, would most likely give you more successes than just 10% more, as he was fighting dark blues in Kael.  Although, he probably was elaborating a small bit...never seen taunt succeed 9 out of 10 times.  60% feels more accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not that I have the logs from back then, but what would you look for in your logs to show that taunt worked vs not?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I'll elaborate on what I remember from the raids I mentioned:<br />
<br />
My guild was young, and raiding the plate cycle in Kael was a &quot;big deal&quot; to us - getting all that yummy thurg armor and all.  I was the MT, having just recently graduated from being MT for numerous Naggy/Vox open raids.  I think I was in the 53-56 range (on some I remember not yet having defensive).<br />
<br />
Without the Pink Hat I had a bear of a time getting aggro, much less maintaining it.  In part, this was due to my guild not really understanding what raid aggro is all about, etc.  The other part was my less than stellar weapons (can't even remember what they were - maybe a Frosty?).<br />
<br />
As soon as I put on the Pink Hat, basicaly every time I hit taunt I got aggro.  Stuck in my brain so much that almost 10 levels later I was still looking for a Pink Hat of my own.  Note that I say every time I hit taunt I got aggro - I was still losing it frequently because we still didn't know what we were doing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the Pink Hat put me over some magic SoE mathematical inflection point - think of it as a reverse soft cap.  Up to the &quot;soft cap&quot; you have the usual crappy RNG chance of taunt sticking, but above that &quot;soft cap&quot; your chances improve dramatically for very little actual increase.  Kinda like with some tradeskills.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting more curious about what the Pink Hat does for me at level 65.  Gonna have to try without it sometime soon.  Will be either BoT or LDoN - only places that I have a good baseline feel for taunt sucess rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think most warriors at 65 would have their taunt already maxed out at 230 so the taunt aspect is prettty useless to  a warrior, that mana is nice though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remember that thread. ^_^ The subtile point I was trying to make is that the way Taunt is geared should be treated more as a &quot;free shot&quot; than a main line skill.  Its failure rate is way to high to be dependable.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, if I could only stop 60% of the gaters from getting away, I'd stop claiming I could do it.</div></div><hr />
