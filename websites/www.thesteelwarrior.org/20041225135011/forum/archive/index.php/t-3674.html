<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pretty much use a Vanazir as my main weapon. I was planning on adding the Anger3 augment from Guk as soon as I was able to buy it. The problem with doing this is I wouldn't be able to dps at all with the Vanazir and would need to keep it in my backpack until it was my turn to tank and normally I'm the 3rd or 4th tank on gods. That would leave me using a Emp sword for dps. There's a +5 Dmg Aug that drops in LDoN raids that might be better in the long run. Right now I have the 150dd Rujarkian Venom and it procs pretty often and doesn't get many resists. <br />
<br />
Which do you think would be better? I'm leaning towards saving for the damage augment myself but I wanted to get some opinions. I posted the stats of the items I'm talking about below for reference.<br />

This does give me a bit more aggro, but i find its still usable for DPS if i start out slow with another weapon(i normally start out with that crappy fire 2h hehe), then flip in my VDD when tank has a decent lock. After seeing the 5 dmg aug, im going to switch to it, soon as i get one, as i said before i really have 0 problems locking with vdd, except when slowed, the yk is nice for extra dps/aggro, but 5dmg boost to vdd will add a good bit more dps, and a tad more aggro, with beter ability for it to be dps+tanking weapon.. <br />
<br />
Of course this is all up to each user, but my goal is the 5 dmg aug(unless a better is found)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will personnaly try to keep my ykesha augmented blade of war for tanking and when it's more important I have aggro.<br />
<br />
But in the long run, Vanazir with a 5dmg+ mod is the way to go for dps and that's what I'm aiming for.  (Btw if you are asking what will do more dmg, the 150dd proc doesn't even come close to what a 5dmg augment would do for dps).<br />
<br />
You can still hold aggro fine of course most of the time, but nothing beat pure hate proc.<br />

I know afterlife has gotten one, didn't think it was an easy raid?.<br />
<br />
It is a time-level raid drop and they are very hard. They're what we raid in LDoN. We are really close to beating those exact same raids and have already beaten the Rujarkian raid. This is me planning ahead regardless.</div></div><hr />

I got the 100 Ykesha proc atm and I'm liking it a good deal.  It adds some aggro which is nice, and a little DPS.  I can still use it for DPS if I'm semi-careful and turn atk off every once in a while if I get a ton of procs in a row.<br />
<br />
I'm currently not maxed on offensive AAs, so I think I'm going to just work on those as my way of getting better aggro.  I might upgrade to the 125 Ykesha once I get enough points to open that up just to get the lower resist rate and minimal extra DPS.  But the Anger3 so far looks like overkill for a proc that does nothing useful (other than gimmick taunt).<br />
<br />
I get decent lock atm in exp groups, even with low AAs, and haven't had any problems with lock when MT'ing on raids, yet...<br />
<br />
The 5 dmg augment does look nice, but I can't really imagine that it will goto warriors over Pal/SK/Monk/BST/etc... as Warriors will be expected (forced) to keep aggro procs on their weapons as the only Aug, while other classes can just use whatever helps their DPS the most.</div></div><hr />

I've been looking for some good info comparing  VDD and BoW.  I do not want to get a VDD and realize it cannot hold aggro well enough to be a MT weapon.  I do not have the luxury of getting one, then deciding I want the other, as I am low man on the totem pole. ;) <br />
<br />
Notwithstanding augments, how DOES VDD stack up against BoW?  Is the higher damage output and AC debuff enough to hold its own or surpass the BoW? Or is the BoW still king of the endgame 2handers? <br />
<br />
If this information is elsewhere on the boards, please point me to it...I haven't found what I'm looking for in searches etc.  Thanks in advance!<br />

I have no problems tanking with a Vanazir at all, under any circumstance. Our tank order on the gods atm usually looks like this:<br />
<br />
Tank1 - Vanazir<br />
Tank2 - Darkblade + Bloodfrenzy<br />
Tank3 - BoW<br />
Tank4 - Vanazir<br />
Tank5 - Vanazir<br />
Tank6 - BoW<br />
<br />
We have absolutely no troubles with this and can normally clear time in one night (6-7 hours) if we start early enough. I would say you really can't go wrong with either one.<br />
<br />
(Btw if you are asking what will do more dmg, the 150dd proc doesn't even come close to what a 5dmg augment would do for dps). <br />
The Ruj aug was a toy I added after getting a refund for a 40hp augment and not being able to replace it right away due to a lack of points in Everfrost. I realize the 5dmg aug will blow it out of the water.</div></div><hr />

Speaking from the other side of the fenace, as a beneficiary of a tank getting fast solid agro, I will take a BoW+augment weilding warrior over a VDD+augment for LDoN adventures or exp groups. The amount if fast agro along with long term agro is amazing. I have found I can really unload when a BoW+aug warrior is doing the tanking.<br />
<br />
For raid purposes, either does fine since there is plenty of time to get agro. I haven't had any problems with getting splattered by TZ or VZ since our warriors started getting augments on these 2 weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolkin</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mt with vdd all the time, 0 problems with aggro unless im slowed. Its the only time vdd dosn't rock.. as for ldon adventures (laugh), funny rogues/wizards are always saying they love to group with me, cause my lock is instant(thx to warrior 2h dps)+ the procs. Im not downing on bow, both are great weapons, BoW prob can get a tad better lock over time, do to its innate procs aggro over nightmare. Vdd gets better aggro early off the bigger hits and still does great over time. I actully still went yk proc over anger.. why? my vdd almost never loss's lock when i want to tank, i felt no reason to go anger. And as i posted above ill prob trade yk for 5dmg add soon as i can.<br />
<br />
PS i had vanzir a good long while ago now, way before ldon and proc add's.. i still had 0 aggro trouble with it back before u could add a proc to it, slaughtering my old combo of 2 enrage proc'rs for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stikka</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a rogue I regularly backstab opposite Vanazir, BoW and SeWS they are all good for aggro and all seem to be usable for DPS when not tanking on raids. One of our SeWS tanks added Yak to his and it was noticable he had snap aggro on any proc.<br />
<br />
In Time I can't recall seeing our tanks swapping out their main weapon in DPS mode or tank mode and they are all fine to work with from a roguely perspective. If you want a nice compromise between DPS and aggro then Yak seems pretty much ideal for the task.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cardinal</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used VDD, VDD + 125 Ykesha , VDD + Anger 3, BoW, and BoW +125 Yk.  They are all excellent aggro.  The neked VDD was only a problem when tank gets thumped with a deaggro curse or slowed, or versus a hot BoW (ie yk augmented).  (If you are relying on largely dps aggro, a slowed VDD is in a world of hurt ...) <br />
<br />
What is best depends largely on what you need it for....  if you need absolute maximum possible aggro (either to compensate of stun happy pallies or SoS happy wizzies ) the Anger 3 VDD simply rocks.  If you are looking for maximum DPS, go ahead pop a cheap 150 poison proc or whatever on it. If you factor in the average 2 proc / min proc rate, you're looking at best a 5 dps increase (assuming never a resist).  Given the VDD will dish a minimum of 125ish dps ( and often much higher ), your need will dictate whether an at most 4% increase in dps is worth more than 2 chunks of 600 hate / min...  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I think the VDD deals more than adequate damage in its base form. Give me that extra 1200 hate cushion anyday .....<br />

You can't put it on another one.<br />
<br />
 I use BoW, and have not augmented it yet. I can honestly say I don't know what to put on it.  I am leaning towards damage/dps over an aggro proc.</div></div><hr />
