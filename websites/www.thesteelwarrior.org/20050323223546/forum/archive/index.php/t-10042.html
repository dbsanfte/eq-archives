I am a ldon junkie, but I have never been on a ldon raid event.<br />
<br />
I'd like to lead one, if they are worth doing.  I have heard the possible loot drops is quite nice.<br />
<br />
Is there any links to info on this?  If not can someone enlighten me to questions like this please...<br />
<br />
How many people form a LDON raid (minimum and max)?  <br />
What theme would be best to start with?  <br />
Are the objectives in a raid similar to an adventure ( ie.  slaughter 60, collect 30 )?<br />
Are the level limits a 7 level spread like a normal LDON adventure?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kathump</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also wondered about the LDoN raid function.  I think you have to have 18 people minimum for it to be considered a raid and that they must still be in the 7 lvl range for it to work.  That is about all the info I have been able to find about the raid function, besides that they are very hard and that if you wipe 3 times the raid is over.<br />
<br />
If any one has any info would you be able to enlighten us who are still curious about them please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my understanding the normal raids are comperable to Vex Thal in difficulty, while the hard raids are comperable to Time.<br />
<br />
The only time I ever tried an LDoN raid was a normal everfrost one.  We zoned in with no clue at all what we were supposed to do.  A couple green /con goblins screamed that invaders were in the zone and ran off into the tunnel.  A short minute later our raid was wiped by a horde of green and light blue /con goblins.  Was funny and humilitating all at once.  We still have no idea what we were supposed to accomplish on the raid.  We never went back, mostly because other raid avenues opened to us and the LDoN stuff just wasn't worth it.</div></div><hr />
