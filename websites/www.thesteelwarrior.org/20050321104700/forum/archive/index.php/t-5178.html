FFXI suck imo.  The UI is totally crap and its designed as a console game.  If you are use to PS2 games, then you might be in luck.  Graphics and such, skill sets are all pretty decent.  I could not get over the interface at all!  You have to play without the mouse, or rebind all the buttons to a controller.  If you thought there was lack of skills to warrior types, this game has less special moves than EQ.  Try taunt that refreshes once every 5 mins.<br />
<br />
SWG is what Im playing now.  Fairly easy to climb the skill trees.  Once you figure out the game, you can master each class in less than a week.  Pretty decent pvp with rebels vs imperials and having atst's walking around killing things for you.  You have to take on other factions bases and such, kinda kewl.  Lack of big game raid material, but there are hunting raids that go on.  No warrior class of sorts, mostly who does more damage etc.<br />
<br />
Im personally waiting for WoW to come out.  SWG is getting a bit old but then you can holo grind.  That means you have to master 5 random proffesions outta 32 possibilities, with 4 chances to find out which to master first.  The last one you cant find out so you master till you hit it.  Then you unlock a jedi slot that you can play and be hunted.  Bounty Hunters hunt you all the time and if you die you lose all your skills and have to start from scratch.  Fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not the word I'd use to describe that.<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I got tired of Star Wars after about a month, but let my account drag on for a few more and played sparingly. The visuals were great. The system/foundation was great. But the content wasn't there.<br />
<br />
So the point of me grinding? I couldn't find any.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to City of Heroes. At least that one when the POINT of grinding goes away, I'll still have ROLE PLAYING to fall back on (hey, I'm a comics nut).<br />
<br />
In the meantime, it's EQ or bust, heh.<br />
<br />
And a nice healthy portion of John Madden Football and Jepoardy for PS2 ... &quot;Because I hate you Alex Trebeck!&quot;<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played the snot outa FFXI (in beta and release).<br />
<br />
IMHO the biggest detractor for me is the lack of English Speaking specific servers, coupled with an overly restrictive grouping system and well - after 2 month's FFXI accounts closed and removed from the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Let me expound...<br />
<br />
1) Lack of English Speakers<br />
While I don't have any issues with people of foriegn nationality or other languages, basic communication barriers suck ass.  You play on the same servers as the Japanese do.  All of these servers have large Japanese populations of high level characters, so there is not the &quot;race&quot; to level up as a new server opens (which can be a fun aspect of a new MMO IMHO)<br />
<br />
2) Overly restrictive grouping system.  <br />
While you will solo (with about any class / race combo - some better than others but) to about lvl 10 as standard, once you start grouping, especially in the mid teens and getting progressivly more restrictive as you go up in levels, you will be forced to group with people within 1 or 2 levels of you for the &quot;best exp&quot; (and why get anything but?)<br />
<br />
On top of that, there is the &quot;holy trinity&quot; aspect of what classes you have to make an ideal group, and well, it just makes forming a group (of which you probably won't be able to talk to most of the people you would like to invite) a big pain in the ass<br />
<br />
3) Lack of end game<br />
I've talked at length with very experienced english speakers who had played the game, and once you hit max level, you basically hunt notorious monsters (like rare spawns) for loot, help others level, but there aren't much in the way of big raid type targets like the plethora of stuff to hit in EQ<br />
<br />
4) Game looks sweet tho and has solid, non buggy systems<br />
Just wish they had new servers for English speakers and a more open grouping system - skill chains, sub jobs, auction houses, lots of quests - game is cool but ultimately didn't hold me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ: You know and love (or not love) it.<br />
<br />
DAoC: Nice option. I beta-tested and then played about 6 months into the release, finally coming back to EQ because most of my guild came back as well, and the world was pretty small compared to EQ. Also, Realm-vs-Realm (their version of PvP) wasn't my cup of tea. Things have improved since, I hear, with two expansions and some special ruleset servers, including an all-blue server that allows you to travel to any and all realms to do adventure in. (I am, by nature and play style, an explorer, not a killer, so I prefer blue servers where I can travel the zones extensively.)<br />
<br />
EQ2: Looks like a really different beast. I'm following its development, and this is the one I'm likely to end up in, methinks.<br />
<br />
SWG: I was in Beta and thought it sucked big time, then they just up and released it, and the peeps who were not in Beta seemed to generally enjoy it. Some of the peeps in Beta who made the transition wondered why we weren't playtesting what was released, because it was apparently better. Although it draws people in, it seems to have a more limited lifespan than EQ, with many of the peeps I know having already tried and cancelled it after a few months, as opposed to many of them being in their fourth and fifth years of playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Anarchy Online: Sucked at release, much better now from what I hear, though I didn't give it much of a chance and cancelled after just one month (this was at the time of retail release).<br />
<br />
City of Heroes: Just entered Beta and not a lot of info, but I find the lack of &quot;I don't care about the NDA, this game sux!&quot; posts encouraging. Very genre-specific, though...you gotta like playing superheroes in colorful tights.<br />
<br />
WoW: I am in that apparent minority who could care less about Warcraft and its ilk. As such, I have no particular desire to play this and will reserve any judgment on its qualities until those who have played it extensively in Beta pipe up and give us their feelings.<br />
<br />
FFXI: Played it for a couple of weeks, even bought a gamepad to play it because the mouse and the interface are quirky at best. Very pretty to look at, but not a whole lot there is you're used to what EQ offers. Cancelled it after two months, but only because I didn't get to it in time to cancel before I was charged for the second month.<br />
<br />
Planetside: SOE's MMOFPS is pretty dead (&quot;I'm not dead yet!&quot; &quot;Yes you are, you're only kidding yourself!&quot;), but I still log into it maybe once a week to see what's up and to get myself shot up six ways to Sunday. Finding a large battle outside of prime time is, at best, a challenge, and since the only things you can kill are other players (no NPC's to shoot at...hint, hint, SOE, it would make it more fun if I could hunt down giant lizards when there's no one to shoot at), it can get pretty boring unless you play at primetime exclusively.<br />
<br />
Eve, Earth and Beyond, Horizons, AC2: Don't bother...some of these may not even be up anymore. Horizons is brand-spanking new, actually, but I was not impressed with it in Beta, and apparently not many are impressed with it at release. I always thought of it as MMORPG-Lite. I will say this for AC2, which I played for 4 months after release: It was a beautiful world to explore, graphically; there just wasn't a heck of a lot to do in it and ultimately that doomed it. I hear it is still online, with just one server.<br />
<br />
YMMV, of course; these are just my observations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just started up FFXI yesterday, in the few hours i have logged in it (ok, i mean the few hours to get a level 10 monk) ive had more fun than i have had in EQ for the longest time, english speaking players are sorta rare, but i got a server pass to valefor(whoops there goes my monk) and there is a large group called GUshell of very nice people, and the server has a large amount of people that speak english :) kinda pissed i cant continue the whole &quot;cat-man&quot; legacy i started with my war in EQ because the mirthas are fem only :/<br />
<br />
ah well its still loads of fun<br />
some config file editing has really helped me get around the clunky UI, and i kinda like the way that the UI is kept out of sight untill you need it<br />
<br />
i also played Earth and Beyond and god that game was shit!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found the game really interesting in Beta, but exicution and release were so bad as to be almost ledgendary (though I don't think it was quite as bad as WW2 online). I just wondered by their fora and, seeing the lack of ranting there, I am encouraged that the 6 months since release has solved a lot of the problems. <br />
<br />
I liked Planetside too (as something comepletely different from EQ) though, even though I am now running a 3200+ Athlon, Radion 9600 Pro, etc, I wont go near it as I only have 1/2 gig ram (and you NEED a gig).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a LOT better now than what it was; although it's still a pretty mindless game overall. Definately won't keep you there for 12+ hour sessions but, it's what I call &quot;the little game that could&quot;.<br />
<br />
It had potential..a LOT of potential. Too bad what Funcom released was the biggest pile of steaming sh*t ever and turned most of the playerbase away from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect. They now have 5 (I believe) English servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing about DAoC is that I played it in its final beta release, beta'd the expansion, and there's just something naturally appealing about the RvR. I'm not a big guild kind of guy and that really doesn't translate well in EQ, but in Camelot if I go out for a Midnight snack of Hibbies at the Mile Gate by myself it just means I have to play different, rather than it being a completely hopeless effort.<br />
<br />
Take away RvR on Camelot and it will be nothing but the hunt still attracts me in a way that Everquest is hard pressed to contest these days.</div></div><hr />

Since when?  Did they give all the english speaking peeps the chance to move characters there or create characters there?<br />
<br />
Cause if not, then you are probably just thinking of the servers that are known as having the highest population of english folks (Fairy, etc.)<br />
<br />
At least I'll have to go look at the playonline site now ^.^<br />
