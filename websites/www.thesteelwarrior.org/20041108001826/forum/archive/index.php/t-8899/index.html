<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helwaqe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aghh. Have you did an LDoN where the puller brings 4 mobs,  and then gets 2 wanderers on the way. AND THEN LIVE TO SMACK THE PALADIN AROUND! We lived with all under 10% health the Cleric nearly had a tantrum. Any stupid puller stories you got?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe 6 in a normal is not a train. In a hard I am amazed you lived :-p. <br />
<br />
SInce I usually pull the easies... no I have don't really have that many stupid puller stories. Particularly those I would share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bah, Mistmoore is easy... go try to pull those darn NRO (Takish) dungeons were chain agro gets you 4-6 and then ... DOORS !!!<br />
<br />
Doors SUCK !!!!<br />
<br />
BTW im talking the 65 hards... but anyways.. worse story I have is door shutting on me then getting stunned and door wont open or stuck in geometery :P<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, btw, how did hurricanes leave you, Helwage?  You and your family and house ok?<br />
<br />
I'm in Lake Helen near New Semerna, we did fine.. others near us didn't fare well (<br />
<br />
And then .... Ivan GO AWAY.. though I sure hope he doesnt hurt anyone while running from me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh; I killed my entire guildraid off...One pull, Kael ... granted it was almost 2 years ago but to kill off 45+ people is a feat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MM Assassinate.<br />
<br />
The dungeon where he pops in the room with 8-9 other mobs, after passing thru the route with the most large spawn rooms to get to (which happens to be the worst - longest route of the whole zone).<br />
<br />
Extra half hour didnt even get my group the sympathy points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mistmoore has been pretty easy to pull for me.  More mobs come single than I ever think will come single there.  Constantly doing a &quot;3 inc&quot; to the group, only to see one come.  Doesn't always happen of course, but a lot more often than I think it will when looking at the mobs spacing in the rooms I've pulled.<br />
<br />
Guk and Tak on the other hand blow for sure.  Entire rooms always aggro.  I've gotten to the point where I'm pulling those decently too though since the rule of thumb I've been living by is &quot;if there's a corner of the room I can't see, there's a mob standing there&quot;.  I have the cleric pacify everything he can see, then I pop around the corner and tag the one no one knew was there.  There's always a mob tucked away in those little cubbies and corners you can't see in.  Pretty predictable now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I kill my whole guild every 2-3 months or so.  It keeps me humble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe.I've gone to MM on the rare occasion I LDON because it is easier for me to pull hards there without CC.I get to kill my guild practically every day now on the weekends$$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Meh, if you don't wipe your group/guild once in a while, they'll think being a warrior is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">during the times i do LDoN, i manage to kill my fair share of the group, or totally wipe them, at least once per day.<br />
<br />
on normals.<br />
<br />
best pull we lived through were probably 12 mobs with no cc and no AE casters.<br />
<br />
best wipe i pulled was upwards of 25 mobs with no cc (but hey we had 3 AE casters for that one... but no AE stun. we tried anyway. we failed.) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just did a Mistmoore Hard LDON last night.  I pulled between 4-6 mobs on a couple pulls and was quite confident that my chanter can take care of em all.  It helps that me, the cleric, and the chanter have been playing together since our early 50s so we know exactly what to do.  I wouldnt pull like that if i had a pickup chanter though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I usually ask my teammates in evey LDoN adventures I do : <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know the difference between a great crowd controller and a normal crowd controller ?&quot;<br />
<br />
After that, I pull 3 or 4 rooms and we try to kill them all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SO far mistmoore adventures were as deadly for enchanter than the other themes, but I have done it only a dozen of times, so this is not (yet) a reliable sample.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The worst is running for camp with 4 mobs only to find out  that the chanter doesn't like to use AOE mez because he doesn't find it very effective.<br />
