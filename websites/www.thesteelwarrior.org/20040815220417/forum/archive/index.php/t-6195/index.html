Fabled Ghoul Lord Quadded me for 1400ish undisced.  Since they are the same con as the original it's been amusing watching people walk up to them and get splattered.<br />

Someone hollered in the bazaar that they dropped in Najena (didn't say what MOB tho) ... I am assuming that the quest is not the way to go - tried the Crafted Vambraces quest thinking that *mebbe* that's were the Fabled Crafted Vambraces came from - and that one is still the plain ol' dumped em on a vendor for 12 plat Crafted Vambraces.  After that, I dumped 240p or so in the casino, and called it a night. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Bonequest,<br />
  I beleive the fabled Ancient Cyclops drops them, so you do not have to do the quest.   Also I read that these events and fable mobs are suppose to be ingame until the end of the month.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know what sort of force is required to take out the fabled executioner, I can two box combo 65 mage with assasinating water pet (for mobs under 46) and 62 beastlord, would that be sufficient?</div></div><hr />

Hrmm if its the orginal J Boot mob (pre-AC) its goin to be one of the 3 named behind the darn Najena sign...I can not for the life of me remember the name though..although I do remember that stupid room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So anyone know where to get Fabled Crafted Vambraces for sure.  They are pretty nice.  The jboots you have to have a key bc i saw someone selling it in POK.  Kinda stupid if u ask me.  O yeah wait time for jboots on Therris-Thule Tuesday was 6 hour minimum.  Frenzy wait time was about 4 hours.  Its pretty insane how many people came down to lguk for these drops the LEAST Ive seen down there is 28.  O yeah I tanked the lord with a 65 shm 65 dru 65 cleric 57 bard.  Wasn't that bad accually.  When he rampages though that hurts even with defensive up.</div></div><hr />

I wonder what this will do to the server economy?  Hmm . . .<br />
<br />
Also there is a fabled Ring of the Ancients.  Maybe that leads to the fabled JBoots?</div></div><hr />

I thought I would mix it up by trying to pull the fabled king to frenzy... and it worked. Got myself a fabled mith2h. Only worked once though.<br />
<br />
The problem I ran into is that after killing the guards in his room (was dumb of me since king can be single pulled) a shaman popped and sowed him when he respawned and I got owned trying to get back to dead side. I'm sure if I had some pumice on me I could have dispelled him on the pull. Oh well, was fun :) Got fabled fbss, exe axe, mith2h, and ee bag wute!</div></div><hr />

the fabled king in lower guk hits for around 1000+. the fabled frenzied ghoul hits around 700+. I never got smacked by the fabled evil eye so i cant tell yall how much he hits for. the fabled ghoul lord hits for about the same as the king. they all have (except drelzna.) around 50k hp so they are pretty tough but when u have lots of people helping it isn't bad.</div></div><hr />

The Fabled Garnil Rucksif in Unresy is super easy to solo. Cons light blut at 65, hits max 298. Just open with furious and a high dmg 2hander and he will kill himself basically. I killed 10 times and he never got me below 50% health.<br />
<br />
Fabled cloaked dhampyre is a bit harder, hits 268, but is a sk ans HT right off the bat, has a few more hp. <br />
<br />
Fabled maid issis is fairly tough. Hit me for 326 max (triples) and casts/summons. Had over 32k hp and I needed 2 druid 5k heals to take here, even with dmg shield up.<br />
<br />
fabled reclusive ghoul magi hits for 181, easy.<br />
<br />
fabled undead knight of unrest hits for 183, easy.<br />
<br />
fabled undead barkeep hits for 171, easy.<br />
