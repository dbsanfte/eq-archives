<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried doing a search, but the search here on the forum is a pain in the ass and wouldn't give me what I wanted to find.<br />
<br />
If I'm mainhanding a BoC, do I still need something for agro in my offhand (copper hammer, or SoD)? I know the offhand procs significantly less than mainhand, so would it be ok to just stick a dps weapon in there like SBoD or shortblade of lightning instead and rely on EB proc exclusively?<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?<br />
<br />
Also, another question, this time hp-related: what would you say is a good hp target to shoot for a 65 warrior who has no option to raid or join a raiding guild? I work nights, 6pm-2am, which pretty much kills any possibility of attending raids unless it's with an Asian guild, and I don't speak chinese/japanese/other asian (and they speak poor english, so it wouldn't exactly be an option).<br />
<br />
I'm a casual warrior, a BoC is the best weapon I'll ever see, and right now my hp's around 5400 unbuffed (see magelo link). Any upgrades I'm not noticing? I've set my target unbuffed hp at 5800 and am hoping to reach that some day - not holding my breath though - am I aiming too low, or too high?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all the replies ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have allmost the exact same gear I had or am still wearing now :p You have a huge boon over most casual wars just by being Tribunal. (cheap and good armor that is allmost the same as ornate and can still be sold after you upgrade)<br />
<br />
 When I had 5.4 k hp (only at 5.8 now; see magelo), I allready had clerics in BoT etc telling me they were happy I had some hp on me, so I'd say for a non Elemental guild you are fine. From what I see warriors in VT cabable guilds have around 6k-6.5k hp so for wearing droppable gear, you re not far off. <br />
<br />
As for using a BoC as only proccing weapon, I d say that way you take away any advantage dual wield and the BoC provide you with over a proccing 2hander. I like my BoC a lot, but it has a streaky proc rate; having a proccing offhand ups your chance of holding aggro significantly. As an example, I will use ChoS offhand in most exp grps due to it adding a tad more dps, but when I absoultely must hold aggro defensive, I use red epic offhand due to the minor dps boost not really making up for the quality of a 500 hate proc. <br />

<br />
As for your unbuffed HP, there is no reason to shoot for 6500ish, even as an unguilded warrior with no raid drops. My warrior has almost 5200hp at level 62 with only 6aa. At 65 with around 30aa he'll be close to 6200hp. Most everything he has can be found in the bazaar. If you can get your hands on a BoC, then you should be able to work toward getting everything I have gotten.<br />
<br />
Also, with the new LDoN armor, there are some nice items you can make if you put in the time to rack up some points, not to mention the 40hp augments you can put on most of your gear. Using augs you could end up with close to 7khp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for 40hp augments on everything? Possibly... but aren't those around 750-1000 points each? That's around 20 successes per aug, which counting failures would equal close to 40 hours a pop, per slot (yes, YOUR groups never fail and they win in 30 minutes; my pickup groups don't).<br />
<br />
Though raising hp through ldon is always an option, it's a long-term one - a year and more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no reason why your pick up groups have to fail. Don't do the adventures you know are a pain in the ass and be picky about who you group with. If you get an invite to a group with 2 clerics, 2 druids, and a level 60 ranger, kindly decline and get a group with some DPS. I mostly do LDoN adventures late nights so I end up grouping with my nonuber friends and we don't reallly have a problem winning. No reason you can't get a 40hp aug every 2 weeks even with a casual play time. 2 adventures a night will get you enugh points every 2 weeks even with a 28% fail rate (20/28).</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's still one of the best tanks in my guild.<br />
<br />
So to answer your original question: Do you NEED a second proc? No. You can do just fine without one.<br />
<br />
Will a secondary hate proccing weapon help? Maybe. Probably. Get one and find out.<br />
<br />
In fact, actual in game experience would be worth a lot more than anything I or anyone else here has to say.<br />
<br />
Fight the mobs, find out.<br />
<br />
Good luck, have fun.<br />
<br />
Just remember, my friend MT's right now with Krizzen's Flame and his red epic. Before that it was Krizzen's Flame and Anklesmasher and he did just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In raid MT setup I use CHSD for added security and bum a FA from a shaman.<br />
<br />
No matter what people on this board say, regardless of the fact BoC proc rate is streaky its still more then enough for any LDoN normal adventure you will do.</div></div><hr />

Anyway...i have a BoC and that alone is usually enough. I have red epic and primal for offhands, i always use red epic offhand for tanking on raids, but in groups i usually use primal for more DPS and avatar. I'm also thinking of getting a SBoD and putting a ykesha proc augment in it for DPS and some aggro. BoC alone is fine for keeping aggro in most situations. However, a proc from the offhand can and does help. I mean...i doubt you'll have the DPS to not lose aggro for a sec on slow(assuming you get it right back with a taunt), unless the slow is really late. An EB proc on BoC will definetely keep the aggro on you. But having a nice proc in offhand gives you a higher chance of having almost knight-like aggro, so it's your choice.</div></div><hr />

He'll get his EB weapon eventually Gir.<br />

Then you really gotta start worrying about him.<br />

With a BoC primary, it's really all you need, but with an aggro'ing secondary weapon, you increase your chances because it could proc before your EB procs. <br />
<br />
You don't *need* to offhand one, but why wouldn't you want too? We have a hard enough time getting aggro as is.<br />
<br />
Get one if you can, if you can't, it's not gonna kill you (but maybe your groupmates hehe).</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't recommend only using BoC, but if that's all you have, then it's fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer some questions, the main reason I was wondering whether I could get away with a non-proceer in offhand was vanity. Me just getting tired of the same old CHoS being wielded in some form or another by myself for so long ;)<br />
<br />
Although it's a mosst point, I'm giving up on the warrior for a few months. Hopefully they'll fix the class by then, and if they don't, great - I can cancel my 2 accounts and move on to WoW which should be out by then.<br />
<br />
What sucks is that warrior was the class I've had the most FUN with (played a 65 cleric, 54 wizzie, a bunch of classes to 40 like pally, sk, shaman etc). But it just gets so frustrating playing your heart out to get 7, 8k hp only to see everyone BUT you tanking. When grouping, you know everyone is holding back on dps and whatnot. When they get agro they look embarassed and politely apologize, and you *know* it wouldn't be a problem with a knight and they're just being polite by not saying it but everyone is thinking it. Like I'm a fucking invalid or something.<br />
<br />
I'm just ranting, don't mind me. See you in a month or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agro is like PP , or HP , you will NEVER NEVER have enough of it.<br />
(Well you get the idea).<br />
While it is true after a certain point more agro will not be needed,<br />
this situation is very very rare (not tanking mostly).<br />
<br />
Looking at your magelo i think its safe to say you are OK agro wise for a LOOON TIME.<br />
(See elemental planes with the current combo).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the offhander goes I don't think a second agro proc is essential with a BoC.  I was using red epic offhand until I picked up a 16/19 with a DD proc which I had grabbed to use when not tanking, but found that the added DPS in the offhand was more use to me tanking than the occasional offhand proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">atm i wield BOC with Copper hammer and i have noticed some things. Most importantly is that BoC dont proc that much. This meaning i cant count on having boc proc on mobs before ppl assists. Main problem here is that ppl are used to gruop with knights who have instant mad agro. <br />
<br />
Secondly i loose agro with this combination. There are many reasons for using agro. wizy overnuking, cleric healing badly, slows etc, etc, etc, etc. All warriors probably knows this. Example when cleric is super over mana conservant and let you stand at 25 % hp and engage CH after incomming there is no way of holding agro. <br />
<br />
However in theese situations i often got agro back by copper hammer proc before BOC proc. I dont have any numbers of how many times i gained agro back by Taunt or BoC or Copper hammer. <br />
<br />
In my opinion you need all the help you need for getting agro back (holding it dosnt seem to be too much of a problem), so i would suggest getting agro weapons in both hands. <br />
<br />
And about group vs raid tanking. It seem harder to me to hold agro on groups than on raids. On raids ppl in general seem more disciplined on holding back abit becuase they know how crucial it is that the warrior have agro to suceed where in groups ppl seem to go full damage from start so the agro number counter will be much more tight in a group situation and therefore much more easy for warrior to loose agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BOC does not have a &quot;streaky&quot; proc rate!  Well, not any more than any other weapon.  It is exactly the same as 99.9% of the weapons in EQ.  Good lord I'm tired of reading crap people post about proc rates with absolutely no parsing to back it up. <br />
<br />
You can't determine a weapon's proc rate without parsing, so please stop posting about it if you haven't parsed.  <br />
<br />
To answer the original question, BoC is more than adequate for aggro in exp groups.  An offhand proc is nice, but you don't need to break your neck getting one if you have a BoC.  Holding aggro is more than procs.  I did three LDoN adventures using a WMBS with no proc and held aggro 90% of the time over the other warrior in the group using an exiled whip and bloodfrenzy offhand (I was MA and he wasn't trying to get aggro).  <br />
<br />
I used BoC/primal for a long time, and if you can't hold aggro with that, then either you or someone in your group is sucking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togr</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always aim higher than you can think<br />
<br />
Here are some relatively easy ways for you to upgrade<br />
<br />
Strength of the Elements (100hps shoulder)<br />
Shaderock Amulet (100hps neck)<br />
Executioner Trial (+10hps to your charm, 1AA)<br />
PoS minis for BoT Key (+10hps to your charm, 1AA)<br />
<br />
The last is probably the hardest, you can get the bone/beard/sash/head with one group, you prolly need 2-3 groups to gather the medallions from minis or just be in zone xping and hope someone shouts in zone when some might be rotting<br />
<br />
Also, get stat food, Grobb for drink and Halas for food would net you 11STA and 30HPs<br />
<br />
BTW, I love my BoC/SoD combo, you can never have too much agro (especially since you don't raid).  More agro lets your DPS crank it up more.  This means that in a set playing time you can fit in an extra adventure or finish off an extra AA.</div></div><hr />

--------<br />
<br />
The truth in the above statement is somehow one sided. The part about the one in your group sucking or not if not counting noobs is about knowing how to hold back and balancing exactly how much you have to hold back not to overagro. <br />
<br />
By pure logic not parsing anything i would say going for absolutely best possible agro and thereby reducing group members holding back not to overagro should increase group dps and therefore be a better solution.<br />
<br />
Btw not saying that the mentioned combination is bad or anything.</div></div><hr />
