<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been farming Everfrost quite a bit lately and I'm considering getting the Malevolent Greaves of Suffering. The main reason is because of the slots for augmentation. Is +8% dodge aug worth getting? Can it be compared to some level of lightning reflexes AA for example?<br />
<br />
My guild is pre-VT and just starting into Ssra and AoW. So the question is are the Malevolent greaves enough of an upgrade to my Fierce Heraldic for me to spend the points on?<br />

Of course you could also put vengence or other things into that slot 3.  Depends on what you want most tanking power or dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm all about more tanking power, as MT for my guild anything I can do to make everyone else's job easier I want to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">someone said the 8% dodge aug was basically worthless, said the when parsed it was hard to tell if you even had the augment on . . .  anyone care to clarify or better yet post some parses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each skill mod, dodge, parry, riposte, etc when parsed by itself makes a very small difference in the stats of the parse (there is a difference, it's just hard to see and takes a ton of parsing to see it and remove the statistical variance).  But combined, they do make a noticable difference.  This means combining different skill mods, because mods of the same skill do not stack.<br />
<br />
That said, I can't tell you that aug'ing your items with defensive skill mods will gain you more damage mitigation than you would gain by simply aug'ing your items with AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can put AC or Stam or hps into that slot, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In type 3 you can only put a neat effect . . .<br />
<br />
veng III or IV , dodge 8%, regen V, AoB etc.<br />
<br />
In type 2 you can put hp aug (either +40, +30, +20 hp)<br />
<br />
In type 1 you can only put basically the /all augments, i have yet to see any augment that are purly type 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
So for an Ldon BP<br />
<br />
type 1:  stamina +10 (or what ever stat you need help in)<br />
type 2:  hp +40<br />
type 3:  (pick you effect)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh but staying in the &quot;pure&quot; LDoN universe all you get is +Dodge.  There are no +parry, riposte, taunt etc all.<br />
<br />
I'm still buying + dodge when I can though ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For type 1 augments, only shoulders, neck, face, belt, and cloak can get the useful 10 AC augment (brilliant blood ruby of prowess)<br />
All other slots will have to use either a plus 6 any aug from a dungeon drop, or a plus 10 to a stat from a merchant that costs like 350 points.  Or I think there are some small saves that are sold by the merchants too.  But in the end, the type one augment slot is... somewhat useless, unless you are looking for a particular stat.  (Like I am going with Cha for mine.)</div></div><hr />
