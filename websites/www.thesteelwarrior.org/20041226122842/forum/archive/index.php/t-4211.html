Warriors haven't been broken. They just claim that knights have been made far superior tanks to them in exp groups (where 80% of Warriors spend most of their time). Warriors aren't broken by the normal meaning of the term, it's just that knights were actually made a viable choice for tank in exp groups and now Warriors are angry that their monopoly is broken up.<br />
<br />
Remember, Paladins and Shadow Knights went through this for the first three expansions (and a bunch of misconceptions about them still prevaided through Luclin).<br />

Warriors are ONE-TRICK PONIES. Knights can do their job just as well now (outside of raids) plus they have a whole slew of other things to bring to the table. Very few people would take a warrior over a knight now days and Warriors, some of whom spent a -long- time on their characters, are rightfully upset.<br />

Just issues of warriors pissed because knights can do the job now. They liked the hole pigeon spot of no one going anywhere without them. Ya well just like clerics and enchanters going the way of the dodoo bird with beign the ONLY one to do things they are too. Suck it up you pansys.<br />

Biggest problem with Warriors?<br />
The rest of the EQ players got used to playing behind Knights, got lazy, and cant cope with letting a warrior build up just a tiny bit of aggro to make it through the fight.<br />
<br />
Shoulda seen it comin...<br />

I understand the problem with warriors. All too well, because if a warrior is tanking for my group, I have to play with agro finetuning on and on an on. One tiny miscalculation and I'm summoned and often dead. If a Pally or SK is tanking, then I can relax a bit. <br />
I still need to watch agro, and no I can NOT nuke with impunity, but I can do a lot more damage than I can with warrior tanking. So there is no question, I always prefer a pally or sk tank for exp groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors definitly have problems. They are upset, but so are the people who group with them. In my own self interest I want warriors' agro fixed.<br />
<br />
I confess, I dont quite understand how monks and rogues enter into the picture. Perhaps someone could explain.<br />

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
   A warrior is less efficient than knights and as a result a groups kill rate goes down when a warrior is the tank. In other words groups can't do as much as fast with a warrior tanking as they can when a knight is tanking.<br />
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
EXACTLY! It's not a class issue. Warriors are fine! It's the players that &quot;must&quot; have a knight so that they can grind fasterfasterfaster and moremoremore!<br />
<br />
I don't care if it's a pally, sk or warr that is tanking. Just keep that mob over there and I'll be over here thankyouverymuch. So what if that other group gets to kill 2 more things in an hour? Big deal!<br />

All this has been debated before ad nauseum and the general consensus remains that the warrior package no longer provides 'enough' to the player or group in relation to other tanks. Even SoE has now seemingly accepted this. <br />
All the furor now is about how any change should be implemented.<br />
