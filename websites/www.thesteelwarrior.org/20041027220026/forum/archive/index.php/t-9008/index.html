Anyway we just got into Qvic and it seems that there aren't a lot of non-visible slots available. <br />
I know which items i was going to pick up for the visible slots, but for the non-vis  my current upgrade wishlist are raex face, bert collar, raex cloak/quarm cloak. <br />
<br />
however im not sure how much longer we will be farming time for. so is there anything worth holding out for for those slots in qvic and upwards? or stick it out and hope for the time drops?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

The neck off of Cyno (Glowing Spiritstone Necklace) is nice, but doesn't have shielding like bert or inny neck.  There is a nice cloak off of Cyno as well, can't recall the name.  As for mask, the only one that comes to mind is from the Garden Event in Txevu, so that would be out of the question for now.<br />
I'd say go for Cyno neck/cloak personally, that event is incredibly easy for the rewards, and he's up more often ;)  Visor of the Berzerker/Veil of Infernos are still both better then the Txevu mask imo.</div></div><hr />

cyno cloak (shroud of corruption) is asstastic, and your rogues will snip your balls off if you touch cyno neck (glowing spiritstone necklace) more than likely.  get inno neck or bert neck, rz cloak or quarm cloak...or hold out for inktuta -- stained threadbare cape, whispering amice, cerulean painted veil, effigy of kelekdrix etc.</div></div><hr />

Whispering Amice. I wasn't aware this was going to drop and didn't plan in advance. It's also possible to get a reasonably good belt and range item outside of PoTime. IMO, the &quot;must have&quot; accessories from PoTime are mask, neck, cloak and possibly Quarm ring and earring.<br />

<br />
just out of interest, and so i dont burn up all my dkp on the first muramite boots that drop :), how many mould drops do you get in a nights clear of qvic? assuming all the nameds are up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, if you hit Qvic twice a day you could get 4 items if you were lucky.<br />
<br />
Example: 4 helms or 4 boots or 4 HP Augs from Dvion. 4 bracers or 4 HP augs from Ptav. 4 arms or 4 gloves or 4 MANA (bleh) from Mnat.<br />
<br />
So if you are going to clear it once a night Dvion can drop boots/helm/HP. Ptav can drop bracers/HP and Mnat can drop arms/gloves/MANA. Each mob has 2 drops which can be any combo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A Usual Run through Qvic on our way to Txevu or Inktuta results in 1-6ish molds. The 3 Mshas , Cyno , and Zoo (Cyno and Zoo both can drop molds). The cloak off Cyno (Shroud of Disruption)  and the earring off Zoo (Prism of dark hues) are both on my wish list. There is a good variety of gear that drops in this zone that are wonderful upgrades. Unfortunately last clearing before Txevu of the 3 Mshas resulted in 4 90 mana augs and 2 90 hp augs....=/. Double aug drops off the Mshas are very common. <br />
