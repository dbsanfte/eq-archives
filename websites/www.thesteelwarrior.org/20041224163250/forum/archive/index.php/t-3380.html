You can rely on multiple classes do dish damage instead of just one.  Multiple classes can go fetch instead of just one.<br />

Its better today than it was &quot;yesterday&quot; but not perfect.  Most of the classes are content with their interaction with the monsters and with other classes.  Do you think its unbalanced because you are unhappy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know that warriors with under 4k hp were now the authority of end game class balance. Honestly, don't relay what other people say, because you have no clue. I don't post about how low tier warriors are unbalanced, because I wouldn't know about it.<br />
<br />
However the endgame is by far the most balanced, compared to you guys with agro problems, a warrior with a blade of war (or two potime 1handers) can hold agro just fine. Sure pallies are a little bit better, but for exp groups endgame warriors can lock agro easily, and we're still tanking on raids. Maybe you can explain to me how endgame warriors are unbalanced if you can tear yourself away from exp grinding in dreadlands.<br />
<br />
3. Taunt needs fixed  <br />
<br />
/shrug I only seem to need to taunt before breaking mezzes. Sure it may take a couple tries, but after a couple rounds of melee agro isn't an issue. To make up for not having instant agro lock like knights we gain the ability to tank on hard ldon encounters. I'd imagine a paladin tanking a 1300 hitter in a six man group would be pretty exciting.<br />
<br />
So from my point of view, with 270something aa and a blade of war, our class is perfectly balanced. Now if you want to say low tier warriors are unbalanced, go for it, I won't dispute it. But don't talk about things you don't experience first hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's an entirely different issue, this thread is about warrior's balance in relation to paladins. The issue you're thinking of is melee dps in relation to caster dps. While increased dps will assist with agro, as far as I know they intend to increase all melee dps, so it shouldn't change the balance much between the melee classes.<br />
<br />
In the endgame, the difference between a warrior and a paladin is minimal, with a warrior you gain increased dps and ability to tank bosses on hard. With a paladin you get faster agro lock and some backup healing. Ask any time equipped warrior if he feels underpowered, their responces will be similar to mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, my charecter can only get more powerful and yet I'm still edging on being overpowered. Besides that, I group with people from the local time guild all the time, and none of their warriors have agro issues either. I really havnt seen any warrior with a blade of war, 9500hp and 200+ aa complain about agro, have you? And that's not even that powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
and in responce to<br />
So just because I'm not there I don't see the problems that ARE there? You're wrong in saying so. <br />
<br />
You can see the problems are there? Do you regularly group with warriors from time guilds or something? Tell me what you see, because just speaking from personal experience; I have no problems getting groups, no problems holding agro, and my dps is on par with time equipped monks. And the warriors with darkblades and EoE have it easier than I do.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, as far as I can recall i've never posted saying that low end warriors are balanced. Sure i've taken pot shots at some people for using lammy and frostbringer, when you could buy better weapons in bazaar for next to nothing. But other than that I've always believed that warriors were underpowered UNTIL they got dual EB or superior.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering how you can justify that a warrior with 10500hp, ~220dps, and two to five agro procs is less powerful in comparison to a paladin than a low tier warrior that can't hold agro, and has low dps. /boggle</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine when the Paladin has 9700hp, ~190dps, has no need for aggro procs, and can pump out heals on the order of 9k in direct heals or 21k in group heals (assuming a 4k mana pool and using either touch of nife or wave of marr) before going oom  that some people might consider this pretty powerful indeed.  Some might even consider it more powerful than the Warrior.  And this isn't even considering if they're fighting undead or using LoH. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Post #7: Furor (I apologize in advance if he takes offense to my quoting him...)<br />
<br />
Frankly, the stupidity needs to end. I feel like a fucking piece of shit on raids, especially LDoN raids where my aggro is goddamn near worthless and mobs hop from player to player mem blurring themselves non stop and assraping the civilians. Some of these raids scream USE KNIGHTS TO TANK DUMBASS... and we do. It's just fucking frustrating being sidelined with 11k hps and 2300 ac because I have zero aggro control and initial heals generally result in a fucking catastrophe if I'm not lucky on proc rolls. <br />
<br />
so.....there is at least one Plane of Time warrior (who actually is in PoT) that is also probably on the bleedingest edge of EQ saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
You asked for an example there it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, I would rather champion Furor who is time enabled and is very angry at warriors inability to have aggro on demand like SK/Pal and end game balance compared to other tank classes.<br />
<br />
Same with previous post....I'm going to use Furor quotes here, as it pretty much sums up some valid points.<br />
<br />
&quot;it's a simple fact, the 3 Tank classes are severly imbalanced. The fact that you cannot understand the utility of a Paladin or a Shadowknight, the gross imbalance of AA's and Gear available to a Hybrid Tank, and the min/maxing that happens on a daily basis due to the resultant mudflation causing Warriors to take a back seat in 95% of the gameworld, doesn't mean it doesn't exist...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Hybrid tank pays no penalties for the power they reap. The gap between the hybrid tank and their parent classe(s) has reached unacceptable levels&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give Warriors Fearless, give warriors aggro on demand, give warriors natural HP and AC bonuses to all of the gear they can wear/use. Conversely give Knights a large penalty to any item that is listed as WAR useable but also PAL SHD useable. Nerf their taunting ability entirely and tie it in soley to their ability to press 'taunt.'&quot;<br />
<br />
--- End of Quotes<br />
<br />
This is the consensus i've known....not sure what server Daddio plays on or what time enabled warriors he's getting his info from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is definately a problem I have seen all too often, fighting amongst ourselves, insulting, bickering, slandering.<br />
<br />
With all the high end warriors posting their experiences with end-game content its easy for the lower teir warriors to know what really goes on at that stage.  I suggest you read more of the board, do some research.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  Im not sure how you hold aggro with your BoC in primary past tier2 PoP.  The 1-2 procs a minute that thing puts out will only garauntee you will loose aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify my whole point, SoE has a role set out for paladins and it seems they are intended to have a tanking role on raids. Just because they have a tanking role doesn't mean we're unbalanced. We're supposed to have inferior agro capabilities than knights (SK's were given direct agro spells, I think it's a safe assumption.) We're supposed to make up for it with superior tanking, NOT superior agro. <br />
<br />
This is why threads like this always irk me. If warriors have great agro and great tanking, knights lose their role.  This is clearly not going to happen without some serious modifications. Because if they balance warrior agro, knights as a whole become unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Whether or not we need an increase in mitigation should be the debate here. Personally I'd love to have a mitigation increase as it would let paladins keep their role (MA, offtank) and warriors keep theirs (MT) I can't really think of a good second use for a warrior, maybe that's where our class is lacking. Personally I'd be in favor of a pure melee dps increase. But I hope this clarification has shown you the other side of the issue at hand.<br />
<br />
I'm not the bad guy here, but I do have a different way of looking at things. I'm just trying to show the big picture.<br />

Reflagging recruits for time last night, we did Rathe.<br />
<br />
One of our newer warrior(esses) using a BoC main and Jaelins offhand had no problems whatsoever keeping aggro, including pull aggro to place that rathe council member to its appointed mez location.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, I love aggro and know its value, but a boc can be used for aggro on most encounters in EQ effectively.<br />
<br />
PS with anger 3 augmented Bloodfrenzy, BoC offhand, and +5 combat effects, from some short parses, Im averaging around 7 procs a minute (some of which are 300 hate instead of 700).<br />

Estimating 2 of the 7 procs are for 300 and 5 for 700, thats 4100 extra hate a minute, or nearly 70 hate a second from procs alone.</div></div><hr />

The point is SOE should have a role set out for warriors also. Our role has been mudded. I would recommend to you the previous posts admonition; that is read these boards. Has it occurred to you that we are the parent tanking class? I would argue with anyone that thinks a hybrid class should be the best at both worlds. The price hybrids pay having both worlds would suggest that, but in actual game play this is not the case.<br />

I would be careful categorizing your broad statements as the consensus of warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fully aware that we're the parent tanking class, and that's why we should be able to TANK &lt;--read this word. To tank is to mitigate damage the best, currently we do, undisputed. As a weakness for being able to tank the best, we have weaker agro control. Knights have better agro control, but are weaker at tanking. <br />
<br />
This is where the balance lies, the advantage of our mitigation has to equal the disadvantage of our weaker agro. Does it currently? Probably not, but our class is not as underpowered as you make it out to be.<br />
<br />
If paladins can't tank, they can't do anything. Every class needs a PRIMARY role on raids, you take tanking away and knights have nothing, they might aswell all re-roll as clerics because there's no point in bringing them on raids.<br />
<br />
In actual gameplay people want the most efficient class for their groups. If warriors can instantly lock agro AND tank better, who the hell is going to group a knight?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being unmatched in our ability to survive the most brutal battles doesn't mean much unless we can also make ourselves the focus of all our enemies' attacks.<br />
<br />
The actual survivability gap is small enough that it isn't a major issue for Knights. But the aggro ability gap in their favor is huge. It's so overwhelming that they don't even bother to wield aggro weapons although they can. Imagine Warriors having so many HP's that they didn't have to concider HP's when selecting armor and accessories - its the same deal.<br />
<br />
All Warriors have as assets are survivability, aggro ability, and DPS. All Knights have are survivability, aggro ability, DPS, and spellcasting.<br />
<br />
It should not be a case of &quot;knights lose their role&quot; if we have competative aggro abilities. That role they are dominating in experance groups is the Warrior Class Description. They are tanks and they should get to MT as often as the opprotunity presents itself. But they shouldn't own it - it is not &quot;their role&quot;.<br />
<br />
Giving Warriors snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro would only balance our classes a little. Lizard on a Stick! With all their spells and virtually identical tanking ability you think an equal shot at MTing in groups and a stranglehold on offtanking was a horrible position to be in - Kunark all over again - phhhht.<br />

You're assuming we can't get agro at all, we can, just not as quickly. If warrior agro capabilities = knight capabilities AND warrior tanking &gt; knight tanking; the little paladin heals are all they have going for them, and that's hardly giving them class utility.<br />

Besides, our disciplines make up for their ability to heal, utility wise. The fact that they can lock agro at a range, and we can lock it after five seconds of combat is hardly as dire as you make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That may only be 4 things, but it's still 2 more than a war as SA: dps, offtanking.<br />
<br />
Or a necro for that matter: mana pump.<br />
<br />
Or a ranger: dps, snare once in a while.<br />
<br />
Or a modern day monk who's only use: subpar dps.<br />
<br />
So why do pally's need to be MT also? Seems they already have more than enough to do opposed to other classes.  And seriously, who in their right mind can honestly say they created a fucking pally to be the MT on raids!  What did they think the WARRIOR class was for!  And they sure as hell were never meant to have superior aggro capabilities to warriors, nor did anyone creating a pally do so because they just somehow knew stun would give them superior aggro over warriors.  How anyone can say knights deserve a spot next to warrior's as MT, and that's how it's supposed to be, is simply out of their damn mind.<br />
<br />
Sorry knights, but if you think you deserve to MT then you need to re-roll as the class that was originally built to MT, the WARRIOR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question about the hard single group encounters. All the named hit for 1350 and if you do a hard one without a mezzer; defensive, aetaunt and rampage work well to control the large pulls. We can also hit evasive and keep it up for a few pulls to conserve cleric mana etc. There's plenty of opportunites to use discs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, I'm doing Normal LDoN encounters and generally avoid the Kill Bob (Bob doesn't drop anything) scenario as are probably 90% of the people on my server. In my experiance,  a pacifier chills out the next room or if thing go bad hits us with 2-5 mobs. CC chills them out while I tank one (which they leave entirely alone until things are well under control).<br />
<br />
Not being willing to kill the Enchanter, I taunt the next mob and wait for my taunt button to pop back up before attacking.<br />
<br />
How it all works is the source of Warrior problems in LDoN. I can't really help out on CC with Root like a Paladin. If the Cleric DA's, I can't toss a Stun at the mob that's taken an interest in the Enchanter. Someone casts a spell on the mob I'm tanking before the room is full under control and we've got a couple running around loose.<br />
<br />
An when we go to kill the mezzed mobs, I have to wait 6 seconds after the first taunt for it to be available again (cause I don't know if it actually did anything when I hit it) so the mob doesn't run over to the Mezzer when I attack.<br />
<br />
Some of the Paladin utility you dismiss is very valuable to groups. And my difficient aggro control is source of regular irratation to them.<br />
<br />
At the moment, on my server, there is never more than one experiance group in either PoFire or PoEarth. So, I'm talking about how things are where people are playing, Mobs aren't hitting for 1300-2000 and any advantages a Warrior might have are neglegible.<br />

Well ya know daddio, if you look at it that way, then there sure as hell isn't a reason to bring more than 3 or maybe 4 warriors on any raid either, usually not more than 2.   Guess the warriors who aren't MT'ing should reroll as well ?<br />
<br />
The fact that they can lock agro at a range, and we can lock it after five seconds of combat<br />
<br />
Strange.  I spoke with a couple of warriors in our server's PoT guild, and when I asked them if they could consider agro &quot;locked&quot; in 5 seconds in any number of a reasonable percentage of times, they just laughed.  <br />
<br />
defensive is on par with complete heal for one of the most powerful abilities in the game<br />
<br />
Sure it's a powerful ability, with a 10 minute timer on it.  How ya think clerics would feel if you put that timer on CH ?<br />
<br />
This is where the balance lies, the advantage of our mitigation has to equal the disadvantage of our weaker agro. Does it currently? Probably not<br />
<br />
Not even remotely fucking close.<br />
<br />
You can blab all you want about the &quot;high end&quot; raiding warriors doing time bosses, but that's what, maybe 1 percent of warriors out there ??  Never mind the fact that many many more of those same warriors, even those far beyond you, disagree with you than agree with you.

Count me in, someone clearly doesnt fully understand what an Agro Lock is.<br />
Everytime we have a knight tank a mob, I nuke a little bit faster on my wiz, and a little less concussion.. and when I get to parse my dps, I am stunned how large the difference between knight and warrior agro is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys are picking apart some minor issues, but hardly concentrating on the topic. <br />
<br />
This thread isn't about warriors under 45. Some 50ish warrior said that the high end was the least balanced. It's hard to think that a class whose entire effectiveness relies upon the gear that they possess, becomes less powerful as their gear improves.<br />
<br />
Warriors have been holding agro for four years of everquest, and just now that somebody can control agro better than us you suddenly think that we can't control it at all. It's simply not true. If you could link me a guild that uses paladins exclusively as main tanks, and is successful doing so, then I guess our class is doomed. <br />
<br />
However for all the boss mobs, warriors are still used all the time, even if our entire class balance relies upon our three minutes of glory, for those three minutes we're less likely to die than any paladin, and after those three minutes are over, we're still better equipped to do the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No daddio, you're the one who's not getting the topic.  <br />
<br />
It's hard to think that a class whose entire effectiveness relies upon the gear that they possess, becomes less powerful as their gear improves<br />
<br />
That would be because the gear of the competing classes, knights, has had a greater increase in proportion.  Not really a difficult concept to grasp.<br />
<br />
You're right, warriors have survived with their shitty agro capabilities for 4 years now.  We had to.  Pallys have always had awesome agro, but until luclin came out, they didn't have near our gear/HP/AC.   As a result, warriors were the tanks in a group.  You'd have an SK or pally tanking from time to time, but only the better equipped ones *exp grps only obviously; bosses were always the domain of the warrior MT*<br />
<br />
However, since that time, their HP/AC have closed the gap with that of the warrior.   With easy &quot;fixes&quot; for sony such as all/all gear, knights now have damn near the same AC as warriors.  Take say a human knight, and a human warrior, both wearing the human cultural armours, and they'll have virtually identical ac, with the warrior having more HP.  However, now add in the fact that the pally can also use a shield while MT, for another big chunk of HP/AC, while the warrior has to use a 2nd weapon to keep his already slim agro hopes alive.  When I started gearing up in my cultural gear *barb helanic tundra*, our guild had a pally the same lvl as me, who actually had more AC in his cultural gear... most of our gear was identical, plus he had the shield bonus.<br />
<br />
This all results in the fact that pallys now make more than capable tanks for virtually any exp grp situation.  While some ppl say it's not realistic, I'm going to ignore the MT situation on raids. This is because raiding boss mobs that require defensive effects less than 1% of warriors over lvl 45 *which is the only place that lvl 45 was mentioned, daddio*.  <br />
<br />
By comparison, our agro capabilities have not increased whatsoever.   We still rely on our gear, and the fickle bitch known as the RNG.  The only hope a warrior has of getting decent agro is by using EB weapons.  The CHoS and SotB have been recent attempts by Sony to alleviate that fact.   While they are definitely a nice step, they are not a cure.  And previous to those weapons, if you didn't have EB, you didn't have shit.  I tried it all.. wavecrasher, frosty, fleshgrinder, you name it... When I finally got my BoC, it was a night and day difference.<br />
<br />
So now, we have knights approaching our tanking capability, while our agro is still vast strides behind theirs.  THIS is what has gotten people so pissed off.  THIS is why the majority of nukers and slowers and DPS would rather have a knight over a warrior.  Our tanking advantage does NOT equal the knight's agro advantage.  And so while some people are calling for a nerf on knights *it sure doesn't help their cause when asswipes like ariokk spout off*, the majority of people would rather see warrior's agro capability increased to close the gap in overall tanking *agro + tanking ability* with that of the knights.<br />
<br />
Now are you getting the picture ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Daddio's difficulty in grasping the situation is he's probably surrounded by people that actually know how to manage their aggro which in turn gives him the idea that warrior aggro owns.  Add to that he has a BoW which 99% of us don't.  <br />
But for the rest of us that still suffer from having to aa grind in pickup groups with rangers using their damn cof stun buff and bst's using their lousy slow claw our aggro is pure shit.  Healers easily use twice the mana healing others in the group with a warrior mt as opposed to a knight mt.  I simply can't belive people still don't get this whole issue, it's truly mind boggling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors everywhere else are surrounded by idiots and nincompoops (with a few talented people mixed in) who just want AAs/Levels as fast as possible.  Knights thrive in these areas, especially the knight alts of some 65 person who got bored of the high end and thought after watching knights tank they knew everything there was to tanking.<br />
<br />
This is a huge difference.  I tell my friends all the time, all the good and talented people are in Tier 3+, while we're down here in PoV using a 61 SK tank who has 2700hp or less unbuffed and uses his 65 cleric bot to help kill...and gets a monk to replace him when he leaves.  And there are actually people who wonder why others complain about the ease of leveling with Knight agro and PoP...<br />

We seem to agree on the same point, warriors have dealt with weaker agro capabilities than knights for four years. What we need is increased mitigation to make us more desirable.<br />
<br />
Our agro capabilites havn't changed, knight's agro capabilities havn't changed. What's changed is knights are a lot closer to our tanking abilites than they used to be. So that's what needs to be fixed, we don't need any new taunt gimmick, we need to be able to mitigate well enough to make up for our weaker agro control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most warriors agree, yes we do need added mitigation to seperate us from Knights. But How much would be required to make a difference? <br />
<br />
Right now, lets just assume that a 'AVERAGE' Fully Buffed Warrior is at some value of HP's lets just say 7500. I know many have a lot more.  And in the same comparable gear the average Paladin will be at what?  6750? so we have a 10% advantage. <br />
<br />
It has been 'claimed' by paladins, I tend to disagree, that we 'mitigate' 10% better. So if a 10% more HP's and 10% better Mitigation is not enough? What is? Should we have Perma defensive? is that too much? <br />
<br />
Considering that is ALWAYS the paladin argument that 'You have Defensive, so leave us our aggro' I would assume that to mean that Paladins would accept warriors having a permament defensive? Personally I think thats too much, but do we really think that increasing our hp/mitigation gap over knights will make a difference? <br />
<br />
The answer is NO.. for the average player it will not. The reason I will explain after the next point..<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Daddio <br />

<br />
Well you are partially correct here. Our 'triggered' aggro has not changed one bit, at least since AoE Taunt was introduced. We 'mash buttons and pray!' At the high end, our secondary aggro has increased with the higher dps weapons, BoW is great aggro not only because of EB but it is good dps, the combined effect makes it a great aggro weapon. <br />
<br />
Overall, the effect of added dps is reduced because while warrior dps has gone up slightly, every OTHER class has had an even greater increase in 'average' dps. Now BoW is not standard warrior equipment, most warriors use older weapons for aggro that dont have the higher dps that PoP weapons have and thuse the 'AVERAGE' warrior aggro generation has actually DECREASED.<br />
<br />
The scond part of your statement is however completely false. How many new Spells have been introduced that are good aggro? Stuns? FAST Heals? Group Heals? Aggro Spells? these new spells dont increase a knighst aggro capabilities? While a whole slew of new spells have been added to boost knight aggro generation, that wasnt enough... <br />
<br />
Lets look at the increase in Knight MANA capacity. The Mana pool of Knights has increased easilly doubled  since PoP was released. All this extra mana doesnt help knights generate aggro? What about the now INSANE amount of mana regen spells in the game? When was the last time you honestly saw a pally say, hold pulls I am OOM? <br />
<br />
So, Warrior aggro generation has stayed essentially the same or even decreased relative to all other classes, while knight aggro generation has increased.<br />
<br />
Now lets go back to the mitigation point. Remember when I said that even giving warriors HUGE increases in mitigation and Hp's wouldn't solve the problem. Let me explain why.<br />
<br />
First is the exp differential. Planes of Power with the INSANE exp bonus in zones made 95% of the game just not 'good' enough to group in to get experience. No other expansion ever had such a drastic increase in exp value. This made for an enviornment where no one wanted to go anywhere but PoP for experience.<br />
<br />
Secondly, PoP mobs were created on a new 'design model' Very high DPS, relatively Very low Hp's. The low HP's mean for faster kills, even more exp bonus.<br />
<br />
This HIGH DPS is what made the aggro disparity evident. Because of the high dps, SLOWING a mob is imperitive, the faster the better, slow is huge aggro so the slowers were getting eaten, also a lot of pop mobs have good resists so need debuffs, debuffers were getting eaten, Healing the people causes huge aggro, healers were getting eaten, large damage/dps caused overaggro, casters were getting eaten.... <br />
<br />
Do we see a pattern here? So in pops JohnyCockSure SuckAss_paladin_01.. He says, let me stun the mob a few times so you can slow... so he starts casting stuns on mobs, slowers slow on inc, debuffers debuff, healers sit and med, since mob is stunned/slowed/debuffed and has not even made it to camp yet... Casters nuke, Dps goes all out, and the warrior tries in vane to pull aggro from the paladin and fails... <br />
<br />
A couple mobs latter after the warrior still hasnt pulled aggro and no one besides the paladin is being hit... the warrior sees this message on his screen..<br />
&quot;You have been removed from the group&quot; <br />
followed shortly by, <br />
JohnyCockSure says in out of character,&quot;Awesome EXP group seeks DPS class! PST!&quot;<br />
<br />
So let us say we increase warrior hps/mitigation so that we are head and shoulders above knights. What does that change? Since the aggro generation is not there, No slow on incomming, no debuff, dps must wait, when the cleric DOES finally heal, he will get aggro so now cleric is being beat on by an unslowed mob, the slower tries to slow gets resisted so the mob jumps the slower, dps starta ttacking, pull aggro from the warrior who FINALLY pulled it from the slower with a good taunt, so now the wizard is getting beat up, while the warrior counts down 6...5...4...3..2..TAUNT! and more than likely.. FAIL! ..6..5..4..3..2..TAUNT! TAUNT! TAUNT! <br />
<br />
Valiant_Warrior_01 says in OOC, &quot;GAH! God damned taunt work!&quot;<br />
JohnyCockSure says in out of character,&quot;65 pally LFG! PST!!&quot;<br />
followed shortly by... <br />
&quot;You have been removed from the group&quot; <br />
followed shortly by, <br />
Cleric_01 says in out of character,&quot;Pally to Inner!&quot;<br />

Wizard_02 says in out of character,&quot;Pally to RC!&quot;<br />
Enchanter_01 says in out of character,&quot;Pally to Outer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Increasing warrior mitigation will do absoloutely nothing for warriors in an EXP PoP situation... If we cant keep aggro reliablely as it is then why would it help if we have better mitigation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daddio, we are not using knights exclusivly as tanks, but that Paladin with 9007 hp buffed tanking Fennin Ro Tyrant of Fire (nope, we are not in time and he has no time loot, he was not tanking &quot;outdated&quot; content for us) for 5 minutes without dieing (and doubling my wizard's DPS mind you) showed me how it really is.<br />
Warrior pride is the only reason we dont use knight tanks on raid bosses left.</div></div><hr />

When i said knight/warrior agro hadn't changed I meant they hadn't changed much in relation to eachother. With the new pally stuns and fast heals, we've gotten some really nice agro weapons that are easiliy accessable, and some really nice EB weapons. <br />
<br />
All those weapons are war/knight/BARD/RANGER capable.<br />
<br />
With exception to Hategiver I think which is War only.<br />

<br />
When verant said that direct hate procs were only going to be a temporary fix, they didn't have anything else in mind to help warriors with agro. When SoE took over they seemed to embrace the warrior hate weapon idea. <br />
<br />
Direct hate has been a reoccuring theme throughout the last four expansions, it's a little to late now to say they were just meant as a temporary fix. Besides that, most guilds give the high agro weapons to their warriors first, so it's a lot easier for us to get items like blade of war etc.</div></div><hr />

They have been saying it was a temporary fix for years now. It's not like this is some new excuse that they've come up with. If it was, you might have a point, but it's not.<br />
<br />
you're also competely wrong when you suggest that SOE abandoned the idea that hate weapons were a temporary fix. That is not true. In fact as recently as 2 or 3 fan faires ago, dev's have publicly admitted that enraging blow is a &quot;temporary fix&quot; and have also expressed dislike for enraging blow, as it supersedes the taunt skill as a way to get and keep aggro.</div></div><hr />

Take away complete heal and you break or seriously screw up the balance of every higher end encounter in the game. There's no known replacement or even idea for replacement for complete heal in the game at this point. In fact, encounters are specifically designed for the use of Cheal.<br />
<br />
Whether they like complete heal or not, they can't remove it from the game at this point. <br />
<br />
Replacing aggro procs is a completely different story.</div></div><hr />

At this point, high agro weapons are just as entrenched as complete heal.<br />
<br />
Any fix to this issue would require a lot of fine tuning to encounters. A mitigation boost would require a bump in mob dps, thereby expanding the tanking gap between warriors and paladins too much. At the same time any agro improvements to warriors would not only bump paladins out of a primary role on raids, but would require exp mobs to gain some special abilities (AE's, unsplittable pulls, etc.) just so that adventures would be almost entertaining.<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the original reason I posted here, as I'm really not qualified to discuss pre-EB, pre-65 warriors.<br />
<br />
1. End game is the most unbalanced.<br />
-Wrong<br />
<br />
2. Making them have the same aggro as warriors won't eliminate them from the LFg thing. <br />
-It will definatly reduce their desirablity, as they won't have any unique tanking role, and clerics don't need backup healing for adventure groups anyway.<br />
<br />
3. Taunt needs fixed (DING DING DING!)<br />
-Taunt itself seems to work fine for me, it's not supposed to generate agro, and it doesn't. We've been able to keep agro with it for years, and we still can today.</div></div><hr />

As for your assertion that you've been able to keep aggro with taunt for years, and you still can today. You're full of it. The very fact that warriors cannot keep aggro with taunt  was the reason why Enraging Blow was put into the game to begin with. It's the very reason why warriors rely on having high hate proccing weapons to keep aggro. They CANNOT keep aggro with taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since lowend_paladin_1 can easily hold agro, then what is the point in looting a blade of war? DPS? Or to have aggro control that's 10% as good as lowend_paladin_1?<br />
<br />
Knight aggro is sooo good that they forego the use of aggro weapons. Warrior aggro is so bad that they eagerly seek them out.<br />
<br />
With Knight survivability not an issue in most of the game they've become Warriors who are not confined to using aggro weapons and can cast spells.<br />
<br />
Giving Warriors near parity in aggro control returns the Warrior/Knight balance issue to Warrior survivability vs Knight Utility.<br />

OMG, can I puke please?  I am not a low end warrior, however I am not a PoT/Elemental equipped warrior either.  Are you seriously saying, that just because I CANNOT play during the times that most of the uber guilds have their set REQUIRED raids do, that I should be relegated to DPS (HAHAHAHA, warrior DPS) in experience groups?  That if I cannot raid PoT/Elementals for the above stated reasons then I am useless?  With your above reasoning, any warrior who CANNOT meet the RAID TIME REQUIREMENTS of the uber guilds (i.e. have different work schedules, etc...) had just better reroll as a paladin then in order to just play the roll that made them choose to be a warrior in the first place.<br />
<br />
Warriors, exist for one reason, and one reason only, revelling in the glory of combat and the kill.  To stand in the FOREFRONT of the battle slaying our enemies with reckless might, skill and courage.  Urging others onward.  Warriors are supposed to be the badassest of the badass at ANY level.  Sorry I will never be able to loot a BoW, guess I had just better reroll as a paladin. OK I AM going to puke now.</div></div><hr />

&quot;High end-low end&quot; I hope he is referring to is a lvl issue.  I.e. a lvl 65 should have better agro utility from their weapons than a lvl 50 (which is ironically not true any way).<br />

<br />
First you get off your soap box, as it's common knowlege to me and everyone here that we know pallys and SK and warriors CAN tank...so quit that stupid line of talk....it's condensending.<br />
<br />
The issue here is as a parent class we are not the preferred tank in many situations.<br />
<br />
Your line of reasoning on aggro generation for warriors can be applied to the hybrids just as well...if they had our ability to aggro they would STILL be able to aggro.<br />
<br />
Did it ever occurr to you that SOE has openly admitted our taunt has issues, suggesting there are some needed changes to be made? That means we need more taunt. Further, our makeup places us at a higher taunt skill than SK or Pally, and NO WHERE has SOE said Pally's/SK should have aggro better than a warrior. That is just a recent line of fodder going around, and wish it would stop. In fact, I would argue that SOE never intended to have SK/Pally have that much aggro. Part of aggro loss was originally SOE intention to cause players to play more intelligently as opposed to unbridled reign of DPS onslaughts. And, I wouldn't be suprised that SOE adjusts spell aggro to remove the 100% dominance of aggro lock the pally/SK have to be more in line with warrior aggro wherever they finish placing that in upcoming balancing.<br />
<br />
I simply will not accept your line of reasoning with a pally losing utility if they lose superiority in tanking, and I mean preferred tanking...not your odd reasoning of tanking soley in mitigation....that's like a 500 hp car without gas in it...goes no where if a cleric has to use tons more mana to heal 3 people in a group because the 20k hp warrior can't keep aggro. It's called tanking efficiency, and that is the sum total of what a cleric/healer uses per mob to keep group alive. BS...pally does DPS just like warrior, and pally has spells UNLIKE a warrior in addition to EVERYTHING a warrior can do.....sorry your line of reasoning suggests that a pally totally throws out the other half of his hybrid nature....spells....unless I am wrong and the ONLY spells paladins have are stun spells for aggro.<br />
<br />
Your fear is a pally will lose it's role....BS...and how ? By making them what we are in at our current condition? Whatever. That's a sorry line of reasoning. That's a &quot;I want my cake and eat it to&quot; whine. Get over it...warriors should be the preferred tank period. The aspect of a hybrid class suggests trade offs...if the pally wants to be the preferred tank then they should have to give up their hybrid nature. Warriors can't solo, can't buff, can't heal, can't run around with a uber horse AA. Our trade off for not having ALL THAT is we should be the PREFERRED tank, and if WE are the preffered tank, I guarantee you your pally isn't going to all of a sudden dry up or not be able to tank in many situations whether they ultimately get properly balanced with aggro generation capabilities.<br />
<br />
Better accept it now, changes are happening with aggro generation - whether warriors get put on par with hybrid classes or SOE adjusts 100% lock from hybrid more in line with warrior or a marrying of the middle ground of the two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
goes no where if a cleric has to use tons more mana to heal 3 people in a group because the 20k hp warrior can't keep aggro. <br />
<br />
So you're saying that despite being able to keep agro for the first four years of everquest, we can no longer keep agro at all? Simply false.<br />
<br />
The way paladin's lose their role if they lose their superior agro is that in Everquest, people always want the best charecter for the job, in raids, in groups, it's all the same. So since warriors already have more hp and defensive disciplines, as soon as we gain equal agro we take all of the paladin's jobs. Warriors are offtanking, MAing, not because paladin's can't do it, but because we're better, at everything; except agro at which we're equal(since you can either hold agro, or you cannot, there is no middleraod)<br />
<br />
I don't know whether low end warriors are underpowered, so don't ask me about it. But speaking from personal experience, I don't really have any agro problems, and the clerics I group with never go oom. So there must be a point where it evens out in the current system, maybe we just need to lower the bar a bit. Just remember that any &quot;fix&quot; always has multiple side-effects. If you're agro fix proposals allows warriors to hold agro while naked(without weapons), agro from a range(without using a bow) then it's hardly rational. We've always relied on our equipment to hold agro and tank, I see no reason to stray from that system. <br />
<br />
Our agro capabilites havn't gotten worse, and yet people are still complaining that they can't hold agro. I don't get it, I'd be open if somebody could explain to me why they can't hold agro. I was able to hold agro fine with BoC and BBoE last night, and those weapons drop from pretty easy old content.</div></div><hr />

And with warriors selling their old BoC's for 125k, it's still out of reach for most.<br />
<br />
The high end warriors who are power-gamers don't have the problem. It's the casual (less than 20 hours a week) gamers who don't have the tools available to make the class work. <br />
<br />
A healer told me today.. &quot;I don't care how many times I have to heal you as long as you can keep agro.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how it SHOULD be with War's and knights.  War's should be the tank of choice in exp groups, while knights can still get the job done if needed, but the way it is now, knights are always the tank of choice in exp groups.  And now they're slowly becoming the tank of choice on raids too.<br />
<br />
Daddio, you are blind if you can't see the warrior class being entirely weeded out of EQ, slowly but surely it's happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there is a middleroad with agro.  The middleroad is the varying amount of agro others can gain without going over you.  It's not 50/50.  If you have it, you can either barely hold it where if people do a little bit more it's gone, or there's no competition.  Knights are the latter, can you guess what warriors are?<br />
<br />
&quot;Never intended&quot; and &quot;don't want&quot; are two separate things.  Skilled English comprehension is good here.  Explain to me how a set of spells added for SKs after Luclin came out means they were always intended to have agro.  They want SKs to have agro abilities now, yes...but that doesn't mean they were always intended, which is what you failed to reply to.  If they always intended, they would have given SKs those abilities from the start, instead of letting the SKs go through Disease Cloud and Shadow Vortex &quot;nerfs&quot; without giving them intended agro abilities.<br />
<br />
So where's the &quot;always intended to have&quot; agro abilities?  Until they decided to go ahead and give SKs specific agro spells, they've nerfed each one used without compensation.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors might have been able to to hold agro in the past, but everyone else hadn't gotten all the upgrades they do now.  Weapons are so much better now.  Every caster class and hybrid class has gotten tremendous upgrades and put out a hell of a lot more agro since PoP came out than the warrior does.  The Beastlord class alone causes agro problems since we can't lose it without completely stopping fighting and we came out in Luclin.  It's not so much a warrior now is worse than a warrior then...but everyone else is leagues better now than they were then.  I'm glad you don't have problems, but you're one person out of hundreds, if not thousands.  For everyone else, to quote a friend of mine:<br />
<br />
Warriors hold agro because everyone else allows them to hold it.<br />
Knights hold agro because they don't allow anyone to take it from them.<br />
Now if the &quot;taking damage&quot; gap between knights and warriors gets smaller and smaller, which one is better?  Which one is more powerful?  Both answers are the same.</div></div><hr />

This is a quote from you, I understand the fragment &quot;because the 20k hp warrior can't keep agro&quot; to mean that the 20k hp warrior can't keep agro.

<br />
The point being that if it is trivial for a cleric to keep a single paladin with 5k hps up in an XP group while gaining the advantage of agro lock where other group members dont need spot heals then a warriors additional hps whether they have 500 hps more or 15000 hps more are redundant compared to the lack of agro control.<br />
<br />
If it is trivial to heal a paladin with 5khps and agro lock is maintained meaning other group members dont need heals, then why have a warrior tank where other group members may draw agro and need additional heals despite that warrior having 6k or even 20k hps.<br />
<br />
thats how I read Dafrog's example anyway... skipped most of the thread though so I might have the wrong end of the stick.</div></div><hr />

Personally with 120 AA, an EB weapon and enough HPs to tank BoT mobs unslowed long enough to the CH to land I don't really have an agro problem.<br />
<br />
8 months ago at 65 with 30AAs wielding a flesh grinder + red epic or the epic 2hs at around 6khps with average XP group buffs I could hold agro pretty well, but there were those times when I'd get no procs, the chanter would slow, resist, I'd taunt, taunt would fail, I'd shield the chanter, taunt again and get agro back, the chanter would tash, get agro, taunt would fail, AET was still down from last time this happened 10 mins ago and the chanter would go splat, then we'd have an unslowed mob in camp and the cleric has agro from trying to heal the chanter and goes splat and the rest of the group die one at a time and you spend your next 20 mins on CR.<br />
<br />
Its unlucky and you did all you could to do your job, but the Random number generator screwed you and if the group had called a paladin to tank they probably wouldnt have had that problem.<br />
<br />
It is because of situations like this that when theres no spots in guild groups and I want to finish off an AA point or some other stupid urge makes me look for a pickup group, a group will take unknown 65 pally with 10AAs and 3khps unbuffed to tank for them in BoT over an unknown warrior (me in this instance with 120AAs and 6khps unbuffed).<br />
<br />
Warriors can hold agro, a good player in mediocre gear can still do a great job tanking, but when you have a warrior tanking there is a risk that taunt will fail 5 times a row and the warriors weapons might not proc for 2 mins and the debuffers might have all their spells resisted and someone will die.  <br />
<br />
Theres also a paladin LFG so why take the risk?</div></div><hr />

Daddio it's nice that you have no aggro problems which only convinces me you play with a set group time after time again.<br />
<br />
I have more AA than Eodin, and there are groups I do not have aggro problems, and there are groups I do. A lot of aggro depends on who you group with, and what kind of DPS they are putting out, weapons etc. I group with a lot of pick up groups in addition to guild groups. I'm not going to go in detail in this to you, as I am convinced your still going to apply broad generalizations to what everyone else has said to the contrary.<br />
<br />
I'll end it here with a post on this very issue regarding aggro from Furor. Some may not like this guy, but regardless he's more qualified than you, and you blanketed statements regarding time equipped individuals which you even aren't.<br />
<br />
Quote from Furor<br />
<br />
&quot;I also find it funny that you would go to such extremes to 'handicap' yourself to prove that what? A warrior can hold aggro when you create a situation that aggro is a non-factor?...  You can come talk like this on Steelwarrior or PoN...and someone may believe this...it won't fly here.<br />
<br />
You want a realistic comparison? Compare my Knights to my Warriors in terms of gear...The only advantage 'real world' end gamers have is /disc defensive. Everything else is a complete loss for the Warrior.<br />
<br />
I don't need to use a magelo for the measuring stick. I use every day gameplay. If I'm experiencing with one of my Knights, I don't bother toying with aggro, I just let them have it and not put up a fight - there is no difference between me tanking or one of them tanking aside from the fact that aggro for them is effortless - and that is the fundamental f***ing problem that you cannot seem to grasp.&quot;<br />

Warriors shouldn't get an agro boost. In that post Furor posted a need for a nerf in knight hp/ac. I said that an increase in warrior hp/ac would fix the problem. Either way, it resolves the issue, although it's clear from that post that Furor believes that knights should have superior agro and pay for it with inferior tanking, I believe the same thing. <br />
<br />
There needs to be a disparity in tanking abilities when you chose a knight. Sure, you get superior agro, but you pay for it when the knight needs 2 ch's per mob instead of one. It makes them relatively even in exp groups, since the cleric either casts one SR and a CH, or two CH's. However on raid encounters it locks warriors in the MT role, and paladins can keep offtanking roles on slowed mobs.</div></div><hr />

The difference in tankability between warriors and hybrids is NOT SR+CHeal or 2Cheals, it is far, FAR less than that.<br />

Not only that, Furor has stated, and just about every warrior I know agrees, that mitigation and hitpoints mean absolutely nothing when the mobs won't pay attention to you. Increasing mitigation and hitpoints isn't going to solve a goddamned thing, unless it's the kind of increase that'll double or triple our current hps/mitigation, which would have the nice side effect of fucking the balance in every god encounter in the game.</div></div><hr />

Again another person saying that warriors can't hold agro at all. You're wrong, people without blades of war can hold agro, I'm sure with a hategiver and AHB you can hold agro aswell. Are you saying that you've never, to this day, held agro on any mob in your history of everquest. If you have, do you think that it is impossible to replecate that experience? It's not, I hold agro on mobs every day, warriors with worse weapons hold agro on mobs every day. Believe it or not, Furor can hold agro every day too.<br />
<br />
Just because we aren't as good at something, doesn't mean we can't do it. Knights have always had abilities to agro better than us (although not as well as they can now.) But they've always been imbalanced and never able to tank. Now they've been overcompensated and able to tank too well. Knights should be able to tank in exp groups, they should be able to offtank, they shouldn't be able to tank boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

i had a group in a Mistmore Adv with a ranger and a rogue. i was using my GsoT. the ranger had a Fleshgrinder and a Horror shard blade, and the rogue was using epic and Fleshgrinder. to make it short. the ranger shoulda been tanking for the most of the adventure.  it was a fireworks show from seeing their weapons go off so much. <br />

 if weapons don't proc and taunt doesn't work no way in hell we can hold agro. <br />

The trouble is that with ranged aggro and snap aggro groups can let loose on mob faster and safer. Add the ability to root park mobs and you've got a little help with CC as well. Stun is a big help in saving the life of a caster. The list is endless.<br />

Or groups could avoid this possibility and group a Paladin - and that's precicely what they are doing.<br />

Now I'm not saying I can't find a group. But it is VERY frustrating to try to tank without meeting the expectations of your group and to watch a Paladin group MT instead of you and to do the job effortlessly and flawlessly.<br />
<br />
I remember Kunark and how frustrating it was (as a Paladin) to watch a Warrior from the sidelines as he MT'd for hours without dying even once. This is worse - we are supposed to be the best MT in the game, not 3rd runner up to the Druid's sister's cat.<br />

<br />
Raid Roles - you want to honestly tell me paladins have no raid role outside of tanking. Don't pull that shit, they are the 2nd best raid healing class with their 1-sec cast heal, group heal and LoH. SK's maybe, but they can out-damage an equally equipped war on a raid, not to mention pull certain things that monks simply don't have the HP for, and atk boosts, you can't argue against them.<br />
<br />
XP roles - What the hell is more mitigation gonna do really? Knight mitigation is more than viable for groups. Fixing out mitigation won't help shit. Knights have more than enoug to tank right now without much hassle. As long as that holds true, the agro differences will make knights a better choice for groups.<br />
<br />
Game - &quot;Balance&quot;: Show me the encounters that suddenly become trivialized by boosting warrior agro. You just said it yourself, with BoW, a good augment and symbol planemasters, you can hold agro easily. So, show me an encounter where boosting warrior agro will make it trivial. For every encounter you show me, I will show you 5 encounters that become more trivial by boosting warrior mitigation over warrior agro. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your argument it not viable, simple. It's not original, we've been hearing it for over a year from Phantron and Co. It hasbeen owned and detroyed thoroughly, stop ressurecting failed points, they just don't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors cannot &quot;AGGRO LOCK&quot; justlike Knights...your assumption is completely false and completely misleading. There is no way a warrior can. Extensive parsing has shown that the BoW without question the best aggro generation weapon warriors use in the gam, procs at an AVERAGE rate of 2 times a minute? That is what 1400 hate every minute we can 'possibly' add to our aggro? Now compare this to a paladin with his fast stuns? how many can he do a minute? or a SK with their 'EB' spell? they can easilly create 5-6 times as much aggro as we do. Dont forget they ALSO have a taunt key that works 95% as well as ours. And their weapons are all better ratio than any warrior weapons. And their DPS extensively parsed is 80% of a warrior (unless undead) So tell me, What super-secret-uber trick do you have for getting this famed aggro-lock? Explain to us, the oh so unedcated masses what we need to do, so that we can be uber and great like you?<br />
<br />
Can warriors hold aggro? yes<br />
<br />
Will exp groups, who are all about effeciency want a warrior for aggro? no<br />
<br />
Remember these groups are now made up ofthe same people who used to solo and quad-kite, people who do not like 'waiting for the useless tank' to get aggro. <br />
<br />
Increasing war hp/ac/mitigation while something that needs done to seperate warriors from knights will not fix the problem. As many stated before, why heal 3 people when you can heal one?<br />
<br />
Decreasing Knight ac/hp/mitigation would change nothing unless you took them down to ranger level. And while that would make a lot of us feel good, that is not fair.<br />
<br />
What needs  to be done is twofold..<br />
<br />
fix some of the problems with aggro. immune spells, low level spells, taunt fix, and give warriors an innate hate on every attack of say 25<br />
<br />
then increase warrior hps/mitigation, make stamina worthwhile, give us innate soul to increase stamina/str  to 355 like wis/int make no diminishing returns on stamina. give warriors an innate 10% bonus to all hp spells/gear. And give all melee HP's for their mana...Defense cap at 305 would be nice also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only acceptable &quot;mitigation&quot; difference I would consider realistically balanced is if the &quot;danger level&quot; of a knight dying while tanking was directly proportionate to the &quot;danger level&quot; of someone else dying while a warrior were tanking.<br />
<br />
In other words, while I'm not in complete disagreement with the concept that aggro control be traded for mitigation level differences, I don't believe that knights would accept the levels of mitigation differences required to create a &quot;balanced&quot; situation.   <br />
<br />
In other words, warrior tanking would need to be enough better that a cleric would notice the difference in his/her mana bar to the extent that he or she would need to cast enough to account for ancillary heals in a standard exp group with a warrior.<br />
<br />
This is a rather dramatic difference in durability, roughly early velious levels of difference.   This game has never been as balanced as it was in early Velious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am saying the primary role of a warrior is tanking, and as the parent class being pure melee the warrior class should be the preferred class in that role. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the supporting roles have become too strong comparative to the mother class diminishing this preferred role. As a single dimension class of pure melee, we are not designed to afford this role to be trumped. This state belongs to the hybrid class, whose very nature supports another dimension of utilty. A diminsion given in lieu of accepting the &quot;supporting&quot; role status and not the preferred role.<br />
<br />
The affects of this diminished role are a function of HP/AC being too narrow(due to itemization), and comparative risk with 100% aggro lock vs. warrior is huge. <br />
<br />
The current PvE make up in Everquest cannot resolve this diminished role alone by increasing HP/AC of the warrior. Risk cost for choosing the mother class is greater than the supporting role classes directly attributed to aggro control differences.<br />
<br />
The concept of tanking efficiency comes into play when both risk, and mana output are diminished by a class weilding 100% aggro lock allows the cleric to focus mana to one party member, and damage/death becomes an insignificant matter to other party members.<br />
<br />
These matters taken together make-up an imbalance.<br />
<br />
There is a forum in favor of warrior aggro adjustment on other class forums. My main class, 65 Necro, has a thread on this topic now. So has the Shaman boards. So has the Monk Boards, and other class boards. Even SOE development has acknowleged this.<br />
<br />
It's hard for me to collectively throw away my own experience, and other class board experience, when even SOE development acknowledges the fact, and yet offers an apology for complacency in doing nothing - aggro is an issue in this imbalance makeup.<br />
<br />
How this imbalance should be addressed should be the course of the discussion, not whether the warriors, other classes, and EQ designers are on crack for saying the discrepancy exists. It exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will accept the idea that the difference of agro control for knights and warriors should be equivalent to the mitigation/avoidance difference.  If you have good agro, you shouldn't be able to take damage as well as someone who has less agro control (and therefor more damage absorbtion ability).<br />
<br />
Considering the significantly large agro capabilities of knights, the closest it gets to being equivalent is while warriors are under /disc defensive (much higher mitigation and even weaker agro since you're simply not hitting as hard), IMO.  So what could be the solution?  Make warriors constantly under defensive?</div></div><hr />
