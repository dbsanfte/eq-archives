The taunt skill works less than 10% of the time on this guy, once I lose aggro I never get it back.  Also, do you pull him to the north end or the south end of his valley, or into one of the tunnels, or do you kill him on his ledge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tanked him and never had any problems.<br />
<br />
That's probably your answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
We had him pulled to the last big chamber before the tunnel with zone to B.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well now I know better.</div></div><hr />

Last time we just zerged him down cause of that O.O</div></div><hr />

Recast time 12 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We kill him in one of the big chambers before you get to him. You need to be able to kill fast to pull this off, otherwise repop will bite you on the ass. But the big chambers give us enough room to setup DPS and spam healers outside the AE, while a CH rot with bardsong is inside the AE, plus another bard with the MT group. Doing this without two bards is much more difficult in my experience.<br />
<br />
As far as the blur goes, our very first try at him the recommendation from friends was to hybrid tank him. We tried it, but his DPS was &gt;&gt; our hybrids at the time. The warriors ended up tanking once the hybrids died, and all noted that he seemed kinda gimp to tank. At that point we switched to warrior tanking, and telling people to make sure they stay far back and moderate their DPS. Slow and steady beats fast with this one.<br />
<br />
I've personally tanked him about 4 or 5 times now, and we lose maybe 4-5 DPS throughout the fight because they get summoned. I have to admit I never even noticed the memblur, it doesn't affect the fight for us as far as I can tell. It's certainly no worse than Gintolaken, not that you can have done that yet. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've done Ginkobiloban once.  We killed ARbitor first time we tried him, lost about half the raid summoned and killed.  Since then though he's owned us.  Ginko didn't actually give us a lot of trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Promethis</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We train him away then kill his Guardians, and fight him where he spawns.  We just have every warrior taunt like crazy and the healers /assist off the mob.  Works wonders for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh, you all just want to spoil it when this is one mob that really is gimp enough to be tanked easily by a knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like all earth mobs, the memblur is really inconsistent, I've personally never had memblur problems with arbitor, more so with vine and dust named.  Anyway just have your healers assist heal, use ae taunt after memblur, your healers can stay out of range of the ae with quick heals 200+ range(150 on the ae)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iyacc@work</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We pull him out where the croc spawns. He doesn't home, rogues all have keys and can sneak through everything. <br />
<br />
When we're doing rings, as soon as he spawns, all the rogues haul ass and start working the pull. He's usually near the door by the time we have done loot and finished cleaning up after whatever ring was last. <br />
<br />
Kill him (bard songs are your friend) and then we AE through the tunnels to get flags.<br />
<br />
This also makes it easy if you want to kill him for loot and don't need the flags (hey, it could happen.)</div></div><hr />
