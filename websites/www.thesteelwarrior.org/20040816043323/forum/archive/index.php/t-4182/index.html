<br />
When it is nerfed you can reflect on the joys of warriors calling nerf.<br />
<br />
Six months ago Palladins and SKs would have been sympathetic.<br />
<br />
But the whiners among you have removed key allies.  The call for nerfing knights has actually limited SOE's choices as to how to improve your abilities.  Before SK and Pally boards were sympathetic to minor upgrades to Warrior abilities and increased utility.  Now any aspect of warrior improvements that is better than SK or Pally will have major protests from knights tired of the little boy who called nerf.<br />
<br />
Improving one class always infringes on another class in some way or another.  Usually classes are tolerant of small increases in other classes especially if that class needed help.  But now if your DPS is raised the rangers who read about Furors proposed nerf to channeling will be upset.  If you get additional agro abilities the SKs who are tired of your overstating our power (and understating your agro) will be upset.  This will force SOE to reduce what they would have given you.<br />
<br />
Its just a matter of time before the Wizards and druids start calling for a warrior nerf on the rampage Proc thing above citing how kiting has been nerfed in the past.  And SOE will have to nerf you.<br />
<br />
Pallys, SKs and rangers have all been far worse off than Warriors currently are.  They really did feel your pain.  They really would have been willing to give up a little for the greater good.  But to a large extent that goodwill has been used up.  Hope the ranting felt good casue it probably was a self imposed nerf.<br />
<br />
Look around thank your leaders.  <br />
<br />
Flame me all you want.  But the net effect is that you are nerfing yourself.  Warriors are not nearly as broken as some of you believe.  Sony isn't going to give you anywhere near what some of you think you deserve.  The more you whine without rational argument the worse you collective deal becomes.  <br />

Sound the alarms, another retard has escaped Fairview Mental Hospital.<br />

And in response to your post: *makes jacking off motions* Oh no, the Paladins and Shadowknights won't be sympathetic to our plight of 'Who gives a shit?'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um lets see, that was between 3 warriors each using a weapon tht no longer drops in the game.<br />
<br />
So lets take YOUR numbers of 50000 damage of 8 seconds that is 50000/8 = 6333.33... ~6333 damage per second. Ok that was between 3 warriors.  So to find the dps of one of those warriors we have to divide the dps by the number of warriors. 6333/3 = 2111 dps. <br />
<br />
Now, that number still seems kinda high right? Well, that is with a particular weapon that no longer drops that procs a nice DD and a skill called AE Rampage that causes you to hit all critters in a certain area.  So you see, your cry for a nerf Mr Anon_Knight_01 is rather flawed. Those warriors aren't taking down a boss mob and holding epic parts for ransom. They didn't solo all that since they had healers standing by, they simply killed some stuff really fast using a little used aa ability and a weapon that doesn't drop in the game any more. <br />
<br />
There isn't much to nerf there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is a fun trick more than a valid exp/loot strategem.  The healer is standing by to REZ them after the inevitable deaths more than for healing. It's also been around for quite a while. Are we going to see warrior rampage groups owning all the exp mobs and putting everyone else out of a job? Nah. It's so unimportant that even if they did nerf it (hardly seems neccessary) the vast majority of people wouldn't miss it.</div></div><hr />

OK here is the math works.<br />

~45 mobs *~20,000 Hp ea=~900,000 hp damage done<br />
<br />
900,000/3 war=300,000 damage ea war<br />
<br />
300,000/8 seconds=~30,000-40,000 DPS<br />
<br />
read the thread for an explaination on how they did it.<br />
<br />
Your misinformation factor of 15 is symptomatic of the whole war nerf knight debate.<br />
<br />
Warriors are not off by a factor of 15 on the other issues but a large portion of the posters here do use a misinformation factor on other issues as well. <br />
<br />
Relax keep it honest.  Do your research you will get improvements.  But the more misinformation the worse your case becomes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This &quot;tactic&quot; that you're linking has been available since Luclin went live. Much longer than six months ago.<br />
<br />
And six months ago, neither paladins nor shadowknights WERE sympathetic.<br />
<br />
So you're saying that nothing's changed?<br />
<br />
Funny, I already knew that.</div></div><hr />

This will influence SoE behavior how?  If SoE was actually that interested in protests, warriors would have been fixed a year or so ago, when we started protesting.  It dod not work for us, why do you think it will work for you? <br />
<br />
Look around thank your leaders <br />
<br />
I would like to thank some of the 'leaders' in the call for class balancing.  They have done a ton of work educating and analysing the problems warriors face, and trying to come up with solutions.<br />
<br />
The more you whine without rational argument the worse you collective deal becomes.  <br />

Speaking of rational arguments, when you manage to actually come up with one, maybe we will be slightly interested.  Till then you simply come off sounding foolish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sony can take back rampage. I wouldnt miss it, and really I don't think many would miss it. Hell, I'd go so far as to say take it OFF warriors and give KNIGHTS rampage just so they can spend AA on a skill that is probably the last of the warrior line of AA's that most would consider getting because its so situational as to be almost useless.<br />
<br />
But...BUT...all I want in return is the best damage mitigation table in the game across any class as a warrior. Sounds fair right? FFS we are WARRIORS, plate bearing 100% melee skilled tanks who have no other utility than to hit and to be hit. Thats what we do, thats ALL we do, we dont get spells, buffs and utilities like knights do. Quit your BS about how you were sympathetic. In Kunark when you guys thought you were way behind the 8 ball Verant/Sony looked into your classes and they put in changes which fixed YOU. Knights have been looked into so much there is no definitive line between warriors and knights anymore. We are still pulling our puds waiting waiting waiting. <br />
<br />
Sharing the same mitigation table with knights is downright ludicrous and just plain unfair in the philosphy of how the classes were created. Duel wield DPS needs a boost, because lets face it it's 99% of a warriors bread and butter DPS apart from the top end dudes who have BoW/SeWs etc etc. 2 weapons should output a shitload more DPS for warriors than it does currently. I'm not out to upset rangers since I don't want ranger level DPS, but FFS it should be a lot better DPS than it is now. <br />
<br />
Not our frikeen fault you guys decided to play hybrids, for being hybrid you by definition are jacks of all trades and masters of none. Warriors however arent even masters of their own domain anymore. You are here because you KNOW whats going to happen. Coming to us while shaking in your little chair because the wave is coming over the horizon is indicative of you guys not minding us being held underwater like we are, so long as no one lets us up for air.<br />
<br />
Nerfing ourselves? A paladin just tanked Quarm you lunatic...and so has an SK. Given a few more weeks and some more Time gear youll see a Monk tank Quarm, it's just a matter of time...and warriors will get to sit on the sidelines sucking their thumbs. Remember how warriors were pigeonholed into a role &quot;Well, you guys still hold the role of raid tanks&quot; well thats no longer seems to hold true either now. Nerfing ourselves? I don't think collectively as a class it could get any WORSE don't you?<br />
<br />
I don't want knight classes nerfed, I don't want any classes nerfed...I want warriors to be raised to the status of WARRIORS, not hybrids without spells or utility.<br />

3 Warriors do ~30,000 DPS its no big deal don't worry nothing to see here.  1 Pally tanks Quarm omfg the world is ending...sigh.<br />
<br />
For those of you remember the old warrior role and standing you will never get that back.  It was unbalanced in your favor.  Knights could only get groups when warriors were not to be had.  Your attitude then as now was its not our fault you chose to be hybrids.  You can hope and hope those days are coming back but they are not.<br />
<br />
Having said that I support a large increase in warrior UTILITY and a very small increase in warrior overall power.<br />
<br />
As for master of something warriors are the master of situational dps by a good factor of 5 from what I can see.  As well as situational tanking by a factor of 2.  Situational dps in bezerker is not too bad either.  <br />
<br />
But if you are expecting to have sk agro, defensive on all the time, 20% more hp, and much better melee dps you are gonna be sitting in pok for a long damn time.  If you are looking for knights to be nerfed so that one pally can't tank Quarm you gonna be sitting in pok even longer.<br />

This is kunark reasoning.  <br />
The fact that you don't mind it at all when it applies to knights really really weakens your case.  Surely if you were happy with us being passed over it must not be all that bad now when you passed over....oh well.<br />
<br />
I didn't like it when I was passed over for warriors.  I feel your pain but those among you who insist that you have to be the tank with knights only being chosen when you not there can sit in pok and cry.

Britty gotta admit the bulk of your post wasn't that bad I just picked it cause you had the its not our fault you chose hybrids line.  Which was the whole warrior justification for superiority in kunark.<br />
<br />
As for pally my understanding is that they do about 20% more dps against undead with SU3 etc.  But that like the ranger bow damage it is easy to get the idea that they are super Gods if you only see a small portion of the parse.  Granted a lot more people have used SU3 than the rampage trick.<br />
<br />
Most knights I know support making Warriors slightly more powerful and even situationally very powerful like pallies are against undead etc.  But you are gonna get a lot more milage out of a large number of situational utility type things than mitigation or agro cause there isn't that much stuff SOE can give you mitigation/agro wise without going back to kunark.  <br />
<br />
And in all probablity you are going to have to give some at the high end to get anything meaningful at the low end.  Unless the bulk of warriors are willing to trade devensive/evasive at the high end where you are obviously superior to sk/pally then how can they make you equal at the low end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If they can make CH rotations to where Pallies and SK's can tank even the entirety of Tier 5 with no changes in it compared to having a Warrior, how can you claim there's an obvious superiority?</div></div><hr />

BULLSHIT!  I didn't make my warrior so that I could be &quot;utility&quot;.  If I had I would have made a god damn knight.  I made a warrior because I was supposed to be the best of the best (insert hysterical uncontrollable laughter here) at what I do.  This whole crap about knights supporting making warriors slightly more powerful, puhlease.  I don't want to be YOU, I want to be a WARRIOR!<br />

If you would have bothered to read through any number of threads on this forum, you would know that most warriors, high end included, would GLADY give up the damn defensive/evasive disciplines just so you knights can quit using it as yet another excuse as to why things are &quot;balanced&quot;.  If knights can tank Quarm without it, why do we need it anyway?</div></div><hr />

I also love how sympathetic you say knights were. They were so sympathetic that they helped us by standing on our heads and claiming everything was fine with example after example shown to them for over a year.   <br />
<br />
Starting your post off with something like &quot;Well yeah warriors need a small fix but...&quot; and then going on for four paragraphs about how you actually feel things are perfectly fine does not equal helping the warrior class, sorry.<br />
<br />
Only coming to these boards when you see the word &quot;knight, Paladin or Shadowknight&quot; in a post  to play damage control is not helping the warrior class, sorry.<br />
<br />
We need some action, and you  saying its our own fault for trying to invoke that action, shows exactly where you are coming from. You, along with any other class thats been too powerful in the history of this game (I am sure a lot of warriors will do it themselves if they ever become too powerful in the future, I will be in another game though by then) are perfectly content with nothing changing except maybe a few small bones.</div></div><hr />

BULLSHIT!  I didn't make my warrior so that I could be &quot;utility&quot;.  If I had I would have made a god damn knight.  I made a warrior because I was supposed to be the best of the best (insert hysterical uncontrollable laughter here) at what I do.  This whole crap about knights supporting making warriors slightly more powerful, puhlease.  I don't want to be YOU, I want to be a WARRIOR!<br />

<br />
Warriros are the best of the best at tanking...just not only tank in game.<br />
Knight is &lt;75% warrior  that is about ~94% HP ~94% mitigation (may not scale into AC% if not linear ) and ~85% melee dps of warriror (thus against same target using only melee no heals we do 75% the damage that you would have done before we die). <br />
85%*94%*94%=75%  but I think the truely fair test is parse of same mob how many hp done before death using only melee  knights do &lt;75% of what warriors do.  So far none of the warrior claims I have seen so far claim that a knight can do more than 75% of similiar equip war in solo fight to death against mob using melee only.<br />
<br />
Then knights get about 25% the dps from spells or in pally 25%  of cleric heals.  This is about where we are.  But many warriors are very not happy.  And when utiltiy is raised as something to fix the problem you don't want that either.  <br />
<br />
If knights are made less than 75% warrior we would have to be more than 25% cleric/necro which would suit us fine but you gonna go ape shit when pallies get shaman version of complete heal or sks do the infinite mana/hp loop that necros get.<br />
<br />
So lets say you trade defensive/evasive and get 25% additional mitigation.  The knights are gonna get some of the raid tanking and you will get some of the group tanking but are you guys really gonna be happier?  I don't think so cause the good knights gonna outplay you even if you outplay the bad knights cause utility allows good players to seriously outdistance bad players within the same class.<br />
<br />
Your problem with knights isn't the 75% warrior cause we really are 75% or less the warrior than you are.  The problem is the utility of the knight &gt; than the extra 25% warrior unless you really really smart about equipment (and possibly even then).  But SOE can't just give you 25% more mitigation 25% more dps and good agro.  They can give you utility that allows you to be useful and wanted on raids and in groups but if you will be unhappy with that, then they just gonna stall and hope their problem goes away or give you some gimp improvements that you gonna hate.<br />
<br />
And clearly you are not happy with that.  It really does come back to warrior expectations=Self imposed nerf.<br />

<br />
What about those spells that knights get, that their parent caster class simply doesn't get?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't those simply have to be removed from existence, since, you know, giving the class something unique and all its own would be like having a knight be 110% of something else ... 75% parent melee ... 25% parent caster ... and 10% unique?<br />
<br />
That may have something to do with the perceived unbalance.<br />
<br />
Or it may just be that knights are 85 to 94% melee, but still only 25% caster. Meaning they've gained quite a bit of ground on the melee side of the ball, but caster &quot;balance&quot; has been kept firmly in place.<br />
<br />
Speaking as a melee, I'd be perfectly happy allowing hybrids to encroach further on their spell casting parents ... IF, in turn, their melee abilities were toned down.<br />
<br />
That way, groups would be LESS spell caster dependent.<br />
<br />
You want to break the holy trinity? Break the other pieces of it too.<br />
<br />
Instead of taking out JUST the tank part of tank, healer, slower ... bust up some of that healer and slower part while you're at it.</div></div><hr />

Your DPS is about 20% less on normal mobs, and as much if not significantly more than a warriors on undead mobs (which by the way make up about 60% of the latest expansion).

You can't. We don't have any way to keep ourselves on our feet.   A paladin has solo'd Gorenaire, and if one of Furor's posts is to be believed, a 65 SK solo'd Zlandicar.  Show me a warrior that can do that.  Again, you can't.  Your numbers are off bud, knights are about 90% warrior and 30-40% parent class.  That adds up to 120-130%.  Knights are overpowered, and either they're gonna get nerfed, or warriors are gonna get boosted, and most likely it's gonna be both.

No amount of spin doctoring is gonna make knights look any less godlike.  <br />
<br />
 1)  I don't see you disputing that knights are less powerful melee than 75% warrior.  Well let me restate that I don't see a parse.  If you really think knight are 90% war but do 20 % less damage and &gt;20% less mitigatimon then your math skills need some work..<br />
<br />
2)  3 Warriors took ~45 mobs of similiar power to Zlandicar/ Gore.  You cited a pally and a sk soloing dragons with 32,000 I cite 3 wars taking 45 mobs with ~20,000.  Stop and think about that 300,000 hp damage ea vs 32,000 for the knights.  If you can't be satisfied with outdamaging knights by a factor of 10 you just can't ever be satisfied.....<br />
<br />
3)  Warrior soloing kunark dragon.  If a 52 monk can solo naggy then a 65 war can solo gore they just never got around to it (or didn't think to brag about it if they did).  I am not saying they won't have to take the healing potions with them but they can do it.  A war with 11k hp against a mob with 32k that does 66 dps is very doable.  With chargok ring (25 pts DS) and shaman potion 58 pts DS is possible (never done it myself but lucy says they stack if not 10th ring gives 35 with chardok and does stack) add 2 pts from ldon aug that 60.  War get another 10 but not sure if that stack (tunare belt and a war only item give the self only druid DS which lucy seems to say stacks with chardok and shammy 33 pts potion).  I think furor or equivalent if he puts up a 70 pts DS, uses max clickies to self buff (haste, hp etc from potions etc), best dps weapons etc can solo gore...probably without a heal if he has 30 pts regen and lifetaps on both weapons.  The problem with soloing stuff is you have to pick gear that works best for soloing and most wars don't do that.  Its the warriors without the 8th ring, without chardok ring, without eyepatch or equivalent who never geared towards soloing that cry loudest about the SK/pallies soloing stuff.<br />
<br />
4)  And you know what?  When Furor or equivalent does get around to soloing gore or Zlandicar the knights won't howl in pain sit in pok and demand a Warrior nerf.  War will probably never be the first to solo a previously high end mob.  But go look up who tanked the first time Gore, Zlandicar,Naggy, etc al went down.  Wasn't a knight now was it?</div></div><hr />

What does any of this have to do with anything?

I think the SOE developers are as lazy as the next person and are reading all the boards for ideas.  If Warrirors had a list of widly accepted (by warriors) reasonable (to SOE) fixes I think SOE would just run with it.  <br />
<br />
But warriors are focused on tanking and particularly tanking better than knights in every possible conceivable situation.  It is very hard to balance a class if you start by saying they are going to be the very best at something without making them the very worst at something else.  <br />
<br />
If warriors are going to be the very best tank what are they going to be the very worst at?  DPS?  Agro?  Survivability? Utility?  The problem is warriors are so much better at mitigating damage that their utility has been nerfed so that they are basically unworkable in any group not specifically designed around their tanking strength ( all high end raids and most dificult mobs require a warrior but only the first few times then you can get a knight to do it).<br />
<br />
Warriors are the last single use class in game.  Even clerics can solo.  Enchanters can DPS.  SOE's only option for fixing you is utility.  They can't make you any more uberer as a tank without total chaos.<br />
<br />
 Believe it or not I group with warriors a lot.  Had three in my group last night.  From the start of ldon to now I have noticed a major shift in warrior agro based on the agro procs.  With 2 agro proc 1HS weapons and 2 agro procs with high dex (305 for end game) warriors should have an ave of 8 procs per minute to get agro.  Thats a lot of agro.  True its not instant agro lock but its a lot of agro.  And since I can only use one aug and the anger line is war only the agro shift is in war favor...SOE is giving you all they can within reason towards what you are asking for.</div></div><hr />

Newtank i am convinced you are either not paying attention or are just plain braindead.  The crux of the matter is knights mitigate as well as or better than warriors.  This has been parced by the lovly folks of AO, and i'll leave it to you to find the parses.  You are correct our weakness is utility.  All we can offer is one thing tanking survivability.  We have never had any other utility to speak of.  Warriors are not asking for a whole lot, just compensation for the spell books we don;t have and the &quot;spells, skill, disciplines etc&quot; we did not get from level 60 - 65.  Is it too much to ask? /shrugg i don;t know, but lazyness is not an excuse.<br />
<br />
Your retoric about flurry is almost comical.  A bard has solo'ed the queen in chardok, 6 nights rampaged an LDoN adventure, Knights have soloed dragons need i go on.  Thing about it is all those people actually lived through said event.  All three warriors died, and maybe 1 or 2 of them actually got some xp from it.  You'll also notice it has no practical use outside a stupid stunt.  It was not just &quot;situational DPS&quot; but a situation where only a few warriors could even do, because the items are no longer dropped in game, and it has to be setup by a team of players (a shaman to slow the warriors, and a cleric to rez them minimuum).  This is not like slay undead where any paladin with the aa can go hog wild on an undead mob, requires you waste the aa's (yes they are a waste) on the ability and have this weapon that no longer drops.  Oh and you'd better find 2 other warriors to help you because it won;t work otherwise.  <br />
<br />
Your views on class balance reflect one thing, &quot;I am a knight I am overpowered compared to warriors and i like it&quot;  Just say that and leave.  Just because SoE is lazy does not somehow fundementally change what they will or won;t do nor what they should do.  <br />

I wanted to reply more, but i'd rather wait for Furor to drop a &quot;F&quot; bomb on you.</div></div><hr />

Nerfing knights would certainly solve any balance issues among the 3 plate tank classes, and that one just pops off the top of my head.

1- HEALING. Warriors don't heal themselves very effectively. They certainly don't heal their groupmates much at all. Even with max Bind Wound AAs.<br />

<br />
Well for starters you have one of the lowest initial agro but your agro over time is very good at the levels I can see using the right tools (mostly due to ldon).<br />
<br />
As far as soloing I support warriors being able to solo.  I think if you asked for FT to work for war  and then make mana=HP (but only once you 0HP and heals don't replenish mana) or the pure melee regen cap to be 15-30 higher than knight we would back that.  Probably back a squire who either healed you or did reasonable dps to give you some of the sk or pally utility.  These are things that SOE could give you.  Trading defensive/evasive for constantly better mitigation of 10-25% would probably pass too.  Making you tank unslowed mobs 30% better would probably not cause any harm either.  Even making some of the equipment tools you need purchasable at a merchant as spells were for a long time is probably fair game.<br />
<br />
But knights agro needs to be&gt; than war agro (possible exception if you make pally better defensive tank than war via self heals) Knight mitigation in groups needs to stay same relative to war mitigation in groups unless war mitigation under defensive were used to trade (thereby giving up larger slice of raid tanking).<br />
<br />
As for the not getting ldon aug for agro/dps.  Thats part of your class.  As a 50+ war if you don't have (or working towards) 8+ pts self DS, 2 weapons with agro/dps procs and agro/dps augmentations and clicky haste then you have no more rights to whine than the sk who doesn't use his pet cause the dps low or his spells cause they just weak necro spells. Wars have a lot of utility  available to them via equipment that many just pass over as too much work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey I liked your reply =)<br />
No unnecessary flaming and very good counter points =)<br />
<br />
So lets talk reasonable things wars could be given.<br />
<br />
1)  Bind wound/regen/total available hp/heal pool on war is lower than both knights.  I agree.  How should SOE fix it?  A warriors ability to solo should be in the same ballpark as a knight.  <br />
<br />
2)  War could get either a viable root type ability &quot;tackle&quot; or something or else the ability to really tank more than one mob at a time via area taunt.  perhaps a larger stun likelyhood.<br />
<br />
3)  I think a small war slow or more likely a offensive inhibiter of some kind that is slightly different than slow so as to be unique would be fine.<br />
<br />
4) sorry like us you probably SOL on this  OT hammer here we come<br />
<br />
5) I agree in principle that ranged attack would be good but don't see a reasonable solution...would 75% of ranger bow damage cause problems with them?<br />
<br />
6) think this is covered in 2 you get one or the other snare or root/stun.  <br />
<br />
7) wars could get some from of mana drain call it deny magic or something.  Not sure how this would give mana back to casters in your group though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think SOE is much more able to make warriors less bad in any of these areas than they are to make warriors better overall mitigators of damage or better agro or even really higher dps. <br />
<br />
Do warriors have a list of the things they would suggest to improve the above?  I saw the sk spear spell idea suggested before they were added by soe and the named changed from spear to sythe as a result of complaints on boards.  Big brother IS watching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Dator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">heres an off the wall idea for a limited form of crowd control for warrior utility:<br />
<br />
2 Mobs Inc to the group,<br />
 warrior picks one and attacks,<br />
 10  seconds later CH lands,<br />
 mob 2 attacks the cleric,<br />
 warrior hits his /protect ability,<br />
 instead of shielding the cleric with himself,<br />
 he forces say 75% of the damage the cleric would take to hit<br />
 mob #1,<br />
 the ability would last until mob#2 turned back to the warrior,<br />
 have it on the same refresh rate as /shield<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Great, another asshole with no grasp on the situation.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to two main problems:<br />
<br />
1) Putting Knights on the same defense table, bad idea....<br />
<br />
2) CH being the mainstay of group-healing, costing 400 mana, almost always completely healing the tank, and being a level 39 spell...<br />
<br />
Since the game began, warriors had the best tanking ability, and caster aggro had to be &quot;managed&quot; since CH was 400!!! mana, and if the cleric got LOM, pulls were halted.<br />
<br />
Mana-pools increased, kei was added, tranq was added, marr was added, FT was added, focus affects were added....and now a CH costs a  400 mana .<br />
<br />
Clerics can cast 2 CH's a fight, and not care, so damn near anyone can tank...plate class + near warrior mitigation and avoidance + snap aggro = #1 choice, even if they need healed more....why? cause clerics never go oom anymore.<br />
<br />
I play a shaman, and barring mana regen from canni, I can cast slow, bane of nife, a root or two, and maybe a nuke and never worry about mana, and thats about 900-1300 mana a fight, and thats just with FT, KEI, and mount.<br />
<br />
I prefer to group with warriors.  I slow in inc in tier2, and dont worry, because I am not stupid enough to do so while being out of melee range of the warrior, making him chase the mob.  Rather, mob is inc, I slow, it hits me for 100-600 damage, he hits taunt, attack, presto, warrior has aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO there are a few blatant things that have lead to the current situation:<br />
<br />
1) Pussy chanters slowing mobs<br />
2) clerics with 6k mana casting a spell that after specialization, aa skills, and the 1-2 ticks of mana-regen during the cast, ends up costing them about 150-200 mana.<br />
3) Knights being on the same mitigation table, bump them back down a bit, lower the cap on defense to 200, 225 maybe...but make it a bit harder to keep them healed, but not much<br />
4) Turn mana on warrior items into hp when equipped by a war, in a 1:1 ratio, monks and rogues at a 2 mana:1 hp ratio, and all FT turned into HP regen, 1:1 for all pure melee.<br />
5) Bump the mana cost on CH to 500 or so, and lower the hp healed to 5k, adding a level 51 version that heals 10k for 600, thus making clerics prefer to heal warriors, as it was not all that long ago.<br />
<br />
This would keep knights viable as tanks, but not the ONLY choice, with the extra 1-2 hp that would be gained from the mana on items, warriors would be much more mana efficient to heal, and warriors with FT9 would see some benifit of that item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I disagree with messing with clerics. and I dont think we should NERF anyone. That doesnt do any good at all. <br />
<br />
When we got to go to 65 warriors got very little we got a few HP's and new tables. Big deal. Same with rogues and monks. <br />
<br />
We should not nerf anyone. We as warriors need to have a very good edge on the other tankers. <br />
<br />
SOE could easily give us new discs from 60 to 65. Or if they use the defensive crutch take it away. i dont care at all if i have that disc. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Well for starters you have one of the lowest initial agro but your agro over time is very good at the levels I can see using the right tools (mostly due to ldon). <br />
<br />
Over time agro is not truly the issue, initial agro is.  With mobs needing to be slowed early, and DoTs needing to be cast early, initial agro is the key.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing I support warriors being able to solo. <br />
<br />
I do not think warrior soloing will ever be terribly viable, nor is it something I particularly want.  I have alts who can solo if I want to spend time soloing, when playing my warrior, I want to group.<br />
<br />
But knights agro needs to be&gt; than war agro  <br />
<br />
I do not have a problem with knight agro &gt; warrior agro, it only makes sense.  I do feel that knight agro is far  to high in relation to warrior agro, and that the difference between the two needs to be reduced.<br />
<br />
Knight mitigation in groups needs to stay same relative to war mitigation in groups unless war mitigation under defensive were used to trade (thereby giving up larger slice of raid tanking). <br />
<br />
No.  I do no say neccessarily that any changes need to be made to mitigation, but opening the difference in mitigation would be a tool that could be used in balancing.  As far as raids, knights already have a strong raid role(and not in competition with warriors), why do they insist that they need part of our limited role?  If you want a larger raid role, why not push for more utility(you are after all tanks with utility, while warriors are simply tanks), and expand your raid role that way?<br />
<br />
As a 50+ war if you don't have (or working towards) 8+ pts self DS, 2 weapons with agro/dps procs and agro/dps augmentations and clicky haste then you have no more rights to whine than the sk who doesn't use his pet cause the dps low or his spells cause they just weak necro spells. <br />
<br />
Can I complain about the pally who can outagro me with level 9 and level 15 vender bought spells?  Why do you insist that to be balanced, all we have to do is far more work than a knight?  The balance issues are fundamental to our class, and therefore need fundamantal changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Saying warriors have thousands of DPS is a sure sign of lunacy.<br />
<br />
That is like saying SK's do 7500 DPS. They can do 7500 DPS right? So it must be sustained...<br />
<br />
Heck, my rogue can do 32,000 DPS against some MOBs.... damn 32k DPS rogues, wtf.<br />
<br />
Even if a warrior manages 200,000 damage in one ramp, by time he can use it again the total DPS is going to be 300-400 assuming infinite supply of mobs, and some other classes support keeping him from insta death.<br />
<br />
As for mitigation advantages, lets not forget that most paladins can sustain 30-40 DPS worth of healing on themselves without ever going OOM. SK's have few problems sustaining 20DPS GROUP heals with mana regen for group on top of it. There is no mitigation advantage, we are at a disadvantage in that department as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Silias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Give heals more aggro, give warriors more migitation and hp, presto u got balance.  The warrior can survive w/o being healed and the mob w/o being slowed right away and has plenty of time to gain good aggro.  Which does not effect knights one bit b/c they have instant aggro spells.  Raid mobs? With more hp and migitation and defensive (maybe cut the time down to 1min)? they can survive long enough to gain aggro before ch chain has to start casting. Sure theres a few flaws but thats nothing a few good minds can't think of fixing. Em and make taunt for warriors equal or almost equal to that of slow so the healers don't have to worry about aggro on slowers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giving the melee classes, both monks and warriors, more utility is certainly a viable solution to the problem.<br />
<br />
However, until we hear more than just &quot;We'll have something maybe in a month or two&quot; from Absor, and until we hear more than just &quot;We're possibly, maybe, considering, that sometime we might look into this issue&quot; on the dev corner ...<br />
<br />
well ...<br />
<br />
Even the good ideas seem to be just pipe dreams and wasted bandwidth.<br />
<br />
But yeah, giving warriors some reliable utility that is useful to groups would go a long way toward helping them compete for limited XP group spots, and take some of the sting out of learning that with the right heal chain any monkey could tank the big bad boss mobs of the &quot;endgame.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Warriors = specialist class, they can only tank, and are specialised in tanking. They are thus 100% dependent on other classes.<br />

You want to tank, but still like spells? = Knight<br />

This is completely false in the world of Everquest, the specialist class is worse at his job.<br />

Apparently the first rule of elementary debate ( as in elementary school debate) is to use retarded to refer to your opponent as many times as possible.<br />
<br />
The second rule appears to be to hide or ridicule all evidence that doesn't support your hypothesis.  Eg stated above.  War situational damage output of 300,000 hp ea over 8 second is not best or is in some way &quot;so fucking hilarious&quot;.  And statements otherwise  &quot;aren't only false... they're simply retarded..&quot;  see rule 1.<br />
<br />
The third rule appears to make statements that even your own allies can't sign up to in mass.  <br />
&quot;Currently:<br />
For raids - Knights &gt; Warriors<br />
For high end encounters - Knights = Warriors&quot;<br />
Of course anyone pointing out that war mitigation with defensive vs kight mitigatimon is 50% better while defensive up and 20% better on average thus requiring 20-50% fewer clerics to run the heal chain.  (if defensive up 30% of time cycled) would be retarded.   And my not being able to remember raids cancelled cause the knight can't come tank a raid mob but being able to remember raids that were cancelled cause the main warrior couldn't come...must be retarded.</div></div><hr />

Just because your raid organizers were afraid to try knights, does not mean it was not possible.<br />
<br />
And my current guild cancels many raids due to lack of our pally. We cannot hope to really do some of them without him.<br />
<br />
On top of that, doing  high risk LDoN advents without our pally is suicide.<br />
<br />
Can do it fine without our main warrior tho.<br />
<br />
Remember, just because you are locked in the mind set that wars are the only solution to every hard hitting mob does not make it true. It has been proven that knights can step up to the task over and over again. If you applied your knights potential to thier fullest you would find that, but by all means continue to cancel your raids due to lack of warriors... more raid targets for the rest of us.<br />

85%*94%*94%=75% but I think the truely fair test is parse of same mob how many hp done before death using only melee knights do &lt;75% of what warriors do. So far none of the warrior claims I have seen so far claim that a knight can do more than 75% of similiar equip war in solo fight to death against mob using melee only. <br />
<br />
You are aware if the Warrior is &quot;tanking&quot; in this scenario he is taking a DPS hit for using defensive or evasive of between 40-50% of his dps potential??? right??? You do realize that these disciplines have negative side affects as well?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Rogues are a specialist melee class. They are specialized in dishing out damage(offensive). <br />
<br />
Rogues do not use a discipline ,that last 3 minutes, to out-damage(their specialty) the knights. A rogue can out damage even them with or without their discs.<br />
<br />
Warriors are a specialist melee class as well, but specialized in soaking damage(defense).  Warriors SHOULD be soaking damage better, and in a noticeable manner(that does not require extensive parsing to SEE the minuscule differences) than knights. <br />
<br />
Can rogue outdamage knights in a noticeable manner without discs? Hell yes they can.<br />
<br />
Then why can't a warrior soak damage better than knights in a noticeable manner without discs?<br />
<br />
<br />
The main excuse for warrior having  crappy aggro was that we soaked hits too good when compared to the other classes. But that was Kunark-Velious. In todays game, Knight soak the damage as good as warriors(we are on the same defensive table) PLUS they have a full spellbook that allow them to aggro lock, heal, buff, CC and so on. <br />
<br />
The totality that is a knight(spellbook, class specific abilities and melee) should equal, or be in balance, to the totality that is a warrior (melee and disciplines). <br />
<br />
Today: Knight melee + Spellbook + unique abilities &gt;&gt;&gt; Warrior melee + disciplines(they have not been changed since Velious). <br />
<br />
<br />
With every expansion knights get new spell while warriors get nothing. This will continue to tip the balance in their favor. And the balance has not been tiped our way since Velious. Thats Luclin, LoY, PoP, LDoN.<br />
<br />
 And there are still some knights that dare say they had it bad in Kunark(1 expansion). Please knock it off. A lot of  paladins started playing during/after Luclin when they got the good boost (same defensive table as warriors, Slay undead with pretty crits and a horse).  <br />
<br />
Either warriors get upgraded to balance the equation or knights get nerfed.  Your pick.  But it wont remain as it is right now.</div></div><hr />

So Newtank, you say we should be nerfed because we can rampage for ungodly amounts of damage with a weapon that does not drop anymore ?! <br />
<br />
Did it occur to you that is has already been nerfed ?<br />
In fact, if you start a new warrior today, you cannot build him up in any way so he can do those massive Rampages.<br />
So, there you go, it's only a very few who can do it at all.<br />
And those are more of an anecdote in the overall picture.<br />
<br />
 - However - <br />
<br />
Warriors should be better at Mitigating Damage than Knights, we are after all worse at generating Aggro. And since Tanking Ability = Aggro + Mitigating Damage, I think something needs to be done to warrior's Aggro or Mitigation abilities.<br />
<br />
Pick your poison.<br />
<br />
Either way you twist or turn it you will have to either :<br />
 a. Improve Warriors to be better than Knights.<br />
 b. Nerf Knights to be worse than Warriors.<br />
 c. Kill a Ranger so they don't start tanking Quarm ... heck, kill them anyways.<br />
<br />
And no, Warriors don't really want root / snare / lull / whatever odd utility you can think of, we are not spellcasters.<br />
We just want to be the best at what we are supposed to do : <br />

Either warriors get upgraded to balance the equation or knights get nerfed.  Your pick.  But it wont remain as it is right now. [/B] <br />
<br />
I pick improving warriors most warriors and nerfing the rampage trick.<br />
<br />
Let me flip the situation around a bit.  Imagine rogues(offensive specialists) had a new ability that only a few of them had access to that allowed them access to get 100,000 hp but only under very special conditions and only with a bp that doesn't drop anymore.  And that three rogues killed quarm with no heals and no help except to be buffed before the fight.  It wouldn't be a problem for you because warriors have tanked quarm before an the bp doesn't drop anymore and most classes have much higher tanking ability than rogues under normal situations.  Lets add in that rogues are complaining that they can't get groups because monks don't have to attack from behind and ldon is fast paced.  would you run out a support them in their bid to nerf monks?<br />
<br />
Then why can't you see that for warriors(the defensive specialists although not necessarily as defensive as palladins) to be the offensive kings by a large margin is unbalancing?  Even if it is only a few capable of doing it.  It is extra bad when warriors are crying nerf and claiming that high end warriors are underpowered.<br />
<br />
As for war not getting new stuff go to ldon...get 2 125 damage procs for your 2 high dps weapons.  Now get your dex up to 305.  You have now gained 500 damage per minute or 8 dps.  Similiar knight gets only 4 dps from that cause can't duel wield.  That is a rather large swing in your favor dps wise.  Alternately you can get EB procs which are a large swing in your favor agro wise.  LDON favors war over knights as far as new power being given out.  Sk get a new undead only spell that lets me increase my dps by 1 per mana used which at 24 mana regen would be 4 dps.  So against undead I hold my own but against all other mobs warrior gains ability to do 4 dps more than knights.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that casters can get spells easier than you can get offense improvements from equipment then I can relate to that.  But I didn't start the nerf talk furor etc did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">1. The Rampage trick has already been nerfed, get over it already.<br />
<br />
2. the LDoN augments should not be our balancing points since not ALL have LDoN, or can be expected to have it. Besides, even with all the pretty procs we still have aggro problems in the first 10 seconds of a fight, which might end up with the Shaman or Enchanter going KER-SPLAT.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if Rogues could figure out a way to do 100k damage in very special situations, once every 4 hours with something that is limited to a few Rogues per server and which ultimately wound up killing themselves as well ?<br />

Then why can't you see that for warriors(the defensive specialists although not necessarily as defensive as palladins) to be the offensive kings by a large margin is unbalancing?  Even if it is only a few capable of doing it.  It is extra bad when warriors are crying nerf and claiming that high end warriors are underpowered.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Let me be the first to call BS on this one.  Like people have said before this has already been nerfed.  There is only 1 weapon that will give the results you are siting.  That weapon has been nerfed and will no longer drop.  The skill itself, while mostly worthless, was not the problem the weapon was.  The only thing SoE can do now is remove the weapon from game, still that is not a class issue but itemization.  If we are going to talk about balance then lets really balance the classes not this silly crap.  Tell you what i'll trade this uber warrior skill (and the potential 1000k damage) for su3 . . .fair??  If you don;t think that's fair then it's time you re-evaluate your position and step back into reality.</div></div><hr />

You are aware if the Warrior is &quot;tanking&quot; in this scenario he is taking a DPS hit for using defensive or evasive of between 40-50% of his dps potential??? right??? You do realize that these disciplines have negative side affects as well?<br />
<br />
As for your other claims.. have answered them and the DPS one ad nasuem: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1365<br />
<br />
Go read, have fun on the short bus.  <br />
<br />
Wow you are a poster child for what I am talking about.  Everyone please read the first post in his link.<br />
<br />
It compares war dps while defensive in effect (40% reduced damage) against knight dps.  It then goes on to say there no mitigation difference between war and knights.  <br />
<br />
If you take war higher damage with a 2HS than sk of 12% (your number 100 dps vs 88 dps).  The sk needs 12 dps from spells to make up for warrior advantage in dps. At a ratio of 4 damage for 1 mana the sk needs 18 mana regen just to keep up with you dps wise.  If you factor in the extra 5 dps you mention from risoste etc (5 dps sounds high to me) that would require an extra 7.5 mana regen for a total of 25.5 mana regen.  That isn't counting warrior bezerk when below 40% health but I didn't count HT either.<br />
<br />
Alternately if the war cycles defensive 30% of time the war will do an ave of 85 dps to the sk 88 and have 15% better mitigation.  The sk would then have to use the mana for taps to try and make up the mitigation diff.  But there the transfer is less than 2 hp per mana so the 25.5 mana regen above only gives ~9 dps mitigation which gives a clear edge to the war cause mobs do more than 60 dps (at least the mobs that anyone with 25-26 mana regen fights).  The casting time for the taps would easily eat up 5% of melee time and thus take 3dps away from sk.<br />
<br />
If you honestly look at things you may decide that the war underpowered but you can't claim it is by much.  25-26 mana regen per tick requires kei and 11 extra mana regen.  Knights don't always have kei on and thus can't always keep up with wars as above.  Palladins probably do better on the defensive side and worse on the offensive side of stacking up with warriors.</div></div><hr />

How many wars can do the rampage trick?  How many knights have tanked quarm.  If one relevant the other relevant unless the numbers of wars with earthshaker is much smaller than knights tanking quarm its fair game.  But I agree with you in that neither affects most toons in game.</div></div><hr />

1. The Rampage trick has already been nerfed, get over it already.<br />
<br />
And if Rogues could figure out a way to do 100k damage in very special situations, once every 4 hours with something that is limited to a few Rogues per server and which ultimately wound up killing themselves as well ?<br />

<br />
When 2 of the dps classes have an ability to do freak damage that is one thing.  But when one of the 2 best defensive classes does it that is different.  The apt analogy is rogues getting a 100,000 hp buff every 4 hours.<br />
<br />
The rampage trick isn't limited to POF.  A group of warriors could use this to do named in any open area with large numbers of trash mobs etc.  .</div></div><hr />

I don't know your toon Thaak so one of several options present itself.  Don't take this a too much flame cause I am not trying to be mean.<br />
<br />
1) Either you are not one of the better warriors and thus it is only natural for the better SKs to outdamage you.  You dex not high, you don't have DS your weapon choice poor not maxed offensive AA etc.<br />
<br />
2) you are one of the better warriors but you optomized for agro, mitigation or hp and not for dps while the Sks you speak of optomised for dps and not mitigation.<br />
<br />
3) there is a real dps advantage to being an sk and no real mitigation offset to balance in warrriors favor.<br />
<br />
4) The nature of SK damage is that they outdamage you for a short time by a lot and you outdamage them for a long time by a little and its easy to conclude that their dps&gt;&gt;&gt;yours like ranger bow damage and pally undead damage.</div></div><hr />

That reminds me of kiting. You know, ranged DPS classes with the ability to take less damage in a one on one fight against a mob than a proper defensive class. <br />

I am all for a warrior get out of death free effect like loh or fd.  You equivalent is suppost to be that bezerk thing you guys do but I agree with you it not as good.  If your mana pool acted as hp but only if you dipped below 0 hp and heals didn't heal mana but kei/FT etc did then that would be similiar to loh in power.<br />
<br />
As for CC or fear I think war should get something of equal value/utility.  I think if you had a whole set of melee spells that used hp as mana you would have equal power with sk/pally who use mana for spells.  Most pally/sk don't view mana different than hp and as long as their is mana its very hard to kill either but mana runs out very fast.  As long as mitigation was similiar you could then be given a larger hp pool cause you have to do your melee effects from that pool.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of power for wars to gain as long as the mitigation/agro balance stays very close to what it has always been.  Or if it changes there are tradeoffs to it.</div></div><hr />

LOL So warriors have to pay trade offs to get upgraded and be on balance with knights?<br />
<br />
<br />
The knights that take damage as good as warriors? <br />
The knights that can use the same uber gear a warrior can PLUS get mana and focus effect out of it? <br />
The knights that have aggro lock, aggro on demand, heals, buffs, CC spells and unique abilities?<br />

The knights that do the clearing in Elemental raids so the casters can burn quick?<br />
The knights that tank PoP bosses that require on demand and ranged aggro?<br />
The knight that can tank PoTime gods under the same conditions as an equally geared warrior. But with total control of aggro?<br />
<br />
Tell me newtank, what trade off have knights paid to be able to do that?  List them please so you can enlighten us.<br />
<br />
Don't know about you, but I see paladins having no trade offs for doing all that shit.  <br />
<br />
Warriors have a lot of trade offs: <br />
Defensive: In order to soak 40% dmg from a mob, our DPS is reduced 40%(so its not viable in exp groups where killing fast is required). It lasts for 3 munutes and it cannot be used again for 7 minutes 30 seconds(nor any other discipline).  Not viable in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Evasive: For 3 minutes we get hit less often, but as trade off, we hit the mob less often. We swing and miss a lot so our dps and aggro is diminished. Not viable in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Precise: For 3 minutes we can hit the mob more often. Our dps increases, but as tradeoff, the mobs can hit use more often. So we take more damage.  20+ minute re-use time of any disc. Not viable when tanking.<br />
<br />
Aggresive: For 3 minutes we can hit a mob harder. Our dps increases, but as tradeoff, the mobs can hit us harder. 20+ minute re-use time of any disc. Not viable when tanking.<br />
<br />
All these disciplines have a detrimental effect, or trade off, which either lower our dps or makes the mobs do more damage to us.<br />
<br />
<br />
On top of that back then in Velious we were branded as a class that soaked hits so well, that as a tradeoff our aggro was crap. <br />
So in order for a group or raid benefit of the superior warrior defense(which was very noticeable), they all had to control their aggro and make sure the mob stayed on the warrior who had crap aggro.<br />
<br />
Our trade off for being the best tank, was our unreliable aggro. <br />
<br />
<br />
Newtank, we been having tradeoffs for a long time and in spades. Can you open your eyes now and see why we are complaining? Can you see why there is no excuse for warriors to be paying these tradeoffs while Knights can tank(our main and only role) just like we do, be masters of aggro, heal, MGB heals, group Mana taps, group atk taps, FD,  rez, buff, CC AND outdamage(another benefit warrior had over the knight classes)<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins do not want to pay any trade offs. Do you remember when Slay Undead was going to be &quot;nerfed&quot; Newtank? <br />
<br />
Before PoP was going to be released, SoE wanted to give SLay Undead additional levels, so it would go off more often and do even more damage. But as a trade off, SU would have worked with the press of a button(ON/OFF for an unlimited ammount of time). When active, the paladins would be doing enormous ammounts of damage, virtually making them an undead DPS class. But as a TRADE OFF, paladins would be hit by undead for 50% more damage. Meaning that they would not be able to TANK while it was activated, they would have been forced to (gasp) work like any other DPS class, avoid getting hit while doing massive damage.<br />
<br />
For paladins that was too much of a &quot;NERF&quot;. They did not want to pay tradeoffs. They wanted to tank and do huge damage to undead.  Both at the same time. <br />
<br />
So SOE decided to leave SU untouched and provide no additional levels for the PoP expansion(which had a LOT of undead content and undead gods)<br />
<br />
Paladins gave massive complaints on how USELESS this would have turned SU, specially when soloing. They could not bare the idea of duo with another tank who kept the mobs attention while they unleashed DPS, <br />
<br />
Funny thing how that &quot;nerf&quot; which was nothing more than a TRADEOFF would have made SU USELESS. But thats the way warriors discipline work, with TRADEOFFS: detrimental effects, limited use and refresh timer that does not allow us to use any other.  They do not have an ON/OFF button with an unlimited timer like SU would of had after the &quot;nerf&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be game breaking if warriors had no tradeoffs. But of course its perfectly normal for paladins to have none. <br />
<br />
<br />

Well you are right about haveing a level 20 character and then quiting.  But it was a troll sk named tanktank.  Rerolled him into an ogre cause getting stunned from front kinda sucks.<br />

no need to even think of nerfing something that depends on you being luckyer then the gods. on top of that the warriors also need a support group slower rezer sower.<br />

Right NewTank? [/QUOTE] <br />
<br />
OK lets sumarize many warriors position.  I know there are warriors who don't feel this way but this is how I see your community.<br />
<br />
1)  Tanking is mitigation and agro.  I think we can agree this what casters want from a tank.<br />
<br />
2) Most warriors believe that warriors should be the #1 best mitigator of damage by a large margin.  This is why you are so upset about quarm.  With defensive you have the ability to be 50% better than same geared knight for 30% of time.<br />
<br />
3) Warriros get higher ac and higher hp than knight throughout the game.   Most warriors see this as fair some as required.<br />
<br />
4) warriors are unhappy with their agro.  Most warriors want initial agro very close to sk.  Specifically they want enough agro so that shamans can cast slow on inc mob and not get agro.<br />
<br />
5) Many warriors don't want utility they just want the raw power.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK now lets look at another view point which I believe is the knights view point as well as the rest of the classes/SOE.<br />
<br />
1)  There will be 3 viable tanking classes  each class will have to be balanced so that a group can take any one of the three just as slower can be done by enc, shammy, bard, bst and cc by enc bard etc.  There may be slight advantages of one over another but nothing major.<br />
<br />
2)  The highest agro tank will have to have some drawback that prevents him from being the only choice for tank.  This could be lower mitigation as it currently is (war ac&gt;knight ac, war defensive&gt;knight defensive etc)<br />
<br />
3) The tank issue will be balanced before the class isssue is balanced.  IE it is more important that each class balances as a tank than that they balance with other classes equally.  For example if a palladin is nerfed some loses agro so that they are no longer a good choice for tank no amount of dps will make up for it short of becoming a dps or healer class which isn't going to happen.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So my point is this.  Warriors need a place as one of the three tanking classes.  With their current level of mitigation relative to knights they can't have similiar agro or they will dominate xp tanking and raid tanking.  In that sense the mitigation hurts warriors because it blocks tanking balance.<br />
<br />
Once the tanking issue is balanced there is lots of utility/power that warriors can get to balance them against the mix of classes without making them so ubertank that knights are useless.  However most of the ideas here at TSW and especially the nerf knights one do not end with 3 tanks and as such are unrealistic.  Its in the tanking expectations that warriors will need to trade, in the overall class balance there is lots of room for you to get uberfied but between the tanks your tanking ability is hard to balance without making you too uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">So you still demand that warriors make tradeoffs while paladins make none. Thanks for proving Vikos' point.</div></div><hr />

Hey newtank, how about answering the post right before yours? You know, Vikos' post. I know I'd certainly like to see your response.  <br />
<br />
I think you are refering to the one where he says what did knights give up over luclin, pop, loy and ldon?<br />
<br />
Warriors went into luclin being insanely overpowered.  During the early days of pop no one would tank there with a knight.  That you are now slightly underpowered after 4 expansions that favored knights over you is proof of how bad it was.  If you look at ldon it actually favors 2 1HS over 1 2HS due to procs augmented.  The tide has shifted back in your favor as it should.<br />
<br />
As for what did knight give up?  SK gave up soloing at high end and fear kiting mobs above 55.  SK gives up progressively the power in both HT and lifetap relative to lower levels.  Both knights gave up the idea that they get parent spells or sk would have rez by now and pally complete heal.  Knights have to spend 2 times the AA at 55 due to having melee and caster components etc.<br />
<br />
But the main point of your question is why are we giving up more than you?  The answer is that you were overpowered.  Your ability to mitigate is still overpowered which is the cause of most of your problems with balance and causeing your overall package to underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">As for what did knight give up? SK gave up soloing at high end and fear kiting mobs above 55. . <br />
<br />
That SKs cant solo mobs above 55? Oh what a trade off. What about warriors? what the hell can we solo?  Last thing i ever soloed was Spiders in Velks. They turned green the moment I hit 61.  ANOTHER of our trade offs for being best tank was the inability to solo at all. We have ALWAYS been group dependant to kill anything. We lacked the spells to heal, fear, FD.  Been this way since I started playing my warrior.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Both knights gave up the idea that they get parent spells or sk would have rez by now and pally complete heal. <br />
<br />
This is another trade off? Being unable to cast the spells of the parent class?  lol Of course if it was up to you, Knights shoudl have all the spells of the Parent class up to level 60 WHILE tanking like warriors.  Of COURSE you dont have all the spells of your parent class you. But you have your Hybrid version of them. Remember, your Caster parent class cannot tank nowhere near as a warrior. <br />
<br />
Knights have to spend 2 times the AA at 55 due to having melee and caster components etc. <br />
<br />
I have over 310 AAs already.  The only thing I have left to spend points is on Resist.  When LdoN came out, I was hoping new AAs would be released so I could continue improving. But this did not happen. There is no point for me to continue doing AA. I have nothing to look forward to.  You see as a tradeoff that you have more AAs to improve your character? <br />
<br />
This is your list of tradeoffs? Thank you for proving my point.<br />
<br />
 So my point is this. Warriors need a place as one of the three tanking classes. With their current level of mitigation relative to knights they can't have similiar agro or they will dominate xp tanking and raid tanking. In that sense the mitigation hurts warriors because it blocks tanking balance. <br />
<br />
Here is when you are wrong . BACK then in VELIOUS , Warrior poor aggro was the trade off for having mitigation NOTICEABLE better than any other melee in the game. With and without defensive.  Back THEN defensive discipline was REQUIRED to take mobs out. <br />
<br />
<br />
In TODAYS game(this is when your head comes out of your ass) Knights mitigate just like warriors. Knight are on the same defensive table as warriors thus mitigate about the same. The difference between the tanks lies in the avoidance. Thanks to the higher skill cap, the warrior AVOIDS approximately 10% better than knights. BUT WAIT! Dont let your head sneak up in your ass again.  <br />
<br />
Knights make up this difference of avoidance by using *gasp* their frickin spells. SKS can lifetap to compensate for the 10% more hits they fail to dodge over warriors. And Paladins can STUN the mob so they dont get hit OR heal themselves!<br />
<br />
You still with me Newtank? Keep that head out just yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok You claim that warriors were OVERPOWERED in Velious comparatively to knights thus being the reason why we havent been upgraded at all. But guess what? In TODAYS game Knights tank like Warriors( we soak damage the same). I am in an elemental guild and knights can surpass my AC when they use their shield to tank and they are within 500-300 of my HP. <br />
<br />
So whats next? You are going to focus that we have a LOT more hp than knights so its ok for warriors to stay as they are?<br />
<br />
How about the spell that is currently on test for Paladins? Aura of the Crusader. The one that is a self buff only that gives Paladins 230 more hp and stacks with everything?  <br />
<br />
What that Newtank ? 230 hp is no big deal?<br />
<br />
Well once some pallies get that buff on, the hp difference between warrior and knights will drop to 300 hp or less(and it gets worse with Time gear).  Which is no big deal either. <br />
<br />
<br />
**So a paladin will tank like a warrior who has no defensive on(Are you on an elemental guild and are aware that many mobs are not tanked with defensive?  Its amazing what a 9khp  1700ac buffed  knight with VT gear and 1 or 2 pieces of elemental can tank in raids. (Do I have to recall you that Defensive is no longer a requirement?)<br />
<br />
<br />
**They have aggro on demand and aggro lock. They can aggro mobs on incoming from a distance. <br />
Paladins have buffs, heals, group heals essential for AE fights, CC spells(root and aggro mobs without damaging them), they can rez in emergencies both in raid and in groups that lack Rezer.<br />
Knights can keep themselves up with lifetaps during Ae fights, they can Snare/FD pull, they can summon corpses, they cant Mana tap and keep a group of clerics fed with mana during long ass fights, they can grant attack buffs to the group. <br />
<br />
**They are prefered exp tanks because they can lock on aggro and take damage as good as any warrior in exp settings.<br />
<br />
**Once we hit the VT/elementals we have about the same AC or close enough to make no damn difference. And the HP gap is a 'No big deal' anymore. <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Whats is left newtank? Defensive? Rampage? that makes up for all the stuff I mentioned you can do? <br />
<br />
<br />
And still upgrading warriors would break the balance according to you . But its obvious to the warriors on this board, after reading your replies. That  YOU version of balance is:<br />
<br />
 Knights&gt;&gt;&gt; Warriors. <br />
<br />
What we want is :<br />
<br />
The totality that is a knight(melee+aggro+spells+AA) to be EQUAL to the totality that is a warrior (melee+aggro+ disciplines+AA)<br />
<br />
Since  the scale is so tipped in the favor of knight to a degree EVERYONE with common sense can see , the only 2 posibilities are:  <br />
1)NERF the knights down by giving them TRADEOFFS. (in the melee or caster side or aggro)<br />
        <br />
 2)Buff up the warriors  in the melee , aggro, disciplines(being able to activate them ala SLay Undead planned &quot;Nerf: before PoP was released)  Whatever the developers deem necesary for the Tanks to be balanced among each other. <br />
<br />
Can't use the excuse of knights being better at exp groups over warriors since we are supposedly the only MTs in raids. This is no longer true(I know, I raid in elementals) and MTing is not the only role knights can fullfill.  But I am probably wasting my time with you.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day, and thanks again for prooving my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S Stop trying to dance around the truth. Face the facts. Everyone else has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">2) Most warriors believe that warriors should be the #1 best mitigator of damage by a large margin. This is why you are so upset about quarm. With defensive you have the ability to be 50% better than same geared knight for 30% of time. <br />
<br />
Let me clue you in on something Newtank(as you appear to be lacking)...we do not use defensive every time it pops, so the idea that we have extra mitigation 30 % of the time is completely false.  We actually take damage marginally better than knights, but with far less agro, and no utility.  Let me repeat this...we take damage marginally  better than a knight.  We use defensive when MAing raids, when killing a named in an exp group, and that is about it.<br />
<br />
You are amusing in some ways...you are fixated on something that some warriors did that has no real bearing on anything(rampage + earthshaker), and you are fixated on knight mitiagation vs a defensive warrior.  Niether has anything  to do with balancing tanks for exp groups.  Nothing at all, zero, nada ziltch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">As for what did knight give up? SK gave up soloing at high end and fear kiting mobs above 55.

<br />
Knights give up nothing for their spellbooks. They bitched and whined until they got put on the same mitigation table as warriors, they whined until the got upgraded spells and more choices for improvement via AA. They whined to avoid the nerf bat for Slay Undead while the monk community got railed without lubricant.<br />
<br />
Guess what...Paladins DO get complete heal. You get the goddamn thing CLICKABLE on Soulfire. Sure, there's only a couple of charges on it, but it's been proven that paladins can solo the fucking dragons to get the books, so the difficulty of the quest is moot.<br />
<br />
But the main point of your question is why are we giving up more than you? The answer is that you were overpowered. Your ability to mitigate is still overpowered which is the cause of most of your problems with balance and causeing your overall package to underpowered.Like hell we're overpowered. When a paladin TEN FUCKING LEVELS below me can tank as well as I can with VASTLY superior aggro to boot, I call foul. When a paladin of equal level with relatively similar gear is within 200 hp of me with identical buffs, I call foul. When that same paladin can stun a mob to avoid even being hit and thus negate my vaunted mitigation bonus as well as heal himself, provide aggro lock and do it all with a 2hs while I have to cripple my DPS with 2 1hs and pray that I get a damn proc, you guessed it, I call foul.<br />
<br />
In the years I've been playing, warriors have never been overpowered. Knights were underpowered, but the pendulum has swung FAR the other way.<br />
<br />
Tap dance your way around someone else's issues, I'm sure you'll find someone with some pocket change for you. Maybe then you can buy a fucking clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Holy crap. Your persistance in maintaining your absurdly erroneous positions on nearly all issues at hand and the way you trip yourself up in contradiction is amazing!<br />
<br />
Warriors went into luclin being insanely overpowered.<br />
Warriors were never insanely overpowered. If anything, they were simply good at what they were designed to do: Tanking. Knight classes weren't as good as tanking - why? - they are a derived class with certain qualities of a warrior (inferior tanking ability) and some qualities of a casting class (some spells common to their parent casting class awarded at a later level, and some spells unique to the hybrid class). Of course knights have been adjusted, as their tanking skills are now nearly on par with a warrior's, to the point that a knight class is not only an acceptable tank, but a *preferred* tank for virtually any encounter in the game. <br />
<br />
During the early days of pop no one would tank there with a knight.<br />
The following scenario occurred &quot;during the early days of pop&quot;: My nearly full group encountered a paladin soloing the area we intended to camp. After a brief exchange, the solution was to invite the paladin to the group to take the MT position while I was relegated to a DPS/off-tanking position. <br />
<br />
That you are now slightly underpowered after 4 expansions that favored knights over you is proof of how bad it was.<br />
(I'll ignore the fact that this statement simply doesn't make sense...)<br />
Slightly underpowered? Slightly underpowered?! As has been stated probably hundreds or thousands of times on this forum, the magnitude by which knights' agro management and general utility outshine the warriors' deficiency of agro management and general utility is not a slight gap. I feel obliged to mention here that although I would like to see the warrior's agro management ability increased, I personally am not all that interested in much utility beyond superior tanking ability.<br />
<br />
from a previous post:<br />
Warriors need a place as one of the three tanking classes.<br />
No. Warriors are the parent class for the tanking hybrids. By definition, warriors are the tanking class and by nature should have superior tanking ability. When warriors are considered as - not only &quot;one of the three tanking classes&quot; - but the *inferior* of the tanking classes in all but a select few situations, there is something seriously wrong. &quot;An apt analogy&quot; would be for clerics to be warming the benches while druids and shamans are selected for healing positions. Obviously a druid or shaman is acceptable as a healer in many cases, but a cleric is almost always preferred.<br />
<br />
back to your last post...<br />
If you look at ldon it actually favors 2 1HS over 1 2HS due to procs augmented.<br />
I'm having a little trouble understanding what you are trying to say here also. If you mean that a warrior is preferable to a knight in LDoN adventures because of the Duel-Wield skill, I would have to wonder if you even own the LDoN expansion and question whether or not you've even participated in an LDoN adventure. Speed is of the essence in LDoN. Slow early, nuke early, kill fast. A knight's agrolock is unquestionably preferable in an LDoN adventure. The concrete nature of a knight's agro management is preferable to the random nature of a warrior's reliance on proccing weapons and the inconsistent Taunt skill to manage agro. EB/TB procs were not the answer, and neither are Anger augmentations, duel-wielding or not.<br />
<br />
The tide has shifted back in your favor as it should.<br />
Why yes it should! Look, we can agree on something. :eek: But sadly, it has not.<br />
<br />
As for what did knight give up? SK gave up soloing at high end and fear kiting mobs above 55.<br />
I gave up trying to solo for experience a long time ago. Around level 10 or so if I remember correctly. What's your point?<br />
<br />
SK gives up progressively the power in both HT and lifetap relative to lower levels.<br />
Good observation. I can think of many, many attributes of any class that don't scale up proportionally to their level. You probably can too. So again, what's your point? If you are trying to demonstrate the sacrifices that knights make, your examples are invalid and irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Both knights gave up the idea that they get parent spells or sk would have rez by now and pally complete heal.<br />
You gave up this notion, did you? Is it your belief that a shadowknight should have access to all of the spells that a necromancer does? Is it conceivable to you that a paladin should be able to cast Complete Healing? Yeah, me neither. Your statement is unfounded and ridiculous. Hybrid classes by nature should not have access to all of the same spells that their parent caster classes do, just as they should not have tanking abilities equivalent to their parent melee class.<br />
<br />
Knights have to spend 2 times the AA at 55 due to having melee and caster components etc.<br />
I can't claim to have the in-depth knowledge of paladins' or shadowknights' AA paths to dispute this. I can't help but wonder though if you've even played either class above 55...<br />
<br />
But the main point of your question is why are we giving up more than you? The answer is that you were overpowered. Your ability to mitigate is still overpowered... <br />
The warrior's damage mitigation is not overpowered. Disciplines aside, it is my understanding that damage mitigation is computed just the same for warriors, shadowknights, and paladins. And you can't possibly think that the warrior's defensive discipline is overpowered, can you? If so, I urge you to do some research, since ALL of the warrior discplines are pretty disappointing. <br />
<br />
...which is the cause of most of your problems with balance and causeing your overall package to underpowered.<br />
I think it would be safe to say that the warrior's &quot;overall package&quot; is primarily the warrior's ability to mitigate damge. You mentioned that the warrior's ability to mitigate damage is &quot;overpowered.&quot; Now, you say that the warrior's &quot;overall package&quot; is underpowered? This is caused by the warrior's &quot;overpowering&quot; damage mitigation? How does that work?<br />
<br />
newtank: Please refrain from posting your spurious drivel here. It's compelling intelligent people to waste their time reading and responding to it. I urge you to go do your homework before you start spouting out your ludicrous stances on class balance because everything you say gives me the impression that you simply don't know what the fuck you are talking about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Yesod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">OK lets sumarize many warriors position.  I know there are warriors who don't feel this way but this is how I see your community.<br />
<br />
Those would be clueless warriors .. or warriors that have not passed lvl 9.<br />
<br />
1)  Tanking is mitigation and agro.  I think we can agree this what casters want from a tank.<br />
...and since we lack the so called 'aggro' (thus loosing 1 part of the formula), this makes us no tanks. or half tanks if you want me to put it that way... is that what a warrior is?<br />
<br />
2) Most warriors believe that warriors should be the #1 best mitigator of damage by a large margin.  This is why you are so upset about quarm.  With defensive you have the ability to be 50% better than same geared knight for 30% of time.<br />
Good, next time I go xping every mob i am gonna tank I will use def to show my superior mitigation over a knight, but it will be unfortunate that my group will wait 7min 30sec waiting on me to be rdy for next mob... HI, EATRH TO BASE, HAVE WE MET? Seriously, I wish it was only about Quram... but this is about EP Gods, PoTime gods... and I am there now and I get to sit and watch Paladins do most of the tanking..<br />
<br />
3) Warriros get higher ac and higher hp than knight throughout the game.   Most warriors see this as fair some as required.<br />
See, this is where you clearly prove to us that you have no fucken clue on what your talking about... Knights AC are in par with war's AC, if not even more. My SK fellows in the guild when were in EP their AC would be over 2k when I was 1850... explain this to me sir...<br />
<br />
4) warriors are unhappy with their agro.  Most warriors want initial agro very close to sk.  Specifically they want enough agro so that shamans can cast slow on inc mob and not get agro.<br />
Dude, hell with initial agro or snap agro or wtfever you wanna call it, i just want to be able to LOCK the agro.. not tank the mob for a good 60 seconds before I can call for assist or ask the shaman / chanter / druids / casters to cast away, and even then i might loose it, cos hey, I might not get lucky with my hate procs. so it comes down to luck (and lets not go on about the taunt).<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Many warriors don't want utility they just want the raw power.<br />
Last time I choose my class because it was all about POWER, because we are pure muscle and armor, we are to be hit and hit back, exactly the same reason people choose wizards, cos they are all about nuking power and fireballs and lore and and and...<br />
<br />
OK now lets look at another view point which I believe is the knights view point as well as the rest of the classes/SOE.<br />
<br />
1)  There will be 3 viable tanking classes  each class will have to be balanced so that a group can take any one of the three just as slower can be done by enc, shammy, bard, bst and cc by enc bard etc.  There may be slight advantages of one over another but nothing major.<br />
Dude, taking a tank in an xp group these days is a last resort thingy, hell, if i am a caster, I'd prefer a knight / paladin these days over a warrior in the group, are you still playing EQ at all n00btank?<br />
<br />
2)  The highest agro tank will have to have some drawback that prevents him from being the only choice for tank.  This could be lower mitigation as it currently is (war ac&gt;knight ac, war defensive&gt;knight defensive etc)<br />
Read my 1st responce about defensive and ac... stop using that as the basis of your argument, because its moot.<br />
<br />
3) The tank issue will be balanced before the class isssue is balanced.  IE it is more important that each class balances as a tank than that they balance with other classes equally.  For example if a palladin is nerfed some loses agro so that they are no longer a good choice for tank no amount of dps will make up for it short of becoming a dps or healer class which isn't going to happen.  <br />
Once again, very clueless comment... lets not pull up parses on LDoN undead adventures (since most of LDoN is loaded with undead) and watch the parses there of wars and knights.. and hi, SK dots? or thats not dps? Man, I wish I had the link to that post where 6 paladins did a hard ldon adventures and unleashed hell in that place... Now tell me, can 6 warriors do the same?? Did not think so...<br />
<br />
So my point is this.  Warriors need a place as one of the three tanking classes.  With their current level of mitigation relative to knights they can't have similiar agro or they will dominate xp tanking and raid tanking.  In that sense the mitigation hurts warriors because it blocks tanking balance.<br />
I dunno, but is n00btank contradiciting himself or is it me unable to comprehend what he is blabbering about?<br />
<br />
Seriously dude, wake up, and stop dribbling bs here... go back to your knight's haven...</div></div><hr />

<br />
adding these 2 augs will give you about 3 procs per minute. I understand addition and/or multiplication is hard, but that is not 500 per minute.<br />

<br />

<br />
Knights can add thier own proc buffs so can have 3 procs versus wars 4, and when using 2 handers, knights will have more procs than warrior.<br />

<br />
<br />
Here is one thing I notice almost all Knights unable to grasp....<br />
<br />
There should NOT an equality in tanking between Knights and Warriors.<br />
You keep saying that Warrior should have as much advantage in mitigation, as Knights have advantage in Aggro.<br />
To form an equilibrum in EQ's 3 tanks...<br />
<br />
NO<br />
<br />
Yes, the 3 tanks should be viable options for tanking.<br />
<br />
But the Warrior, the specialist, should be best, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
You f**king knights don't understand, that as a hybrid, you're suppose to be handicapped, you're suppose to be less preferred in groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors currently are extremely generous to want to only equalise general tanking..... and you're spitting back at them...<br />
<br />
When a group is looking for a tank, they should hesitate in taking the LFG paladin... just incase a Warrior shows his face.<br />
We sacrificed everything for this advantage.<br />
And you chose to be only 2nd best, because you like spells.<br />
<br />
The way it is now, Knights are the best, groups wait for knights to show their face. While Warriors just suck ass....<br />
It should be the other way around.<br />
But we'de be happy with just and equality....<br />
and you call us whiners, and say the situation isn't that bad?...<br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro should be equal between Knights and Warriors,<br />
while Warriors have a visible advantage in mitigation.<br />
<br />
And that aggro, should not be as retarded as it is nowdays, for knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Go shop this view around in other class boards you deserve the abuse you would face with the idea that warriors were never overpowered relative to knights.  I don't mean knight boards I mean cleric, druid, shammy etc. see if the neutral parties think of your idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here is one thing I notice almost all Knights unable to grasp....<br />
<br />
There should NOT an equality in tanking between Knights and Warriors.<br />
You keep saying that Warrior should have as much advantage in mitigation, as Knights have advantage in Aggro.<br />
To form an equilibrum in EQ's 3 tanks...<br />
<br />
NO<br />
<br />
Yes, the 3 tanks should be viable options for tanking.<br />
<br />
But the Warrior, the specialist, should be best, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
You f**king knights don't understand, that as a hybrid, you're suppose to be handicapped, you're suppose to be less preferred in groups.<br />
.  <br />
<br />
Its almost too easy.  My whole point from the beggining of this post is this...Warriors want to be &gt;knights not equal to knights but greater than knights.  With the current dynamics specifically that warriors can mitigate damage much much better than knights SOE is forced to give you worse agro in order to balance the tanking part of the 3 tanking classes.<br />
<br />
The desire to be best raid tank and best group tank isn't going to happen.  Trying to get it actually is hurting the warrior cause believe it or not.</div></div><hr />

We all know newtank is about as clueless as they come however:<br />
<br />
What role are we leaving a paladin if we say that the warrior should be the preferred tank in the game (xp and raid)?  I think an unfortunate byproduct of EQ is that we want to pigeon hole everybody into tank, DPS, healer etc.  The knights have a valid point that if SoE just blatently gave in to ever warrior demand then a knight would be lucky to find a group if ever.  Then again not that I mind that a whole lot either.  Certainly warriors need improvements, but where do we really leave paladin's and sk's?  As a substandard tank will they ever find a spot in a group?  <br />
<br />
All 3 tank classes are fighting for the #1 tank spot of which there is only 1 per group.  That is the crux of the problem only 1 spot for a tank period.  All three classes are not know as DPS machines (well sk's may have good DPS but not the first class one thinks of when we talk raw DPS).  The biggest problem is really none of the classes are really adaptable to become the DPS part of a group, maybe you can throw a SK or Paly on stun/snare duty but that would be about it.  The utility with their spell line is good, but in a group setting it hardly earns them a spot in front of any class.  They do have some utility which is more than any warrior at the moment.    <br />
<br />
I'd also point out the classic knight arguement, &quot;yeah keep us on top, or we'll be back in kunark&quot;  is still lame.  I won;t dispute that making a warrior hands and above better than you won;t make you feel like you are in kunark again, but it is still no excuse to make a warrior the 3rd worst tank in the game.  You didn;t like it, we don;t like it  . . . no one likes it.  It's also no excuse for the obvious; hybrid's traded tanking ability for utility . . . don;t cry now that you can;t be the be all end all of tanking (you purposfully gave that up).  I do think that things need to change to make all three classes valuable to a group, and not just one paly/sk/war to 1 group.  Combo's such as paly + sk + others ; war + sk + others ; war + war + others should all work and not be the infamous gimp group.  <br />
<br />
This is not to give any credit to newtank, because he is quite simply a moron of the first rank.  The rampage trick  is no justification for any part of class balance period; if rampage needs to be nerfed then maybe SU3 needs a carefull looking over also.  I simply think we (warriors) are all getting caught up in a mob mentality.  I would like to see some changes but let's at least have a place for the extra war/paly/sk in a group that doesn't totally gimp the group.</div></div><hr />

That SKs cant solo mobs above 55? Oh what a trade off. What about warriors? what the hell can we solo?  Last thing i ever soloed was Spiders in Velks. They turned green the moment I hit 61.  ANOTHER of our trade offs for being best tank was the inability to solo at all. We have ALWAYS been group dependant to kill anything. We lacked the spells to heal, fear, FD.  Been this way since I started playing my warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have over 310 AAs already.  The only thing I have left to spend points is on Resist.  When LdoN came out, I was hoping new AAs would be released so I could continue improving. But this did not happen. There is no point for me to continue doing AA. I have nothing to look forward to.  You see as a tradeoff that you have more AAs to improve your character? <br />

I think the best way we can move in the same direction is for you to focus on how you can have 2 warriors in a group and have them both wanted/usefull.  If you do this within the bounds of making warriors balanced within 3 viable tanking classes and also within balancing warriors with all other classes you are set.  For example giving warriors rogue damage isn't a fair way to make 2 warriors attractive.<br />
<br />
Personally i can't see that without giving warriors most of their power increase from &quot;utility&quot; type abilities that are varied enough that 2 wars can be doing 2 seperate things in a group just like sk and pally can do multiple things within a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole &quot;group&quot; and &quot;raid&quot; tank ideas is something that should have been buried a long time ago.  You will never make it to be a &quot;raid&quot; tank if you can;t at least be a good &quot;group&quot; tank, and a &quot;raid&quot; tank is still a very good &quot;group&quot; tank unless the people in the group are all ebay'ers.  Why can;t we just have sk/war/paly as all good &quot;tanks&quot; and leave it there.  Warriors need to have their nitch, and by description that should be superior survivability, but equally all three classes really need improvement on the utility part.  Sk's and Paly's do have some utility (compared to the warriors ZERO utility) but something should be done to make 2 tanks in a group a viable option (not a gimp fest). <br />
<br />
 I still think as far as tanking though War should always be the superior tank, that's why we all play warriors.  We didn;t want fancy spells, or soloing, we wanted to get into the mobs face and crush some skulls.  We need stuff to do when we are not tanking, besides trade skills and /lfg.  Warriors need to be the best tanks like clerics are the best healers, just carve out something for all the tank classes to do when they are not in the MT role.  Of course newtank can;t even grasp that concept . . . if paly's don't stay at the top oh noooozzzzz we are back in kunaarrk, we'll never group.</div></div><hr />

fyi the only decent slow proc weapon you can get is a truncheon of doom (50% slow) but you'd better be praying because the RNG is not all that friendly.  Some things you should remember when considering why warriors cannot solo.<br />
<br />
*  we have no way of healing ourselves during a fight.  That means either we have the DPS, and mitigation to last or we don't.  We don;t have even a 450point heal, a LH or other skill to compensate.  There is nothing a warrio can do to tip the odds in his favor by skill or anything; hit auto attack and hope the RNG is kind to you.<br />
<br />
* the only spells we get are proc's on weapons, and you can;t exactly plan when they will go off.  We can;t snare a mob at will, or slow it even if the weapon posesses that ability.  Also the weapons with those useful abilities are all subpar weapons as far as DPS.  <br />
<br />
* we chose our class knowing full well that we would not be the solo machine class.  We traded that to be the best tanks.  Hybrid's traded the #1 tank spot to have those spells so they could solo.  Now hybrids want both #1 tank spot and their spells, and warrior get  . . . nothing.<br />

I regularly do ldon with 2-4 tanks in my group( me and 1-3 others).   I like having the tanks because it lets us do without CC.  I am in dps configuration and don't have any of the sk CC spells up when I do this.  By losing the CC who would not have done much dps and replacing with a war the war dps only needs to be 2/3 or so monk dps to make this configuration viable.  <br />
For that configuration I think war dps, peak dps or utility would benifit multiple war in a single group best.<br />
<br />
What are your successful multi war groups and how did they work?</div></div><hr />

As for what did knight give up?  SK gave up soloing at high end and fear kiting mobs above 55.  <br />
<br />
Fairly small point, but it's not like SKs can no longer solo after 55.  They cannot fear a MOB that is over 55th level, but 55th level mobs are still quite blue to 65.<br />
<br />
Ignoring fear kiting, I know 65 SKs who solo quite well in valor by aggro kiting crystalline golems around.</div></div><hr />

OK 9k sk with 6k mana has about 15k effective hp if he uses all 6k to make hp add another 3k for soulabrasion effects etc.  Effective hp 18k maxed out mana takes long time to med up after fight.  Casting the taps takes away from sk damage.<br />
<br />
similar 10 k war gets slow proc which makes his effective hp 15k but he also gets defensive which makes his effective hp 22.5k While in defensive the war does less damage say 68% of sk damage but similiar or higher damage shield is possible.  Add in that any regen of hp or aug lifetap procs that occurs during the fight gives war 4 times what it gives sk because war hp buffered by slow and defensive.  With 3 min fight with 2 75 pt procs that gives 900 hp returned from 2 procs per min but with slow and defensive this gives you effective 3600 hp.<br />
<br />
War in optomized solo configuration has effective hp of 26.1k but does 68% damage.<br />
<br />
SK gets 18.45k (added in single lifetap proc aug) but does 100% damage<br />
<br />
War with good DS will out solo sk on low damage fast hitting mobs because of higher effective hp.  SK will out solo war on hard hitting mobs but not by large factor.  True its only good for 4 mobs per hour.  But warriors can solo if they spend the time on it.</div></div><hr />

Umm havn't you ever heard of the RNG . . . a proc on the last hit is worth about . . . . nothing.  And yes it has happened, and that is partly why you do not see warriors soloing much of anything . . . ever.  If we want a DS we have to buy a potion (the clicky ones are really not all that good).  Defensive reduces the damage output by a more significant margin than 25%.  While soloing a mob you may infact take longer than 3 minutes in which case you are now toast.  Long long ago warriors gve up on the idea of soloing because it's a pointless endevor . . . 4 mobs an hour who are you kiding?  <br />
<br />
newtank get over it, warriors gave up soloing to be good group/raid tanks.  Only with the best gear, max aa's will we even touch a mob solo and even then the results are not all that impressive.  All of our needed spells for soloing come as procs and we have to wait for a lucky round to get it to work and hope it's not resisted.  We may proc 2x during a fight . . . but it might be the last minute of the fight so what does it matter anyhow.  Lastly at the level of gear and aa's required to solo, most warriors no longer care to solo in the first place, because they are either raiding, or adventuring with a group anyhow.</div></div><hr />

If you were on the same mitigation table and were able to consistently cast through getting beat on (same assumption sk tapping has) then you would indeed be a better soloer than a war or sk.  of course you have to factor your melee dps relative to a war or sk because you are using your mana for healin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Sounds pretty accurate to me uhrlik.  Oh, and about this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Its almost too easy. My whole point from the beggining of this post is this...Warriors want to be &gt;knights not equal to knights but greater than knights. With the current dynamics specifically that warriors can mitigate damage much much better than knights SOE is forced to give you worse agro in order to balance the tanking part of the 3 tanking classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
First, warriors do not mitigate damage much better than knights. WE ARE ON THE SAME MITIGATION TABLE AS YOU!!! WE MITIGATE THE SAME.!!!  The only exception to this is 3 minutes out of every 10 we can be defensive, and during that time our DPS drops by 35%.  If you honestly think that is balanced when compared to the fact that you can mitigate JUST AS WELL AS A NONDEFENSIVE WARRIOR if all you do is melee, and mitigate a damn sight better when you factor in stuns for paladins, and taps for sks, plus reap the huge benefits of utility that your spellbook provides.....well you're just an ignorant jackass.  Which you've pretty much proven in spades already in this thread.<br />
<br />
You're right about one thing though, warriors do want to be better than knights at the one thing we were designed for.  Tanking. It's what we do. It's ALL we do.  We're the parent class you're class' tank side was based on; you should NEVER under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE be BETTER at pure tanking than we are.  Jackass.</div></div><hr />

newtank, sk's can kite ( fear or later aggro kite ) therefore: apply not getting hit into your hp calculations. <br />
<br />
I will also tell you dps (especially ranged) is first in soloing, followed by regeneration (including healing). Not mitigation or hp pools. <br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said before, come back after you nerf kiting.  <br />
<br />
A real beef warriors have soloing wise is that hp regen in war isn't higher than hp regen in knights.<br />
<br />
Knights get mana regen and hp regen non casters  should equivalent hp regen to knight hp and mand regen combined.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it's been said before (and please for the love of all that is digital and good listen), knights are on the same mitigation table as warriors. We mitigate or avoid 10% better because of slightly higher skill caps. HOWEVER (and this is the part you need to remember), Knights also get heals, stuns or lifetaps that UTTERLY NEGATE that 10% difference.<br />
<br />
I have more for you, but I want that to sink in first. We don't want your head to explode, do we? Besides, you never read or reply to a post that has any form of facts in it.</div></div><hr />

knights can only spend the mana once... either they spend it on the better mitigation you have or they spend it on the better dps you have from melee.  Allowing them to equal you in non-defensive mitigation or in dps but not both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">knights can only spend the mana once<br />
<br />
Stop please, I am hurting myself from laughing so hard.  Are you trying to say that knights don't regen mana?  Or are you trying to say that you can only cast one spell at a time?  If the first, then you are obviously wrong, if the second...well boohoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">Uh huh. Sure. Keep telling yourself that. I'm going to give you a couple of pieces of KNOWN information here, so brace yourself.<br />
<br />
1. In order for me to keep remotely reliable aggro, I need to switch to dual wielding which cripples my dps. All the while, knights trod their merry way using 2hs weapons and exceeding my dps while maintaining aggro lock.<br />
<br />
2. A SINGLE STUN OR LIFETAP is enough to negate any hp or mitigation difference. Take a minute if you need that to sink in.<br />
<br />
As far as spending the mana once, you get caster focus effects, kei and flowing thought. You may only spend it once, but it takes you 3 friggin' hours to get through it... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is your dps with 2 1HS weapons?  Cause rangers and monks don't seem to be crippled using them.<br />
If you are talking 1 tap per 1 min fight you are only going to be able to sustain ~250 hp worth of heal with that over time using all a sks mana.  Which would put both tanks very close to even again.  Before the war uses defensive.<br />
My point has never been warriors=knights at the present time it has been that there isn't a huge difference.  My perception of the counter point is that unless war&gt;knight in ALL possible tanking combinations then you won't be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks and rangers get a lot of other special abilities to augment their weapon damages and you know it. Stop tap dancing.<br />
<br />
You'll notice that I said that stuns heals and lifetaps negated a warriors hp and mitigation bonus, correct? Read my last post again if you have to, it's there, I promise. Thus, your &quot;tanks are very close&quot; statement draws a &quot;No shit&quot; from me.<br />
<br />
Oh, and while I'm at it, stop bringing defensive into a group discussion. In an exp group, unless the shit has hit the fan, a warrior will NEVER USE IT! Got it? We don't hit it and wait for it to refresh every ten minutes. Not ever.</div></div><hr />

Wow you are a poster child for what I am talking about.  Everyone please read the first post in his link.<br />
<br />
It compares war dps while defensive in effect (40% reduced damage) against knight dps.  It then goes on to say there no mitigation difference between war and knights.  <br />
<br />
<br />
LOL... time for you to take some reading comprehension courses bud... I mentioned that using defensive cuts those warrior DPS numbers by an ADDITIONAL 40%... I did not compare  a war defensive DPS to knight  DPS, the numbers there are not taking defensive into account.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you take war higher damage with a 2HS than sk of 12% (your number 100 dps vs 88 dps).  <br />
<br />
You obviously did not read the thread... you missed the entire point... MOST warriors need to dual wield in order to attempt to get and hold aggro... thus the DPS numbers are for a warrior DUAL WEILDING... now.. a knight does not even have to melee to lock aggro... thus the Knights DPS numbers are 2handers.... are you seeing some light at the end of the tunnel yet?<br />
<br />
 That isn't counting warrior bezerk when below 40% health.<br />
<br />
Umm.. what are you smoking.... crippling blows are nothing but eyecandy and dont even parse to HALF a point of DPS..... in fact... beserk usually is only an indicator for lazy clerics that they need to ch the tank... ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Newtank,<br />
I am not even going to bother to quote any more of your gibberish ( mostly because you missed the two above pints entirely and based your argument around the numbers there not understanding them.. thus invalidating all of the assumptions you have made); however, I do feel the need to mention one other fallacy... The down side of defensive is that a warrior does alot less DPS... how do you think that is.... oh yeah... we hit less often.. thus building aggro even more slowly.... making us even more of a slave to the RNG... since most of our hate is now generated from procs (well... most is anyway.. but you get the picture)...<br />
<br />
Why do you think on raids you give your MA time to get aggro....<br />
<br />
No warrior in his or her right mind would EVER continuosly cycle defensive in a XP group... are you nuts? Maybe a boss mob here or there but thats it... defensive wont save you bacon on a slow CH... its not that nice... (a few others might might however, but have insanely large reuse timers hehe).</div></div><hr />

I think the apt analogy is that unless the amount of damage being taken is large a druid is a better  choice for healer than a cleric, due to dps and damage shiled.  Even though they are both healers and clerics are definetly better healers than druids.</div></div><hr />

Looks like knights are going to get a relative but not absolute nerf.  The new combat system should give pure melee a lot more ability and fix the problems you have without nerfing knights current abilities.<br />
<br />
SOE has published enough details that I think they  have all the particulars worked out and there no point in lobbying for one approach or another.  As a hybrid I am looking forward to it because we will get a weaker version of it than you but a small power increase is still an increase =).<br />

If any of you are on tunare server between lvl 48 and 55 and having any trouble finding a group send me a tell =).  Unless you were rude on here and have a name I remember.

Sorry if I don't feel for knights who think this change to melee combat (a system they engage in just as much as melees) is a NERF in any way shape or form.</div></div><hr />

And in response to your post: *makes jacking off motions* Oh no, the Paladins and Shadowknights won't be sympathetic to our plight of 'Who gives a shit?' <br />
<br />
Didn't you quit or something?<br />

<br />
This quote can be found in two different sources that I'm aware of, possibly more:<br />
<br />
1. First Reference:<br />
<br />
Page 103 from the &quot;Junior Shadowknight's guide to bulletin board debates&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Often times when debating topics like tanking balance, and relative power, an evil man will post on a thread.    This evil man is the source of much power, and will oftentimes engage in comments which will confuse you, reports have been filed with the Junior Shadowknights Society that it has taken upwards of a year sometimes for our members to realize that what sounded like confusing gibberish was actually an insult in the form of a reference to something which is relatively difficult to remember during the course of the debate.   As an example, one of our up and coming shining stars of bulletin board debates, &quot;suckmygangrenoussctrotum&quot; was confused by a reference to an early 90's movie which he was not familiar with.  it wasnt' until his parents began letting him watch R-Rated movies and he saw it, that it clicked on him that he had been insulted months earlier.   Poor junior shadowknight tried to respond at the time, only to appear the fool for having taken such a long time to actually understand what was being said months eariler.    <br />
<br />
It is important that young shadowknights not fall into this trap.   This evil being is called &quot;Furor&quot; and we recommend the following tactics in dealing with him.   First, open every statement you make to him with &quot;Weren't you supposed to have quit EQ?' or something paraphrasing this.   Your junior shadowknight troopmaster should be able to help you come up with different ways to phrase this.   See him, if he's in jail, see his immediate subordinate.   We at Junior Shadowknights of Norrath have decided that this phrase has the effect on this &quot;Furor&quot; that Kryptonite does on superman.   It is his sole weakness, and eventually after hearing it repeated enough he will eventually simply die after losing his powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The Second reference is in a more obscure work known as &quot;How to look smart on EQ Boards without putting in the effort&quot;.   Page 79, int he chapter &quot;Shadowknights r Smartur&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;After you've destroyed warriors by saying 'u suk omgz, ur dumb cuz you just hit attack and taunt and ne1 can do that be4 level 2'.   Really sock it to them, and point out that you can aggro better than them, and that this makes you more skilled.   Remember, it's not reality you're after, it's a feeling of dominance.   You dont' need to win the logical portion of the debate, just enough one liners to feel smug, then walk away declaring that you've met your goals.   The cream of the crop of the one liners is if you come across Furor by saying something along the lines of &quot;didn't you quit EQ?&quot;.    Praise yourself for the originality and creativity of such a statement and leave the board immediately.&quot;</div></div><hr />
