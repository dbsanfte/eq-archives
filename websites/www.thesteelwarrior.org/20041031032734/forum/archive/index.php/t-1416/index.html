<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maineeak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First and foremost , long time reader , first time poster, so wanna say hello to every1. I have a question in regards to weapons that proc a slowing effect . I was intrested in getting one and have been thinking about which 1 i should go with? here are my intentions.....I am currently a 55 warr , 2 boxing with a 45 cleric. i would like to start the fight with a slowing weapon to slow mob (pray for proc), then switch to my gsot to keep aggro . <br />
<br />
so i guess the question i am asking here is this...<br />
<br />
what weapon or weapons provide the best slowing effect that can be purchased? if the best slowing weapon is not able to be purchased , is the quest or mob easy enough for a 55 war and a 45 cleric to take down ? <br />
<br />
<br />
 any information on this would be greatly appreciated.stay cool every1 and  thanx ahead of time to the one's that can answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most warriors seem to have a ToD in their bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Truncheon of doom is the best slow you can attain for a warrior.  Buy one, they arnt that expensive these days.<br />
<br />
Other weapons have slow procs, but nothing more than 35%, ToD is the only way to go as far as proc slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your really worried as far as tanking also, you can try to kill vaniki and get a willsapper or pick up a wavecrasher in Siren's grotto, both have a lower % slow but being a 1h wep you might proc it quicker then switch to ToD for the real slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maineeak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">-thanx for the info. i have been looking for a ToD on the nameless (gameless) server and have not had any luck in doing so. either the ppl that get 1, keep it or the drop has been alot more difficult to come by. If any1 on the nameless server has 1 of these they would like to sell, send either maineeak or trats a tell in game. thanx again for the replies. stay cool every1.   -DoC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turgan7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am looking to buy one on the 7th so I check bazaar from time to time. The only one I ever saw for sale was 60k which I am neither willing nor able to spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I bought my ToD for 8k (IIRC) 3 months ago or so on EMarr. However, it did take me several weeks of searching. As was stated, I think it's a very rare drop and once a warrior has it, these don't change hands often.<br />
<br />
GL in picking one up though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is possible to camp for the ToD where it actually drops instead of camping the bazaar, heheh.  One good group can easily hold the camp and loot is fairly nice in terms of cash and gems.</div></div><hr />
