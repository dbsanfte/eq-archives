<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 31 froglok warrior and having a bit of trouble keeping all of my weapon skills maxxed out as I level up.  Currently, my 1HS is 150ish and all 4 other skills are in the low to mid 80's.  I try to work my off skills as much as I can, but I've had some rather lousy pullers lately and keep having to deal with 3 and 4 mob pulls.  So I have to switch back to my 2 one handed swords to keep us from getting wiped.<br />
I've been grouping in DSP since the last couple kills of lvl 29 and the exp seems kinda slow.  Most of that is probably because there are always 2 lvl 40s in the group.  I would think that with these longer lvls I could get more off skill ups but it doesn't seem to be working.<br />
I know the epic is the 2 one handers that combine into a two handed sword.  Should I focus on just 1HS and 2HS or should I keep trying to raise my blunt and piercing skills?<br />

Between 40 and 50 is the easiest time to max them, since levels slow down and they have a cap at lvl 40 that is lifted at 51, giving you plenty of time.</div></div><hr />

As you level the levels continue to take longer so you have a lot longer to get skills up. You never know what will drop in your lap:) Also I know a lot of Warriors 50+ use a Windblade (2hs) for agro when MTing. So you won't always use 2 weapons. <br />
<br />
As for keeping 1hb and piercing up, get a decent one and put it in your off hand. Keep it there. Always get dex buffs. <br />
<br />
As for 2hs and 2hb, I'm not sure how warriors get these up if they are main tanking. I would imagine that you would just use these in groups that you aren't MT in. My main is a beasty, I'm sure I'll run into the same issues that you have when I level my warrior up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From 40-50 your skills all stay maxxed at 200 (except for offense/defense they go up a lil) so then grab some decent weps (Lammy, Jarsath Trident, Cane of Tranquil, Stormwood Battle Staff, and some 2h)</div></div><hr />

That is unless you are a worthless PL twinkie =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks guys.  I'll raise them as I can.  The 1 handed weapons should be easy enough, but i'll need to have someone else doing the tanking to work on the 2 handers.<br />
My current weapons are decent for now, but I'll need better: Shaded Blade, Crystallized Longsword, Crystalline Spider Fang, Cane of the Tranquil, Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword, and a Mithril Staff.  I'd love to get a Frostbringer/Lammy combo but 9k is way out of my price range for now.  I'm hoping a friend of mine will make me a Black Acrylia Halberd when he gets his blacksmithing high enough if I supply him with the stuff for 2 tries.  I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to piercing weapons, the fang came from my monk while he was in Velks.  I'll get the blunt weapons from my monk as he outgrows the ones he has now.<br />
