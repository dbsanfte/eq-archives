I've seen people who don't even own a shield putting Shield of Strife or Aegis of Earth on their magelo, just to make their e-penis *thx for the quote from your own magelo, Dima* bigger. Even if they do have it, they NEVER wear it, and in fact often wear 2h weapons instead. Is it that fucking hard to use the weapons you actually USE while tanking?<br />
<br />
And don't make the excuse that you occasionally use this combo when Defensive is out. I know the drill. That doesn't occur terribly often. Why the hell do you people do this? USE your own weapons in your magelos, for ^&amp;$&amp;s sake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i used my SC a ton.  Zak was always hitting mobs he had no business hitting and a lot of 'em fell over and went boom.  Of course I couldn't slam as an Iksar, I had to ghetto bash.  it wuz my security banky when the cleric was lagging or just sucked.  Prolly the biggest shock was MT'ing with it as good or better than I did with my DW setup on raid mobs.  Go Taunt!  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfeld</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny thing is, my primary tanking setup is A3 BF + Shield (with WA 5 of course)....and its the setup I use 95% of the time, unless my sad dps is needed then Ill toss in either the pet sword offhand for fun or my A3 SEWS /shrug.  So it isnt always for &quot;E-Penis Magelo Padding&quot; some of us really do use that type of setup~ <br />
Edit:<br />
Got an EoE over the weekend so ya now Im a E-penis padder thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a shield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mondion</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've said it before, you really don't know how beautiful a shield can be until you feel the aggro of a dbow augmented with anger3.  That weapon in itself is just amazing aggro, especially after you get Bellow.  I can use nothing in my offhand and still hold aggro over the raid.  This is with pretty much max aa as well.<br />
<br />
So my shield is super beneficial to me when tanking big mobs.  Clerics love me using a shield, and I can tell a huge difference when using one.  Mind you, my shield is 120 AC with an extra shielding 4.  But yeah, if you'd rather see my exp group magelo.. I'll gladly equip my jagged onyx staff.. but if you wanna see the combo I use when I'm getting the job done, you are gonna see the shield equipped.. that is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a related question, how many of you add AC to your magelo profile to represent tribute AC?  I noticed that at least one poster in this thread has a lot more AC in their magelo than their equipment should give them, which I'm guessing is meant to show Bulwark tribute.   Not that I think there's anything really wrong with that, but sure did make me scratch my head a while wondering how the numbers were adding up :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The people at magelo really need to limit the ac and attk correction fields to +/-10, I wouldnt doubt for a second that lots fluff their ac considering how many profiles have over 1562 attk which is impossible for anyone but a ranger.<br />
<br />
You can see who fluffs ac easily by adding a &amp;debug=True to the end of the url for their magelo, like Blitzberg for example has an 84 ac correction http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=877729&amp;debug=true him and aspit are the only 2 I did, Aspit's is correct.</div></div><hr />

So I decided to look at his profile and notice in quite a few of his slots he has the 20 or 35 AC augs...although I was a bit confused since they are lore...I want to know how he managed to get so many lore items on his stuff  ;)</div></div><hr />

Never have I padded with a sheild or crappy 1handers with okay hp on them. When Magelo showed an Ivory Hilted Cleaver, it's because I actually used one.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am ashamed I used it. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I was looking at the magelo and was #9 for ac and noticed everyone above me had shields on so I put on shield and was bumped to #3, 1 of the top 2 looked to be bogus. alot of Raex and hp augs but ended up with like 100more ac then me. so I was realy #2 /flex haha.<br />
<br />
I have gone back to the weapons I use. However. when fighting bosses in GoD I do put on my shield after establishing good agro. virtue cor with my sheld is like 2784ac. would have been 2800 if I didnt loose that 20ac aug /sulks haha</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually monks max out at 1567 (1568 by Magelo). And technically it's 1561 for warriors and rogues (1562 by Magelo).  Need to adjust it -1 to be truly accurate, but I doubt anyone's going to start an e-penis fluffer hate thread if you don't, hehe.<br />
<br />
Another solution would be to add tribute adjustments to magelo. I'm sure there would be a lot of people to abuse it to artificially boost their profiles, but I don't see how that's any different from what a lot of people are doing now. Tribute is part of the game.   Honestly, right now I'm down to only 5atk over the worn cap (thanks GoD rogue gear that's seriously lacking in worn atk!), and if I upgrade much more I will be using tribute ATK just to stay at the cap. At which time, I would definitely adjust the +atk field in my magelo to reflect my actual worn atk with tribute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure which one you're referring to, but Raex bracers are still good ac and type 7 -&gt; bonus 2x 15ac augs from ferubi. 61ac is very competitive for a bracer.<br />
Mine is not bogus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one i was refering to I think is gone. he had basicly the same armor i had before I upgraded to vadd's and GoD armor and had like 100 more ac then I did with vadd's and other god armor and shield. his is gone. i was 3 then move to 2 i think. im not back to 9 after taking off shield.</div></div><hr />

I use my shield on every boss encounter so i would hardly call it fluffling magelo.  The only time i dont use it is clearing trash and exping.</div></div><hr />

I tank with dual weild and change these weapons all the time ( Main hand Bloodfrenzy, offhand = GBoS, Primal, whatever else I feel like using )<br />
