<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ealdidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If we are to deal with knights and Sony with any degree of success, we need to pool common misconceptions they use to justify the current state of &quot;balance&quot; into one post that everyone can link.  If these people continue to ramble on afterwards (assuming they don't present new ideas or find holes in this post), just take a &quot;don't feed the trolls&quot; policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Common Excuses That Warriors Are Balanced:<br />
<br />
Warriors have defensive.<br />
The number of mobs that can be tanked without defensive is growing.  Defensive only affects a mob's DI and mob DB's have grown tremendously compared to their DI to lessen the effect of defensive.<br />
<br />
Warriors have superior mitigation and are therefore better tanks.<br />
tank<br />
v. tr. tanked, tanking, tanks<br />
1.  To be the focus of an enemy's attention<br />
2.  To live long enough to receive the next heal<br />
3.  To mitigate damage such that the healer(s) do not run out of mana before the enemy's death<br />
n.<br />
1. one to attempts to achieve all three forms of tanking<br />
I'll save the agrument that a knight can reach (and sometimes surpass) a warrior's hp/ac in similar gear.  What matters is that if a knight can tank they are preferred to tank because superior aggro generation means fights are shorter (DPS classes can do more) and generally safer.  (Which although not a perfect solution is fine as long as knight can't some mobs that warriors can.  Knights should not be tanking the toughest mobs in Time (http://www.archoverseers.org/))<br />
<br />
Any knight using gear a warrior uses for hp and ac is an idiot for ignoring their spellcasting half.<br />
1. Many very high hp/ac items have int/wis/mana/focus effects on them.<br />
2. A knight in warrior's clothing &gt; a warrior -- a gimped spellbook &gt; no spellbook<br />
<br />
Knights had it hard in Kunark.<br />
Kunark is fucking over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkQuark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have some good arguments there. I too think warriors should be the end all be all of Melee.  I disagree with you about aggro but in essence you a good argument.<br />
<br />
There is one point I have to strongly disagree with you on.<br />
<br />
Knights, &quot;had it hard&quot; as you put it up UNTIL Luclin.  We just got that much worse in Kunark. It was not till Luclin where the tables started to turn a bit.<br />
<br />
I agree with you that things are unbalanced at this point but to say we only had it hard in Kunark is like saying Warriors are balanced because of /disc Defensive .<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back during Kunark you guys were actually hybrids.  80/20 war/clr(nec), 60/40 war/clr(nec).  However you want to look at it, the end number should result in '100' and it did back then.  Currently you guys are around 95/85/35 war/clr(nec)/unique.  I'm sure it rocks to be a high level Knight in current EQ, the epitome of BattleMage from UO.  You can do it all with no drawback.  You have all the toys, and honestly I think the Warrior class should be removed and we should all get a choice: Pal or Knight.  I personally think its cool to have an offensive tank and defensive tank class.  Where does this all leave Warriors tho?  The game just isn't fun from our side of the fence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wonder if you understand why spouting bullshit doesn't help your cause...<br />
When your bullshit is easily debunked with logic, people start thinking everything you say is bullshit.  Stick to the things that really do matter and that you actually have a point on!<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Defensive IS a huge advantage in raids. Anyone saying it is not is just plain lying.  In XP groups we are agreed its not as useful.  Warriors are overpowered in raid situations as compared to knights...  this should be remedied, as should the warrior taunt problem and it linking to procs on weapons.<br />
<br />
2) Warriors have 583 HP more than knights nakid with full AA's.<br />
Warriors in proper gear and knights in proper gear have 1000HP more average than knights due to equipment.  Paladins close that distance by 227 due to AotC and what AotC stacks with.<br />
more HP means more mitigation when aggro ceases to become a problem.  <br />
<br />
I agree that warrior taunt should NOT be linked to effects their weapons... that it should be innate... but spreading lies about knights does not gain you any points.  KNIGHTS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT CANNOT EXCEED WARRIOR HP.  That is a lie.  It IS true that a time-equipped knight has more Hp than a non-raiding warrior... but thats par for the course.<br />
<br />
3 While it is true that time gear has some gear that has both Hp and AC and caster effects, it does NOT have as many Hp as the best HP gear that warriors will be using....  most of those pieces have 50 less Hp on them...  not counting the slots we have to stay elemental or pre-elemental in order to keep certain effects.<br />
note that in order to get FT pieces and proper focus peices, we give up the ability to get certain avoidance, shielding,vengeance, and time effects.<br />
<br />
I will say again. KNIGHTS CANNOT EXCEED WARRIORS IN HP IN SIMILAR GEAR AS WARRIORS HAVE 583 HP MORE THAN KNIGHTS NAKID.  If I wear all the gear that gets me to 600+ish Hp (I cannot wear the warrior BP, and I do not duel wield like time warriors do) within a warrior, I gave up spell foci, FT, and caster effects to be a 600+Hp gimped warrior.  I also only got 65% of the vengeance 50 im wearing, due to 35% of my damage output being spells!  Now the warrior gets 100% of the vengeance 50.<br />
<br />
How much you want to bet the knights tanking quarm have KNIGHT chosen gear (caster effects) ... not all HP/AC gear??<br />
<br />
I'll say it again.  Knight spellbooks make up the difference in lower skillcaps and lower HP...  the spellbook makes us superior sometimes and NOT superior sometimes.  Knights who know what they are doing must advance BOTH of their sides in order to maintain their power upgrades...  Thus knights need to get the same vengeance item the warrior gets plus at least ONE more loot that covers thei caster side in order to get the same upgrade the warrior got!<br />
<br />
Example: Shadowknight behind mob = more damage than warrior behind mob.  (spells allow us to maintain 10% more overall sustained DPS)  Shadowknight tanking = LESS damage than a warrior due to spellslot allocation (for taunt) and the fact you don't cast as well when tanking something. (stuns, pushbacks, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
End the lies.. stick to what needs to be said.<br />

<br />
Heh, grass is greener syndrome here.  If thats really how you view knights then you should play one, yes its nice as a tank but they aren't anywhere near one of the stronger classes in the game, bottem 50% somewhere. <br />
<br />
Warriors have defensive - That should actually be warriors have useful disciplines.  As much as you'd like to say its useless its not.  Every time a guild does new content they tank it with a warrior for defensive.  In various other situations the other warriors disciplines are more useful than knights.  Now its not some huge advantage but its certainly as useful as that elusive knight 'utility' that gets brought up all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have superior mitigation and are therefore better tanks - What this really means is warriors require less healing than a knight while tanking the same mob.  Its only partially true when you factor in knights stunning on incoming and with the mana regen of today's healers its not really much of an advantage anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any knight using gear a warrior uses for hp and ac is an idiot for ignoring their spellcasting half - Well I don't really see people saying this, however until the extreme high ends of the game knights do make sacrifices in gear in order to get FT, focus effects etc.  Its a small part of balance but it is actually true.<br />
<br />
Knights had it hard in Kunark  Yeah I hate seeing this justification as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I fully agree warriors need a leg up.  They definetly are in the bottem 20% of classes as far as power compared to the rest of classes in EQ.  The main difference between myself and many warriors here is that I don't think Knights are in the top 50% either.  The gap on the backend has closed as much as the warrior vs paladin gap.  In 90% of cases a well geared BL or ranger can tank anything a paladin can and have as much or more utility and better DPS to boot.  The problem is with the balance between all melee based classes, not just knights vs warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont think many Knights think warriors are balanced, most that I see posting think they DO need help, the main disagreement is whether or not Knights should be nerfed or not, and whats is &quot;ok&quot; for a Knight to beable to do in terms of Class Balance.<br />

Hmm, so HOW many paladins and shadowknights tanked Quarm the first time??  How many months of tanking Quarm with warriors before the knights had the gear and the new expansion spells buffing them to handle the job??  We let quarm-equipped druids tank some of the pre-elemental bosses because we CAN.  That guild is letting paladins tank quarm becuase they CAN, not because paladins are better at it.  our warriors faced quarm fo the forst time with elemental gear, and mayeb ONE time loot.  Try that with a paladin or shadowknight... even with bulwark.<br />
<br />
I cannot see his gear at this time due to the link being bad or magelo being down...  want to illustrate his all Hp gear for us?  I or another hybrid can probably find you better HP/AC gear than what he wears... but we both know you will be only proving my point.<br />

there are other cap differences as well.. but knights do not exceed warriors in ANY melee skillcap.<br />
(as it should be)<br />

Weaponskills besides pierce: 250-225 = 25<br />
Pierce: 240-225 = 15<br />
offense: 252-225 = 27<br />
<br />
Where do you get 10?  Is this warrior math or monk math Wubao?<br />
<br />
There are times where warrior advantages make the the ONLY tank as has been seen since the days of Kunark.  A guild first facing Quarm even now, will STILL use a warrior.  Groups in LDoN should likely use a beastlord and skip both warriors and knights.  (this needs to be addressed)  Low level/low equipment PoP Xp groups are slightly better off with a knight due to taunt issues, but a warrior always works fine. (needs to be addressed.)  High end equipment and level knights and warriors do all of the above as well as each other... except for raid tanking where the warrior still holds a massive advantage. (also needs to be addressed)<br />
<br />
My entire spellbook allows me to either: 1) taunt better than a warrior OR 2) outdamage a warrior by 10% if behind the mob.  I also provide 200hp and 100 mana to the group every 60 seconds, and I am able to Death Peace (feign death)  I can do other things, but I then do these things less well. (these things are what most people want of me)<br />
For those abilties, I deal 20% less melee damage all the time (when tanking and when behind), I have 583 Hp less nakid, I avoid and mitigate slightly less...<br />
Oh and I forgot the extra .5dps from normal disc'd HT over 72 minutes and having worthless disciplines.<br />
(2.78dps over 72 minutes due to spending 42AAXP on HT twice for 7200 and 4800)<br />
<br />
Superchum/Wubao...  what exactly do you think the spellbook is for?  Its to close the gaps our skillcaps leave.<br />
It makes me better at certain things and worse at others.<br />
<br />
your right...  spouting &quot;grass is greener&quot; shit is not worth bandwidth... WHY do you continue doing it?<br />
<br />
I figure if you keep hitting your head on the wall when it comes to your bullshit, that you will actually press the matters that actually aren't due to &quot;grass is greener.&quot;  Warriors and melees in general need a looksee. (yes, even hybrids)  its time to take a look at the REAL roles of the classes and balance them so that no class is irreplaceable... and so no class is underuseful.  The biggest gap is not between knights and warriors... the biggest gap is between melee and casters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">EDIT:<br />
<br />
Screw it ... I'll let an SK make the argument instead ... <br />
<br />
From this thread:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=4132&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2<br />
<br />
I am overpowered and I like it <br />
It has become apparent to me that I am overpowered as a class. More specifically, compared to warriors. <br />
<br />
Between personal experience, and what I have read, i find its hard to find many situations where I can not do what a warrior does. In fact, do it better in a lot of cases.... even in the cases where I might not perform as well, i dont perform much less better than.<br />
<br />
I guess i should add that I am in a time capable guild.. and most of my peers have time gear etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I have only tanked one god in potime.. which is Cazic Thule. Due to my fearless ability, being able to have just shy of 10k hit points, easily having over 2k ac with buffs, and my consistant agro, i am a pretty good choice for this. Add in the fact that I dont even have to turn on attack the entire fight (no, not once) to keep agro and still get nice save my ass effects like divine intervention... its a pretty fun time. <br />
<br />
Enough about raiding though... I like to xp too... I've always had it lucky in xp groups. Finding a group as a tank role is easy for me. Always has been.... My agro spells are many, and keeping hate off of any dps class is just a given. Not to mention I have the taunt skill, which i'm pretty clever at utilizing. It's great knowing that if i want to do an easy mission in LDoN all i need is a competant cleric and any 4 dps classes (gear is not a factor usually). Even on hard missions, I never seem to find myself grouped with a warrior..... why? Inconsistant agro, 1khp, and a defensive disc never seemed to keep people from tkaing me over a warrior... anyway<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not always easy being a shadow knight, thats for sure. to be good at it takes skill just like any class... but I definately have an easy job.. at least compared to warriors. <br />
<br />
<br />
That is really the part that irks me, I guess. I am overpowered as a tank class imo, and I do love it... and it makes me wonder why we have warriors at all now? <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe I have some more examples of this thought...<br />
<br />
<br />
During raid time, i seem to do a lot of work. When we do any event where adds are a variable, I am there tanking adds (along with other sk/pal). Sure, mezzable stuff a knight seems a logical choice for pre agro cc.. since we can do it with non dmg. But even beyond that, my agro is reliable, so even when unmezzables come I am in there again. using my way superior snap agro to control a mobs hate. (yeah, rangers help out on stuff that can be snared/rooted) Where is a warrior you might ask? Doing what they can i'm sure... just not much compared to what I can do.<br />
<br />
<br />
I read that since the introduction of LDoN, wars have had the amount of hate they can generate increased... due to anger procs. and that, given a long enough time, war agro would exceed a knight. This is probably true in a long enough fight. Like a god or elem boss mob... but this leaves out two equally important things... <br />
<br />
One being that not everything is a boss mob. Time trials come to my mind... when I am in time trials, i tank and hold agro.. simply because warriors just cant keep it over nuke/melee dps. half way thru the fight someone is getting summoned.. or the mob turns... Sure, tell your casters to learn to watch agro better when a war is tanking.. but why have a war tank when i can hold agro 100% of the fight and never have someone get summoned from over damaging? Same applies to trash clearing pretty much anywhere. Where are you Warriors?<br />
<br />
<br />
And secondly, sure.. on a boss mob a warrior could eventually get enough agro to where I wouldnt be able to take it short of taunting probably...... but if you let me start getting agro first that same warrior will never see it short of using the same taunt. I dont care how many procs you add to how many weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
okay, enough rambling<br />
<br />
I could go on and on about all the spells I get.. (like my neg 500 resist lifetap.. even necros dont get one that good), and all the focus effects I have access too.. (detremental and beneficial spell haste, DD focus, dot dmg focus, shielding, accuracy.. wow long list)...... <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure the things i've listed wont be enough to convince any other knight that warriors are getting fucked in the ass at the PoTime level... but just so yall know at least one SK knows: <br />
<br />
<br />
I know i'm overpowered, and I like it. <br />
<br />
<br />

Arex<br />
<br />
<br />
Say what you want Brik, but the reason people keep saying your're full of it or to fuck off is because you just keep missing the point.<br />
<br />
AO used the SAME heal chain they used on warriors to tank the highest end content in the game.<br />
<br />
There's nothing left that ONLY a warrior can tank.<br />
<br />
The class is marginalized. Their &quot;REAL&quot; role as you state it, is gone.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

problem is this poster is looking at the problem from the wrong end.  Are warriors lacking, yes.  Does that mean SK's are overpowered?  No.  It means warriors are underpowered.  Compare a SK to a melee based hybrid and they'll look underpowered too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to partially agree with you. Defensive is powerful. AE Taunt is used only because Warrior taunt is teh suke. The rest of the Warrior disciplines could be thrown away and I wouldn't miss them.<br />
<br />
Defensive is powerful when the mob dies before it runs out. How many mobs die that fast? Well I'll tell you. Hard hitting yard trash and some named mobs that you kill with a group. A guild makes a MA list and every time you get to a really hard hitting mob the next Warrior ready to use defensive is up. But wait!! My guild puts Knight on that list too.<br />
<br />
The only other times Defensive is used is at initial contact with a boss raid mob so the CH rotation gets a chance to smooth out and when it's necessary to switch to a new MT (the last one died). Any mob that can be single tanked and take more time than Defensive lasts can be tanked without it.<br />
<br />
Unless you're in a group doing hard named mobs for loot or perversely doing LDoN Hard Assassinate it is rarely used in an experiance group at all.<br />
<br />
How often do you cast a spell when you're in an experiance group? See any difference in our spell-like abilities and yours?<br />
<br />
I've got a great deal for Knights. I would gladly give up all my disciplines for right-clickable Cease, Desist, Stun, Root, and Superior Heal with the same casting and refresh times as the spells. Make each use my Stamina, but allow it to be propped up and regen with items and buffs. All I want in addition is 10% better mitigation and 1000HPs more than a Knight can achieve in my gear as compensation to being allowed only 5 spells<br />
<br />
Seem fair? I didn't think so. That my friend is how powerful just 5 spells are. How much are the rest worth?<br />
<br />
I'm positive you know all this stuff. No player can be as oblivious as you are pretending to be. Warriors don't believe your mis-representations and writting them so SoE might read them and think their is another valid point of view given your obvious distortions is not likely to work.<br />

True, but these are reasons knights (and others) pull out to justify warrior &quot;balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wonder if you understand why spouting bullshit doesn't help your cause...<br />
<br />
Follow your own advice, please.<br />
<br />
1) Defensive IS a huge advantage in raids. Anyone saying it is not is just plain lying. In XP groups we are agreed its not as useful. Warriors are overpowered in raid situations as compared to knights... this should be remedied, as should the warrior taunt problem and it linking to procs on weapons.<br />
<br />
Defensive WAS a huge advantage on raids.   Shielding mods / Vie buffs / High DB, low DI mobs have greatly reduced defensive (it's still an advantage but warriors are no longer the only raid tank)<br />
<br />
2) Warriors have 583 HP more than knights nakid with full AA's.<br />
Warriors in proper gear and knights in proper gear have 1000HP more average than knights due to equipment. Paladins close that distance by 227 due to AotC and what AotC stacks with.<br />
more HP means more mitigation when aggro ceases to become a problem. <br />
<br />
I agree that warrior taunt should NOT be linked to effects their weapons... that it should be innate... but spreading lies about knights does not gain you any points. KNIGHTS WITH SIMILAR EQUIPMENT CANNOT EXCEED WARRIOR HP. That is a lie. It IS true that a time-equipped knight has more Hp than a non-raiding warrior... but thats par for the course.<br />

583?? that's what half of a swing? <br />

Try that with a paladin or shadowknight... even with bulwark.<br />
<br />
I cannot see his gear at this time due to the link being bad or magelo being down... want to illustrate his all Hp gear for us? I or another hybrid can probably find you better HP/AC gear than what he wears... but we both know you will be only proving my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
People tanked Quarm with a def warrior because they perceive it the safest way.  Most guilds also lost at least the first time.  I think a paladin could tank Quarm with elem loots + 1-2 items from time.  Now if you want to argue VZ, TZ, etc... we'll talk.<br />

The utility generated from an entire spellbook makes up the difference in 10 skillpoints in any given weapon EXCEPT piercing where it's equal ... as well as 583 hit points?<br />

knight weaponskill caps = 225<br />
knight offense caps = 225<br />
<br />
warrior weaponskill caps = 250 (except pierce at 240)<br />
warrior offense caps = 252<br />
<br />
there are other cap differences as well.. but knights do not exceed warriors in ANY melee skillcap.<br />
(as it should be)<br />
<br />
Weaponskills besides pierce: 250-225 = 25<br />
Pierce: 240-225 = 15<br />
offense: 252-225 = 27<br />
<br />
<br />
What you don't realize is this means knights get a bigger boost than warriors out of +skill mod items (everyone is capped at 252)<br />

I'm sure the things i've listed wont be enough to convince any other knight that warriors are getting fucked in the ass at the PoTime level... but just so yall know at least one SK knows: <br />
<br />
<br />
I know i'm overpowered, and I like it.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
problem is this poster is looking at the problem from the wrong end. Are warriors lacking, yes. Does that mean SK's are overpowered? No. It means warriors are underpowered. Compare a SK to a melee based hybrid and they'll look underpowered too.<br />
<br />
<br />
SK's are overpowered as a tank.  Necro's are overpowered as a caster.   Casters in general are overpowered compared to melees.<br />

As far as Brik is concerned:<br />
just take a &quot;don't feed the trolls&quot; policy<br />
Going to go follow my own advice now.</div></div><hr />

You should feel special, you're one of the few people I deliberately insult at every opportunity. <br />

I won't shout, I'll use *'s.<br />
<br />
*** Only when a warrior purchases buffs in advance of finding a group (and the buffs aren't lost) or groups with a Paladin does he have more HP's than an equivilant Paladin in the same equipment. In all other cases the Paladin has more HP's than the Warrior. ***<br />
<br />
In the same gear - 583HP's minus Brells, minus AoTC. What's that leave as an advantage? In groups lacking a Cleric, the Paladin comes equipped with the ability to buff like a Cleric. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>TpDread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, after browsing these forums for awhile you peeps made me realize something. I am sooooo glad i quit my warrior at 60 and started a SK. I noticed and accepted the fact that my warrior wasn't and never would be as cool as my buddie's 50 SK. So, rather than whining about it in a futile attempt to get it changed... i started and leveled a sk to 65. End result? I get groups whenever i see fit to join one... and get thanked after leaving for a job well done... i feel for you peeps in a way... but seriously, if you really want to be an effective tank, drop your damn warrior and start a sk or maybe a pally... peace out<br />

Keep on gloating - you just prove the point for us. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TpDread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Naw man being serious for a sec... i mess with yas guys a bit... but dont take my shit seriously. Yes i love my SK and wouldnt change a thing... but i played my warrior to 60... granted not 65, but i understand what you are going through and how much of a pain in the ass it is. My warr was my 1st toon on EQ, no PL or twinking... no bullshit, i leveled him and played him hard... i read these boards religiously and saw the problems with the class. The reason i made the switch should be obvious. I'm no idiot, and neither are you guys... which is why i cant understand why you continue to try to get it changed. I mean... it's not hard to see the problems with the warrior class, and they have been problems for too long. There's no argument i can make on you guys' behalf that isnt in this forum a thousand times. They will NOT fix it! Look at how much EQ has changed in just the past 6 months. Newbs are spoon fed to the max now, you may as well give em 8 backpacks... and fill em with deathfist belts and start them with an open trade window to captain ashlan in wfp... yet some simple additions/modifications to the warrior class are barely recognized.. much less considered... /shrug i wont go on... but i do respect you guys dedication, and genuinely hope for your cause.</div></div><hr />
