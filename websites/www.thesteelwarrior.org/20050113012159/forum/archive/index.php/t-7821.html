<br />
My current gear has stable HP/AC and aggro is quite fine (added my 2nd Anger 3 aug before I logged  last night :D )<br />
<br />
My primary concern are my boots and wrists, it seems to be the weakest link in my gear at the moment. I was planning on getting those Tak gear, but at 1492 points each, those might take a while. So, in the meantime, are there are any single-groupable boots/wrists that are nearly equal to or better than Tak gear? A few things to consider also:<br />
<br />
1. My guild is still pre-elemental<br />
2. I have crap PP generation, so bazaar stuff is kinda hard to get<br />
<br />
Just need to know if there are viable options to just doing Ldons till I unlock those drops  :cool: Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

As for your bracer... (not the ornate)... go for Mana-Threaded Bracelet. 28AC and more HPs than the ornate. Not sure what it costs... got mine as a drop a long time ago... Luclin? I believe... You can check. Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Buyable, so well worth a look. Or The Malovelent Boots of Suffering  from EF LDoN is good value for points.<br />
<br />
Wrist: Adamantite Wristguard from XTC in Ssra. Gimp kill, lotsa AC and HP's, otherwise Crystallized Acid Bracer or Ornate.</div></div><hr />
