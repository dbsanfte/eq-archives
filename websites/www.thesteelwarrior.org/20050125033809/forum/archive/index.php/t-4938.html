I noticed there were some augments that Lucy wasnt exactly clear on their effects and I thought I might be able to get some information from others here.<br />

SpellGuard I through IV - What does this line do? Is it like SPELLSHIELD and that it procs a rune that applies to magical damage only? Does it have a flat chance to add to resisting/rebounding the effect back on the caster or something?<br />

Guard - What does this line do? Is it like rune for weapons?<br />
<br />
If the SpellGuard line of augmentations works like spellshield then I will probably end up working towards it and putting it on my BBB so that I have the perfect defensive weapon. After that I will likely be going for HP boosters and better armor after that.</div></div><hr />

Guard 3 procs a buff that lasts 2 or 3 minutes and will act like a rune on 5% of all hits until it takes 50 points of damage per guard point... so 150 for Guard 3.<br />

The spell reflecting you are thinking about is Mirror.</div></div><hr />

It does reduce dps on you slightly but PoP mobs with high dps, the total amount of damage absorbed is a moot point.</div></div><hr />

I notice theres a proc buyable on MIR for 30 points (Easy as hell to get at level 65). This is Mirror I which reflects 5% of spells? Is that the same thing as the enchanter one? I was considering doing that since the points are pretty trivial to get (I get about 50 per successful adventure) and stock up points until I got enough for Anger III. Or perhaps aug both my 1h weapons with Mirror I so while I'm going for an Avatar proc I might get some beneficial side effects besides it ;)</div></div><hr />
