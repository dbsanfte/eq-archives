Conventional wisdom has a TSBS (53/45) is rated higher in DPS than Fleshgrinder and Dagarn's tails (both 12/19 with DD proc).  Unfortunately even with capped stats and FA I miss an awfull lot.  Is there any data on at which point the added damage of the procs (which don't care if I miss) makes up for loss of DPS due to DW vs 2H?</div></div><hr />

Bear in mind that if you are fighting red cons, the dd procs will probably be heavily resisted, so I am thinking they will not make up the difference.</div></div><hr />

On the matter of resists, usually the red cons are raid mobs, so they will have a full set of lvl 65 debuffs on them.  Resists on the fireblast proc, unless the mob is inherently fire resistant, are very rare (I noticed one in a whole NToV clearing).</div></div><hr />
