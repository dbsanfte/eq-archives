<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/sigh, goddamn brainless fabled geared twinks that don't give a shit about what a warriors job is.<br />
<br />
When do people start listening? /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No fair. You didnt tell us why you said this....<br />
<br />
(As if we can't imagine some gruesome examples)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Berzerker with a fabled axe, pulling when I am pulling, running in front of me and getting agro, breaking mezzes, etc. etc. Ranger who does not answer you, does not buff you when you ask does not answer period, also runs ahead and pulls whole rooms, breaks mezzes etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Even after I asked nicely, still no change. So I told cleric and enchie I can't hold agro and do my job so they better watch out. Finally the enchie did an all cap group say /g BLAH BLAH WARRIOR TANK! YOU NO TANK AND BREAK MEZZES BLAH! BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I thought I left behind all the idiots when I was in 20-30's, I guess not. And it's not like a group where you can just leave anytime you want. You have to stay with the adv to get the points. This is why I've always solo'd. <br />
<br />
.. if I just had sow maybe I could have ran in front of them to pull, lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hey, my warrior is a fabled twinky =(<br />
<br />
but i know what ya mean, was playing and alt rogue on a diff server and invited a paladin to the group. he made absolutely no move to tank, heal, and rarely meleed. to make it worse, every time you said a word to him, he'd link ALL of his twink gear and said nothing else. there was much pleasure in booting him ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First thing I asked the zerker was if his axe was a Fabled Exe Axe and he's all yeah and starts linking all his gear. Uhh, I didn't ask to inspect you, I asked for agro management issues. As some people may know, at level 46 with only 1 procing weapon that does not proc often it can be very difficult to hold agro against one.<br />
<br />
Oh well, maybe one day I'll be in a good group.</div></div><hr />
