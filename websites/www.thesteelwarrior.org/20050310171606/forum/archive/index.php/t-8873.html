<br />
A long time ago I was working on the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest. I went through the Badge of Service and the Magus Conlegium Token portions, but then my quest came to a screeching halt. Before I got around to camping the ashes, I was invited to a pickup raid in North Temple of Veeshan. <br />
<br />
The raid's tank had gone linkdead and wasn't coming back so...I waddled my happy ass over there, tanked Lady N. and picked up 1 of 2 Cloaks of Thorns that dropped. I felt that 35AC 100HP with the DS clicky was just as good, if not better, than the shield. <br />
<br />
There you have it. If anyone has the ashes and the faction to complete this quest, I will offer you my badge of service and token free of charge. Let me know.</div></div><hr />
