<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VERMEIL</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, I'd like to get some input on the DPS/soloability of a Protection Spec'd warrior, post level 55.  I fully understand what's what with talent builds as over my past 54 levels I've spent 100gold + in respec's just so that I could discover for myself what works best.  The protection spec was where I had the most fun, hands down.  However, since level 45, I've been a MS build warrior for the sole reason of being able to effectively solo.  I saw a SIGNIFICANT difference in my solo-ability when I respec'd to an MS build from my then Prot. build.<br />
<br />
All that said, I find myself now inches from level 55, and am trying to decide at what level I'll be moving back to the protection build.  I know 100% that the protection build is where I want to be for high-level instance, but I also don't want to hinder my leveling by switching too early.<br />
<br />
As a result, I'd really appreciate your input on how a warrior's DPS &amp; solo-ability is effected when utilizing a Protection build after level 55.  Thanks, and I look foward to your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miron</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gone protection my entire career so I can't compare how different it is to a Mortal Strike build. I find I can solo just fine, especially if I go into defensive stance. I don't use food/bandages very often. There are still a couple problems -- and they might not even be related to how I've speced at all.<br />
<br />
The first is we kill stuff soooo damn slow that if you need to fight through stuff you'll probaly be facing the retardly fast respawn. For example I couldn't do the third Cauldron in West Plaguelands solo because stuff was respawning before I could get near the Cauldron. This was when I was 57 or so. It eventually took a Druid (Who wasn't that good) and myself and we just barely did it. A Rogue friend of the same level breezed right through because of his kill speed. If I had used 2h/dual wield I think the time killing would have been wasted sitting down eating/bandaging.<br />
<br />
The second problem is we can't take that one big mob too well. At 60 I can't solo most 55+ elites regardless of tactics. I would like to think I have good gear/weapons and I have tried the various tactics. Defensive and shieldblock seems to work the best but of course it takes forever for stuff that you can kill.<br />
<br />
With those two problems highlighted I consider soloing defensive spec good when compared against other Warriors. And just because I'm protection doesn't limit me in weapon selection. I keep a set of other good weapons to two-hand and dual wield. I do wish I could try out Mortal Strike to see how well it really works but I do not want to pay the double respec cost to get back to Protection when I am done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was Arms/MS to 60. I recently switched to a prot build as I started raiding. I solo stuff slower but the rate at which I bandage/eat has decreased. I'm also more effective against NPC casters - sure, my DPS has dropped, but I can keep them locked up with stuns for a good portion of the fight. putting a full five points into 1h weapon spec has helped DPS quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I definitely recommend grinding it out to 60, doing what quests ya can but generally avoiding raid instances unless your tanking duties are minimal. once ya hit 60, well, it's your call. ya don't have to go Prot heavy, either - a dozen points will get you some extra armor and extra shield blocking, which is most of a Prot warrior's raw mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would wait until your near 60 and/or in a raiding type guild before you respec.  That's what I did.  Was Arms untiil about 60, then respecced to Prot due to raiding and needing to tank a lot etc.  Never had any issues soloing when I was Arms, and still don't now that I'm Prot specced.  Keep in mind I do have 1 hand weapon specialization which gives a bonus to one handers.  When I'm in DPS mode and not tanking I'm duel wielding, and usually in Arms or Fury stance.  My DPS is usually around 150-200, but it can spike around 350-400 if I get a good execute in.  This is in Strath/Scholo/UBRS/Molten Core/Onyxia etc.  (mainly Onyxian warders, on Onyxia herself the goal is to sustain dps, not draw aggro if your not tanking and just uhhh live  :) )  So our dps is repsectable, not insane, but you can contribute well when not tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with drac, except I skipped the one hand specialization and use a doomsaw for DPS (rarely do though).  Also lvl 60 and tank MC/Onyxia quit often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10% less damage in def stance actualy =-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireiina</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With battleshout up my character sheet reports a DPS in the mid 90's using a 40DPS 1h weapon at level 60. The real DPS is of course going to be lower due to misses and mob armor. However the real cost is that I have no skills that can boost it if I have rage, the best being either heroic strike (which sucks) or doing some more sunders (which isn't very satisfying). <br />
<br />
The &quot;wet noodle&quot; description is accurate enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly full out prot is a joke of a talent path. The tree defining skill is not used much at all, the stuns are neutered in seconds due to diminishing returns (thanks charge) and the myriad of abilities do not enhance your tanking ability in the same way that MS / fury builds enhance your dps. This disparity is why you rarely see any full prot warriors outside of raid mt's. The price you pay for a tad bit better tanking overall is very high considering it destroys your soloing ability and pvp prowess. <br />
<br />
Yes I can solo mobs easily, it just takes forever and a day. This is not an efficient way to solo, no matter what anyone tells you. DPS &gt; defense in that environment, faster you kill things the more xp, faction and loot chances you get. Downtime is almost non-existant with bandages a-pleanty avaliable, and if you're not grinding on humanoids for bandage drops it's your own fault.<br />
<br />
Pvp is much the same story. I see a prot warrior coming at me on my alts and I just point and laugh. They have next to no dps, and if they give up the shield that they invested heavily in then there goes all those points. I'd say a battle chicken is more dangerous then a protection warrior in the all out fights.<br />
<br />
The sad fact is that you can get most if not all of the &quot;worthwhile&quot; prot talents with only 15 points and still retain mortal strike. The tree needs major work in the 20+ point range. Shield discipline, imp shield bash, conc blow, imp disarm -- it all needs to be overhauled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(this is mostly for me to continue soloing with light tanking duties in instances if needed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either shield spec or anticipation 5. (your call really, pros and cons to both).<br />
<br />
Then Toughness is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
Then Bloodrage, and last stand, and finally Iron Will if you're on PvP.<br />
<br />
You'll be 99% of the tank that a 31 prot tank is with 11 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually it's 5/5 shield spec, 5/5 toughness, 2/2 imp bloodrage, 1/1 last stand, 1/3 imp shield block. Some toss 1/3 in for imp revenge as well for the 15 total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10% less damage in def stance actualy =-\ <br />
<br />
Missed this somehow.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, the 10% he's referring to comes from 1h specializiation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps this is the case when you hit 60, but I always duel in def stance and my prot talents help me quite a bit (conc blow, imp disarm, one hand spec, imp shield bash).<br />
<br />
As a side note I have dueled 3 different arms spec warriors multiple times and I shame them every duel.</div></div><hr />
