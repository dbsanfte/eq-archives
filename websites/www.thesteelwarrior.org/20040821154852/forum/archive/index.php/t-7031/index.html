<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfortunately, my efforts to be a registered user (needed to post on SoE's boards and to use the test server) are once again rebuffed - I'll try a phone call. Suspecting that as before I won't get the problem resolved, I'm posting here.<br />
<br />
Bow procs - I haven't parsed them recently, but they've been pretty horrible in the past.<br />
------<br />
Ka-ching New Level - twenty or thirty years ago I played a game that put up a message that said something like:<br />
<br />
You've gained a level!<br />
<br />
You gain 75 Hitpoints.<br />
You gain 10 Stamina.<br />
<br />
You've learned a new ability - Dual Weild.<br />
<br />
You can learn a new spell - Tashini. [not said, but consistant with the idea]<br />
<br />
While the ph4t Ka-ching is nice, a little more re-inforcement and information wouldn't hurt.<br />
------<br />
LDoN augments - it's gotten a little ridiculous to put in soooooo many hours for an augment only to have to do it again should you get a new piece of equipment. Please, we've earned them. In some cases we've earned them two and three times over. Return merchant purchased augments if they are removed with solvent. 12-25 hours of gameplay excluding downtime and /lfg per slot for 10+ slots is enough of a time sink.<br />
-------<br />
Soloing - It appears that your next expansion deals with this, but in truth Warrior soloing is awful. The experiance/time is baaaad and frankly there are only so many 50-500pp items that you can sell in the bazaar. More than ocassionally we all want to &quot;fool around&quot; productively without commiting to a group. This is more than somewhat difficult playing a Warrior.<br />
-------<br />
Diety Change Quests - many players chose their diety or chse not to have one when the benefits/disadvantages were far from clear. Each choice does not come with simular advantages. Allow players to changes dieties by completing a quest much like the mail delivery quest involving traveling from &quot;shrine&quot; to shrine, talking with/delievering a quest item/making a donation, etc. until they are found to be genuine in their desire to convert.<br />
-------<br />
I concur with other posters. Adjusting content so Knights can better tank in GoD is a start - but a heal less than a single hit from a mob, a stun line that isn't useful on nearly all normal adds, Pacify which loses effectiveness a bit early does affect Paladin usefulness on raids. The ability to significantly debilitate mobs likewise affects SK's. Make Warrior, Paladin, and Shadow Knight differences mean something - not 3 flavors - 3 different classes all with something significant to contribute in raids. Please, don't blur the classes by sharing class defining skills. Rather, when a deficiency exists, fix it with a class consistant change or upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">- Warlord's Tenacity (that thing actually works ?)<br />
- Piercing Cap<br />
<br />
Thats it....  I dont think we need any attention any more.<br />
We got a great boost (even better than we hoped).<br />
I am more than happy with my class &amp; its ability to perform in groups &amp; raids<br />
<br />
Now for various fixed :<br />
- Shields : Remove Furious Bash , Replace Furious Bash by Combat Effects x 3<br />
- LDoN please ! I am sick &amp; tired of re-re-re-re-re-augmenting stuff (KT named are way too rare)<br />
- Knight Tankings (i'm still voting for a disc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The main thing warriors need is for SOE to recognize that knights aren't freaking broken.  :P  The content is.  Adjust the content.  Maybe chuck them a 2 tick duration riposte disc like several other classes already have if you want.  *shrug*  Not that that will satisfy most of the people complaining.  They want upgrades, damn it!<br />
<br />
And yes, make augs returned when you use a solvent.  Obviously they made them non returnable to make ldon points an even BIGGER timesink, but it's stupid.  That's not a warrior issue though.  Obviously it's an issue for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDoN augments - it's gotten a little ridiculous to put in soooooo many hours for an augment only to have to do it again should you get a new piece of equipment.

<br />
Or even this, Keep current solvents as they are and create a second set of advanced solvents, at a higher (100pp?) cost  that removes the augment and return it to you.<br />
<br />
This way you can do several things:<br />
<br />
- Not screw up existing solvents<br />
- add a minor plat sink rather while removing a Major Point/timesink<br />
-Make LDoN more attractive<br />
- have the choice of cheaply making your item droppable or paying for your augment back.<br />
- LDoN merchant lesser augs will be actually bought rather than sit rotting on vendors<br />
<br />
Ans this should NOT be a part on the next bloody expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get half pts back on turn in of augments would be about right. Giving 100% refund is too much imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A solvent that lets you keep the augment would need to cost about 10K or so if it works on any augment.<br />
<br />
How about a 100pp solvent that destroys the item but returns the augment?<br />
<br />
And riposte disc is way overpowered in GoD, maybe even more so than the Defensive line.  No one else needs to get them.  They really could be nerfed some as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1. Some attempt at being able to return/upgrade/exchange LDoN augs and items. For example, would be cool to be able to buy the EF Plate BP, and then as you level and earn more points you can turn in that BP and spend an additional 700ish points and get the Tak BP. 5 tiers of class-specific single-groupable gear that you can build on rather than buy and scrap when you earn an upgrade would be fun. <br />
<br />
2. Change the graphic on Greatstaff of Thunder!! Make it a big ass hammer, axe or sword. Hehe, I know thats not a warrior balance issue or something thats truley needs a &quot;fix&quot;, but that X-mas wreath on a stick is just pathetic. Imagine how many posts it would save asking &quot;what weap should i be using&quot; If that actually looked decent.  <br />
<br />
Better yet (as long as im dreaming), make a Greataxe of Thunder that drops in PoV thats 30/30, A Greathammer of Thunder from BoT thats 32/30, and a Greatsword of Thunder drop in Tactics thats 34/30. All no-drop :) Be neat to have some sort of progression in PoP for 2hander agro weaps.<br />

I don't care if they want to make solvents 1-2k each to balance this...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gabriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would agree wholeheartedly with the Aug removal.  Hell 10K is reasonable to get that Anger 3 Aug back off a weapon you just upgraded.  I havent augged any weapons as Im looking to upgrade them soon.  AND IT SUCKS.<br />
<br />
Shields.  I would like to be able to use a shield and have it be a viable choice instead of people looking at me thinking Im a shaman with a weird spear.....  (not that I use them, just the option would be enough)<br />
<br />
The Diety Idea is a great one.  I hate to see agnostic warriors getting the low end of the armour shaft....<br />
<br />
How about a war steed.  I know Pallies and Sks get them, but hell, we should be able to get one (outrageous costs either AA or Plat) that would help us when we fight!  (lol no flames just sounds cool)<br />
<br />
Actually I am happy with the way I am today and most of the ideas I have would not be warrior related.  If they throw us some bones great, if not let still kick ass and take names, AND make fun of Pallies.......   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I want an AA war boar based on the same model as the ones in Plane of Tactics.<br />

Having more endurance related abilities than the current discs and incite would be nice too, you know, kind of like the warcry idea they pillaged from us to make the berserker class.</div></div><hr />

  Who said that? And it doesn't even make sense... 3 minutes to get to a zone line? Wtf are you running from that you'd expect to live for a full 3 minutes of stuff hitting you? Fortitude and furious are our real escape disciplines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More than a few times I have had to train from deep in KC, Kersora, seb, PoI or through WW to the zone. Most times if your around 12 seconds to the zone or so you can make it anyways.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps that was an original intent. But it had to be evident that as Warriors became more tankish, only something like Defensive could make Warriors beefier at need while not unbalancing normal experaince grouping and trivial content. Heaping more AC and HP's on Warriors every expansion would not have worked.<br />
<br />
I knew exactly what Defensive meant the first time I saw it.<br />
<br />
I understand Blind and Stun were not originally supposed to be aggro tools either and that Warirors were expected to generate superior aggro to Knights.<br />

<br />
Raid tanking in Kunark, when defensive was introduced, was still pretty much a zerg fest.  Attempting to focus mob attention on one tank and using a CH chain to keep him standing didn't come into it's own until Velious.  So defensive was in place some considerable time before people really realized what it meant and what you could do with it.  I believe that defensive, much like Monk FD, wasn't fully apperciated by the devs who implimented it and the player base used it in ways that were never envisioned.</div></div><hr />

U can be summoned with DA, unless mobs are different in KC.  My cleric got summoned often when I died and went DB/BDA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm not sure of the gravity of what I'm about to bring up, but assuming that new players coming into the game are at all attractive to SOE, then a couple of things are worth noting about folks who choose warriors.<br />
First, warriors, even young ones, are heavily gear dependant, yet aside from some newby quest armor, stuff like crafted and cobalt is showing its age. No warrior can solo his own upgrades, and its pretty much impossible to suggest with a straight face that your friends go quest crafted or even camp Karnor's nowadays at a level you can use the armor that drops there. Most of the quested armor is like that.<br />
The bazaar fills the gap (if you're not on a server with a borked economy) until let's say the warrior is about level 50-ish, then what? Cultural? Okay, but the 50-ish untwinked warrior probably can't even solo giants. A suit of BD armor is a lot of spider webs &amp; rockhopper hides away, and a big jump in price (a nice jump in gear, too, of course, but how is the untwinked warrior to pay for it?). <br />
LDoN has a good progression of warrior usable gear, but it certainly would be difficult to earn it as fast as you level: at 20 points or so a mission at that level, LDoN is pretty slow, and I suspect that after level 45 this warrior's damage mitigation is becoming embarrassing by today's standards. It would be in PoJ, anyway.<br />
The need for haste and the upcoming need for aggro weapons and augments will put further pressure on the warrior's budget/LDoN points.<br />
Between a warrior's inability to solo many cash mobs and the dated nature of most quest armor available to young warriors, I have a feeling that many of them hit a wall and just quit the class if not the game. The fastest way for such a warrior to gear himself up would be to pick a good solo caster class, level that toon up, and use it to farm the warrior some plat and twink gear, lol.<br />
Any way you look at it, there's a lot of farming and bazaar trading in store for these warriors, and not many paths for fighting for and looting upgrades.<br />
Yes, I know there are ways around these issues, and I realize that other classes have their upgrade issues as well, but if I could data mine what happens to the warrior mains of new players, and if that data showed a lot of stalling out, I'd look at doing something here.<br />
If SOE is going to look at expanding solo opportunities for various classes, then warriors should get a look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>grimmreaper1400</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The content is. Adjust the content. Maybe chuck them a 2 tick duration riposte disc like several other classes already have if you want.<br />
<br />
They do, its called DA.<br />
<br />
Soe tries and has imbreeded the class to the point they fight over the same slots.  Druids with a fairly decent heal, and beasts with a somewhat good slow.  BS.  Druids you want to be a healer, roll a cleric up.  Beasts?  well they should be nerfed with about 6 bats.<br />
<br />
I guild with some very talented hybrids.  There isnt a &quot;fighting over the tit&quot; that many keep trying to make issue of.  Doing Uqua our hybrids snap aggro, and we peel off them.  They off tank a lot, more then the warriors do, cuz we are usually in a rot of some sort.<br />
<br />
Again, if they wanted to be in the spot light on named mobs, roll a fuckin tank and quit your crying.  You dont hear warriors *real warriors* posting they want heals, fd, HORSES, etc.  Get off the &quot;we got as much right&quot;.  No ya dont, your an oreo,  Half tank, half cleric/necro.  You chose that path, so get the fuck off the &quot;we deserve shit&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry SOE has given you a narrow path and now your so upset you want to sponge off warriors role (since the dawn of EQ).<br />
<br />
<br />
SONY!<br />
1) Fix the fuckin taunt, incite is a toy, its not 100% like snap spells.  Its use time (30 sec) is a slap in the face, when a hybrid can spamm a spell. (claim your interrupts and fizzles) but i have yet to see  a hybrid NOT snap aggro, and hold it, while i Blood of thule, and Funeral pyre, when i play my necro.  Thats some aggro there.<br />
2) You give the hybrids defensive, it better have a 3 day reuse, and a requirement to use a shield.  Or they just became the sole tanks.<br />
3) AA's, well every class got fucked on those (GOD)  10$ grand to buy a pinto.<br />
4) Endurance is mana, wake the fuck up.<br />
5) Disc, although have a &quot;trivial&quot; bit better timers, they are now punished by 2 factors, Time and Endurance/mana<br />
6) Warrior only drops.  As i posted earlier, we have gotten 32 hopebringers, and 8 dbotw.  This is the same type shit on every warrior only drop.  Where is the fairness in drops?  Would be nice if warriors got drop rates like chain classes /rangers do, like they get the horseshoe sword, or the bloodlink chestplate, that drops like water on about 18thousand mobs.  That shit rots now, while tanks squabble and argure over why they need it more then someone else.  Thank god for DKP<br />
7) Friend of mine, is lvl 65, 423aa, full time gear, and most of the GOsuck, loot he wants, and got meleed owned by a druid of same gear lvl.  Not one spell was casted, only disc, and aa skills.  PvP is so one sided, or even soloing is for hybrid type players exclusively.<br />
8) Where is the pure melee only aa **i.e.** hybrids got horses, where is ours?  must be nice to get 100k horse, for  a stack of aa.<br />
9) they claim they will make it to remove augments, and place on other items.  Does this cover sell back, for augments that are not equipable to the new items?  i.e.  EP drops is type 7, while time and GOD is type 8.   Whats the score with that?<br />
10) i totally agree with everyone.  Hard ldon should equal like 200 pts, and normal should equal 100 pts, or even higher.  After about the 8th trip through the same patch together zones, its rather boring.<br />
11) I'll never give in to thinking more lvls is a good thing for EQ.  WE ARE FIXING THEIR FUCK UP.  THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER GO PAST LVL 65.   People that have nothing to do but grind, are totally sick of it.  I am lucky i raid 5 hours a day, so grinding isnt as frustrating to me, cuz its like a break.  But i can imagine the folks that dont raid like that, must be thinking, &quot; is there anything else to do besides grind?&quot;  Dont say tradeskills or quests, cuz they both have been 3 expansions behind since the beginning.  Tradeskill stuff from GOD, is a rip off.  Kill &lt;insert super hard mob&gt; recieve component *sometimes* that makes damage 2, delay 87, 5hps, 1 ac.  heh, look up eqtraders if you think i am exagerating.<br />
12) Keys/flags/trials,  *cough* boring, lame, lack of imagination.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I got more, but like i posted before, SOE has no intention of doing anything.  You really feel that incite, and melee enhancement fix anything, then your a hybrid impostering a warrior.  Its eye candy, and like this summit.  Nothing of use will be done.  Maybe some lvl 1 newbie gear will be implimented. <br />
<br />
I've played since the time Nameless went live, and before on Quellious.  Not once have i ever seen a hybrid sit lfg longer then a warrior.  Pally owned in KC, SK's solo feared in DL, and with siphon str, could pull better then any other class.  So the point of being left out is bogus, they just werent the tank, and they cried.<br />
<br />
You want to talk warrior being lfg less then a tank.  /cong gems   lvl 308, 8190087 score.  6 1/2 hours in potranq.<br />
<br />
If you've been watching.  SOE is has been taking polls.  Expect soon, they will be doing their own ebay type selling buying.  And eq will get screwed up so badly.  Flooding the game with lvl 65 people that dont know how to open a spell book, is gonna do almost as much damage as Gates of Suck has.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if OoW is anything like Gates of suck ballz, then i'm like the other masses and retiring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">OK, I've found something that ticks me off big time.<br />
<br />
Like darned near every Warrior I've damaged this or that faction. Can't really get your Epic without hurting Chardok faction. CoV, Dain, or KT are surely going to hate you - maybe if you are really lucky, all three.<br />
<br />
I can understand taking a big faction hit. But, how big and how difficult to repair isn't without meaning.<br />
<br />
I've been soloing the Arena in Kael to equip some twinks. Getting the Thurg faction to do the armor MQ's isn't a problem. BUT, I thought 'Gee it would be nice to do the Coldain Ring Quest. ahahahahahahaha!!!!!! Guess what. As near as I can determine other than doing a Velium turn in 123456537376532 times or armor turn in an equal number of times there is NOTHING I can do solo to fix Dain faction. There is NO way I can solo KT's personal bodyguards. Goodness knows I tried.<br />
<br />
So like trying to fix Chardok faction, Dain faction is darned near impossible to fix once broken. Oh, I've hung out in Kael hoping some guild would do KT when he's up. But the days of him being a regular raid target are pretty much over.<br />

This whole unbelievable timesink/ordeal to repair Chardok, KT, Dain SS faction might have made some sense at one time. But now it's just a pita that excludes players from content for no good reason. I'm not saying it should take 0 effort, but killing KT a half dozen times is not in the cards for any PoTime+ Warrior IMO.<br />

In general, I feel like when I play my warrior, other players know what I'm supposed to do, I know what I'm supposed to do, and for the most part I can do the job. Warriors are working pretty well right now, I think.<br />
<br />
The kick/slam thing; the pierce cap; perhaps a bit more scale on taunting high-level mobs.<br />
<br />
But really, what worries warriors most is what will happen with knights.<br />
<br />
I don't think knights should have defensive. For exactly the same reasons I also don't think that warriors should have endless free charges of spam aggro lock.<br />
<br />
Both classes need commonly accepted functionality, though. There should be a reason for groups to want a warrior; there should be other reasons for groups to want a Pally or SK. I spent a while lfg before melee changes. I don't wish it on the knights. <br />
<br />
Besides, I have a troll SK alt. &amp; hope he's playable for a long time.</div></div><hr />

This all with that fact that you have AE aggro generation through AA.  No where in your class description does it say unparraelled aggro generation, that comes with spells, your pure melee deal with it.  See when your pair aggro lock with the best defensive abilities and highest dps output of all the tank classes, you come off sounding like a class domination advocate, and lord knows your against knights getting any sort of defensive ability which would (in your opinion) create the situation that your so strongly against.  On the flip side, Im against you getting any more aggro generation then you already have because in the end it would result in you being the choice for all encounters, too.

Uhm, Crimson the last time I saw anyone even remotely suggesting Knight aggro should be nerfed downwards was pre-Incite.  Since Incite has been added to the game as far as I can see Warriors are reasonably happy with where they stand in comparison to Knights aggro wise.  Knights get it faster and with more assurance, but Warriors can do their job in a reasonable fashion.</div></div><hr />

Now, it dosent directly state that he wants it brought downwards, but this is an example of the mindset held by alot of warriors that I run into on a day to day basis:  &quot;Well Incite is great, but your aggro is still too high compared to mine....&quot; Notice that the abilities we have had since release somehow disturb people as if it was something we were never intended to have.  Im all for taunt failure upgrades being reduced, I still use it inbetween gem refreshes.  What bothers me is that ench's are calling for a spell resist aggro nerf, which would totaly negate the use of CD/Fear on most mobs for aggro, and give you the undisputed tank slot because snap aggro will totaly be negated for sks.  SoE still to this day refuses to fix terrors, which are supposed to be our prime source of aggro generation according to them.  Our aggro needs work, currently its using bugs in the system to generate insane amounts of hate.  Your better defensive abilities should be countered by our unparalled aggro generation.  It saves lives, it makes your lives easier through aggro transfer on raids, if its properly balanced against your defensive abilities it would only help further all 3 classes desireability.  Currently, it is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Currently, it is not. <br />

  I disagree. Knights can tank most everything just fine, and have aggro over debuffs on inc. Warriors, as you might notice by lots of threads on this board, still struggle for anger augments for their aggro proccing weapons coupled with WA to give them a reasonable chance at holding aggro. We still often fail on any early debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">the bit Crimson quoted actually bothers me too.<br />
Incite is not a toy, it's an on demand hate proc that refreshes every little bit. It has limitations, as well it should. but it's a helpful tool, at least for me.<br />
One of the reasons I think knights should not have defensive is that I really think that would be barking up the wrong tree. Just as giving warriors endless snap aggro is barking up the wrong tree. <br />
<br />
Making knights and warriors more the same is a failure of imagination.<br />
<br />
But it's very clear to me, anyway, that knights should have a set of purposes, and these functions should be advantages that folks will like to have in group situations. Groups should know why having a knight is cool, because if people go around thinking that the only reason to take a knight in a group is that there aren't any warriors on line, that blows for the knights. Cf my post above about lfg as a warrior. If knights need more functionality, they need new functions.<br />
<br />
Neither knights nor warriors (nor the game itself) wins if there's and endless counterclockwise deathspiral of warriors getting knight aggro and knights getting warrior mitigation. Or warrios getting nerfed and knights getting nerfed, which is the same spiral, only clockwise.</div></div><hr />

And I agree that Knights certainly don't need any kind of an aggro nerf.  I do see his point about taunt though.  Taunt has always worked for crap.  Even after they adjusted it several times it still works for crap.  Convince me I'm wrong that if any other class in the game had a primary ability that they relied on to the degree Warriors relied on taunt pre-incite, that a 60% failure rate against blue cons wouldn't cause a major shit storm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crimson, this seems to be a very common Knight belief.  But it doesn't seem to be actually based on anything of substance beyond gut instinct.  Knights have never been able to accurately and undeniably establish that without defensive there is in fact a &quot;substantial&quot; difference in tanking compared to a Warrior.  Some people claim to see one.  Other people claim they don't.  The best numbers anyone has generated in the way of parses aren't conclusive and can be interpreted to indicate between a 5% and a 12% difference in tanking between an equally geared Knight and Warrior.<br />
<br />
Now, please explain to me how you consider a 12% difference, even granting the best possible interpretation for Knights, as a &quot;substantial&quot; difference?  Any closer and there would be no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I must be the only person that thinks Taunt works fine.  You'll be surprised how powerful this ability is if it even worked a little bit more often (say, 10%), especially with GoD how a lot of ubers are actually tauntable without the need to use AE Taunt.  It wouldn't be a bad idea if they go back and implement this to the older expansions since being able to taunt most ubers in GoD doesn't make it trivial.  It's just an extra thing you can do now.  <br />
<br />
Yes that red con yard trash isn't going to get taunted easily but either have people actually pay attention to clearing trash or if they cannot, get a Knight instead.  If it's an XP group, you should be paying attention fighting red con yard trashes, and given the DPS they dish out, the ~10% difference in tanking between war and Knights is significant.  Knights aren't supposed to tank as well as Warriors, defensive or otherwise.  ~10% is a pretty reasonable difference I'd think, enough to matter on things that can actually kill you and helpful on things that cannot, but not so powerful to make Knights obselete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Lol, well.

Even worse when mob is not mezzed, and is beating on cleric.<br />
<br />
The problem with taunt is that it could easily be an overpowering element in the game if it works too well too fast.<br />
<br />
So, every time I play, just about, I wish taunt worked faster and more reliably. But just because I want it doesn't mean I'm convinced that it would improve the game.<br />
<br />
I don't completely agree with Phantron though (whew): the game wouldn't be unbalanced if everyone else's taunt stayed the same, but the tanks on my account had a 95% taunt success rate.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for XP groups, I'm not sure about that.  It is a nuisance to wait for Taunt to work when you're the only tank in the group, but the way I see it if people can't be bothered to root or do other things to help you out with aggro management, then they should have to wait for you to get a successful tauint.  If they don't do neither, it's their fault.  If something needs to be addressed, it should be that Knights should not be able to lock aggro on a group that obviously don't care about aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plz to not try to arrange my words to fit an arguement.  I do not, and will not agree with breaking one class to fix another.i.e nerfing a class  No matter what side of the fence you stand on.<br />
<br />
Incite and the melee garbage that came with it, is a toy.  The timer is too long 20sec would be a bit more in the reality, maybe.  Its not any better then old taunt (when successful), and drains endurance.  Fool yourselves into believing that it balanced the warriors out.  It just gave us 2 partly successful taunts.   It didnt, we now play like bards, and have mana pools.  Glatius2 i have followed your comments for the bast couple years, and i agree on 99% of the things you post.  This one i however simply disagree.  Simply making the old taunt work sometimes, would have done 10X more for the warriors then incites.  I dont vote for having 2 taunts, 3 if you believe ae is there every pull.  Lets just be really happy, heals dont fail/fizzle this much.  We'd never get anything done.<br />
<br />
1. Suitable aggro abilities<br />
<br />
<br />
Example:.  I'm the only tank in our guild that can tank RZ in potime, it seems.  Here is what i do.<br />
<br />
1) monk pulls takes fd,<br />
2) rt shoots arrows.  RZ goes after him.<br />
3) before rt is in RZ's melee range, i INCITE *note i pulled with incite*<br />
4) i &quot;old&quot; taunt with def on. success or fail, i only use it<br />
5) RZ fd's me<br />
6) when unstunned i AE TUANT. Incite, cuz its there.<br />
<br />
I have never done any more then that.  BOW procs *augmented* holds aggro.   I rely on my BOW and its augment, to hold the aggro.  /cong most warriors not having the tools they need to do their class job.  Warrior gear is too rare or off the hardest mob, and should be looked at, to at least give the class the tools needed.  All warriors having bow, boc, bf, dbotw, etc. does not unbalance the game.  Thats like saying not every cleric will get a cheal.  But they are still useful.  Yes i know there is a ton of weaps out there.  3 warrior only, and all 3 are considered rare, by lucy standards.  The others are pretty much all melee useable.  Although i do have a good guild that they pass so that warriors can have.<br />
<br />
2. Unlinked Discs<br />
<br />
Yes some disc are not tied to others.  It should have been that way from the start.  Offensive and Defensive disc, on the same line, was wrong.<br />
<br />
But better? No way.  We *any pure melee* are now punished X2.  1- endurance *its fuckin mana* and 2- timers *same as its always been, some with trivial timer improvments* Sta bar was never a factor, unless you liked jumping to the next fight.<br />
<br />
I do not know where people ever got the idea that tanks hit attack and watch Opera.  You obviously never tanked shit.  You got positioning to think about, buffs *di* to keep the guild informed of, communication with the healers, tell spam, disc status, etc. I believe that warriors *prolly mostly hybrids posting as warriors* kept saying the melee enhancements were good, and SOE bought it and put them in.  Its eye candy.  I use Defensive, Evasive, or Riposte.  The rest are worthless, unless i want to flash to someone, me constantly critting for 1200 while in frenzy,  and the 3 i listed where there since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Old school warriors have had a class they loved turned into double dragon, bard playing, mana dependant hybrid, with defensive skills.  And yes , thats why i post harshly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you're telling me if one class is over powered in some over looked aspect, another class should get beefed up just as much, instead of nerfing the first class listed. Thats total BS, EQ classes are extremely hard to balance, because theres so many dimensions of play, and to think that you can't be nerfed is stupid.  Necros were extremely over powered early in EQ life, quadded like 70s at level 49, and used fine steel daggers for insane dps, so that means every other pet class should be equivalent or near that to make it fair, instead of nerfing a necro. <br />
<br />
I don't see why people want a higher sucess taunt rate at a set value? 80%?  Think outside the box, if someone over aggro's, why should it be a near-guarentee that you can take the aggro right back? Why dont you just ask for an instant kill button, cuz the game is already easy enough to play as is. If taunt didn't have a higher fail rate, wtf is the point of watching your aggro? A wizard is just gonna keep nuking, cuz the warriors gonan take the aggro right back.  <br />
<br />
IMO the best solution for taunt, because quite often taunt fails 4 - 6 times in a row, which is IMO uncessary, is for incremental sucess upon previous failures.<br />
<br />
make first taunt 60%, if first fails second one is like 75%, third is 85%, 4th caps to 95% or something like that.  RNG can prove the statistical &quot;unlikely&quot; to happen quite often, and I hate it.  RNG only seems to work in an extended timed test, but not in the real game.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who thinks Incite along with LDoN hate augments to make the warrior class too easy? Warriors asking for snap aggro ability, ie discs that guarentee proc etc, needs to go play Knight, cuz the way I see it, warriors were meant to sacrifice solid aggro control for the improved tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
VERY RARELY will a shaman take aggro from me from simply slowing if he starts casting soon as i'm engaged to the mob, its too easy to play with a warrior nowdays, but then again i'm not speaking for the droga weapon warriors.</div></div><hr />

Now, you keep insisting that defensive is a warrior only ability<br />
While we may claim this, SoE has agreed and said, &quot;Defensive is a defining Warrior class ability that will not be shared.&quot; I hope that clears this part up for you.<br />
you just recently got:<br />
<br />
1. Suitable aggro abilities<br />
2. Unlinked Discs<br />
3. Mitigation upgrade.<br />
Each of these changes were the result of the Phase 1 Melee Update which was &quot;needed&quot; (SoE's word) to address long-standing class imbalances.<br />
No where in your class description does it say unparraelled aggro generation<br />
You are correct, the Warrior Class Description says:<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
It says &quot;all their enemies' attacks&quot; not once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
But it was kind of you to bring up the Warrior Class Description. Would you kindly point out in your Class Description where it mentions your class has the ability to obtain aggro at all, much less:<br />
making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
Despite the fact that your entire argument has NO foundation, I partially agree with you  :) -<br />
In order to have a raid role that includes tanking, Knights need to have effective aggro control. Note however that I did not address superior or inferior. There is no aggro contest. I frankly don't care if your aggro is better or worse than mine so long as we both are effective. Knights should be able to effectively obtain and hold aggro.<br />
in the end it would result in you being the choice for all encounters<br />
You have your abilities as laid out in your Class Description and Warriors have theirs. These lead to the acceptability of both classes in normal experiance groups and different but hopefully useful raid roles.<br />
By the way, unless your willing to trade the knight classes something for the ability to summon a mount, you dont have any rights to a horse either.<br />
Silly goose, there's already a drum that summons a Drogma that Warirors can use, we can purchase a horse if we want one. Warriors generally only mention &quot;free&quot; Knight horses to see if anyone, like you, is so petty that they think they are a big deal. Seeing some of the twits that ride horses, frankly, I'd rather walk 8P.<br />

I dunno, taunt works pretty well imo as is, tho i would prefer the incremental success, and I disagree with Brutul that on red cons, taunt fails too much, cuz i think we're missing the point that a red con is supposed to be hard.<br />
<br />
And as far as your quote Glatius about PoP ramming home, the other players need to learn how to control their own aggro. I will agree 100% that warriors aggro pre-ldon for the average joe schmoe was terrible, but now its over powered with augments and incite. But to say if a tank can't get the mob's attention when he needs to, means that the other players are getting it when they shouldn't.  <br />
<br />
Coming from experience as a ranger in plane of valor, I saw all kinds of tanks.  And the average group had a braindead concept of warrior aggro.  Slowers would slow right off the bat and get aggro, and our RNG huggable taunt fails when most needed killing slower, or cleric uses a fast heal too soon instead of timing their Ch right, and gaining aggro and causing messes.  Or a favorite was a ranger/druid(not me.. really!) snaring to pull. IMO that was cuz the players need to grow a brain and realize EQ is an easy game to play, and made easier and easier with ridiculous stat items and feeding the whiners all their cries. Instead they play the game half minded, and complain that its still too hard.  So Sony makes it easier and easier and easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">And as far as your quote Glatius about PoP ramming home, the other players need to learn how to control their own aggro.<br />
<br />
Romul, you can't force people to play the game they way you think they should.  If they see advantages in not having to control their aggro so much and they have the option not to, they'll take it.  The only way to have made it a level playing field would have been to require that they have to control their aggro with all tanks and that would have required a pretty significant change to Knight spells across the board.  Or, as an alternative, they could have made Knights completely unable to tank so the only choice is a Warrior.  Neither was a very good option.  And then the players may have just used a Beastlord or a Ranger instead and all the plate tanks would have been standing around groupless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">The difference between a 60% taunt and a 80% taunt is that mobs will never hit the wrong person on a raid as opposed to just hitting the wrong person rarely.  All Warriors should taunt on things where it is not important which warrior is tanking (most trash, even lesser named).  For the ubers there's always AE Taunt which always work barring bugs, so no need to have anything fancy there.<br />
<br />
For example in Qvic where yellow and red mobs abound, and you're looking at well under 50% chance to taunt yellow+ mobs roughly, so let's call it 25%, but even at 25%, if you have say, 4 warriors, the chance of no one successfully taunted is (0.75)^4 = 31%.  This number at least empirically looks close to what actually happens after mez breaks.  Most of the time a mob will be picked up by a Warrior assuming all the warriors are actually paying attention, even with Knights doing whatever they're doing because someone's taunt will work and beat all the Knight aggro (of course, it's possible the Knight got aggro via taunting too).  The rest is divided between Knights and if the Knights are slacking, it hits the wrong person (Enc, Sham, clerc, whatever).  Taunt, even at lower %, is very powerful because it is one ability that stacks (assuming reasonably good reaction time on your warriors) in a raid.  If you have 6 people capable of taunting (and remember Knights can taunt too), even at 25% success rate per person that leaves you with only 18% chance that the mob won't be hitting one of the 6 tanks.  That's before even considering any additional aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is from a raid point of view.  I do not know what to say about groups.  I know there are groups who do really weird things, and there just isn't anything you can do if someone wants to slow a mob before you can hit it.  It shouldn't require rocket science to XP grind, but it seems like some people put in no effort at all and expect to get away with it.  If this is a persistent pattern it'd make more sense so that people who obviously don't even care about aggro gets penalized globally, i.e. they've a hard time even with a Knight tanking, as opposed to making the game playable for people who don't even try to survive.</div></div><hr />

so in other words, you rather that we have a no-fail taunt, so that all someone else has to do is just keep clicking that spell gem, might as well bring out Raymond's Diablo Trainer, and no not ALL tanks.  Thats the whole point of warriors! We lost better aggro control for the sake of better tanking! So if u want a lesser tankable class, but better aggro go pick a knight to tank for the group.  You can't have all and maintain game balance, yet you want a taunt that gives all.</div></div><hr />

No i dont want more aggro.  You think warriors got more aggro with incite?  Incite isnt more, its and add on, like LoY was to POP.   All many are asking for is more reliance on the old aggro we had/have.  <br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with taunt either, with the possible exception that the success rate goes down a bit too much on red-cons, but on blues the success rate is completely acceptable to me.<br />
<br />
Thats fine if you like tanking green and blue mobs.  Many players *even causal grinders* find them selves tanking mobs that are a bit harder then that.  And to say your fine with your aggro contradicts what i just quoted.  If you were happy, you wouldnt say any exeptions to the rule.<br />

Romul, I've had this discussion a number of times with a number of different people.  And if taunt was 100% successful every time, and you could fire it off every single time someone goofed, with no refresh timer at all, then you'd have a point.  But the fact is that taunt is on a timer.  That timer can be lengthened or shortened as is deemed appropriate.  So if they wanted to make taunt 100% successful but it had a 5 minute refresh, they could do that.  And if you think having only 1 successful taunt available every 5 minutes wouldn't add challenge to the game and require people to control aggro, then you don't understant how taunt works.  And they could do something in between as well.  I happen to disagree with taunts current setting, but that's kind of a moot point, isn't it?<br />
<br />
This is only a theoretical discussion.  The game is as the game is and while I happen to think taunt should have been fixed, the fact is that incite works well enough to make the Warrior class reasonably functional, and in the end that's the important point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understand the math of the situation Phantron the only difference between making sure a Warrior gets aggro with a 60% success rate and 80% success rate is the number of Warriors you have to throw at the mob.  If you have enough Warriors taunting there will come a point at which you are mathematically certain to have one of them be successful.  With an 80% success rate it just takes fewer to reach that point than with a 60% success rate.  That's it.</div></div><hr />

that 5 min 100% taunt no fail you're talking about is AET, which is the long refresh no fail taunt.

Any closer and there would be no difference. <br />
<br />
You forget that its not always the actual gap, while somewhat important, that makes the difference between a knight tanking something and a warrior tanking something.<br />
<br />
Well...lets make this clear, allow to illustrate:<br />
<br />
My guild has an overage of tanks, mostly warriors seeing that we currently have close to 11 mains and 2 active recruits.  Basically forcing our way through the lower PoP tiers (just killed Rallos.) Content that knights are still supposed to be balanced against, and we mostly are.<br />
<br />
Ask me the last time Ive offtanked something on a raid, or one of the other 7 sks in my guild has....dont hold your breath this might take awhile.  Same goes for pulling, peeling of mobs, ect.  Basically Im just there to hit auto, cast zefs/AoH, and HT.  No pickup groups, I get asked daily what my stats are to tank, when your at 8k hp and 1600 ac nothing should keep me from being desireable, but day after day I sit looking for some pickup group because there are 4 guild groups in earth. Getting asked the same questions by &quot;random_person_01&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only 8k?  Kthx.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell me, if your classes primary role since launch has been to tank, and your had that taken away to do the same boring shit for 300 trash mobs a day, would you be happy?  I already know the answer, you had a gamewide strike going on not too long ago for just that.<br />
<br />
You know what causes this? Perception.  People &quot;percieve&quot; knights to be inferior because even though 12% is nothing for the most part, people make it out to be 100% after hearing of it and your discs.  I have neither the time or the patience to explain this with pretty charts and graphs to another 50 people, and every xp group I try to get into on a daily basis, more than likely Ill be ignored.<br />
<br />
I am not an advocate for knights getting defensive, personally, I dont want it.  However, a full riposite/evasive disc linked to mana or endurance is along the lines of what we are entitled to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Romul, I know this.  I know about AET.  I was giving an example so you would understand that just because something has a 100% success rate doesn't make it overpowered if you use other factors to make it not be.  How often does a Cleric fizzle a heal?  Not very damn often.  Has that broken the game?  But OMG, you mean that Clerics have at least an 80% chance of getting off a heal every time they cast it?  That must just break the game!  But it doesn't, does it?  Or how about the failure rait of Rogue backstabs, they go off on a pretty predictable basis, does that break the game?  Uhm, no it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Designing a game around abilities having a significant failure rate means you're designing the game to be based more on luck of the draw than on ability of the players.  If on the other hand player abilities are given a fairly high success rate, but are restricted by other constraints, like refresh timers, then you can go about designing a game that is based on challenging the skills of the players and not just whether or not they happened to roll the right number at the right time. <br />
<br />
And as far as your comments about making the game easier for me, blah blah blah, you know I haven't been insulting to you, I'm not sure why you feel the need to be insulting to me.  Where I come from, that's called being rude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crimson, do you really think that Warriors don't get asked some of the same questions and get passed over for their answers?  Let me clue you in, it happens.  It's not that unusual at all.  Now, are you talking 8k buffed or unbuffed?  Because if you're talking unbuffed, then the people passing you over are fools unless where you're trying for groups is just plain nasty.  If you're talking buffed, then obviously where you're trying to get a group people want a tank with a bit more meat.  I would probably also be passed on in that setting.  I'm sure there are lots of Warriors who would be.<br />
<br />

<br />
Here's the difference.  You have all the tools necessary to do your job.  There is no particular reason for people to pass you over for a group slot, other than either unreasonable bias or you're trying to get groups in places over your head (and I don't really think that's the case).  The only way to combat unreasonable bias would be to give Knights such a huge advantage, like they had in PoP, that people put their biases aside and take the Knight over the Warrior. <br />
<br />
It isn't that your class &quot;can't&quot; tank.  It's that for some reason you're finding that people won't let you tank.  And the reason they won't let you tank isn't seemingly based on anything more than unreasonable personal preference.  How do you fix that?  How do you explain to people that rather then there being a legitimate provable difference that makes one class far more advantageous than another, like when Warriors couldn't hold aggro, that their decisions are based solely on gut instinct or prejudice?</div></div><hr />

Pal/sk (as a class pair collective) can stop whining about how useless they are, grow a backbone already, and show people that they can. Every single high level pal/sk I know do this.<br />

In the time I've spent in this game I have found three things that will chance any individuals mind about being able to suitably handle a situation with a certain class.<br />
<br />
1. Experience with said individual proving otherwise.<br />
2. A patch message.<br />
3. Pretty charts and graphs with parses.<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
<br />
1. Dosent apply, I cant even argue for the chance.<br />
2. Check some of the current EQLive posts about whats going on currently, knight issues arent going to be on the &quot;to do&quot; list for quite some time.  This is caused by the numerous idiots populating my class boards with their own &quot;2 cp&quot; about what sks should be about.  Along with the other 40 people who come along to flame the morons with their own moronic ideas.  In a nutshell, knights will never agree on worthwhile change(s) to ask for.<br />
3. Now I could link all your pretty parse threads onto my guild board, perhaps maybe even put the URL to it in the notes field of my LFG entry.  Either way, its not going to make a damn lick of difference to people with preset ideas of how well I tank under certain circumstances.<br />
<br />
Im not whining, Im speaking of my own personal experiences.  If you had access, Id link you to the threads in which I argue for the rest of my guilds class roster on my internal board.</div></div><hr />

Im well aware I dont need a riposite disc for xp tanking, just like you dont use defensive to tank XP mobs.<br />
<br />
Im talking about raid roles and xp roles.  Riposite is however, going to make me much more attractive in an offtanking slot.<br />
<br />
Ill make it very simple, as to not get into another flame war over stupid shit:<br />
<br />
In the once and a great while that I manage to stay awake on the 400th VT clearing we do to equip recruits and bots, sometimes monks get alittle overzelus pulling.  When you have 30-35 people clearing, its slow, its tedious, and somewhat risky with overpulls.  So the warriors are going down, as is most of the raid.  Situations like this, I may end up with an Eom unslowed that I have to keep occupied while we attempt to get a cleric/casters camped to avoid a total wipe.  No healer, so, tap tap tap, leechcurse, perhaps HT the low hp runner ping ponging off people to drop him.  All but one cleric is dead, Im almost OOM/low hp with no discs.  Comes down to two choices:<br />
<br />
1. I can fein, let the mob cap the cleric.  Sit there and watch the rogues drag corpses. <br />
<br />
2. Stand and spend the last 300 hp or so to give the cleric that extra .5 seconds to camp, which is probably gonna result in him dying anyway.<br />
<br />
Since I have no riposite disc, or anything to help me in those &quot;oh shit&quot; situations, either way Im below warriors, rangers,  rogues, beastlords or any other hybrid who could have given that cleric almost an extra 20 seconds to camp, close to 2/3 of the time needed.  This is not balanced, HT, FD, are not utility that should seperate me from having the 90% of tanking classes and hybrids (utility mind you) with the ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">What you're missing is that if you were a warrior you would have died sooner than you did, disc or not, because you wouldn't have been able to tap and the riposte disc would have been all you had.

SK by FAR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Ah, but Crimson's point here about group desirability for knights is exactly why I brought knights up in a &quot;what warriors need&quot; thread. I seriously don't think it's a derail, and I'll tell you why.<br />
<br />
Knights were tanks from day one; light tanks, maybe, but supposedly with other skills that made them useful and desirable in groups. So if people do not believe these other skills are significant, knights will have a hard time getting groups. A lot of people play knights, so SOE can't ( or shouldn't) really just let them dangle out there. Zerkers maybe (heh, god what a strange class to add), but knights no.<br />
<br />
I don't really have a good sense of how difficult it is for knights to get in groups. I suspect that in the upper levels of the game, the situation may be different for knights than it is in lower levels. My SK alt mostly plays with the alts of folks I already know, but I think that, for example, LDoNs groups looking for a tank will at best see a knight as neutral and a warrior as positive, with the possible exception of undead-heavy places and groups that need the tank to be the puller. At any rate, when finding groups reaches the point where it's an obvious problem for knights (you know, knight lfg for an hour while warriors zone in and get called up in five minutes), that's *precisely* when the fate of warriors and knights become linked.<br />
<br />
Our fates are linked because It's not realistic to expect SOE to say to their customers who happen to have picked knights to play, &quot;You should have realized that if you wanted to get groups you should have made a different class. Now that you're lvl 65, why don't you admit your mistake and re-roll a warrior, or maybe a cleric?&quot;<br />
If knights are facing serious problems convincing other people that knights are useful in groups, then warriors do have a problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is not theoretical. When knights had significant aggro advantages over warriors, the warrior mitigation advantage simply was not enough to convince groups to pick a warrior. Solution? Improve warrior aggro, unlink discs. Okay, now warrior aggro is more like knights' aggro, and warriors can get groups, but suddenly knight utility is not enough to make up for warrior mitigation and knights can't get groups (assuming they are, in fact, having trouble getting groups).<br />
<br />
A move to improve knight mitigation dramatically simply continues the cycle. That's why I say that making knights more like warriors and warriors like knights is not a very good solution, and why /disc defensive for knights or aggro lock for warriors simply moves the point of disequilibrium rather than solves the problem.<br />
<br />
And, that's why I think &quot;closing the gap&quot; between knights and warriors is a failure of imagination. We need a different solution, or nine months from now warriors will be back to where we were 9 months ago: lfg. <br />
<br />
Rather than make knights and warriors more alike, they should be &quot;more different.&quot; -- knights should be less, not more, like warriors. Right now, if knights can't get groups, it's for two reasons:<br />
1. Their mitigation isn't as good as warriors'.<br />
2. Their utility does not make up for their lack of mitigation.<br />
<br />
Most discussions I see on this issue focus on #1.  I've explained why I think that's not ultimately a good path. Not for knights, not for warriors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Crimson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">What you're missing is that if you were a warrior you would have died sooner than you did, disc or not, because you wouldn't have been able to tap and the riposte disc would have been all you had.  I have done LDoN Hard with SKs plenty of times, and if you want to know who lives longer with no heals, SK tapping or a warrior using riposte disc, there's no comparison.  SK by FAR.<br />
<br />
Situational.<br />
<br />
ToI and ToV, while fast casting, may give me an extra few seconds of life if I can manage to channel through the damage incoming.  Stuns, effect both my lifetap disc through me not being able to hit/getting spun around, and my casting.  Your disc is instant, no interupt.  All else fails, if you have a decent amount of hp left after the riposite disc, you could pop defensive.  I have yet to see a valid reason why other hybrids with utility seem to have no argument against their mitigation/evasive discs, yet knights meet with almost unrelenting opposition.<br />
<br />
And I know why too, because they arent going head to head with you for offtank and group desireabilty in the tank position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">So yours is better in some situations and mine is better in others.  Sounds like balance no?  <br />
<br />
And you can tap whenever you have mana, where Furious/Fortitude are 12 seconds out of every 45 minutes.  If your HT disc is up, you can probably kill the mob outright several seconds before a warrior tanking would, so you do have an &quot;oh shit&quot; disc.<br />
<br />
For the record, I'm not really against knights getting a dodge/riposte disc.  But right now, in a exp group/raid clearing situation where the healer goes down, a group is far better off with either a SK or a paladin than a warrior.<br />
<br />
This became very clear to me not too long ago when I did a LDoN hard with 2 SKs in my group.  The cleric went down and we're waiting for him to come back and the SK says &quot;let's pull one&quot;.  Bard goes and gets one and the SK tanks it, finishes the fight full health.  Damn.  &quot;Bring another one&quot; he says.  This one he finishes the fight at 80% health and says &quot;low mana&quot;.  Next mob comes and the other SK starts tanking but I'm thinking I should be able to tank one of these since the SK did so good so I hit taunt.  Wind up using riposte disc at 20% health and it carries me to the end of the fight, but now I'm at 20% health and have no disc for 45 minutes, while the first SK is almost ready for another mob.  And my AC and hps are considerably higher than either of these guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Crimson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Rather than make knights and warriors more alike, they should be &quot;more different.&quot; -- knights should be less, not more, like warriors. Right now, if knights can't get groups, it's for two reasons:<br />
1. Their mitigation isn't as good as warriors'.<br />
2. Their utility does not make up for their lack of mitigation.<br />
<br />
Most discussions I see on this issue focus on #1.  I've explained why I think that's not ultimately a good path. Not for knights, not for warriors.<br />
I wish I had a practical, easy-to-implement silver bullet suggestion for a change that would work for number 2. All I can say is that I feel that for knights to be useful in the long run, the best solution is to work on #2.<br />
Knights should be able to tank if a group stays on its toes, but the group should feel that for that in exchange for adjusting to the knights' lower mitigation, the groups are getting something useful in return.<br />
<br />
<br />
Major problems lie in both our no mitigation ability, and our shortsited utility.  Im not going to pull, thats a monk, bard, or even a cleric with lull.  Im not dps, Im considered a tank slot.  Im not croud control, mana battery, Im a hybrid with no niche other than average offtanking.  <br />
<br />
Paladins should be the best tank at heal/stun mitigation, but with a huge mana cost to offset it.  This can be achieved with high mana/low resist stuns, and fast casting, moderate to high mana cost heals, and group heals.  Shitty ass pitiful DPS.  All that being offset by interupts, and one short &quot;ohshit&quot; ability other than LH which is more of a toy than a useful ability on a day to day basis.<br />
<br />
Warriors, are for the most part, other than the taunt button issue, well off atm.  Still the raid tank, still a very respectable offtank, surviver of the most brutal encounters.  Number one choice for the bleeding edge content. Moderate to slightly above average DPS.  Retain all discs.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are the worst mitigation, stat taps and debuff taps that mean something to the group and gimp their enemies in way that dosent take 14 hours of parsing to notice.  Semi decent healing with high mana cost/high damage short casting lifetaps.  Fein death, corpse summoning, ect aka harder to kill than a cockroach.  Very slightly behind warriors in pure melee dps, between a warrior and perhaps slightly higher than a monk mana bar permitting.  One short &quot;ohshit&quot; life preserving disc.<br />
<br />
LH and HT are too long of a reuse to be useful at this point, they are toys, eye candy.  HT does not save raids/groups that are going to fail without it, LH might, if timed and used correctly.  Defensive and Furious however, save raids/groups(to a much lesser extent) every day.</div></div><hr />

All decisions made for highend knights effect the class through perception.  If a group percieves a 65 PoP SK lower in tanking desireability because the tomb for the disc they require is dropped an expansion and 3 locked zones ahead of their progression, then it is indeed a class issue.  How do we counter this?<br />
<br />
1. Insert the disc tomb on a high end named in fire. Why fire? Because the zone requires 2 Gods to enter, and is a good part along the line to where we begin to see the knight offtanking problem become more apparent.  Tomb should be no drop.<br />
<br />
2. Spell revisions for both lower end sks and the highend.  My healing is subpar to the mobs Im fighting, a 800-1.3k touch tap is not out of the question if its parred with my tap AA, this makes me come a close second to paladins hybrid tank healing.  As I mentioned earlier, make my group taps mean something, sks need their lower end taps increased in strength to match both mob dps, and group needs.  Up my attack tap, my AC tap, give me a HP increase tap, somewhere as a perhaps 200 max hp increase short term buff.  Move all of these to the short buff window and make the majory of them able to be clicked off if not wanted.  My self buff is sub par and does not stack with BSS, the dmg shield on it is moot, change it to self haste or mana regen that stacks with my lich line.  Lower end sks need more self buffs other than diamondskin.  Make zeefers not only give mana, but perhaps a slight endurance regen also, up the damage to at least 400/200 mana recourse and scale it.  Stop balancing my self inbued procs with my Soul Abrasion ability, and an upgrade to Mental corruption would be nice.<br />
Remove unholy aura and make HT scale naturally with the bonus post 55.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on, but what we need the most is for people to get behind these revisions.  What I see is warriors arguing their side, paladins whining, and then shadowknight arguing our side with obscure links to goatse.cx thrown in.  What we need to do is have our own summit, these are tanking issues, they effect us all through the balance of each other.  Perhaps a closed forum, with the class leaders invited, here, or SK.org where you can *try* to come up with a solution and revisions that all three classes can agree on and get behind.  Because this bickering and noncomformance isnt going to get us, or the game anywhere near balanced and enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">All decisions made for highend knights effect the class through perception.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  In PoP it wasn't high end Warriors suffering from horrible aggro control, their aggro control was &quot;acceptable&quot;.  It was every other Warrior in the game.  The perception of the high end does not necessarily corrolate to an across the game perception, particularly when it is demonstratively not true.</div></div><hr />

Twitch is unwanted, scale zeefers to increase group mana instead, Im not a mana battery.  Upgraded FD is a must, along the lines of .5 sec.  I dont think we are entitled to a rez really, its just not in our description.  Theres a whole thread on shadowknight.org by Slein Jinn that summerise most of our problems.  I still stand by that we need to get the leaders together however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you're not a mana battery...but if the cleric is OOM, twitching could mean the difference between life and death.  I'm not saying have them turn you into a mana battery, but utility is utility.  The ability to dump the cleric or wizard all your mana could play big.<br />
<br />
Of course, scaling Zeefers is also great utility.  I was looking at the utility of necro and suggesting you get a downgraded-but-still-useful slew of that (twitch, fd, dots, debuffs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Real Debuffs for the SK would be great, especially if they came up to the level of, oh, say, cripple. Some time ago here, Ciae and I hacked out a few debuff concepts, I still think they're promising. <br />
<br />
Upgrades to Zbite could be good. Group taps like this are a good complement to just about every group, and the dd nature means no making extant buffslot issues worse. For the stat taps we've already got, fix the bloody duration issues. 60 second duration on a 72 second, decaying recours recast is just silly. Six minutes was standard for the old taps, there's little reason the PoP+ taps can't be the same.  <br />
<br />
Dots we have aplenty, but the issue with dots is generally massive mana ineffiency - By the time we establish solid aggro(2-3 casts, estimate 10-15 seconds) and get the dot off, the mob has maybe 30-45 seconds of life left. A minute or two minute DoT is largely wasted. Our only short dot isn't much more efficent than our nukes, and in the fast paced fights of GoD and PoP, I often lose ticks, especially with a big nuker.<br />
<br />
Many of us fear the idea of being given twitch for memories of what we did with the necros in early velious - Sit in the corner, twitch, you can't contribute anything else meaningful. Worse, twitches, and much of the rest of the spellbook, are tuned to be backed up by the current level Necro-conversion, which devestates other passive regen, while our own lich is inferior to c3 while healed by an outside source, and inferior to c1 if we have to negate the damage by Bond of Death.<br />
<br />
Just unthrottling our ability to use our spells would go a significant distance, though orginality in ideas more desired. Heal/Damage Per Second unfocused for Touch of Innoruuk is 261 in terms of 'raw cast time', 142 in terms of 'Raw cast + Fizzle time'.. and a whopping 40 in terms of 'How much can you get chaining'? Similarly, our GoD Nuke is hardcapped at less than 15 DPS by cast time, while being the same mana efficiency as our level 39 nuke. Our nuke output is hard throttled not by our mana pools or focus effects the way a caster is, but arbitrarily by recast times. 'Burn mode' is bascially a joke with these hard caps -  Fix this. Uncork our spells, let us use them at will, and let our mana pool say no. Stop balancing our dots/taps for a Lich+, balance them to what we get, c5, and let our unque lines actually get more efficient with level. (No. Spike of Disease doesn't count.)<br />
<br />
Once you've done that, an Oh Shit button that doesn't kill my cleric would still be great. A stonestance clone for when you get those bad rounds and the writing is on the wall would be a good step, if the fast recycle's still there. Would be good for offtanking as well, buying time for a slow. Since we're five levels too low for GoD, something to shore us up short term, and ensure scaleability long term is kind of desireable.<br />

<br />
These changes simply aren't necessary.<br />
<br />
With Omen spells SK has 4 potential taps (Z, Ancient, Omen Z, Omen Ancient).  That pumps a lot of mana to an entire group, probably even more efficient than Necro twitches for all practical purposes if you've a SK dedicated to it<br />
<br />
Paladins already have stuns that work up to level 55.  Actually they have 3 of them (Akilae, Akera, and the one no one uses).  They do not need group heal over time.  That's what Wave of (whatever) is for.  And if a Paladin with channeling can't cast a 1 second heal on himself, no one will ever be able to cast any spell while getting beat on.  I mean, I can usually sneak in a 1 second casting savage guard and I don't have any channeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I think the real issue here is perception. Pallies and SK's are having supposedly having trouble getting groups. 80% of the time when I'm invited to a group and there is a knight or another warrior, they leave... Why? One of the most successfull hard ldon's i've done was pulled entirely by an SK. I'm always open to having an sk or pally in my group to pick up the slack. I've had great experiences grouping with pallies too. Even 2 warrior groups aren't too bad, provided somebody has a decent dps weapon. Why are people so insistent that every group only needs 1 &quot;tank&quot;?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I've also grouped with several pallies recently who literally didn't know about their stuns. I ask them to tank, and they can't. I ask them if they're using stuns, they say &quot;what?&quot;The slower starts getting the heck beat out of them and I finally have to step in and taunt taunt incite and put on my aggro weapons. No wonder people's perception of knight tanks is bad.<br />
<br />
Maybe some education is in order, both within the knight ranks (don't just stand there and expect the mob to hit you because you're cute), and the general populace (knights can do more than just get hit) ?</div></div><hr />

Sure that group would probably do more damage if it was say War Rog Rog Bard but you can't just wait for such a group to fall into your laps.  Sometimes you just have to take the best you can get.  Getting a group is not easy for anyone unless you're an Enchanter or a Cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">The biggest problem knights have right now is perception, both their own and potential group mates.  When warriors were lfg because we, as a class, couldnt hold aggro, we werent getting groups because we did not have the tools necessary to do our jobs.  Even after we got our upgrades, I saw no real prejudice one way or another in tank preference in xp groups.  Pretty  much whatever tank was available at the time was what most groups went with.  <br />
<br />
Fast forward to the present where we've had a few months of endless streams of for the most part baseless &quot;My class sucks and needs an upgrade&quot; whining and suddenly knights, who are just as strong as they were a few months ago, can't get groups.  And I still want to know if the AC/HP totals Crimson gave in his &quot;cant get an xp group&quot; example were buffed or unbuffed totals.  If they were unbuffed, there's not a damn reason in the world why you couldnt tank and tank well in plane of earth.  If they were buffed totals, well, if I had access to earth I'd get turned down as a pickup group tank too, so I'm right there with you.  <br />
<br />
I think Igneous has the right idea.  You've got all the tools necessary to do your jobs, act like it.  In some situations a warrior tank is clearly a better choice, there's no denying that.  The biggest problem is that knights fail to recognize that there are alot of situations in which a paladin or an sk tank are clearly a far superior choice than a warrior.  So follow Igneous' advice, grow a spine, take some pride in your class' strengths and play towards them.  Instead of &quot;We suck, give us defensive (or the mitigation /disc of your choice)&quot;  how about, &quot;We are really versatile tanks that are more than adequate in xp groups and have a clearly defined raid role, retune our spellbooks so that we can further carve out our niche&quot;?  <br />
<br />
Spells are damned powerful, if there are some gaps in your arsenal of spells, or some room for improvement there, then ask for it.  &quot;Our spellbook does not adequately offset the tanking differences between us and similarly geared warriors; improve or retune it so that it does.&quot;  makes perfect sense.  It's outcome logically flows from it's opening statement.  &quot;Our spellbook does not adequately offset the tanking differences between us and warriors; give us defensive.&quot; does not.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's an overly simplistic way of looking at it. It doesn't have to flow from the opening statement, since you could simply turn the phrase around: &quot;The tanking shortcomings of the knight are larger than are justified by the addition of a spellbook.&quot; There may be multiple ways of solving the problem (assuming you even bleive there is one, which somebody will always deny), but you can't say that giving a mitigation skill isn't one that flows logically from the problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Okay, here are 3 issues and some discussion about them.<br />
<br />
1. In post 87 of this thread, Glatius 2 asked why I thought the problem of knights getting groups was &quot;not theoretical.&quot; Actually, the problem that I was refering to as &quot;not theoretical&quot; was the way that the fate of knights and warriors are linked. Look, relatively early on in EQ players noticed that warriors had the best mitigation. For years, warriors were the prefered tanks in most situations, and over time that perception grew stronger. To the extent knights' primary function was tanking, that made it difficult for them to get groups. When expansions began to show up with mobs that could whack a caster in one or two rounds, though, suddenly the shortcomings of warrior aggro became so dangerous that knights became the prefered tank for most of these mobs. So, after months of warriors lfg and a standdown, warriors got better aggro tools and unlinked discs. Suddenly, warriors could hold aggro. This, coupled with GoD's unfortunate level of tuning, certainly made warriors the prefered tank against tough mobs, and has *perhaps* made it more difficult for knights to get exp. groups. Thus I maintain that the link between the &quot;playability&quot; of warriors and knights is not theoretical, it's historical and it has manifested itself over and over and over. What happens to one class of tanks affects all classes of tanks.<br />
1. a. My first point here is not that at the moment one class or the other is overpowered. My point is that changes to warriors influence knights and changes to knights influence warriors. I think the knight and warrior communities should be able to agree on that. If we can't, then we shouldn't be talking about knights at all in this thread.<br />
1.b. If we agree on that small point, then the next question is this: are we in this together, or are we going to keep calling each other whiners and fucktards? By the way I ask this question you can tell what I think. In my view, it's vital for warriors that knights have recognized and valuable roles, both in groups and raids. And the reverse is true as well. When classes are out of balance, the history of EQ suggests that eventually (after a painfully long time) the underpowered class will be strengthened, sometimes to the point that the other class is suddenly undesirable. Or the powerful class will be nerfed. Neither of these outcomes is optimum. Endless rounds of nerfage and shifting disequilibrium are bad, and they're bad for all three classes of tanks.<br />
<br />
2. The next question then becomes: At the moment, do knights have recognized roles that get them groups and raid slots, and the tools to do their jobs once they're in a group or a raid?<br />
2. a. I happen to think this is several questions. The answer might be different for characters below lvl 55 than it is for characters who are 65 with 200 AAs. It might be different for group situations and raid situations. I suspect that sometimes when people disagree about the answer to this question, they do so partly because at different levels of this game, there are such huge differences in characters, mobs and zones that the level 60 folks are simply playing a different game that the lvl 65 max AA folks. I will give you a small example. Before the melee changes, I leveled an untwinked warrior from 30 to 50, mostly in Kunark zones. At the same time you might have sat for 2 hours as a lvl 65 warrior lfg in PoP, I would zone into OT or DL, shout I was lfg, and simply start running toward popular grouping spots. Within 90 seconds of zone in, I'd have an invite. Often multiple invites. It was quite literally the case that I spent 20 levels never having to wait more than a minute and a half for a pick-up group. Then, suddenly, I hit level 50 and hours of lfg in PoP. I didn't change, but the game did.<br />
2.b. The first step in solving a problem is to get a good definition of what the problem is. Only by defining the problem can you even tell if the problem exists. Some knights obviously believe they have a functionality problem. Apparently some warriors disagree. What we should be doing is coming to some sort of understanding of what knights think the problems actually are, and the levels/zones/conditions underwhich they manifest themselves. Instead, what happens is that we jump from &quot;Hey, I have a problem&quot; to endless specific proposals for solving the problem (up to and including proposals that would basically put various classes in God Mode), interspersed with some people saying there is no problem and other people objecting to the proposed changes and other people claiming that the real problem is something else and offering different solutions, and other people calling the first guy a whining fucktard. If we want SOE to take our suggestions seriously, we have to have serious suggestions about defined and demonstrably true problems. We do not all have to agree, but it would be nice if we were disagreeing about defined issues. then the nature of our disagreements can be defined as well.<br />
2. C. Underlying some of this, perhaps, might be a class definition issue. Warriors are quite fond of telling knights that &quot;You've never been able to tank the boss/hard mobs in new expansions right away.&quot; Well, okay. Are knights supposed to be able to do this or not? This is a game design issue, I think, and it ought to be an issue that SOE can answer clearly. If to main tank a boss mob in one expansion, knights need gear from the next expansion, well, that should be made clear. If that's not what is supposed to be happening, well, that should be clear too.<br />
<br />
3. Over time, both warriors and knights are going to get both new powers and harder mobs/new expansions to deal with. Basically it seems to me that knights' use value comes in two categories: damage mitigation, and utility/spells. I've offered the opinion that the problem with improving knights by focusing on increased mitigation (by which I mean innate mitigation and AA/disc effects that would be shared by warriors) is that it threatens to create a situation where warriors and knights leapfrog each other over and over in terms of mitigation and hence effectiveness as tanks. If knight utility becomes a trivial part of their value because direct damage mitigation is exponentially more important than everything else, then they are functionally warriors. Certainly among the most serious players, there is a powerful tendency to min/max everything. If warriors and knights do the same job in the same way, one class will be better at it. The other classes will have more or less dramatic game play issues. <br />
3. a. This is why I say that I believe that for all three classes to have a valued place in groups and raids, knight utility has to be strengthened. For all three classes to have a role, the classes have to be different, not the same.<br />
3. b. I could be wrong about this.<br />
3. c. Even if I'm right--or especially if I'm right--balancing the classes by making them different is going to be extremely difficult.</div></div><hr />

While in general I agree with you there is a couple of problems.  The first is that no matter what raid role Knights are given, some Knights will never be satisfied with anything short of complete Warrior raid parity.  They want to be able to do everything a Warrior can do and retain their spellbooks in the process.  Not everyone is reasonable and even reasonable people may legitimately disagree on the fine points.  The second problem of course being that conversely some Warriors will never be satisfied with anything short of complete tanking superiority.</div></div><hr />

On numerous ocassions Verant and SoE have in fact asserted that Warriors are the primary tank, have unmatched survivability, will always tank better than Knights, etc.<br />
<br />
The difficulty arises for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Knights want to be the hero too. As far as they are concerned, they are tanks (and Rangers aren't) and they should have ample opprotunity to MT raid boss mobs. Although this arguement is always presented as a class balance argument, in truth it's a &quot;I want to have fun.&quot; arguement.<br />
<br />
2. Warriors do not have a meaningful second task nor is it clear that they want one. Speaking only for myself, I would accept Knights being viable raid MT's if less preferred if and only if I got:<br />
<br />
1. A 1500HP 1 second self-only heal. where 10 &quot;casts&quot; would cost me half of my endurance bar.<br />
2. A better offensive capability than crappy crit and cripple. It takes me a long time to kill a stoopid giant in Kael Arena solo.<br />
3. Root.<br />
4. A Kick, bash, slam stun effective on any non-stun immune mob in the game that produced aggro.<br />
5. 100 banked AA's and a free horse as compenstation for having to acquire/spend DKP on aggro weapons/Anger augs as well as DPS weapons/DPS augs, years of RNG aggro with no fix, and loss of a traditional role.<br />
6. An endurance regen buff.<br />
7. A wide and impressive assortment of endurance fueled abilities.<br />
8. Buff venders (not crappy tribute) in PoK that for a fee provide any level appropriate 25% extended buff in the game.<br />
9. A one year paid up subscription to WoW.<br />
<br />
Warriors are extraordinarily limited, focused, and group dependent. If the ONLY reason to play a Warrior is taken away, then transforming Warriors into a highly versatile and group independent class is reasonable.<br />

The plan right now is to have them linked together into two lines to match the current basic/ancient set up. The newer ones will be linked to the same timer as the old ones.<br />
