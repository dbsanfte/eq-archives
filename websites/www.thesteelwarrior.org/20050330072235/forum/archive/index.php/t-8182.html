<br />
Anyone know where it spawns ? I've heard conflicting stories.... I'm guessing it to be a named spawning from other spiders, but is any spider it's PH or just spiders at a specific location ?<br />
<br />
Exact information would be most helpful, and also allow me to appear knowledgable and wise in the eyes of my group as I lead them to certain death.. errr.. a nice xp camp !!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 2 named spawns there who share the same loot table.<br />
<br />
OBS is his rare drop - the knight thingie is much more common.<br />
<br />
Prepare to spend ages there :(</div></div><hr />

The spawn points I know of for the various minis are the 2nd hut from the left there is a stacked spawn where 2 minis can spawn right on top of each other, then on island w/ 1 hut has a spawn and war spider can spawn on island w/ no huts. The way I got mine was last week's server crash I zoned into fire as soon as I got back on and there were 2 minis up, Obsidian War Spider and Jopal Chieftain. Pulled war spider and it dropped the sword, chieftain just dropped a mace so no extras for the guild.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spider spawns on the first island you see as you go over the lava (no huts), there is a single spawn point on the 2nd small island with 1 hut. The large island has 3 spawn points I believe (1 per  hut (2 on the far side of the island, 1  in the closest hut to the 2 small islands)<br />
<br />
Compared to most exp camps, the exp here sucks and makes dragging people to this camp a chore.  As said above, most people just do these nameds on server up and hope to get lucky.</div></div><hr />

I have a friend who tried camping them for 20+ hours and never saw one.That's nothing heh. 17 place holders, scattered over 2 weeks of daily long hour camping. Ah well, it was good xp at least back then :x</div></div><hr />

<br />
the XP is actually comprable to earth IF you have a high DPS group.  The mobs don't hit for anything .  They have Low hp and drop good cash.  bring a warrior a druid and all DPS and you'll gain great xp.<br />
<br />
In terms of the pet proccer, yeah it's a myth but dedication pays off.  I got mine off the war spider and also had about 20-30 other knight maces rot.  Couldn't even GIVE em away.<br />
<br />
Clearing the isle and all PH's you'll see about one named every 1.5 to 2 hours. Good luck ) and remember,   Play UP the xp.  It really is good.</div></div><hr />
