<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know a way to balance most warriors without a) nerfing knights or b) trivializing content.  This will work for nearly all situations, some high end raid encounters not withstanding.<br />
<br />
To explain, let me lay out what I think the problem with warriors is currently.  <br />
<br />
It's not snap aggro.  Warriors have never had snap agro.  Knights always have.  This wasn't always a problem.  The problem is the massive leap in DPS that mobs have received, and more specificaly the massive increase the damage intervals mobs use to figure the damage on each hit.<br />
<br />
In the good old days, a warrior was the ideal tank.  No, they couldn't hold perfect aggro, but if the cleric or chanter took a round or two of damage, it wasn't a huge problem.  However the hitpoint gap between tanks of all kinds and non tanks began to widen in the luclin era and increased even more in PoP.  To counter the increased HP's that tanks had, mobs had to hit harder as well.  The AC gap also increased along with the AC softcap.  This means that while tanks of all type advanced relatively equal to mob dmg output, the ability of other classes to withstand a round or two of combat decreased dramaticaly.  Paladins and SK's became the preferred tank because it was no longer feasible to have your casters take a round or two of damage.  Meanwhile the gap between warrior ac/hp and knight ac/hp diminished leaving the warrior with only his discs to seperate him.. and compared to knight utility spells (heals, buffs, fd, snare) this wasn't much.<br />
<br />
Most warriors seem to be clamoring for some sort of snap aggro.  Not me.  I don't want to be a knight, I want to be a warrior.  More importantly, I want the knights to retain that unique ability.  <br />
<br />
What I want is a way to for casters to feel comfortable knowing that standing between them and the mob is a human shield ready to throw down his life to protect them.  Enter the /shield command.  This was a good concept in theory, but lousy in practice.  First, the range on it is much too short.  Generaly the only time I need it is when the mob has run to the casters and by the time I'm in range to /shield, it's too late.  Second, unless I plan to redo 5 hotkeys every time I group up or untarget the mob I'm supposed to be tanking w/ an assist, I have to type out the command by hand.  By then, it's often too late, and I'm a fast typist.  Third, the fact that it has a limited duration and a reuse timer is inane.  It makes no sense.<br />
<br />
Here's how it SHOULD work.  I have /shield off or /shield on.  If /shield is on, then I will automaticaly /shield anyone in my group/raid that is taking damage from a mob I have targeted if they are in range.  The range should also be increased somewhat.  In addition, this should generate some aggro as the mob tries to push me aside to get at the caster.  This would be far more representative of a warrior leaping between his friends and his foe and shielding them from harm.  It would also encourage the casters to run back to the tank if they do get aggro.<br />
<br />
If more than one warrior has /shield on, then only the one closest to the person getting hit will activate.  There are other issues to consider, such as it shouldn't be possible to shield the MT.  Perhaps only let casters and priests receive shielding?<br />
<br />
Granted, for some raids this won't fix the problem.  There will be mobs that still require snap aggro for a variety of reasons.  Let the knights tank them.  I don't need to be the preferred tank class for all situations... just for most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this is a very solid idea, but its something that should be fixed, not boxed as an aa in the next expantion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i can personally tank well so i don't think we need any changes in the aggro department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gerrick,  I agree.  Given my choice, the current /shield would be scrapped and something like this implemented instead.<br />
<br />
The role of a knight is to grab instant aggro.  Ok, I'm fine with that.  I don't need to take instant aggro, but I DO need a way to deal with the reprecussions of not having aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've always viewed /shield as too weak but a step in the right direction.  The concept is sound: If someone is in distress take action.  /shield is too combersome and the reset times are too long.<br />
<br />
SOE in general has problems tuning reset times.  There is no reason why /shield as it is doesn't reset in 15 seconds after it fades.  This idea is good because one of the pesky problems tanking and protecting is the round robbin type targeting you must do.  There is a chance of error trying to hop targets so just shielding the entire group isn't a bad thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think you could have possibly made a more useless response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hell... I'd be happy if it was limited to just shielding one person at a time.  /shield cleric_01 would keep that cleric shielded until I switched to a different person.  Then I could choose to keep the cleric or the chanter or pick your poison shielded as default, and switch on the fly if need be.<br />
<br />
Would give non MT warriors on raids another reason to be there as well.  Each tank has an assigned cleric to protect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Perhaps we could have something called 'Interferance' instead of shielding, or preferably with shielding, where instead of us guarding a specific target against all mobs, we guard the targets a specific mob tries to hit., i.e. Reverse Shield. <br />
<br />
I see it as a situational skill, maybe something that could be slipped in into the melee balance part 2 as an alternative to using /shield, perhaps you could stick an endurance cost on it or something. I don't see it as replacing /shield though. <br />
<br />
That aside, I think Pody might have hit on a very good idea though</div></div><hr />

You group with some pretty useless Knight players then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Two procing weapons (with two procs each) + skill is more agro than any class can cast.  Granted its still somewhat random and not everyone is going to have it but denying it is silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Knights arent tanking &quot;well&quot; at all in GoD past sewers... especially not any boss type mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it's fair to say that we can hold our own in terms of sustained aggro.  Out aggro knights?  No.  But I don't have any problem with sustained aggro.  It's the snap aggro that we don't have because our aggro is so heavily based on random procs.<br />
<br />
An improve shielding ability does nothing more or less than allow us to mitigate the damage caused by not having aggro until we can build up enough to hold it solidly.  Let the knights keep snap aggro, just give me a way to deal with the lack of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">your system would be too open to abuse. With it the wizzy now can be the MA, we shield him and he opens up from the time the mob is in range till it is dead he does not worry about agro because the warrior is takeing it all for him. In effect it gives stun lock with no agro value.</div></div><hr />

Today with two procs a weapon and AoET and Incite we've moved to aggro kings.

We've been given the moon and the penjilum has reached it's zenith or close to it.  Thanks to warrior whines we will with in six months or less lose def disc to both knights.  God forbid if the new DT over in india actualy plays melees we could be seeing total MT balance across the board in all aspects between the three tanks.

Enjoy today my brothers for tomarrow we die as kings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry, Merc, it's not correct. Ran into a SK last night who couldn't keep from chain nuking, and that was enough to pull aggro any time a taunt failed. Procs + augs + AA's helps and certainly adds to our longterm aggro generation, but the clueless can still keep aggro from the MT.<br />
<br />
 Oh yeah, and if you REALLY think that Incite + GoD AA's have swung the pendulum all the way to the other side as far as group desireability.......man, I can't help you.</div></div><hr />

Trust me, they're still out there and the better our aggro gets the more they will try to push the envelope of safety and get pasted for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">WA5 increases procs by 50%<br />
Bloodfrenzy Auged with Anger3 will give: 4.65 EB procs/min and 3 Anger3 procs/min in mainhand with 305 DEX and WA5 for an average of 5055 proc hate per minute.<br />
<br />
Blade of Carnage auged with Anger3 will give: 1.5 EB ppm and 1.5 Anger3 ppm in offhand with 305 DEX and WA5 for an average of 1950 hate per minute.<br />
<br />
Incite used once a minute will give 1100 hate per minute. (Can be used more often than this)<br />
<br />
Total is 8105 hate average per minute.  That is roughly equal to a stun every 3.7 seconds in terms of hate. That is about as fast as a paladin can possibly cast stuns, assuming he has devoted a minimum of 3 spell slots to stuns.  A paladin can at best cast 3.41 stuns per second assuming no fizzles or interrupts and endless mana. That, of course, does not take into account the hate built up from melee. The difference between the hate produced by warrior and paladin melee may not be that substantial, but it is there.<br />
<br />
If a Knight is not holding aggro against a warrior is just cause he does not want it.<br />
<br />
Not even close to being true anymore.<br />
<br />
EDIT: actually, I was wrong. A paladin CANNOT cast stuns that fast because of the &quot;Spell recovery time not met&quot; bug. We can probably put out about one stun every 3.6 or so seconds at best assuming no lag, no interrupts, no fizzles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Problem with comparing melee aggro of Knights to Warriors is that Knights weapons invariably have better ratio (which is a horrible design) so Knights actually pump out more melee aggro than a comparable Warrior unless the Warrior has a Raex BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">At the moment Im using a BoW with Anger2 on it, have bought WA2 so far.<br />
<br />
When we are clearing trash with a knight tanking I never pull agro unless I get a successful taunt.  My agro is good, I have no complaints about it, but there are Paladins and SKs who out agro me with ease.<br />
<br />
Same deal in XP groups, was doing one of the sewer trials last night, the original group had a Pal and an SK in it, SK tanking everything was sweet, I repped the pally for the 2nd run and with me tanking I had to ask the chanter to stand next to me when slowing because he was pulling the mob off me, didnt happen for an SK tank.<br />
<br />
Im not complaining at all, my agro is great, I never have problems on raids, was never a big issue anyway, and I havent had a chanter pull agro without me being able to pull it back before he goes splat in a very long time, but at this stage knights still own me, especially when it comes to that inital oh so important &quot;snap agro&quot; at the beginning of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Phantron, your 2 handers have about the same ratio and you guys swing more often. Our 1 handers have better ratios, but you guys are swing an offhander as well. If you are going by just melee produced aggro, the warrior is going to win in most situations. You also don't have to interrupt your melee to proc or incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">VDD and BoW will also pump out far more hate from innate proc than hopebringer and GoC will ever do, and vdd's melee is right up there (parsed as a bit ahead) of GoC as well.</div></div><hr />

This is a load of crap.  We're not going to lose /def to knights.  Most of the player base won't see the type of weapons and augs that will allow them to seriously come close to knights for aggro.<br />
<br />
You have to realize that knights can BUY this level of aggro for a couple PP via spells in bazaar.  Warriors need godly weapon drops from mobs that require a full contingent of guildies in order to kill.<br />
<br />
So yes, if a warrior is extemely motivated and extremely lucky he can achieve a level of aggro close to knights.  Thank god we have a slightly better damage mitigation ability to offset this huge task/timesink.  when knights have to put in anywhere near the time and effort to gain their aggro as we do, then they can bitch about how their tanking skills are lagging behind.  Until then I see it as a more than fair trade off and don't expect any nerfage in the near future.<br />

I can be as motivated as I want, if I schedule a raid, and 6 people show at prime raiding time (plus 4 for 30 minutes), with 105 people in the guild, you can't raid. I will see the augs, because I get those myself. Its trying to get anyone to do anything else other than whatever the hell they do in EQ, everything EXCEPT raid or do LDoN, thats hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To those who think Knights can't hold agro...<br />
<br />
You point on Procs and Augs, but knights can also have those Procs and those Augs... no sense... perhaps, but Im tired of Monks and Rangers using aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
When in exp groups the long term aggro is not that important, cause fights arent as long, I think of long term aggro more like a Raid tool. In exp groups the cleric and chanter want insta aggro, and we only got one 30 sec recast Aggro on demand skill. If you are relaying on procs the chanter or cleric can be dead before you can get aggro back, and yeah we still got taunt, but did you ever get six failures in a row? Is not that rare.<br />
<br />
I don't say we suck holding aggro, but knights are better. They don't really need proc weps or augs... How much time a war needs to get the AP or the cash or raiding time to get Anger Augs or proc weps? a Knights just say &quot;Ding, going to get new spells...&quot;<br />
<br />
IMO they are better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Right Fabel, and I am NOT going to get the aggro proc weapons without raiding, and how do you get people to do that? The casters say &quot;I have max int/wis so why raid?&quot; the Knights say &quot;I can still snap aggro, so why raid?&quot;, and there you go, 90% of the population of EQ WON'T raid. <br />
I love the pulling 2 comment, I have had several Enchanters whine about 2 pulls. Way more than a couple! They won't charm, they won't mez, and the class is horrid DPS! These idiots, and some of the worst Clerics ever, still get groups, because they are needed in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Warrior aggro is fine.  I have no problems holding aggro in exp groups or tanking on raids.<br />
<br />
Knight aggro is fine.  Knights can get aggro-lock because they have VERY high aggro spells that take very little mana to chain cast.  Knights *should* be able to out aggro warriors.<br />
<br />
The only remaining class-balance problem I see is the gap between healing a warrior and healing a knight is not big enough.  All Defensive/Stonewall do is put the gap a little higher than it should be for 3 minutes.  I would prefer that SoE delete those two disc from the game and tune warrior innate mitigation +30%.  That's less than Defensive, but it would create a permenant healing gap between warriors and knights.  They get the aggro-lock and we get tanking.  That's balance.<br />
<br />
An example of the tuning I'm talking about is on LDoN hard Adventures, an EP group requires cleric healing for both knights and warriors.  Properly tuned, warriors should require druid-level healing while knights would still need clerics.  The tradeoff would be aggro-lock vs lower-healing.  Knights could still do their tanking jobs just fine, but warriors would be more appealing for groups that don't have clerics.</div></div><hr />

Procs per min and average procs total are both nice but totaly irevalent, its not the other 10 procs that matter is't the one or 2 at the start of the fight that do or more likely dont go off just prior to the cleric or chanter being eaten.</div></div><hr />
