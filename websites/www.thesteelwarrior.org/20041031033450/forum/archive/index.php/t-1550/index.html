<br />
This hasn't happened on my server, but it needs to be fixed before its used to block progression.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bertox and rz are much easier to block, although i hate plane of air.  In fact we still block emp to keep the second guild from vt lol.  Oh well gotta love pvp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I respectfully disagree, a mob that spawns on server up and NEVER EVER respawns is easier to block than a 3 day spawn.<br />
<br />
Pand killed rallos on the 18th of February and 4 and a half months later only have one elemental God down.  My Guild killed Rallos on the 8th of feb and is currently in POTime.  Their is a cost in blocking content from competitors, its called opprotunity cost.<br />
<br />
PVP is different, I realize this, and you have every right to which ever strat. you choose.  Their are down sides to some decisions.<br />

Word. Finally someone who understands opportunity cost. <br />
<br />
When a guild's advancement depends less on their own success and progress and more on simply keeping the other guy down, they'll never succeed on a serverwide basis. You might be the big dogs on your own server, but you're meaningless on a serverwide basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">serverwide doesnt mean anything, we own our server and do what we want.  Its not a holding hands sharing mobs server ^_^.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep saying that. The zeks are ghetto. There's a reason that the leading guilds are not on zek servers. Civil war is bad for nations and it's bad for servers when it comes to economic advancement and progress.<br />
<br />
Of course I suppose the joy of griefing outweighs advancement for some people. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It probably outweighs the joy of paying $40 a month and being a condescending, pseudo-intellectual, anal retentive dickhead on an internet message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The options are not mutually exclusive. Blue servers have their griefer guilds too. The point is that any guild that thinks success comes from keeping the other guy down is going to progress at a slower rate than guilds that measure themselves based on their progress on a serverwide basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">youre missing the point man - people who play red dont care about other servers - period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">in all actuality i feel what they do on the red servers is perfectly acceptable; protecting your own ass and keeping another team ( i doubt pandemonium is all evil or good or neut RPers ) from ganking them..<br />
<br />
hell, i'm wayy off topic here. i doubt bluebies care about what goes on with reds; but you really can't blast them for it when they have a lot more at stake than we do.</div></div><hr />
