<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quincent</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you guys augment this this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=54065) with a Anger 3 proc and make it an agro weapon? Or would y'all make it a non-MA weapon and stick a lifetap proc on it or something? I'm not in a very high end guild so, I'm a bit limited to weapon choices to a certain extent; and making the best choice in what i augment things with is important cuz I dont wanna have to take augment out and put something else in it's place, etc... waste points kinda.<br />
<br />
Curious cuz I'm gonna be getting this weap just to do the quest, and getting something better wouldnt work too well atm. My sceptre you see in magelo is my G/F's that she's letting me use til I get something of my own that works for me for a while. I also know a CHoS would be a better ratio, but I cant afford it atm.<br />
<br />
Anyways.. that's enough from me. thanks</div></div><hr />

If they end up making augments re-usable then yeah go for it because you can then just pop it out when you upgrade. I guess I'm just saying hold on and see what they do about re-using augments.</div></div><hr />

WTF?!!!<br />
<br />
It's like 3 delay slower! It's not gonna make that big of a difference.<br />
<br />
The major problem with that weapon is that lack of an agro proc on it already. You'd be better served by finding an agro weapon and angering that instead. 2 agro procs on one weapon is much better, as the agro from that weapon's dd is going to be pretty much non-existant.<br />
<br />
If you are lokking for some agro weapons, check the library for a list of known agro weapons to choose from, but to make a short story, try a Copper Hammer of Striking and/or Sword of the Bloodsworn from the Temple of Droga. They are great agro and are a fairly easy camp or can be found cheap on the bazaar. You can usually find a blackhand axe with an +hate proc for extremely cheap in the bazaar. See my magelo for the stats. I got mine for 50pp. When I say cheap I mean it :P<br />
<br />
Edit: here's the link to the library thread.<br />
