<br />
I hit level 60, oh, two days ago, and respecced to protection to go with the Skullflame Shield I got from my first scholomance run (http://thottbot.com/?i=11613).<br />
<br />
Over the length of a 5 man Scholo run last night I got three pieces of the Deathbone Guardian set (http://thottbot.com/?set=124), being the Gloves, the Belt and the boots. At the moment I have Hydralick armour for my chest piece (our guild doesn't have any 50+ healers, so raids into places like UBRS etc are kind hard to get).<br />
<br />
Considering I'm protection specced, would the Deathbone chestplate with the +25 Defence skill be better than the Hydralick armour, which has +20 sta and +10 fire resist?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm engi/miner at the moment, but I'm thinking to do my job properly I'd best go back to Blacksmithing (I was a 277 armoursmith) and whip myself up some Dark Iron gear.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">06-07-2005, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. for starters, armorsmith is probably the way to go for the pure tank path.. but you can pretty much forget about dark iron gear until you have a &quot;lot&quot; of time to just go and farm it.  Seriously takes some dedication of a good group to just go in and farm it,  and quite honestly if you're not raiding.. it's crap :/<br />
<br />
Go with the deathbone for pure tanking if you can get your hands on it... but if you can.. you can also do ornate adamantium out of live strat without much more difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Other than that I have nothing constructive to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Interviglium</div><div class="date">06-07-2005, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed on the text.<br />
<br />
Hmm the Deathbone armour can be gotten from raid groups though, I've only ever been to strat once, as a lvl 57 bystander after some good gear off the Baron.<br />
<br />
How hard is scarlet side strat? Cause I have the For love and family quest (to get the ornate adamantium BP)</div></div><hr />

They have sta, and Defense is pretty nonissue at that level, it only becomes a major issue when raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krelm</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, well I guess my strategy is in error. I'm level 55 and respec'd to pick up 10 points in prot (working toward 15). I thought gearing up on +def stuff would help me in tanking instances. Should I not be worried about that yet?<br />
<br />
I was even thinking about buying an Ardent Custodian (http://www.thotbott.com/?i=5818) to help the cause. A buddy told me there are better blues than this at my level. Any suggestions on a 1h for tanking at lvl 55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look for a serathil, or hold out for a timeworn mace from DM if you can.<br />
<br />
Basically, the defense is always useful, however I typically find it more useful in preventing back to back crits on core mobs (Which typically hit for 600+ in rapid succession along with other attacks.)  Crits from the smaller stuff is definetly there, and yeah, it's an annoyance, but it rarely puts you in a situation of &quot;flat out dead&quot; from it.  You can usually get stronger pieces of +avoidance than you can of defense, so at that level I would tend to go more with those.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krelm</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I certainly noticed a difference questing in my +def gear. I was fighting lvl 51-54 angerclaws in Felwood. At first I had all my str/agi stuff on which is usually good for taking mobs out quickly. I found I was getting pretty hurt and having a lot of downtime (and those darned bears don't drop any band-aid mats!).<br />
<br />
I switched to my new +def gear and my health bar stayed green most of the time. I popped a agi pot to make up the difference in crits and had a field day.<br />
<br />
There is a Serathil up in the AH on Uther now. Maybe I will see if they will trade for the Ardent.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice as always...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding how defense decreases the rate of critical strikes, each point of defense that a target has over the attacker, the attacker loses 0.04% chance to crit. So, for example, if a level 60 Rogue is attacking a level 60 Warrior who has 25 defense, the rogue's crit rate will be decreased by 1%.  <br />
Basically it does...<br />

- Decreases the chance of being affected by a &quot;crushing blow&quot;....<br />
...Players never deal &quot;crushing blows&quot;, only creatures.  <br />
<br />
The first part was a quote of the latest message by blizzard...so i guess it does.</div></div><hr />

Needless to say I died, from 60% health to 0 in one hit.  I am now looking for +def gear myself for tanking.</div></div><hr />
