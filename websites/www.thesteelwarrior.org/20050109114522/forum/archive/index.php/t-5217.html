<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NgokTZ</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put up with being a fat ogre for 4 years so that I could be the supposed best for tanking.  I don't think any non-ogre really knows the pain of being an ogre with out playing one for years.  So verant decides level the playing field and puts in Stalwart Endurance in PoP.  Now what little advantage Ogres had for putting up with their size was taken away and they were left with their fat ass and slam.  Before anyone says you have the best melee stats I just want to say that our dark elf rogues in my guild have 305STA easly.<br />
<br />
Now I play on a PvP server so Slam was suprior to Kick due to the higher skill cap but then I see these new AAs come out.<br />
<br />
Staggering Shot (increase stun level cap on kicks) <br />
Strong Kick (increased kick damage)<br />
<br />
So, now all I get by putting up with being a ogre all these years is having to shrink in each zone and hope their isn't PvP at the zone in.  How I long to be a Iksar now.  I would have made my warrior a Iksar but the supposed no plate stopped me along with others but  I look at my plate I see WAR/ALL.  Thanks Verant...</div></div><hr />

Stalwart Endurance != frontal stun immunity, I have it maxed and still get stunned quite a bit with maxed defensive AAs when tanking. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Heck why I play a Dark Elf War many would say OMG no STA so? =P oh just rambling =p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you've been playing a long time.  Ogres may not be superior in the end game, but they are superior along the way.  Everyone in your guild may have maxxed melee stats, but I'm sure they didn't at 20 or 50 or 55 or probably even 60...  So you got the benefits along the way.  And you still have frontal stun immunity and you don't need to spend your AA's on Stalwart Endurance or any of the Kick AA's.  So you can better spend your AA's in other areas, where as others may not get those particular AA's until they have 200 or more AA's.  Plus, illusion and shrink items abound, so it's not like you have to ask for a shrink, you just shrink yourself, takes a few secs at zone in and you're done.  I understand the PvP aspects of that, but in most cases on most servers it's not really an issue.</div></div><hr />

1- How many points it costs a warrior to get Stalwart Endurance.<br />

2- How many points it will cost a warrior get BOTH of those Gates of Discord AAs for their kicks.<br />

3- Consider what other AAs you could have purchased fot those prices in that time.</div></div><hr />

And I've been using kick anyway, side effect from being too much in dark elf form, cant slam when illusioned.<br />
<br />
But I can certainly see why it would suck being an ogre on a PVP server hehe. One biiig target, and its annoying to get stuck on people at zone-ins sometimes :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You picked the race soley on the distinction of being #1 four years ago, and now that things are somewhat more even a playing field you're horribly offended? I guess those years of perks along the way get forgotten. <br />
<br />
Since you asked, do you know how it was to play an &quot;average&quot; race warrior over the last 4 years? Do you know how it felt knowing if only had been an ogre i'd have the 200+ more hp the higher sta gave? Do you remember pre-rok how it felt having no way to interrupt casting, how it's been with a 50 point lower skill cap on our kick attacks compared to slam (bash) since rok? Do you know how it felt getting stuck behind your fat asses because you thought it was fun to block the zone lines during trains?<br />

after 4 years myself and finally getting a chance with AA expenses...(yes, chance) for avoiding a stun as compared to 100% IMMUNITY TO FRONTAL since the day yer mom plopped you out in Oggok...<br />

I'm perfectly fine with kick stunning and agree that it should stun to some degrees.  a Ogres slamming you should be different then a gnome kicking you, but role playing went out the window years ago.<br />
<br />
My problem is, people picked their races for what ever reason they had be it size, look or what ever.  I picked mine with certian trade offs.  Deal with size and EXP penalty to get no frontal stun and better stats for starting.  The stats by no means sold me, I didn't really care about them since they had a hard cap.  As for AAs, who really cares.  End game warriors have 400+ AAs and you can make 2 AAs in a hour.  So if I was another race and had to get Stalwart I wouldn't have innate PR maxed, big deal.<br />
<br />
As for picking race at the start Kallaen, you made your bed with your race knowing what each one offered.  I don't feel for you in the least.  Sounds like you knew the difference between ogres/trolls and other races.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is this, you start a character knowing you have disadvantages and advantages.  But later in the game they take away your advantages but leave ya with your disadvantages.  and yes, I do have a WE crown.  But when you are resricted by 15 buff slots you don't want to tie up one of them with an illusion when others have it innate.</div></div><hr />

Ogres have had an advantage from day one.  They *SOMEWHAT* level the playing field a bit and you cry.  You mentioned roleplaying which is pretty much invalid since SEO kicked that out long ago.  It neer made much sense to begin with.  WTH woud you give a fatass Ogre more stamina then an Elf?  Who do you think is gonna be able to run farter(read: have more stamina)?  The fatass?<br />

That's like me crying because they don't have an Ogre illusion crown or because I can't just innately turn myself into an Ogre with out the buff slot.  Please.</div></div><hr />

 Pretty much any end game raider will shrink on any raid anyways, dont see the big deal. You still have immunity to frontal stun, which maxed SE still doesnt give<br />

I can get fully raid buffed with about 8 buffs (kazad, 9, focus, sov, wog, cor, sop, sometimes GMR)  Other spots are for DS or heal over times, which till leaves you with a good 4 spots left.</div></div><hr />

Who ever said that your advantages would last at the point of the game you are at, which didn't even exist when you started.  Frankly, during all of your leveling up, you had quite a few benefits over others.  We have to be lvl 65 and a bunch of aa to get anywhere near your stun resistance.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think a kick would hurt more than hitting him with the side of your arm.<br />
<br />
Don't forget though, us dwarves got shafted also.  Our unique advantage was starting with 50 sense heading, now everyone else gets 200 on start!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But we gnomes have also some problems with the design. Like ogres get stuck in small parts . we get stuck in big parts. There are lots of places where a gnome and sometimes also the other smaller races can't do that what a normal size or a big size Race can. That was harder in the past when grow was a myst.<br />
<br />
I remember well the time when an AoN was going form shorty to shorty cause raid was moving back in Hot and you had to be normal size to do that. Or running in Kael having to look for the right places to jump up the stairs ... .  Several times I died of such things cause without of stamina and with a horde of mobs in the back its annoying not to be able to simple run to the exit cause there are some &quot;stairs&quot; the bigger ones will not notice but as a gnome they need to be jumped on.<br />
<br />
And in the endgame all advantages ( gnome high Int tinkering ) ... are eliminated except of the stun immunity of the ogres so they do not have the shaft. Theyre the only ones with a bit of advantage also in the end game.<br />
<br />
You know I started with 80 Sta back in 1999 and its a real big way from there to the around 360 sta I have today. That specially cause there is more warrior armor/weapons forbidden for gnomes /small races as there are forbidden for the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and later look at the high end game ...who does deserve to be better ... <br />
<br />
from this point of view i would clearly say Iksar ...so your Ogre where uba and have to stay uba simply doesnt fit ....in the end every Race is around equal theres iksar ac bonus of 40 and the ogre no stun from frontal who helps ( i let out the regen) but its not that great of a bonus. Considered that we had to pay for it in the past (xp penalty) and no more in AA s its all ok and balanced ... sure lvl 60 to 65 where a bit harder for us Iksars Ogres Trolls Barbars then for the non xp penalty classes but i hope there no lvl 65 to 100 where our xp penalty kicks in again ...unless they give us more type of boni for the aa xps we could make in that time but i guess there will be no higher then 65 for awhile.....im happy ...in AA theres no penalty at all.</div></div><hr />

Anyways - It always seemed silly to me that an itty bitty Gnome should be able to tank as well as a huge muscle bound Ogre.</div></div><hr />

Frontol mele stun immunity is the most usefull trait any race gets preiod and there is still no AA that gets that for anyone.<br />
<br />
I've been playing a troll since march 99 till last August and let me tell ya regen meant fuck all after you get 2k+ hp at lvl 60. Not to mention when shrink was shaman only indoor spell and the only shrinking you could ever get was if you had cobald bracer. XP penalty for troll warrirors I feel somewhat too much. But then again buying something like +10 regen through AAs would probably cost at least 10 points, not that that is remotley usefull when mobs hit 1k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They could remove the warrior class from the dwarven race and just on basis of the jump roll, dwarves would STILL be superior as commonfolk to half of the warriors today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really. Verant originally made all races to be nearly equal (Some races being a tad higher there, some being a tad lower there.) Most of these have been negated or removed (exp bonuses and penalities, for one) I wouldn't cry too much about SE being put in the game, you ever fight a flurry mob without SE that hits really fast? you're stunned half the time, which is really nothx.<br />
<br />
No, ogres didnt get the shaft. You can still get stunned with SE3, it's just rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put in the same four years and I cerainly didn't do it so some Ogre could say &quot;Hey, &lt;---- No frontal stun. I should MT everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ocassionally Verant/SoE did something sooooo unbalance that even they can finally figure out it was wrong.<br />
<br />
I hope yer enjoying being a fatty and having to be shrunk and still not cornering mobs well just as much as I enjoyed seeing Tiny Duhogre be the #1, 2, and 3 MT for years.<br />

<br />
You choose an ogre for reasons X Y Z.<br />
(Size Slam 100% Antistun etc etc etc)<br />
<br />
IF you picked ogre for 100% antistun.<br />
The choice was that 100%.<br />
It still is here today.<br />
Ogres do have 100% antistun.<br />
<br />
Even today these reasons are still here and valid.<br />
No where in the deal did you get shafted.<br />
<br />
I do agree some of your advantages are not unique anymore.<br />
But you got what you were promised &quot;Skills X Y Z&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some got a bit more (like myself) but it didnt come for free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Blind at night (like Erudites and Barbarians)<br />
2) Primary melee stats are average<br />
3) No innate racial abilities (like forage, hide, sense heading, etc.)<br />

About the only advantage I had was that I had an actual choice of where I started and had fewer faction problems than most other races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You also need to leave a slot for heal over time spells and whatever AE's or effects the boss mob might put on you (sometimes 2 or 3 slots go to this).  <br />
<br />
Even using Virtue I run out of buff slots on some fights.</div></div><hr />

I came here with this topic on my mind.  I played a ogre for 4 years, so I don't know how much I would have gotten stunned if I wasn't a ogre.  But I see the non-ogre races tanking just fine, not losing agro or messing up on potitioning that wasn't due to their dumb self.<br />
<br />
My simple problem here was this.  I as a ogre have 15% of the advantages over other classes I have before but with 100% of the disadvantages I had.<br />
<br />
Also regarding the buff thing,  on a PvP server debuffs and DoTs take up more spell slots then you think.  People dispelling your illusion and depending on what mob you are taking and what proc/AE they use.  15 buff slots are too low even before you add illusion in there.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I came here with a bad taste in my mouth about a topic.  I just wanted a different view on the same class, but some would rather be jerks.  Thanks for most of your comments...</div></div><hr />

Now *that* is a whopper if ever I saw one. <br />
<br />
Since release there has been : amulet of necropotence, wood elf crown, shrink, shrink potions, charged shrink items, shrink bracer, plane of knowledge, project illusion just off the top of my head...<br />
<br />
Just what disadvantages are you talking about there ?</div></div><hr />

Plane of Fear came later.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
But yeah, there were always options regarding size issues. And heck, back in the OLDEN days, ogre size wasn't all that big a deal in regards to corner tanking. It was more of an issue for getting around in tight, cramped dungeons.<br />

Most of these pusses wouldn't last 10 minutes on a PvP server. Warrior is a gimp PvP class, and no it is not acceptable that PvP is not balanced by these &quot;Programmers&quot; after dedicating servers to it. Lazy is what they are. Yes I PvP, yes I play a BARD.<br />

It's comments like that that got you the replies you got.  You still seem to think that other races should be inferior to you, which is bullshit.  EVERY warrior race should be able to tank just fine.  Just because you for some reason think ogres should be better, doesn't mean that you were shafted when we're equal.<br />

Doomflayer - PVP in EQ is simply an afterthought.  It's not balanced, and it will never be balanced.  While there are many good people on the PVP servers now a days, it's also where those 12 year old fucktards that don't have the maturity to deal with people on a non pvp server go.  Being able to succeed in a system that no one but yourself cares about doesn't make you special.</div></div><hr />

When Ogres have zero advantage or at a disadvantage I would agree with you. But I still feel they have a good payoff for their exp penalty. Not to mention they do not even have to train SE at all if they do not wish and will only miss out on being stunned from other sides.<br />
<br />
And whoever said trolls and iksar exp penalties are a little too crazy, I agree. It should be about the same as the Ogre penalty imo.</div></div><hr />

Frontal stun immunity is such an outrageous unfair advantage for a MT.  I've seen my guild wipe because I did not have it.  Plane of water, Ofossa stuns me right off the bat, pushes me out of melee range, I can't swim back to him for a couple seconds, he eats a cleric.  Even with maxed SE, I was getting stunned 2-3 times a minute.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the slight aggro hit for just about any uber mob due to missed rounds from stuns, and fuck ups in positioning they can cause.  If anything,  Sony should be putting in an AA to allow every race warrior to be stun immune from the front.</div></div><hr />

In the original game it was a pain in Sol B and L Guk (some Ogres actually blocked the Sol B exit on many a train).  But since the advent of the cobalt bracer (KUNARK) &amp; outdoor shrinks (right after Velious?) I'm hard pressed to think of a place where I've seen Ogres have trouble.<br />

You can't solo the spawn, and the price is still 30k on Tunare, so casters WILL make you roll against them for it!</div></div><hr />

A tank class is supposed to take damage instead of the casters, but normally in PvP this doesn't work since you can't use Taunt skills and abilities to make people attack you (though you CAN talk smack and literally taunt them).  One of the ways a tank class can get around this is to simply get in the way of enemy melees by blocking doors or hallways for instance.  A smart, well disciplined dungeon PvP force would have all their Warriors/Paladins/SKs in the front, impeding movement past them, and the casters behind, /assisting the tanks and casting through them.  The bigger the toon, the better they can do this.</div></div><hr />
