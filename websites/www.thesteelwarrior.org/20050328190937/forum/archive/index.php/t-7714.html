<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, it's worse than DBoW, better than anything else.  A solid #2 choice if you don't have a DBoW, and it's really hard to beat the stats on it.<br />
<br />
Being able to stun level 65 mobs is pretty cool too.  Now granted it won't stun anything that's actually challenging to you at that point, but then no one else can either (besides Time Rend).</div></div><hr />

<br />
His comment was &quot;much better agro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whopping</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have DBoW/A3 and Fleshbiter (without A3 aug). EoE/A3 as offhand weapon.<br />
Sometimes when im with Fleshbiter, it pulls aggro from warriors with DBoW/A3 (same offhander as mine).<br />
So yes, I can prove that its really nice aggro. Id say its #2 after DBoW.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
In exp groups im useing Fleshbiter over DBoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tipoytm</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, I would really bid on this if I couldnt wait for a DBoTW.   Reading the post by Whopping (assuming he is speaking the truth, heh) about the agro factor, that would be great.   MAIN PROBLEM still remains.. the fucking weapons looks like a piece of shit.  If only they can give it  the DBoTW or Chaotic Black Scimitar or SoPP graphic, I'd be happy to pick this up over DBoTW.   Can we petition this or something to SoE? Im sick of that stupid elf-shoe graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People worry way too much on graphics.  If you don't want a Fleshbiter, don't get one.  No one's forcing you to use a Ranger weapon look-alike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron is a ranger =(</div></div><hr />

just made a hot Button with Text... i am not a Ranger so i cant Sow you )  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talked to a guy on my server that seems to be very happy with his.  No Darkblade here, so I'd prolly loot one given the chance... even though I am a Wood Elf... and it looks like an Elf Boot... and I'm gonna get called a Ranger even more if I do loot it... /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well got a second one :<br />
<br />
BF+A3 vs Fleshbiter+A3 = Better agro on Fleshbiter<br />
EoE+A3 vs Fleshbiter+A3 = Better agro on Fleshbiter<br />
<br />
Thats what our warriors are reporting, and they are really happy with the weapon<br />
(well exept for the elf shoe part). Its a very viable alternative to the DBlade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's better than my BoW+A3.<br />
<br />
It looks dumb, and I whine about it, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one. It's better aggro than anything else but DBotW. Now I have augged it with anger3 it totally rocks. If aggro is ur main concern u will love this weapon. Oh btw I'm woodelf so I will live with this elf shoe graphic so called. Graphic looks cool on elf anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no<br />
Warrior weapons with a proc mod (http://www.tw-emarr.com/effect_tool/procer.php?eq_class_id=1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goobayouface</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have trouble seeing how it could be better agro than bloodfrenzy ;0<br />
but i'll likely never get this so i'd take your word for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">twice the DPS with 1 less proc a minute. despite the *1* less proc, your always doing DPS wether you're proccing or not. FB ratio totally shatters BF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perfer to save for a darkblade myself, but the RNG fucks most guilds out on darkblades on our server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well  ..<br />
BF should proc 2x 1+(0.55+0.5) = 4.1 PPM = 2400 Hate<br />
Fleshbiter proc 2x 1+(0.5) = 3 PPM = 1200 Hate<br />
<br />
So the Agro based on procs is rather important.<br />
Seems hovewer the ratio more than makes up for that.<br />
<br />
4 Months without a Darkblade, 2 on 27/28 now !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goobayouface</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">more procs per minute is also less time between engage and first proc<br />
in my experience that's the biggest deal anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ratio is more important for initial aggro than procs.  You can always fail to proc, even with WA5 weapons and 2 EB weapons, but you'll never fail to swing your weapon.<br />
<br />
Even Great Maul of the Mighty (59/31 125dd proc) holds aggro pretty initially due to its hefty ratio.  I had no problem holding aggro over a DBoW for 30 second type yard trash clearing with Great Maul of Mighty which has a significant ratio aggro bonus over just about anything you can dual wield right now.  Sure DBoW will catch up when it gets in a proc or two in, but then the mob's usually dead by then.  You should see a high end monk holding aggro.  They are very good at initial aggro and they certainly have no +aggro proc to speak of.<br />
<br />
Most of your aggro comes from ratio, not procs, and if you want snap aggro, Chaos Cry and ratio is where it's at, not procs.  If I'm going to guess, I'd say 75% of your long term aggro comes from ratio alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tipoytm</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine if we all petition that Fleshbiter can be equipped on secondary... OMGz  DBoTW + Fleshbiter $$.... or to make it even better.. just make it secondary ONLY so the weapon wouldn't be that HIGLY overpowered.  That way, it would be a more unique weapon to balance out the ugly look.  Why can ranger's have Darkglint Blade primary/secondary usable?  SoE is so unfair and class-biased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Midasa</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guildie has a Fleshbiter and when he got it, even before auging, he was pulling agro off those of us wielding DB+JOS (both aug'd).  He is very happy with it, except of course managing agro when not MT'ing is a pain.  I even switch my JOS for EOE at times and find that the speed and proc rate of EOE &gt; JOS sometimes for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fleshbiter is the shit...Seen it 1st hand many times the amout of agro on that thing is godly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fleshbiter wont ever become offhandable, it would produce too much DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demerix (32/26) does more damage than Fleshbiter (34+1/30) in the offhand.  But if you can put Fleshbiter in the offhand it's like having a shield and still being able to dual wield since Fleshbiter comes with 50 AC.  Yeah it won't win you any Magelo contests but I'll take 50 AC and being able to attack in offhand and a ton of aggro over any shield currently available (or any offhand weapon currently available for that matter).  That's why it won't be offhandable.</div></div><hr />
