Velketor, The Va'dyn, Doomshade, Vhe'kiz the Shade, BoT Towers (best bang for your buck and up every 8 hours if i remember right)  That should be enough to get you started.</div></div><hr />

My guild is in a similar situation and we did IV with 14 a couple times.  All you need is solid tactics and some patience (I was MA the last time and went defensive twice on that fight  :D ... but nobody died so it was all good.)  By the way, we wiped with 18-24 a couple times before we got our tactics down and us tanks got our defensive aa's.  Oh yeah, and you need RGC for IV...that blind is a pain in the arse.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
ps - have done xana with 18 people before so it can be done (most in ornate or less equipment)<br />

edited to add ps</div></div><hr />

MY guild killed Nathyn our first attempt. Was a hour and 15 min long tho. We had the MA and SA die twice but managed to recover and win the encounter. Drops a +100 cha robe that  is awesome for Enc and Nec.  We had approx 20 people with a ave lvl of 58. My 2cp.<br />

The staff in your hands should tell you that.  Ornate BP's for people, awesome hybrid shoulders, FTII helm for wis casters, GBoS is great aggro weapon, very nice rogue piercers, etc.<br />
