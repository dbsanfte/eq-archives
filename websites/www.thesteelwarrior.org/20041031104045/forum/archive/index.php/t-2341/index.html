<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did one of the tower bosses yesterday and he dropped a Furious bash shield.<br />
I passed on it since I usually wield my Gaudralek.<br />
1handers are copper hammer,willsapper,primal.<br />
Now that the hipe about FB shields is over,what do you think about it now,do you still use them?<br />
Just wondering if I made a mistake by not trying to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Bor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just got one of these last night.  Ive read many conflicting arguements on the boards here.  Anyone have anything good to say?  I also was wondering crayno.  I have the Sword of the blood and the copper hammer--will this work with the copper hammer? over the sword?--Dont mean to rob yer post but im curious also...Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After reading all the threads about this previously, it seems to me that the consensus is:<br />
<br />
Just putting the shield in your offhand is not enough aggro to offset losing the offhand weapon.<br />
<br />
BUT....<br />
<br />
Swapping between the shield and your offhand weapon (i.e. &quot;the Ruatha Swap&quot; or &quot;Ghetto Bashing&quot;) is a decent improvement in aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
For any not familiar with it:<br />
The basic idea of the Ruatha Swap is to equip your shield when bash becomes available, do the bash, and then quickly put your offhand weapon back in and swing it until bash is available again... and repeat over and over.  This isn't as hard as it sounds, especially with some of the UI mods available.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree Tuscan...I still mess around with my FB4 shield but it really can't hold agro worth a darn if you leave it equipped.  It is a big ++ if you do shield swap though.  I don't remember any &quot;hype&quot; though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I mainly just use my stormrider carapace when im offtanking or rampage tanking on raids. It's a nice little ac/hp boost and works alright in those situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I find my FB shield as an important part of my setup quite often.  Although I don't use it a majority of the time, I can't remember the last time I did not swap it in at some point during a PoP or even VT boss that has a spiky output.  For example with MithMarr or Bertoxx I often use 2 EB weapons first 45 seconds or so and then swap in the FB shield to finish the fight.  <br />
<br />
I have never been a big fan of shields and reluctantly picked up one of the FB shields off Rydda'Dar instead of watching it rot for the 5th time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My bash isn't maxed yet, but it's high. . .my personal opinion is that the shield is useful as a rampage tank, or if you're offtanking something for an extended period of time (emperor fight perhaps).  The shield isn't a huge bonus in either situation, but it is a bonus.<br />
<br />
I was quite disappointed with the shield really.  I use an obsidian greatblade (2h with taunting blow from mobs in sol ro tower) and really it works great.  Clearly a BoW is much better hehe, but my sword seems to proc more often and serves me just fine in an exp group or MTing on a guild raid.  The shield + BoC or SoD or CHSP isn't even in the same ball park for aggro.  2h &gt; all.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">#2 Tank in our guild uses a Stormrider Carapace and CHSD. I gank aggro from him a lot with my Greatstaff of the Four Winds, to the point that if he's tanking something I don't engage for half the fight, I just hold back and watch for adds.</div></div><hr />
