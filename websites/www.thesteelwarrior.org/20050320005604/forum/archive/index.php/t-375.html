<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonnas Povar</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i was just wondering what my guild would be ready for.  Last friday, we were in HoT and decided to try Dozekar.  We only had about 20 folks with us, And were owning him till a frikkin racnar got our healers and we whiped.  Without the add, we would have made quick work of him (we had had 0 deaths up to the point of the add) With this in mind, what do yall think we'd be ready for?  We have a 65 warrior with some OK equip (primals, silver whip of rage, SS/kael/other random armor) that floats a little under 7k hps buffed IIRC. Thanks for the input :D</div></div><hr />

Id venture to guess that you could play around with the ST key droppers (Sont, Kland, Zland, probably Lendi and Yeli). Give Tormax a run, Rumblecrush, Doomshade, Vindi, Telk and Gozz in Wtov. If you can do Tormax really well, keep an eye out for Eashen and Ikiatar.<br />
<br />
Hard to give good suggestions without more info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angry_Tank01</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The next step up would probably be Rumblecrush, he's similar to Vindy, but slowable, which makes him gimp beyond belief.<br />
<br />
Eashen and Ikiatar are basically Vindicator clones; <br />
Farm Vindy for his BP, and when you've mastered him you can take most of NToV.  Statue of Rallos Zek is probably easier than Vindy, equal difficulty at best.  <br />
<br />
Tormax is similar to Vindy, just a bit tougher, you'll probably not find him up much, but GL to you )<br />
<br />
Primals are great, but the other ST loot is fairly average.  If you think you can skip ST, then do it imho.<br />
<br />
Ssra is where the loots are, you can probably kill Rhag1 and perhaps Rhag2 atm for the all important GRC spells, and a few nice pieces of loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah man, take a shot at Vindi....there's your stepping stone on up to the next level critters.<br />
We were about halfway through getting Dozekar The Dirtnap items for us when we took a run at Vindi. From there on through you'll see where you need to work on &quot;working as a team&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's good you got your Tank all nicely equipped; but how do the rest of ya's fare? You're gonna first and foremost need your clerics with a good size manapool; same for your shammys and druids...having your casters set up with the proper spells/etc. there's so much more to a boss fight at that level than having a beefcake MT.<br />
<br />
Talk to your officers along with the guildleader and start crunching numbers on your guildmates and see how you all are equipped..go from there and no matter win or lose; keep trying the encounter even if you fail a few times. You'll get it and feel great about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would really work on getting 15-20 more ppl in your guild. gives you more options and have a better chance of having 30 ppl on any given day to kill whatever. outside of pop, the best items to be had are inside ssra like one poster mentioned, you will want 35-40 ppl for most the harder named in there.<br />
<br />
at 20 ppl, you will be sqeaking by on some of the things ppl are suggesting here.<br />
<br />
most ppl killing tormax or vindicator with 20 have at least 3-4 clerics and are using dire charm/cod for uber giant dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go vindi and Xanomech in PoI, both have good upgrades, and you sound like you should beable to do well with them.<br />
<br />
Make sure you get as many people well equiped as you can.  Its great if you have uba MA, but what happens when they go down?  Need to have good 2,3 and 4th tanks.  Then you need the healers.  Don't forget the DPS too, both melee and casting.<br />
<br />
Crunch the numbers, see how much DPS your guild can put out, and then go find stuff to kill.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya =)  Just remember though, you'll have to beat your head on the wall a few times to get things right before you start winning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonnas Povar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, to elaborate a bit... Our guildmistress is 65 cleric, has some very nice equip as our resident uberguild uses her for some encounters.  We have 5 or so other clerics who are on regularly, as well as a couple druids with heal AAs. Got plenty of shammys.  We have some ok DPS, couple 64ish rangers, 65 rogues, some monks, pallies, etc.  Our main problem is really tankage when the MT goes down and chanters.  Our next tank is 63 with some ok stuff so can do it, but for chanters... we have about 2-3 :(  I'm going to try to get the doomshade raids setup, will be researching him a bunch. thanks for the input :D</div></div><hr />
