<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think its nearly as clear a differance--though I agree with the + defense. I would actaully look at the +stm as a loss to the +18 block. Only 4 blocks per fight will save you 72 HP--more than the HP from + stm and there aren't an complete heals in WoW. (I suspect the crit avoidance ends up being even more important on boss tanking.)</div></div><hr />

Blocking for 51 means very little when a mob is hitting you for between 300 and 800.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xvenator</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For tanking Sta, AC and +Defense are your 3 primary stats. Draconian Deflector is barely better in AC but clearing better in Sta and +Defense, so it is the better sheild.  +Defense is a fairly important stat for end game tanking because it reduces the crit against you(while also increasing your Dodge%, Parry%, and Block%).  Damage spikes are what usally kill tanks, so keeping the crit rate against you low is important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would use the deflector for anything large, and the barrier shield for softer hitting instance trash.  Block dosen't mean &quot;lots&quot; but I'm willing the bet you get more overall damage reduction vs gimps from it than the deflector.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">+7 stamina and +15 defence vs a buff to our worst mitigation ability is an easy chioce. True that shield blocks do help, but not nearly as much as dodge or parry. More stamina gives your healer a greater margin of error, and that is what will keep you alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Barrier shield seems like it is geared more towards protection paladins.  +2% to block actually adds damage over time for them, since with holy shield, they deal 130 some damage with every block, more with a shield spike.  That and stamana is not as important since they have 4 lives in pvp and won't be the main tank anyways.</div></div><hr />

What is this Holy shield you speak of? Is it an enchantment? If so, does it stack with a Shield Spike?</div></div><hr />

Holy Shield, only problem is protection Paladins only get about 35% chance to block base, 65% after a critical strike.  So that 2% I am sure would be welcome, because its not just mitigation, but also return damage.  Imagine getting a big critical strike on a protection paladin, only to have 80-90 points of it mitigated with this shield and about 150 (130 holy from Holy Shield) damage returned against you, and another free attack that your critcal gave the paladin for probably another 200 damage.  So you may have done 8oo damage base, but take about 350 with 80 mitigated for a net result of 370 damage advantage.  You can see why 2% could be important to get that return damage more often.  Its like impaling yourself on them.</div></div><hr />

So, is this shield only for Paladins?</div></div><hr />
