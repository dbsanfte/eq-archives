<br />
I am TRYING to be the best tank possible but it seems that I need some help.  My warrior is my first and only toon currently and I want to be better.  I have heard the horror stories about choosing the Froglok race but that is what I chose.  I like the way they look mostly and didnt know much about the stats at the time.  I can't delete him and start over though because I am depended upon for the MT role most of the time.  Please help me.  I am looking to see where I should currently be and what I can get for little or no money at all.  Here are the stats I know of right off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
Currently level 42<br />
Unbuffed - 1771 HP, 750 AC, 930 ATK, 153 STR, 120 STA, 112 AGI, 140 DEX, 46 CHA, 75 WIS and INT.  I am using a Centi Shortsword and a Defenders Lightblade with DW and Double at over 200.  1hs is my highest skill, over 200,  as I made the mistake of not leveling all skills equally.  I AM working on that though.  All other weapon skills, other than archery, are below 100 still.  My gear is mostly crafted armor and a few other items.  Nothing special at all though.  Do not have much money at all either.  <br />
<br />
Can anybody give me some help please?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, there is nothing wrong with Froglok tanks. We are a bit Charisma challenged, but that can be over come somewhat with Augs. There are some very good targeted quest, my personal favorite being the series of quests from Sugal the Fist which force you to raise all your combat stats.We have a slight Stamina advantage over the average, and we are very dextrous. My Froggy is a 62 warrior with  5.5k unbuffed and all combat stats and skills maxxed (except Agility, but i'm working on it) I've got almost 50 Defensive AA's and am called on to tank even over higher level plate classes. One of the biggest keys is keeping it simple. Don't switch targets and stay focused. If you're MT for a group set up the necessary Hotkeys (assist call, shield healer/slower, taunt, incite line) and do the job. If you're being groomedfor raiding then learn from thte Older tanks what to do in certain raids. There are different tactics for different raids, no matter what other classes think, we do more than just hit auto attack and go out for a latte.  <br />
<br />
The best way to improve your equipment at your level is probably LDoN's, it will also help with your money situation.  The Death Embracer armor is pretty good and holds multiple augs, it also has good resale value when you are ready to upgrade.<br />
<br />
You  need weapons to level up all your skills. The most compelling reason for this is you never know what you are going to come across. Yes the vast majority of Warriors equip 2 1 handed weapons, but what if you get a great deal on a 2HS? You want to be able to make use of it. Try to have situational weapon combos, learn which mobs riposte for a lot of  damage, when you tank those, use a 2HS or 2HB. <br />

I've had a blast playing a Froglok (I RP Gukta as a Holy Communist State, it's all sorts of fun). As a Guktan warrior you have a size adavantage in cornering similar to a Gnome's and you have both high swimming and innate lung capacity.... which honestly don't help much... but we are by far the cutest animations in the game...</div></div><hr />

I think they look cool and it seems to be a less popular race for the job.  I like that because it seems to be a challenge at times.  I have had a great time with this character and they sure have some nice animations.  Thanks for your post.<br />

Please keep them coming.  All opinions are appreciated.</div></div><hr />
