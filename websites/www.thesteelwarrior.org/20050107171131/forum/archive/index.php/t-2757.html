<br />
I'm looking for info on the ToD camp.  I see that the armsmen drops it in Seb and I know where he is from the EQAtlas.  I've been back that way once, so I know how to get there.<br />
<br />
Question is, I'm 61 war and two box with a 53 cleric.  Can I do this just two boxxed?  Can cleric Paci the mobs on the way for single pulls?  And is the ToD a really rare drop?  I've only seen it once in the baz on Xegony and it was like 50k and I so can't afford that.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cleric will be able to pacify every mob on the way.<br />
<br />
The drop itself is pretty rare, I've seen a few drop but I camped chef area hard back in the day.</div></div><hr />

Because you wont be clearing a lot of mobs with just a war and cleric, you will end up with multis when mobs run and with heal agro, your cleric at 53 will bite the dust quick.  <br />
<br />
Personally i would not recommend going down there with just two unless your cleric is an inny worshipper.  Even then, dont fight too far away from mobs spawn point.  One gater can mean a long CR process.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I acquired my ToD doing exactly what you are asking about:<br />
<br />
61 war, 52 cleric (at the time)<br />
<br />
I do not have snare weapons.<br />
My cleric is a worshipper of Inny, and a dark elf, so I do have the &quot;snare necklace&quot; (which is not worth relying on, even if it is better than nothing - clinging darkness just doesn't have a lot of duration or snare-effect).<br />
<br />
Pacify worked fine, dispelling the casters and shamen helped a LOT (gotta get rid of SoW - it'll be on every shaman and every mob near a shaman).<br />
<br />
Usually I'd have the cleric do a long duration stun @20% or so, followed by a nuke, and then bashing near the end of the stun duration. That usually stopped the mobs, for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My cleric has the snare neck, but it is such a week snare it won't stop high-level runners (does slow them down, and they stop at 10% or so.  I like root better personally, then hit em with the snare neck while they're rooted and hope that lasts long enough to get them stopped.  I have never quite had the nerve to go to Seb with my warrior/cleric because of the runners and the fact that Seb is usually empty and I have no way to do CR down there if I get killed.  Hate to beg guildmates to run all the way to Seb to CR my sorry ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutul try it, you will be shocked how easy it is. With Run3 chances of you dying are remote anyway<br />
<br />
I've done it with cleric before no probs, although i admit its much easier with a druid :) With druid (level 63, FT3)I can keep chef ph dead, armsman room, froggy ph + adds, the dining room and bartender ph + assorted wanderers clear in the time it takes respawn to happen. With cleric(Level 58, FT1) have to take it slightly easier but can still keep chef/armsman or bartender/armsman clear with little trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50K??? o_O<br />
<br />
They're worth no more than 10. Mabey less. Hell, mine was what, 6k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not camp related, but if your really looking for this also try auctioning for it.  I hadnt seen any in bazaar for a long time and auctioned for it.  I ended up with a tell from a guy who had it on his warrior twink that he wasnt really playing and sold it to me for 5k that i wouldnt of gotten just checking bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radalas</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadow, I do play my cleric well and do root/stun/anul.  but what Im saying is that there is a chance you will wipe.  one shaman runner that doesnt get annulled propery that breaks root WILL sooner or later ruin your day.<br />
<br />
If you didnt die, then great.  Im saying I would personally would not take the chance for camping ToD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proc effect is 50% slow.  Nice to keep in bag for emergencies, IMO.<br />
<br />
Saw someone selling in bazaar on Veeshan for 2k...these always pop up when I'm broke.</div></div><hr />

I 2 box seb quite often.  Keep your wits about you and you'll just fine with a cleric bot.  (In fact, when in seb, I make the cleric pull. =p )</div></div><hr />
