<br />
upgrade to anger3<br />
upgrade your incite<br />
<br />
<br />
Consider raiding AoW for BoC and XTC for hategiver, both mobs are now very valid targets even for casual raiding guilds with lower turnout than raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use your two 1 handers and work for anger 3 augs... currently you could sell your anger 2 and buy 2x Ykesha for more aggro at similar price... Still debateably whether A3 &gt; Yak blah blah, but no doubt Yak &gt; anger 2. <br />
<br />
Your guild looks to be elemental level, so a BoW would be possible if you guys do any backflagging or farming on RZ... Otherwise your weapon combo seems to be decent enough that I think you'd be able to hold aggro in most situations. I held aggro pretty well with GBoS and CHSD both yak augg'd against Time geared rogues/rangers. Try to get Bazu Bellow from 69 rune, that's always nice for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id concur and say use the 2 1 handers. with aggro augs they should serve just fine till you can score a better upgrade.<br />
<br />
and although this has been said before, ill say it again, its not your sole responsibility to hold aggro on raids. when i moved to my current guild who at that time were elementals/early time, all i had was a GSoT. id get rostered to tank the mini crap and stuff like that and never had real problems with aggro. so tell your overeager DOT casters and debuffers to just cool it a little if you find too much ping pong early in fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your 2handers are good for dps, but as stuns and hate procs are better aggro than DD and DoTs, I'd recommend grabbing a 2h with one of the former types.<br />
<br />
Cheap route: GSoT - absolutely no better bang for the buck. Should be under 500pp easy .<br />
<br />
Common upgrade from GSoT: Greatstaff of the 4 Winds, in Wind Tower, BoT. Appears to proc more than GSoT, and although DD proc, works hella good on aggro. Tried, tested, and true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Gauldarek actually has a shit load more aggro then it's straight DD suggests.. maybe because its unresistable, or the KB or whatever.. It used to be rated in the top 10 aggro 2handers, and for a good reason.  + it has 50ac. + the look of it &gt;&gt;&gt; a lot :P (and esp that shitty GSoT )</div></div><hr />
