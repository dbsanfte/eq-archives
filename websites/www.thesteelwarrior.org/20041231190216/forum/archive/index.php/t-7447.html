<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raggok</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I am new to EQ and am considering making a troll warrior. I was wondering if anyone could tell me where to allocate my points when making this character. Should I put any into INT / WIS or should I just put them into STR and AGI? I could really use a template for the first 10 levels if possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Raggok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't put any into int or wis.  STR STA AGI DEX and CHA are the stats that matter on a warrior.  STA is the most useful, but also one of the easiest to max.  CHA is the hardest to max, but only matters on high level raids, so it's a good choice if you're planning on going to the high end, but useless otherwise.  AGI and DEX do next to nothing.  If it was me I would go CHA if you're planning on leveling to 65 asap and raiding, STA if you're not.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you're coming from Diablo II or some similar game?  Really starting stats in EQ aren't all that important.  With a troll it's impossible to make a bad warrior (any race really, but trolls have really solid stats no matter what you do) so don't worry about it.  You could put all your points in INT (which does nothing for a warrior) and still wind up with a great warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, AGI will probably be one of the harder stats for you to max, so as many into AGI as possible and the rest to STA. if i recall, trolls have fairly high STA anyway, so it won't hurt you much for the point you're at.<br />

and hi nia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, but the only reason to have agi is so your stats look nice.  15 points in agi will get you maybe 3AC at level 65.  Useless.  At least STA will be useful until it's maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get all your melee stats over 75 to start: str, dex, agi and sta. You take a penalty if they are below that. Otherwise, see what Brutul said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you plan to RAID ? Max your Charisma<br />
<br />
Dont ask why, just do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If its just to play a warrior :<br />
<br />
Get your Agi up to 75, after that ... <br />
Well most other stats are semi useless, with stamina beeing the less useless one (more hp).<br />
But dex is nice too (procs). STR is useless, so is Agi over 75</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raggok</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your help everyone. I have split my initial 25 points into CHA and STA. I did not put any into AGI. I didn't wait to see all these responses before I made my char. I hope I haven't gimped him. I am lvl 10 already and would hate to have to start over. Thanks again for all your responses.<br />

<br />
These boards are full of proofs and reassurances that gear and AA's will overcome any racial shortcomings your character may have. If you don't believe me, compare my magelo with Mvreena's (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=648516&amp;resize=true). We're both half-elves. I'm 63rd level at the moment; she's 65th. You want to be her when you grow up! <br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />

Like I said before, it's impossible to &quot;gimp&quot; a character in EQ, and putting points in STA and CHA is as good a choice as any.  You should be good to go, and the fact that you found this board so early on means your future as a great and powerful warrior looks promising.  Good luck and keep reading this board and posting questions when you have them.</div></div><hr />

  And, uh, listen to the responses. We know what we're talking about, surprisingly enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Occasionally at least.<br />
<br />
Anyone rememeber what trollish agi starts at? As I recall ogres are the only class that start below 75...<br />
<br />
Oh, find www.magelo.com . It can be surprisingly handly to have an off line copy of your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just dumped all points into strength back in '99 :) and it worked out just fine for me. It doesnt really matter where you put your stats but since you are asking this question I'd recomend dumping them into stregth since in the beging it does help to not be encumbered until you have some weight reducing bags and lighter armor.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt dump them into wis/int/cha/dex</div></div><hr />
