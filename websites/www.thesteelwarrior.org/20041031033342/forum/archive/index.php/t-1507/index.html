<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
After a gruelling quest I finally completed the warrior epic last weekend thanks to lots of help and patience from friends. :)  <br />
<br />
After the ooh-ing and aah-ing over how cool it looks (which it still does :p ), obviousely I was wondering how it fared in combat. So far the best I can say is I have mixed feelings about it. Rage of Vallon obviousely should be the prime attraction, but I wasn't expecting it to solve all aggro problems overnight. <br />
<br />
If it lands it certainly seems to turn the mobs head at you, more so than any other 1 hander I've had, but here is the problem. It doesn't seem to proc much and doesn't seem to annoy mobs much if resisted. (Even with dex buffed up to 260, I have yet to see a significant increase in proccage). Even when it does proc, I have noticed aggro is fairly can be lost to another melee who will most likely be doing more dmg than you are. At 61 I seem to hit for about 95 in mainhand max, with full buffs on. Offhand seems to be around 55-60. With a good string of procs the dps doesn't seem to matter much, but procs are just so  unreliable. <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell I was able to hold aggro more consistently with the Greastaff of Thunder I used before i finished the epic. The reason I see for this is that next to the high aggro proc on that it is also churning out a real good amount of DPS very quickly.(max hit for about 190) The problem with most 2 handers seems to be that it will aggro if you get a string of good hits, but is lost quickly with a few misses. The staff is fast enough for that not to matter. I was going to sell it to buy a CoF, but not so sure now<br />
<br />
Sooo, despite the nice worn effect on the blade of tactics, I figure it may be a good idea to replace it at some point. Stuff like the Shortblade of Lightning or Fleshgrinder seems to be good for damage, but I kind of doubt it would match the staff for dps with red epic in offhand. My guild is not yet capable of killing the PoI dragon or killing in NToV so I 'll need to either buy something or  get a nodrop 1hander that is not too hard to get. The Willsapper came to mind, but Vaniki is heavily camped obviousely. Basically I'm wondering what other warriors at this point have used in combination with their red epic that turned out to be a good combo.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, that final combine in Freeport was one of the best feelings I have had in EQ, and the epic is a source of pride to anyone who gets it (which after all is what the game is about; achieving something together), but three expansions later it is clear it is a weapon from a different era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;but three expansions later it is clear it is a weapon from a different era.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is two-fold.<br />
<br />
1) It wasn't a great DPS machine back in Kunark when it was contemporary equipment. But it was still good enough that the proc would do its job all by itself.<br />
<br />
2) NOW, three expansions later, it's not the epic that's all that dated. It's the OTHER MELEE classes who are dating it. Monks, Rogues and Rangers are going to make your life difficult. If they were all using dated weaponry too, it's much easier for the epic to hold its own. But all it takes is one monk with a Rune Etched Bamboo Bo Stick to make you think your epic no longer works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You may want to try the 2 hand epic.  I find it seems to proc significantly more than the 1 hander.  It's DPS isn't great but the 175pt dd proc seems to help some.  My dex is normally about 210ish with Avatar so you may have better luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you already have a GSoT and you are holding better agro with it, then keep it and use it when you need agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sadly, I think our epic is just for looks now.. something we can say we did.  Something to wield for screenshots.  Its just too dated now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unless it's the best you got than the epic is quite dated. look for upgrades if you can and just bag the sucker for showing off in the bazaar while in trader mode.....<br />
<br />
i liked my epic; but when i left PoP was about a week old. i tried one of the first windblades out that were found on my server and thought the epic was the biggest hog of a weapon going.<br />
pretty much i'd wager once you hit ToVN or comparable level the epics can be upgraded easily with random drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">blue blade is nice for offhand if you are using a willsapper as the primary form of slow for your group :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used the epic as 2hs when tanking and it was fine all the way to lvl 65 in XP groups.  The DPS wasnt great, though it was still better than a fleshgrinder + red blade combo, but the proc more than made up for that and the 2 hander version seems to have a much better proc rate than the 1 hand version.<br />
<br />
Now days I still use the red blade offhand to tank and will continue to do so until I get my hands on either a blood frenzy or hate giver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Eoden, would you continue to use the Red blade offhand if you had a 1 hand Primal?<br />
<br />
I ask because I mainhand Shadowheart (after Avatar proc) and offhand Primal 1H.   All epic blades are banked.  I have no aggro procing weapons, so I rely on Taunt, Shield, AE Taunt and sheer dps for Aggro.  Seems to work fine.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good question, one I'm unlikely to ever have to consider seriously because my guild is unlikely to target mobs that drop ST keys again, and even if I did score one they are equally unlikely to go back to ST.<br />
<br />
That said, If I had primal I think I would use it offhand until it proc'd and then swap in the red blade.  Usually I do a few parses and stuff to check out my DPS when I change what weapons I am using, so if the primal turned out to be significantly better DPS over the red blade, and/or having avatar perpetually up meant the BoC proc'd enough that I don't need a hate proc in the off hand then maybe my poor old epics would be perma bagged except when I want to stand in the nexus and have people comment on my particle weapon.<br />
<br />
My current feeling is that DPS alone is not enough to hold agro reliably and that hate proc's are where its at, as I mentioned above I XP'd to 65 with the 2hs epic which is a very poor weapon for DPS, but a proc in the first 10secs of the fight would have agro locked on me unless something retarded happened (like 4 slow resists or whatever).  Sure you can tank with just DPS / taunt / AE taunt / careful positioning / shield, and plenty of times you still do while using hate proc weapons because you'll always go through a few mobs without getting a single proc or no procs till the mobs running.<br />
<br />
I don't XP very often now (like once in the last month and that was with guildies) and on raids our shammys will give me avatar if I ask for it so for now the red blade gets to stay in my offhand tanking until Cursed decides to put out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If your guild can, kill Xano the POI Dragon until you get a CHSD, main hand CHSD and red epic off and you'll be sitting very pretty =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From my (not scientific) testing and I believe others have commented likewise, primal (prismatic) for exp'ing is unbeatable DPS.  As a 61 warrior with 260 str, 260 dex, 260 agi at all times while exp'ing my dps is, well, insane to an average 61 warrior.  In addition to the stats (which make me crit like a fanatic) Avatar adds yet another 100attack, so my Attack rating goes from an unbuffed of 1k'ish to just shy of 1400.<br />
<br />
All this combined with a pretty fast mainhand (the Shadowheart):<br />
<br />
Shadow Heart<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
Skill: Piercing  Atk Delay: 17<br />
DMG: 11  Dmg Bonus: 11<br />
STR: +8  DEX: +8  STA: +8  AGI: +8  HP: +50  SV MAGIC: +25  <br />
WT: 1.8  Size: SMALL<br />
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG BST<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
and it seems to equate to reliable aggro.  Plus, I know how to use taunt, I let the mob turn to the shaman and then I taunt, 8 out of 10 times it immediately turns back to me.  If not, then I choose between /shield or AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use both epics as offhands all the time. I use CHSD for main, and either blue or red blade situationally. If there is a SK or Pally in group that is ocassionally pulling agg, I'll stay with redblade for additional hate (BTW, the red blade procs often for me, not sure why yers isnt).<br />
<br />
If CHSD is doing fine, I'll throw in blue or trident of the deep sea. I should mention, I get very bored using the same thing all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tenakha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I repeat what I keep saying.  Warrior epic sucks.  You can take the tradeable parts of the epic (green scale, etc) and sell them in the bazaar and use that plat to buy weapons superior to the epic.  There is therefore no reason for any warrior to ever use any of the 3 epic blades other than for looks or RP reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used 2hs Epic for Raid tanking Quite a bit especially when POP was Repoiste Heavy and My hit points was Tiny.<br />
<br />
Upgraded it with the Velious Drop from Lord Vyemm (the ugly Knockback dragon)  *something* Sword of the Sky.<br />
Now when I use 2hs I got with That one, Nice Proc and DPS, but your epic is still a good weapon provided you don't end up in a group with Lazy people who insisted that agro is your problem not theres.<br />
<br />
Gratz on the Epic and Enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Youre job isnt to do unbeatable dps, its to keep agro so the dps people youre grouped with dont get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I repeat what I keep saying. Warrior epic sucks.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">what better weapons would you buy in the bazaar?  Just looking for opinions on where the epic stacks up against tradeable weapons for holding agro.<br />
<br />
Taking pricing from my server, red scale goes for 5k, green from 40k - 70k.  Gonna compromise on price and say you get 55k for your green scale and 5k for the red its going to give you 60k.  Interestingly this is the amount of plat I have in the bank at the moment.  Every day I check the bazaar for weapons as I have been wanting some decent non taunt DPS weapon(s) for a while now and heres some prices I have observed:<br />
<br />
2 handers:<br />
Windblade: 37k-50k<br />
War Marshall's Bladed Staff: 35k-65k<br />
Narandi's lance: 40k<br />
Stone Bladed Axe of Dismay: 6k-19k<br />
<br />
1 handers:<br />
Split Blade of Destruction: 90k<br />
Horn of Hsagra: 50k<br />
Fleshgrinder: 45k-60k<br />
Short Blade of Lightning: 30k<br />
Disembowler: 30k<br />
Curved Claws :15k<br />
<br />
While I haven't played on other server or checked prices on other servers I have a pretty good idea that due to the amount of spawn competition on the tribunal alot of people twink their alts to play when theres nothing up to kill and as a result our economy is pretty screwed up (the whole my twink is phatter than yours thing can get pretty gross at times).<br />
<br />
Also I have never seen a Great Staff of Thunder forsale on the Tribunal so getting one of these isnt just an issue of raising the cash, but also finding one forsale.<br />
<br />
So... with 60k, what weapons are you going to buy that is either going to be a better offhander that a 14/24 with 15sta, 5svall, 50 hps and a 500 hate + debuff proc, or hold better agro than the epic 2hs 36/41 10svall, 15sta, 100hps, 500hate proc (and I am certain it has a higher proc rate than the 1hs).<br />
<br />
I never had a windblade, but it did have a stonebladed axe of dismay and while it was better DPS than the epic 2hs it didnt even come close in holding agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gallerus - I know my job, I haven't had the luxury of looting high aggro weapons, so my character has seemed to go the way of dps for aggro.  I'm not bragging about my dps, Im making a point that a high dps warrior, such as myself, _can_ do a relatively good job of holding aggro and keeping his supporting toons alive.  <br />
<br />
The weapons I have, are shaping my AA, such that I am going mainly offensive.  If a Willsapper, CHSD or something similar falls in my lap, I'll then be able to place more reliance upon the proc and go with defensive AA.  I just wanted to suggest the option, it can be done, people love grouping with my toon and I find myself sought after for exp groups.  Don't underestimate a correctly used Taunt button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Furthermore, I would wager that I do a better job than an Epic wielding warrior at onset of the pull, because I am hitting faster and hitting harder.  If the proc doesn't go off before the Slow resist, ruh roh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">To me an ideal fight is one where I haven't had to hit the taunt button.  Sure you're not always going to have the luxury of that, but as a warrior you are likely to be one of the lower DPS classes in the group, so DPS alone isnt going to keep the mob on you unless you solo tank the mob down to 50% before everyone else jumps in.  With hate procing weapons you have that chance however that you will proc in the first 5-10 seconds and have that 'snap agro' that everyone seems to drool over.  Use 2 hate proc'ing weapons and the chances just go up.<br />
<br />
I'm also a big fan of swapping weapons once agro is established if you have a higher DPS option.  When I was using the epic 2hs I'd start the fight with the epic and use it until the mob was slowed and beating on me and then swap to something that did better DPS - at the time a stone bladed axe of dismay.  These days I do the same, starting the fight with BoC + Red Epic until the mob is debuffed and I am holding the mobs attention and then pull out the BBB to pound it into the ground.  Works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">but as a warrior you are likely to be one of the lower DPS classes in the group, so DPS alone isnt going to keep the mob on you unless you solo tank the mob down to 50% before everyone else jumps in <br />
<br />
Actually I find that to be wrong.  I use pure dps for aggro.  Monks in my guild who out dps me attack right when I do.  Yet most fights I still keep aggro through the fight without pressing taunt once.  I believe that the aggro multiplier based on class allows us to use pure dps to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
I also disagree that our job is not to do damage.  Yes, tanking is the most important thing, but saying our job isn't to do dps is like a pally saying his job is to tank and not do group buffs.  Dps is a part of our class, even if it isn't as good as others, it's still important imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No one here has said that our job is not to do damage.  I have said that holding agro is more important than doing damage and that I choose my weapons to reflect this.  If this were not true then surely paladins would be the #3 choice for tank as much of the debate on this board concludes that paladins do less DPS than warriors.  However as much of this debate also revolves around Paladins being the prefered XP tank despite having lower DPS I would conclude that groups value your ability to hold agro over the extra 5% DPS you could do if you put your taunt weapons away.<br />
<br />
Yes DPS is part of our class and a part of our job.  We hit stuff and we get hit by stuff - both important, but I would gladly hit stuff for less if it will make the stuff want to hit me more.<br />
<br />
Aside from which using agro weapons for the first 20% of the fight until agro is established and then switching in whatever DPS combo you have is not going adversly effect your DPS too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">well, no matter how much DPS your weapon has ... if a comprably equipped rogue or monk are in your group, they have one advantage the warrior doesn't:<br />
<br />
They're standing behind the mob.<br />
<br />
No ripostes. No dodges. No blocks. No parries.<br />
<br />
I'm all for DPS being part of a warrior's job. It is. It's one of the most basic tenents of melee.<br />
<br />
But as a tank you have to stand in front of the mob. And that puts you at a small (note I say SMALL and I do mean small) DPS disadvantage right from the very get go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My second paragraph was replying to Gallerus, who said that dps wasn't our job.  Obviously aggro is more important, and I stated so.  My other point was, you don't have to put taunt weapons away to do dps, you just have to get the right weapon which gives both.  Not as hard as it seems truthfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The epic 2 hander does indeed work better than the 1 handers. <br />
<br />
Was kind of wary of using it due to the lower ratio over a GSoT or Stonebladed axe of dismay, but even then a half decent 2hander seems to outdamage any 1h combo over 60 due to the dmg bonus moving 2h further and further ahead of duel wield. So, I do a little less dmg than with the GSoT but the proc is fairly frequent and does really upset a mob. <br />
<br />
I doubt very much that there are droppable duel wield combos out there that surpass a bladed staff or Windblade on dps at 65. Seeing as our damage caps are the same, I think that a warrior with a good 2hander could in theory outdamage a duel wielding monk with similar haste, despite their flying kicks, but not likely one wielding something like a T staff.<br />
<br />
Only money I spent on epic was 8k for red scale (1 dragon camp was enough for me) and 4k on rebreathers. My friends and guildies would have been rightly upset if I had sold the green scale and even then, there are no droppable weapons out there with this kind of aggro proc. GSoT cost me 26k-ish (it is fairly common to find it on sale on the Nameless, most warriors still seem to favor Fleshgrinders and wavecrashers for some bizzare reason). <br />
<br />
So, basically I have a nice offhander for when I do eventually get a nice aggro mainhander and a pretty good 2hander with less damage, but better proc and stats than a GSoT. This is one of the nice things about the warrior epic, we get to choose between 1h and 2h weapons and IMO opinion it certainly does beat the SK and Paladin epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tenakha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Eoden, Windblade and War Marshall's bladed staff are both &gt; epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Tenakha - Windblade and War Marshall's are greater than 2H epic? and in which way?<br />
<br />
You all seem to be in agreement that the epic 2H is better dps than the 2 1handers?  I parsed this to not be the truth.  In permafrost however, I know ripostes/blocks/dodges are much higher in POP exp zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Niroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For maximum taunt I use this set up:<br />
<br />
Smouldershank 14/20 piercing -37 Fire Debuff (does not seem to generate any aggro that I have noticed)<br />
<br />
Red Epic 14/24, seems to proc fairly reliably for me.<br />
<br />
For dps with a group that knows what it is doing I whip out me Windblade, which I can maintain aggro, *most* of the time.<br />

On the raids we do, casual guild I am generally the Second Assist or Thrid Assist in ToV.</div></div><hr />
