<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2389">Odd Idea</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's an odd idea, please tell me what you think of it.<br />
<br />
Myself I'm not too sure wether I like this idea or not ;),<br />
but imo, it definately deserves some looking into.<br />
<br />
Since imo a Warrior should be able to tank an unslowed mob as well as a knight tanks it slowed.<br />
I was trying to figure a way of making this possible without Nerfing knights, but rather upgrading Warriors.<br />
Here is what I came up with :<br />
<br />
Auras: (I think the idea of Auras was proposed with Raaj's poll)<br />
<br />
<br />
Frightfull/Terrorising/Demonic Aura <br />
<br />
Warriors have learnt how to cast fear into the hearts of their foes.<br />
<br />
-When a mob hits you, the aura will delay his next attack by 15%, 30%, 50%.<br />
----<br />
<br />
What this skill does basicaly, is Slow the mob for the Warrior only.<br />
This allows Warriors to be loved and cherished when there are no Slowers around.<br />
<br />
The skill could stack with other slows, but not go over 75%.<br />
So if the skill is used with a BST 50% Slow,<br />
the mob will hit the Warrior with 75% delay, and hit everyone else with 50% delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
How will the reuse time etc.. be dealt?...<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see Auras as permanent disciplines.<br />
Using one aura disallows the use of another Aura.<br />
<br />
So you can keep Demonic Aura up as long as you like, but it's stopping you from using Damage Shield auras, or Hate Auras etc...<br />
<br />
Making you have to choose between the best ones considering the situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good thing about this Aura, is it will still force people to watch their aggro, but with reason.<br />
<br />
So Pros:<br />
-Group members will watch aggro, knowing that if they get aggro, it's a UNslowed mob that will kick their ass.<br />
-Warriors will be loved for groups, without shadowing out Paladins.<br />
-Slow oriented class won't become an ABSOLUTE necessity, but they will keep their priviledged spot, and still be loved.<br />
(If a slower is on, you take him, but if no slowers are on it won't stop you from making a group, as long as a Warrior is on)<br />
-This keeps the aggro difference between knights and warriors that many people wish to keep.<br />
-This won't unbalance raids whatsover, because the mobs have their delays capped anyhow (75%)<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-other Auras will need to be implemented as well.<br />
Otherwise the Demonic Aura thingy, will have to be either permanent(which will never happen),<br />
or be time based and have reuse time (which sucks and removes the skill's use).<br />
But implementing other Auras isn't a bad thing at all, it only makes the whole thing a bit more complex ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Please post constructive criticism or ideas :)<br />
<br />
Actually... at the start of the post I wasnt sure wether I liked this idea... but now, I think I like it very much indeed :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: Of couse, the Aura will not affect mobs that are immune to Slow spells.<br />
That goes without saying ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just realised...<br />
<br />
Such an aura would improve drastically the benefit of /Shield.<br />
<br />
If your mob starts hitting on someone else, he won't be slowed, unless you /shield the person. The mob will then be hitting you as well as the overaggroing scum... which will delay the mob's attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont think you can slow for one person, you could be missed more, which would be a defensive type thing, like Defense. Or maybe an aoe aura that slows, slowing anything within 1 ft or something, allowing mob to be slow when close to warrior. Or have it slow target but again only if it is with a certain distance, 1 ft maybe two. That way it would / most the time / only effect warrior, or anyone who is up his arse. But seeing we are going to get nothing no matter what the idea. I will leave it at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can...<br />
<br />
just like a mob gets hit for non melee damage when he hits you (Damage Shields)<br />
his next attack can be delayed when he hits you. (which acts as a Slow if he keeps hitting you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, i see this as a defensive thing. I see what your saying, a mob hits me s l o w, then tirns in same breath and hits like a mad man =\, i just dont think the programers would like that one. Making it a defensive thing would mean he swings as much but hits us 50% less............ Which is alot of missing .. whew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It sounds like you took this from Diablo 2.....<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">huh? o_O<br />
sorry sivok, but I really don't understand what you mean :p...<br />
nothing here about missing or defensive skills or anything...<br />
<br />
Mob hits you - check if Aura is up - If aura is up then mob delay = current delay + 50% delay, until next hit.<br />
Rince and repeat.<br />
<br />
Not rocket science, like I said... they programmed it for Damage Shields (damage everytime a mob hits you if you have a DS...)<br />
why wouldnt they be able to program it for weapon delays? /shrug<br />
<br />
And I never played Diablo, maybe there's an equivalent idea in there :p, I wouldn't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your stuck on math I am stuck on words, it all works out in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In Diablo 2, Paladins (They're nice in Diablo 2) have a skill tree called Auras which can heal, damage shield, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Could be cool to do. At least it might make it where you dont absolutely HAVE to have a slower in a group.  And folks would damn well have to learn to manage their aggro if the mob was only slowed when hitting the warrior.   Still, I can't decide if overall I like the idea or not.  Seems that it could have repercussions on group dynamics that might be undesirable.  And it wouldnt really help us in groups that had slowers unless it stacked with other classes slow spells.  If it did that, I'd probably give it a thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thats where other Auras come into play Beo :).<br />
<br />
So you got a shaman in the group, and no need of your Slow Aura....<br />
then pop up the DS Aura instead if you don't have many melees in your group...<br />
<br />
or, the 20% Haste Aura, if you got a few rogues, it would up dps nicely.<br />
<br />
etc etc...<br />
<br />
the Slow Aura was just a tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
Hell.. even a mana regen Aura if people want it... but personally I'd hate that ;)...<br />
<br />
what else?<br />
<br />
Proc Aura?... <br />
some aura that makes all melees in your group proc an Aggro Debuff? :D ? would be nice :)<br />
<br />
This could also bring in Warrior Stackability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">and then we could give up double attack and become bards.<br />
<br />
Ok, the idea has some merit, but Im kinda adverse to adding warrior utility in the form of something that is essentially a spell but by another name (or in this case more resembles a bard song... maybe we could twist auras?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Eoden... EVERYTHING is a spell then...<br />
<br />
Kick is actually a small DD nuke!!! but disguised as a skill!<br />
Archery is actually Bolt spells! but disguised as a skill!<br />
Rogue's Hide/Sneak is actually a invisi spell, disguised as a skill!<br />
<br />
If we're going to stop at every little detail that makes a skill look like a spell.. then forget any possiblity of a fix.<br />
Keep your Taunt and your Kick if they make you happy.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure you like Furor's idea on DoT aggro?.. (but its a DOT!! omg! a spell!!! we dont want spells!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Aura is not a spell, it is a permanent discipline that can affect the Warrior or everyone in the group, depending on what Aura you're using)<br />
<br />
You hit /aura, and you see all auras available to you.<br />
Choose one Aura and hit /Aura Demonic, for example.<br />
And wham, you're now bathed in a demonic aura.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you think that mighty Overlords, whom fight countless battles against dragons and gods... learn more then a fucking Kick?<br />
Wouldn't it be safe to say that a Warrior's stature has improved massively throughout the fights, <br />
to the point where the mere presence of one of these Warlords would modify the surroundings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What skill would this be then? Skill of smelling so bad your target slows in digust maybe, heh i like that, have to be ogre.trol only though.......<br />
<br />
I think last posters point is that this is a roll playing game, so lets stay true to what warrior should be and build on that. Really all I see we need is to be higher on hate list for mobs. A skill of Battle cry would be cool, use the skill which produces hate from mob, kinda like charging in and yelling, which would get the attention of a foe IRL. Hate from Battle cry could go up with lvl and be reused say every min. Could be used at begining of fight to get a head start on the hate list =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh my... what vivid imaginations you have... Skill of smelling badly?...<br />
<br />
Do you even have any clue what an Aura is?.... no, nothing to do with magic.<br />
<br />
It is something all living creatures produce through their mere existence.<br />
The very fact of being there produces an Aura.<br />
<br />
And you'de imagine that Overlords that have endured the crap from these boards and still play the game, would have a much more present Aura.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the current staff at SOE are a lot like you.<br />
All they see as a fix to melee, is dps/hp/ac/aggro.....<br />
but that would unbalance current encounters, so they end up doing NOTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you find Auras isn't true to the game.....<br />
how can you find Battle Cry any good?.... I mean...<br />
there you are, with 5 people digging their swords deep into the creature's gut, magically raining down flames to burn the creature to crisp, some bard singing non stop during the carnage.....<br />
and you think that a Warrior going &quot;ARRRGGGHHHHH&quot;, would catch the mob's attention?<br />
Would that &quot;hold true to the game&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Absolutely.<br />
<br />
&quot;The battle was joined and the Raider felt sure of himself, as evidenced by the smirk on his face. The fear of the Warlord would soon consume their hearts.<br />
<br />
&quot;A blade of ice solidified in the air around him, stabbing mercilessly into his flesh. His head buzzed with the incessant warbling of a minstrel. So many flies, so little time. <br />
<br />
&quot;But then, a sound unlike any he'd heard before caught his attention. The half elf, whom he had disregarded before, stood directly in his path, his swords spread out to his sides. The manling's jaws opened like a snake and let loose a deafening cry, the sum of all of his rage and pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cry resounded in the Raider's head, and he could tell that he was doomed. Now, the little half elf's friends were unafraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're going to accuse people of not being &quot;RP&quot; enough, try thinking &quot;RP&quot; yourself. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's not to me you have to convince of the skill's truthfullness,<br />
but to Eodon and Sivok.<br />
I don't mind at all if a skill &quot;looks&quot; like magic, or doesnt hold true to the enviroment....<br />
as long as it's balanced, works, and helps us out.<br />
<br />
You'll have to convince eodon and sivok however, that the half elf's cry wasn't magical... because it looked pretty magical to me!!! :eek:<br />
A sound that makes a mob forget the daggers sticking into his body... that's gotta be magical!!<br />
And we don't want magic!!!<br />
<br />
But whatever,<br />
I personally find it logical that someone who doesn't spend his much mental energy, but rather focuses onto his body, would be diffusing an immense Aura.<br />
<br />
What use is it spending time on RolePlay anyhow...<br />
when the Official Master of Combat only knows how to Kick, Taunt, and Disarm....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hahaha Good point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">An elf is a magical creature by nature :P So half elf is half magical in nature :P :P</div></div><hr />
