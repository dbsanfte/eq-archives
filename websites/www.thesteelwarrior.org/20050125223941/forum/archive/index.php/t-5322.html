<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the guild is going all out on Rallos Zek until he's dead.  We have a good shot at being in the elementals by the end of the weekend barring server issues etc, so I decided it's time to start planning.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=619288&amp;alt=163866<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Included a VT Belt, Seru BP, and Agnarr Bow that I don't have yet, so I may wind up looking for those slots in the elementals as well if they don't drop for us soon (I know I won't find a bp in the elementals).<br />
<br />
Couldn't find a belt, cloak, neck, or range in the elementals that I was too excited about, although it's not too tough to improve on what I have in those slots now.  Looking for good AC in every slot, which is why I didn't replace my crimson bull rings.<br />
<br />
Also, I will of course be lookin for Raex pants, but I know what their droprate is so I left them off the list for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went - <br />
BoW<br />
Raex armor<br />
<br />
VT rings and even belt is high AC ( i use augmented Cloak of thornsac35 and  +40 hps and Augmented Ssra blood cord ac30 + 140 hps) id go for your weakest slots first where you stand to gain the most. EP plate legs arent that common and IMO from our drop rates EP Plate is the most common. Grohlin ring usually is cheap too since its basically rot also.<br />
<br />
most common in order to rarest for us<br />
Gaunts<br />
bracers<br />
Arms<br />
Boots<br />
Helm<br />
Legs <br />
<br />
Count on gaunts rotting sooner than you think, with pyronis and AMY + when you do Air when your really bored you guys will be giving em away soon enough.<br />
<br />
I have saved my points after getting all Raex for all time loot. Looks like its going to pay off soon enough for me. In time you can get Ears, Rings, Neck, Belt, Cloak, Face fairly easy.</div></div><hr />

Not sure on this, but I have an augmented BF/BoC already, so while a BoW would be a nice DPS upgrade, I'm not hurting that bad for aggro whether I get it or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your profile is similar to my aims too, I put in a Moss Encrusted Band to replace Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience which might be worth looking at.<br />
<br />
As Krassus said above though generally it seems to pay to go for Raex stuff first. Id look at getting a bracer or boots first, as they are the weakest slots in your set (ignoring legs for now hehe). Earth rings are an easy farm so that haste bracer may turn up early too.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, by my math I'm about 14 months behind uber atm.  Back on Tarew I was maybe 6 months behind :).  <br />
<br />
My 2nd warrior finally did pass my first one in hps though :p.<br />
<br />
Thanks to those that posted for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a pretty solid plan to me.<br />
<br />
If you're still doing VT, you might hold out for an Aten neck over the Magma neck.  Much better item.<br />
<br />
Agnarr bow probably not worth it if you're on points.  If you really want a range attack, elemental tradeskill bows will flood your guild once you're farming eles.  Charm of Defense is an awesome range slot and 1-groupable (0 dkp), and Incite is more than enough to chain off pullers or pull for most xp groups.  Since I got Incite and Time VZ orb, I think I've dusted off my air bow for a really long pull like twice.<br />
<br />
Consider an Ornate BP if you can't get the Seru one.  It's a very nice intermediate alternative til you get to Time.<br />
<br />
I got a Whispering Air Bangle and kind of regretted it.  It's all/all, very popular, and low AC that you'll be replacing in Time.  Agnarr earring and earring from charm birds have better AC and would probably be easier to get/cheaper.<br />
<br />
BoW is totally worth getting, even with what you have.  It's a cosmic leap in dps and hate per swing, and would give you more AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bid on an aten neck this weekend but lost.  People are still breaking the bank for that thing, as is to be expected I guess.  I was suprised that I wasn't able to find anything better than that neck in the e-planes.  Looking at it now, you can close the gap a bit by throwing a 10 ac augment into the reflected flame neck since the aten neck doesn't have an augment slot, but the Aten neck still wins out thanks to the 5 more AC and the effect (although with regen caps and the Veng VI on the other neck you're really only losing the damage shield.)<br />
<br />
Good point on the air bangle.  Might be smarter to stick with my 15 ac 80 hp ear from VT and save points for a time earring.  I understand that pulsing emerald hoop is common as dirt and better than the air bangle, and of course the time god earrings are much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earrings<br />
There are almost no decent earrings in the EP.<br />
AHR earring just blows them away. So does Seru.<br />
Clawed Earthcrafter is the best one out there (EarthB)<br />
(Dont bother even with Wispering Bangle)<br />
<br />
Neck <br />
Thats the worse slot of all the EP.<br />
There is not even one half decent necklace out there.<br />
The one you chose (Fire) is nice but lowish AC.<br />
<br />
Mask<br />
AHR all the way.<br />
<br />
Helm<br />
Faerune .... Some have it... Some Dont ... GET IT !<br />
<br />
Rings<br />
Your magelo shows 2 crimson bull keep them.<br />
Moss Encrusted Ring is nice but warriors should not focus on ATK.<br />
<br />
 Gloves/Bracers/Boots/Greaves <br />
Raex All the way<br />
<br />
 Pauldrons <br />
A very hard choice to make (the hardest in EP if u ask me)<br />
Puresteel (Air) are very nice but very rare (and warrior only)<br />
Flowing Moss Mantle (EarthA) are not too bad and have a 41% haste.<br />
<br />
 BreastPlate <br />
Seru is by far the best (resists &gt;&gt;&gt; ATK &amp; 5ac) AHR is quite nice.<br />
A really underratted BP, is the BP of speed (Ac60 hp125 40%)<br />
Ornate is nice, and i love the clicky.<br />
<br />
Cloack<br />
Basically there are only 2 half decent cloacks in EP.<br />
The first is the Leaf-Joined (EarthA), the second is Feather Mantle (Xegony).<br />
<br />
Both suck, it may seem as incredibly stupid or foolish.<br />
But if you want the best cloack around :<br />
- Cloack of Thorns (NToV)<br />
- Cloack of Icy Shadows (TVX at VT entrace)<br />
<br />
These will be incredibly cheap, and EP one are just a bit better.<br />
And probably cost a LOT more.<br />
<br />
 Belt <br />
All EP belts are totally hilarous and worth shit.<br />
Belt of Mastery all the way (VT)<br />
<br />
Range<br />
Agnaar bow is better, but will cost points, dont bother.<br />
PoFire bows are very very common once you farm Fenin Ro.<br />
Farm PoFire castle 1 for the Charm of Defence.<br />
<br />
<br />

----------------------------------<br />
--- Personnal Comments ---<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Having Killed Quarm,  i have seen all there is to see.<br />
<br />
Assuming you plan to reach Time (everyone does).<br />
This is what i would do if i were you (in a DKP guild, even more with bids).<br />
<br />
In VT :<br />
-Gorget of Superiority as a haste item<br />
(No really better Necks before Time, and it has a haste)<br />
-Cloack of Icy Shadows or Cloack of Thorns<br />
(All the other cloacks are better but not by much are more expensive)<br />
-AHR gloves<br />
(Single best warrior item in EQ with Raex BP, GET THEM NOW)<br />
-Belt of Mastery<br />
(Better belts can only be found in Time)<br />
<br />
In EP :<br />
- Full Set of Raex (Legs = Gods only)<br />
- Puresteel Pauldrons (Air)<br />
<br />
As Quest :<br />
- Seru Earring !!<br />
<br />
For the BP :<br />
Since PreNerf LDoN is out of the question .....<br />
Ornate is probably a good choice (AHR/Seru/Speed) but will be a waste if/when you enter time.<br />
And Ornate Clicky is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in much the same situation as Brutul. We just entered EP's last weekend, haven't raided there yet since we're still backflagging. Two rallos kills have yet to produce a BoW. I have the second most DKP in the guild, two tiers above the closest warrior, and have been saving for a BoW.<br />
<br />
We're in VT (fourth or fifth clear) this weekend, VT is in rotation on our server, so I can get certain things whenever I want basically -- as long as they drop for us. I recently went for the VT haste belt with AC, low hp but I had a haste neck from PoI and we haven't had the VT haste neck drop yet, plus it's pricy.<br />
<br />
Our DKP system is basically zero sum, fixed points, no bidding. I know what stuff is going to cost now and can plan accordingly.<br />
<br />
Priorities for me at the moment are:<br />
<br />
1) BoW<br />
2) AHR gloves if they drop<br />
2) Raex bracers<br />
3) Raex boots<br />
4) AHR neck<br />
5) Raex helm<br />
6) Cloak from somewhere, we don't do VT wings anymore so I'm not sure what my options are here.<br />
7) Rings from somewhere, figuring we'll do Emp again basically, although that ring is pricy, not sure on the other one<br />
8) AHR earring once I have Raex Helm, keeping Earring of Battle<br />
<br />
It'll probably take 3 months to do all of this, if not more.<br />
<br />
Any comments? If AHR gloves drop this weekend, would you drop DKP on them now knowing that it'll leave you lower than some other warriors on a BoW if we get it? Keep in mind I have the Call of Sky globe, although a 10s clicky is... sad.<br />
<br />
The other thing I have to factor in is that the warriors in the guild keep saying I'll merit a BoW since I am most frequently MTing -- basically I've tanked all our firsts -- but I kinda don't want to roll the dice there, especially since I'm an officer and don't like it looking like favoritism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AHR gloves are worth whatever you have to spend to get em.  Seriously.  Proc buff gives you a whole extra hate proc on top of weapons.  There's only one other item with a good agro proc buff in game - Symbol of Planemasters off Saryrn in Time.  And Symbol also has a huge dot focus, making it far more contested.  AHR gloves are clickable from inventory, 0.5sec cast.  I've been able to get a click off on every major mob I've tanked (pretty much everything in game).  They're the only item I'm still using from VT besides Aten neck, and I expect I'll be using them all the way through the next expansion as well.<br />
<br />
Other earring you might consider besides Agnarr/charm birds is the tradeskill quest one: 25ac, 145hp, 30 attack, 15sv all, etc.  It's a huge amount of work, but from the screenshots I've seen of the upcoming changes to tradeskills, it will become a lot easier to obtain.<br />
<br />
I think we ended up at like a 50% drop rate on Puresteel - we went something like 7 Puresteel from our first 8 kills.  Got very lucky.  It also has the advantage of being War only, meaning as long as you don't have poor luck on drops, it will eventually get to rot/roll status.</div></div><hr />

Everyone seems to focus about the Ele gear when they get access to EPs but VT is really underrated imo. Sure EP gear have a lill more HP but most of it lack AC instead.

Aten gloves are Call of Fire. Both are stun, Fire is about twice as much nuke damage (big deal)... The main advantage of the AHR gloves is that they're 0.5s vs 10s from the orb.<br />
<br />
Would you spend 12 points on the gloves knowing that a BoW costs 16 points, and there are two warriors who are 6 and 7 points below you?<br />
<br />
It comes down to how often we kill Rallos and how often a BoW drops. We've gotten two spawns now, no BoWs (neck twice). It's hard to say how often we'll get him, 2-3 other guilds are ahead of us in the EP's progression and still want BoWs as well.<br />
<br />
If I'm lucky, Aten won't even drop the gloves and I won't have to stress about it. :)</div></div><hr />

Almost every warrior in my guild wants one (every warrior who doesnt have shoulder haste that it) and we have yet to see them from about 10 kills, and crawling that far in air really does suck.<br />
<br />
I reckon its worth having some alternative options for your shoulder slot - flowing moss mantle from earth is nice otherwise you'll have to look out for a pair of VT shoulders.  Puresteel would own, but if I see a shroud of vigor or pauldrons of seething darkness first I'd definitely grab them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Aten gloves don't outlive that. 3 second cast for 30 minute duration doing more damage and stunning higher on a better resist (neg 200 disease) on an item that you'd very likely still wear. If you're wondering about something outliving a DBotW, you have to remember that there IS something better than the AHR gloves.<br />
<br />
  Compared to Orb of the Sky, yes it's worlds better. Your DW setup is good, plenty good enough to hold aggro, so I'd probably get the gloves if possible and worry about a BoW second. I'm personally torn on the issue, however, because both are such excellent items. Also, you are more likely to keep killing RZ than you are to keep farming AHR, because you'll start moving into the EPs more and more. 3 day spawn time for RZ vs 7 days for AHR helps too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Drape of the Agile (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=15864) from Charm birds is a decent hold over cloak. OK AC, good HP. Nice saves. And in theory should be cheap since it's from the stupid birds.<br />
<br />
 I was pretty depressed when I realized my NToV cloak was better than EP cloaks and slapped an AC aug on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aten gloves don't outlive that.Wrong.<br />
<br />
The resist on Saryrn symbol is irrelevant for hate generation.  The proc creates just as much hate on a resist as it does when it lands, with most of the hate coming from the stun portion.<br />
<br />
The only advantages Saryrn symbol has are duration of the buff, slightly better dps, and the stun cap.  The duration really isn't an advantage given the fact you can rebuff Aten gloves at any time.  The cast time on symbol is a liability.  The dps isn't really a factor.  Call of fire proc is -100 resist adjust, making it land on almost as much stuff as Pestilence Shock.  It's a marginal dps increase at best.  Even then, you're a tank, not a dps class.  The stun is still capped at 65 which makes it almost useless on raids.  About the only thing it can do that CoF can't is interrupt casters in xp groups.<br />
<br />
The advantages Aten gloves have are super fast (0.5 sec) cast (can rebuff mid-fight while tanking, can use in a low slot on pellers, etc.), and inventory clickable.  You don't have to fumble to swap em in to click if you've upgraded the slot.  Most people have to sacrifice range slot choice to get Saryrn symbol - no Quarm stone, no VZ orb, no RZ shurikens, no VZ bow, etc.  Even if they get both symbol and another range, they gotta swap to buff.  Anybody with a Saryrn symbol who gets a spiffy new GoD range with Quarm-like stats in a few months is gonna have to swap, etc., etc.  A lot of people with Saryrn symbol would gladly trade it for Aten gloves, just like Emilia posted above.  They're 10x more convenient to use and one of the best clickies a War will ever see.<br />

We never had a pair drop for us, so i wouldn't bank on aten gloves. once we hit elementals, we might have done aten once or twice if that. Now that we are in Time, unless we are extremely bored and it would happen to be up or somethin, we aren't going back. same thing usually happens to most elemental guilds. I plan on putting in for saryrn symbol one of these days. :)</div></div><hr />
