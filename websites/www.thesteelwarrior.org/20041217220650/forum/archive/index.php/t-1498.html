<br />
Background information, warriors are the masters of combat and find numerous ways to gain advantages over their opponents.<br />
<br />
Skill Name: Sand in the Eyes -- Works like a kick key only it causes a dot that lowers AC and attack of your opponent. Additionally, each tick adds a small amount of hate. When successful would cause some immediate damage like 10 to 20 points of damage. Effect would last 10 to 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
Skill Name: Knee Bash -- The warrior will strike an opponent's knees causing them to become temporarily immobile. (Thus, it'd be like a small root) Would last a short duration but the refresh would not be fast enough that one could keep a mob perma rooted. Would cause some immediate damage as well and as long as the root lasts would cause hate each tick. Effect would last about 5 to 7 seconds.<br />
<br />
Skill Name: Disarm (Yes a rehash of this useless skill) -- When used this will cause a Warrior to strike their opponent effectively disarming any weapons (like the old skill) and causing a slow effect as the opponent recooperates from the blow. The strike would cause some initial damage and cause a 5 to 15% slow duration that adds hate each tick. This would last 10 to 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Each of these skills would scale in strength as one gained more experience. The percentages and durations I posted would be suited for a 65 warrior. Thus, a lvl 15 warrior isn't going to have an automatic 15 % slow. These effects would stack with everything. However, warriors cannot stack the effects on these but they can stack the agro. For instance, 2 warriors could not Disarm a mob to cause 60% slow but they could both disarm it to cause 15% slow and both would gain the same amount of hate.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, a these skills would be hooked together. Thus, a warrior could not disarm, knee bash, and sand in the eyes in one round of combat. However, having multiple warriors in a group could chain each of these skills. (For instance, 2 warriors could keep a mob perma rooted via timing knee bash)<br />
<br />
Any comments are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Great idea here, with a little Tweaking IMHO, The skill as is causes a non magic weapon a mob is using to drop to the ground, and is totally useless against any mob either not carrying a weapon or carrying a magic weapon besides the small amount of hate generated.<br />
<br />
Perhaps editing the ability slightly as it is used in PVP combat, Non magic weapons could still be dropped to the ground as is, mobs with Magic weapons would have the weapons dropped from use and placed in their inventory, and creating a larger amount of hate. weither the mob should be able to reequip the item or perhaps equip another item if they had multiple weapons on them would be debatable, and in my thought a mute point beyond weither verant wants the mob to have the benefit of the weapon or not after it has been disarmed. <br />
<br />
as far as the slow goes... that may be pushing our luck, perhaps a minor stun effect may be more reasonable, or the slow but not being stackable with any other slow effect</div></div><hr />
