<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longern</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A week or so ago, I posted my magelo and asksed for general gear advice.<br />
<br />
I've just hit 55, and am looking at upgrades again - this time, with a eye toward Ornate and/or LDoN pieces. I thought I'd ask you guys - since a lot of you have more end-game time logged than I do as of yet.<br />
<br />
For reference, here's my magelo;<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1057548<br />
<br />
Specifically, I was given Ornate gaunt and bracer molds as a gift from a friend who decided to quit playing. Gaunts are worth it for haste, I'd wager - the bracers for AC... What other Ornate bits are worth the upgrade? Should I simply wait and accumulate LDoN points to spend on upgrades instead of bothering with Ornate? (realize my guild is smaller and hasn't broken into BoT/EP yet...)<br />
<br />
Bring the knowledge.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jakazzx</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">holy crap that s lot of nice gear for a 55, you bought a black plated collar, rallos helm, and 2 rings of earth, a BoC!! and that girdle's not cheap either... hrm ur ldon points should go towards anger 3 augs since you have way way way better armor than most warriors your level and aggro is more important anyway.  if you have more money, crystallized acid bracers r da bomb, boots of the storm are very comparable to ldon boots and are FAR superior to ornate boots.  keep the ornate gloves the 30% haste IS worth losing 30 hp to those warlords gaunts from hard TAK(droppable so u can buy em if your reeeeely loaded and just swap on the ornate to click em)  the ornate BP and greaves have seriously awesome clickys definitely look at those, the ldon armor can be better than the ornate if augged properly, but it takes a lot of points if u got the time.  also a stonewood compound bow would be a great investment, not sure if that has a required lvl tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, aye, free ornate is often a reasonable choice for a 55 war.<br />
Start working now for Anger augs for your weapons. It would be what I'd focus on. That and helping out whoever helped you get such nice gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The differance between ornate an 1492 plate is so small (particularly in bracers) that I would use the ornate and save points for other slots. (I have over 6k points in LDoNs and still only have one armor slot bought--and will not stop buying augs until at least 7.5k points.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longern</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot for the replies!<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know. I'm a sick, sick twink. I have a problem. I'm in a support group. Seriously.<br />
<br />
Anger 3 augs are first on my list of LDoN purchases. If someone up there loves me, I might be able to snag a GBoW at some point. I'm pretty sure I'll be using the weapons I have for several hundred years though...<br />
<br />
You'd go with Boots of the Storm over Ornate ones, eh? I looked at those, but I wasn't sure if they were worth the price, next to ornate.<br />
<br />
I agree about the Ornate bracers. I might pick-up a set of LDoN armor at some point...probably post-60 at the earliest (due to the crappy points you get from adventures before then). <br />
<br />
I appreciate your time and opinions, folks - thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll want to get an elemental bow at some point since you have more money than God.  Oh, and you totally suck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longern</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the back slot, I'm working on the (far more difficult to obtain than it should be) Loyalist Shield. Valdonov seems to be a shy vampyre.<br />
Shoulders are going to be a problem - I was thinking of the cords quest for that slot. Probably take me a while to get the bits from The Hole, but that's the plan.<br />
<br />
Beo: I know, I know. I'm in a twelve-step program at the local 'twinker's anonymous'. Step one is a pile of buffalo wings. Two is booze. Three... Well, we never actually got to three.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
you might be able to buy some tov mquest items. if people do it on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 55 this may not be an issue for a while, but I would disagree about taking ornate bracers over the Royal Attendant. With the extra aug slots and augs available they are substantially better than ornate. Plus, RA bracers and gaunts will take a 40hp aug, while there isn't a LDoN bought 40hp aug for type 7 slot wrists or gaunts.</div></div><hr />
