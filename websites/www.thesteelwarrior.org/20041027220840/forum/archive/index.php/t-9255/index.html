<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>voodoo5903</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i was wondering if the new oow sword of midwinters vengeance in primary and mace of memories would be a good combo 15/19-18/24</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Assuming they both proc at 55-which I believe that they do-then yes, the SMWV+MoMemories is a very viable option for aggro. Also at lvl 55 you gain access to Weapon Affinity (assuming that you have done 6 General AAs and have GoD). If you are looking for a worthwhile boost in aggro generation, getting the first two ranks of this (6 AAs) has an awesome return on aggro generation, especially if/when you throw in some anger augs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>voodoo5903</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">do you think it would be smart to do like 30 aa at lvl 55 or wait?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes, but take run3 now.<br />
to unlock the other AA, you must have 6AA spent in general, with 3 in run, you have to find 3 more at lvl 65. you can either go for regen, or metabolism or crafting mastery or resist or charisma. <br />
regen3 is close to useless at lvl 65, so if you want it, take it now so that you will really appreciate it.<br />
meta3 is little usefull at lvl65 not to consume too quickly your expensive stat food.<br />
crafting is obviously a must if you are crafting and that you reach your current cap, otherwise forget about it.<br />
resists is usefull versus heavy casters mob but the AA aren't strong enougth to be more than eyeballing, so if you plan to go in big raid you can get it at lvl 65 (just 3AA remember) and finish them when you will have more than 400AA :)<br />
well same for charisma, if you will raid alot and be the MT alot, DI will save your butt more than you can count them, so charisma is the way to go especially for ogre (3AA at 65 then 100 def AA then a little bit of charisma then 100 more deff AA then a little bit of AA then ...)<br />
<br />
so remember, run3 now and maybe regen3 otherwise whatever3 at lvl65 then 100 deff AA then the rest (and AE taunt is a must to have ASAP) ...</div></div><hr />
