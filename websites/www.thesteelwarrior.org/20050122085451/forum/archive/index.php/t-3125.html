I'd really love to get a count of folks with this in there sig... who knows maybe one day in the next 10 years he will pop in here and see the loathing we all share for him :)  So if you got this quote in your sig could you please post here, jsut for shits and giggles :)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure he'll pop up again. Probably around the time of the Chicago Fan Fair. He lurks here though, so he will probably try to come more prepared then in his last visit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When Absor was answering the questions in the LDoN thread, I was really impressed with how people handled it. The thread stayed on topic and compared to some other class boards (necro) it stayed tame. If you haven't read his visit to the necro boards, I'd advise it. I don't think many of the warriors here would appreciate being presented in that fashion.<br />
<br />
That said, if you'd like him to return and actually speak to the community, it would be smart to not ostracize him. The sigs are fine, but we don't all &quot;loathe&quot; Absor. Calling him names like coward and 'laky' won't get us anywhere either.</div></div><hr />

Well said, Raaj. Time to go find that message :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see it as loathing Absor.  It's just the statement is very odd considering pretty much every class board recognizes there's something wrong with how things are currently going on with the 3 plate tank classes (and in pure melee in general).  There is an imbalance there.  All these class boards can notice it, yet the official word from the official liason is &quot;there's nothing really wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
Although I think the whole quote, instead of just the last line, makes the statement the melee are trying to make a lot clearer...that the pure melee have been pushed aside and left to rot because it's simply easier to do stuff with the casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey I call them like I see them.<br />
When everyone was kissing his ass he never answered this question cause everyone tipped toed around him.<br />
<br />
Why should we not demand some straight answers?<br />
<br />
Maybe we should have a warrior strike day where we pick one day a few months in advance so the word gets out and no one play a warrior on that day.<br />
I don't know how much it would help but it sure would be funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny part is I think that Absor is right.  Yes classes are out of balance, but they really aren't that far out of balance.  They definately aren't so far out of balance that EQ isn't fun.  Also if you are listing the weakest classes in EQ right now I would say that Monks and Wizards are #1 and #2 not warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too was impressed with everyone's conduct during Absor's visit. Calling them like you see them is your choice, but it certainly isn't incentive for Absor to give you the straight answers you want.</div></div><hr />

Before we start singing Kumbaya lets all be happy and merry and nice to eachother, let's remember that it's been a long struggle to get SOE to address class situations with Warriors. <br />
<br />
As customers  we have the right to demand a certain level of support for our concerns regarding the service or product we are paying for. These concerns are not being taken seriously, and tempers are boiling. You can't blame people for getting angry, everyones fed up. <br />
<br />
Eye for an eye. If they dont have the respect to listen to what people are saying, and address problems with their product - then why do they deserve respect back?</div></div><hr />

Most of the people whom call Absor out on these things wanted to be civil in that thread on hopes he would visit more. Heck I wanted to be civil but wasnt able to post on that thread before Absor had high-tailed it out.<br />
<br />
I see truth here as , We say a lot of shit to vent frustrations because of no one seeming to listen yet given half a chance to say what we feel we can conduct ourselves in a manner befiting good decent people. <br />
<br />
Hopefully Absor will realize even tho we threaten to hogtie and hang him, Thats only cuz a lot of our pent us frustration from not being able to slaughter and commit genocide on giants etc has to come out somewhere. <br />
<br />
Anyway I hope he comes back and opens up a dialogue that isnt ruined by knights whining, or some of our more vocal ^_^ members steroid abusing rage (C'mon we all know Avatar is a steroid that we abuse) But that our more elloguent members can perhaps bring more benefit to us with a pen instead of a bloody sword.<br />

<br />
Seriously, if we were ever going to get into a dialogue with SOE, it would likely not be with Absor. He's PR, not development.</div></div><hr />

Wizards are one of the weakest classes in EQ? Been eating the wall candy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, if he did come here and post, don't think ppl would really rip him to shreds, heh who cares anyway...its just a msgboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JagdDoga</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to agree with Kaesorn.<br />
<br />
I don't hate Absor in much the same fashion as I don't hate telemarketers.  Annoying as hell to be offered newspapers and credit insurance but you can't fault someone for doing their job.  Similar with Absor.  Hate the guy as much as you like, but all he really does is play middle-man.<br />
<br />
And yeah, the whole quote does put things in a better perspective.  What it essentially seems like we are being told is that nobody wants to put in the effort for a fix because casters are easier to deal with.....and that just isn't right at all.</div></div><hr />

I thought the Warriors might like the idea as well so I passed it along to here.<br />
