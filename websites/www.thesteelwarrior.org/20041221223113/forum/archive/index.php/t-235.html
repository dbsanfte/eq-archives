<br />
this is my magelo. the ac/attack are totally wrong but the hp is correct. plans:<br />
<br />
2 bracer of benevolences<br />
draconic pauldrons<br />
Ornate Sword of the General<br />
Cloak of Maelstrom<br />
maybe work on coldain rings.<br />
boots of the storm<br />
<br />
any free ideas or cheap ones. my guild isn't in HoT yet but League of Guilds is in HoT and we are gonna try vindi twice one day. how often does vindi drop bp and boots? also maybe thinking of frostbringer. i'm broke right now but luckily enough some idiot turned in plate legs but did wrong gems so i turned in gems and got legs back so i can sell those and gain some decent pp.<br />
i'm 59 and not flagged yet so once i hit 60 gonna hit 61 then aa till i get flagged and like 3500hp unbuffed with 1200ac. Sorry about the equipment question because i know theres alot but i'm at a part where i need help from the professionals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off put in your defense and weapon skills to get the correct AC/atk values.  Mainly getting SS gear would be your best bet.  Hope for SS gaunts and sell the belt and go on a PoA raid and grab the war haste belt from there, a bunch drop.  Vindi doesn't drop boots of the storm, Tmax drops those, he drops boots of the vindicator which, at least for my guild, was his common drop, which seemed to drop about 2/3's of the time.  The BP seemed to drop 1/3 of the time for our guild and I don't remember ever seeing a ST key or earring.  Frostbringer would be good paired with either one of the cheap aggro weapons or the generals sword if you can get it but not necessary or you just FB/shadow heart would be good probably.  I don't see how you're going to sell your champs legs unless your saying you turned in the gems for the one guys and already had the unadorned greaves currently so you can MQ it or what.  Cheapest stuff I can think of would be mainly SS gear or other stuff coming from raids as you already mentioned the 2 nice easy CoV quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frostbringer/SH would be a good combo, lack of proc on SH might hurt ya later on. your plan revised: <br />
<br />
Maybe try the Eyepatch of Plunder Quest (worth all the time camping SF imo) <br />
Maybe a Bow with =/&gt; hp than the goranga, just for conveniance (but what am i talkin about.. im still usin a spectral bow :p )<br />
Clattering Bone Neck (30hp 6sta)<br />
Solstice Earring (55hp 5sta)<br />
2 bracer of benevolences <br />
draconic pauldrons (12sta)<br />
Ornate Sword of the General (35hp)<br />
Cloak of Greater Pernicity (50hp 12sta) &gt; Cloak of Maelstrom imo. <br />
Coldain Ring 8/9/10<br />
---<br />
all i can think of in this AM.. look forward to raidin with ya bro in LoG :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference is an extra 1AC 5sta and 5 less hp but at least on my server it costs a bunch more than cloak of the maelstrom and I think his budget is low so cloak of the maelstrom would probably be a better decision.  The CoV quests are your best bet though and solstice earring would be nice if every once in a while you check the bazaar on the various items, then you can usually get the package for a good price by catching good deals on the indiviual pieces.  As for if you end up getting some cash, roughbeard basically set up the main upgrades that are real good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only problem with cloak rough is about 10k more then Maelstrom.<br />

with all those upgrades i + level 60 hp gain(saying 40hp) i will have 3514.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, click my magelo in my sig for stats on boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">solstice earring is made from tailored/smithed/etc. items; not a drop.<br />
<br />
easiest to buy the parts unless you feel like doing lots of tradeskilling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt really know the price on the pernicity cloak, just knew it was good, and the 50cha can help the uglies :p Solstice Earring parts run 6-8k for all of em, talk to Gnomstinpowahs or Qizar (same person)  in Bazaar and maybe he can hook ya up with a good deal.  That sounds like a great outline for gear upgrades so far. Good Luck to ya :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thanks yeah i know gnomstin gives good deals. about how much would i save from buying all the stuff instead of buying the walk thru? i try to save as much money as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know what you mean by walk through but if you mean working up the tradeskills needed for it, no that will cost a ton more.  It takes 9 items for the solstice earring that are all tradeskill items.  Get an idea of what the average price of each piece is and then just check the bazaar occasionally for low marked pieces basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i mean like it's a quest right? guy advertises em in bazaar makes it seem that way. so if i bought all the parts would it be cheaper then just buying the whole set or more expensive?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it depends on the days prices on whether buying the 9 gifts singly or in a big shiny package. check www.eqtraders.com and look for the solstice earring quest, itll help you out with all your questions. the package should run ~5-6k on tarew latly considering deflation as it is and its a decent earring for the price, only wish we could hand it in and get the FT replaced with AoB type effect or something that stacks with other AoB type effects. but dirfs can only dream huh? :P <br />
