<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebast</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need some advice on which of my weapons to Anger Aug first.  A few levels ago, there was no question I was going to aug my CHoS first.  Lately though I've been tanking with my 2 Handers a lot.  I'm not even going to suggest aug'ing my FEA, although it is surprisingly good agro from some reason.  Guess my question is do I aug a 1 Hander or my GSoT?  and which 1 Hander would I aug?  Do I give up the FSSoY for the SoBS? Do I mainhand the SoBS and aug it?  I'm assuming sometime the lesser delay will make the SoBS a better Mainhand weapon, and the proc stuns 55+ mobs.  Or should I go with my first instinct and aug the CHoS?  Any help is appriciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FSSoY and either CHoS or SotB. Either that or you could use your GSoT. Either setup is good aggro. You have the right idea, and there basically aren't any lemons in your choices. Pick whichever looks prettiest and makes you happier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks different and it just as good as either CHoS or SotBW....Plus you don't look like a cookie cutter warrior<br />
<br />
But over all...i would Aug the GSoT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haddion</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would simply aug the GTo4W if you only have one anger aug atm.  When you have enough for two switch to the FSSOY and CHOS.  If your first raid agro weapon would be a two hander, you won't even need a second anger aug for awhile and can spent those points on ac or hp augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For practicality:  Anger3 the GSoT, you'll get more mileage out of a single proc that way and will never need to replace it till EP's or beyond<br />
<br />
For neatness:  Anger the yak and say no to cookie cutter combos.<br />
<br />
Anywho ... you'll have to choose there.  Methinks your tankabiliy would be best with the 2hander though.</div></div><hr />

I was going to aug one of the 1 Handers b/c I figured 3 procs was better than 2(GSoT).  Also, right now my DPS is more with the DW setup than the GSoT.  The two procs make up for a good bit of damage.  I do like being a bit different in having the FSSoY, but I don't want to aug it first b/c it needs to stay in the offhand (delay).  Thing is...except for ratio, the SoBS is better using the 1ac=2sta=6 hp rule and the stuns works on 55+ mobs.  As far as that rule goes, the SoBS is better than the CHoS.  LOL, I might just make it easy and go with the GSoT.  When I get a few more levels under me, my DPS with improve as the DB for it goes up.  Eh, I still need a few more EF runs before I can actually buy the aug...maybe I'll have decided by then :).</div></div><hr />

Since you're going with duel wield sell the CHoS and use SoTBS + anger with yak offhand.</div></div><hr />

That's what I've been leaning toward.  Probalby what I'll do...bye, bye 179 proc :(.</div></div><hr />

Btw when I had SotB with Anger II and the CHOS with the 100 DD yak proc from Guk,<br />
<br />
I always mainhanded the CHOS. Nothing scientific, it just FELT much better :)<br />

Been looking at the numbers...GSoT only out DPS's my DW somewhere around level 62.  So until then I'm going to stick with the DW for tanking purposes.  Also, the CHoS vs the SoBS in mainhand the CHoS wins when you include the proc and its an even tie without the procs.  So...guess it doesn't really matter which I aug first given the ease of moving augs around now.  I'll probably leave the CHoS in mainhand for now and aug it with Anger and keep the FSSoY in offhand.  Maybe something better with come out in OoW :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weidar</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi im new here, and has just begun playin my war again after 7 months vacation.<br />
<br />
I anger augd my GSoT the other day but i feel like agroholding could be better.<br />
Should i un-aug it buy another anger3 aug and put them on 2 1Hand weapons instead? <br />
<br />
If so what weapons? i could afford CHoS, SoTBs, Velium gemmed sword, have 40k in bank, but dont wanna waste to much on new weapons, btw i already have one velium gemmed longsword. <br />
<br />
If i go dual wielding with anger3 augs, ill probably buy the Velium gemmed greatsword (2HS) for DPS.<br />
<br />
Or am i just picky? Felt like i could hold agro better back in the day so to speak :)<br />
My aa:s are as follows runspeed3, regen3, ND3, CS3 and CA1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been hearing lately that either of the yak augs (100dd or 125dd) are better aggro than even Anger 3. I'm otw to the BB merchant right now to get the 100dd to replace A Anger 2 on my GSoT, and it doesn't seem worth it to spend 250 more points to get another 25 dd on the proc so I'm not going to waste points on that.<br />
<br />
edit: bah, forgot yak augs were in guk.. and I only have 284 pts there :(</div></div><hr />
