<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gotten 6 arms and 1 bracer (warrior) now that all six of my guys are warmly (server wide first warmly X 6?) and its not difficult to kill the mobs that drop the items for the various OoW tier 1 armor quests:<br />
<br />
Here is the Plate Quest<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2988<br />
<br />
But the hard part as many of you are aware is getting the faction you have to kill hundreds if not thousands of mobs.<br />
<br />
But Wizards is lucky we can pbaoe. And warriors can get into a pbaoe group by shakerpaging, naturally doing like 10-20 mobs isnt going to make you to valuable but maybe if you have a bard puller you can do more... Sides its not like you even need be in the group, just shakerpage and do one round of damage and you get faction even if the other group kills the mobs.<br />
<br />
The best spot I have found is in DS near the Nobals enterence. <br />
<br />
There is like a castle wall and way up high on it is tons of Kyvv archers, all of which are low level and give positive loyalist faction. <br />
<br />
I like to set up in the hallway with the chanter at the far end and wizards toward the pull on either side. The puller then goes just a bit past the chanter and stops and the chanter will freez them inbetween the wizards who tear them up. You can do 10-20 easy depending on your level and spells. I used winds of G and one jyllys, didnt even need the new spells. The chanter is best if he has the new color stun spell but the LDON one will also work. Its kinda dicy if he only has the level 52 minus color series but still doable.<br />
<br />
The warrior can pull, mobs hitting you fro low damage dont mean much.<br />
<br />
From what I observe you dont get more faction for killing higher level mobs (anyone think different?) so low level mobs is fine. You wont get items or exp of any worth but if yur after faction this is the way to do it!<br />
<br />
Im not sure but seems you could set up a raid and have like 12 people and all get faction, not sure on that though, also people who are out of the group who do damage also get faction I belive. Kinda hard to pin it all down. Also these mobs are like light blue to 70 so you get some minor exp, but for sure you get faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction in Dranik scar off low level mobs seems the same as high mobs in MPG or Ruins of Dranik city. It's just in the higher zones you get more xp and a lot less faction hits. Considering you need some 2000+ faction hits and an xp group might do 20 faction hits an hour(several ferans perhaps or whatever thrown in for xp only) it does take forever in the higher zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sam, is there a good spot in DS to train lowbie mobs and beat them to death? I dont have an earthshaker but i do have a 66 druid for heals/ds/ae's etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Findra</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been soloing during downtimes, and I'm not really set up for it so if you are in any way (druid bot, lifetap aug, bind wounds, etc.) you'll have better success than I.<br />
<br />
Just sniping pulls from the wanderers in the large &quot;field&quot; I can kill ~25-30 per hour, which is better faction than just about any XP camp you can find.  That's with only self buffs.  Throw in a regen or a haste and it goes up to ~40-50 pretty quick.  I'm tempted to buy a lifetap aug just so I could kill those guys without having to take a regen break every so often.<br />
<br />
If you're going to solo/duo them, I recommend staying away from the castles at the NC and BF zonelines.  The mobs in the field have ~6K hp, the ones by the castles can get as high as 10K.<br />
<br />
Yes, I realize that if you do the math that's still something like 40 hours of solid solo factioning, but it is something you can do while LFG, waiting for a raid call, etc. and still make decent progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was part of a guild faction group there a couple days ago, and the mobs are easy as pie.  No cleric (hell, had a pair of paladins as main healers for most of the time) and chanter wasn't slowing at all.  Not a whole lot of XP (2/3 of an AA in about an hour and a half) because there were a lot of LBs and greenies (at 65), but the faction was definitely worth it.  I got a long ways to go before I'll see any of this nice stuff, but if you wanna get faction and get it fast, this is the place to do it.  Just have someone chain pulling and let everyone else beat the snot out of whatever comes home.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost didn't reply after the exploit comment.<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=388<br />
<br />
You're looking for:<br />
1. a feran skull (npc in WoS)<br />
2. kyv heart (npc in DS)<br />
3. seeping murkglider fluid (npc in NC)<br />
4. a stolen dragorn clan insignia (npc in WoS)<br />
<br />
For the feran skull the turn in mob has KOS dragorn near him - you'll need help clearing to do the turn in safely.  All others you can invis to and have no mobs around them.  The faction hits are not that big.  I'm estimating somewhere in the 20-50 range, where any one mob gives you 1.</div></div><hr />
