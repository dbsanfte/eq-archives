<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings.  New to this forum and New to the warrior class.  I've gotten my warrior up to 50 now.  I have a question about the weapon choices available to me.  Wondering if any of the more experienced warriors can help me make a decision about this.  Without spending money (trust me I will upgrade asap) I'm wondering which weapons at my disposal will generate the most DPS.  I'm a lvl 50 troll warrior wearing mostly crusty armor, so my str is above 200 (if that matters) and I got plenty of stamina.  Here's the weapons I've available today.<br />
<br />
Wurmslayer  25/40  (primary only, 1hs)<br />
Defiance 9/19 (primary or secondary, 1hs)<br />
Some axe which does 11/24 (primary or secondary 1hs)<br />
some dagger I picked up 5/16 (trash I know, but it's fast)<br />
<br />
I've noticed that I generate the most aggro with the defiance / axe combo or the defiance / dagger combo.  Doesn't make sense to me because I don't see how I could be doing as much damage with those combinations as I can do with my wurmy / defiance.<br />
<br />
With the weapons listed above, what would be my best choice for DPS?<br />
<br />
Thanks muchly for helpin a newbie!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kozakou</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your probally getting more aggro from your lammy / axe combo because the dly is low... where as wurmy is 40dly. the dly can help with aggro aswell... not just the dmg done. And Kendolekk is right.. you should try save up for a frostbringer (not sure how much they go for these days... but i think they'd be roughly bout 7k). use frosty and lammy combo then you should be set for a couple of levels :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">then that's where it's gonna go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just figured out where the confusion lies.  I'm not really concerned with aggro for this particular question, and by saying &quot;quick weapon question&quot; I meant a quick question about my weapons, not a question about quick weapons (lol!)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the responses.  Yes, I'm saving up for my frostbringer.  But, until I get the cash, which combo do you think will produce the most DPS?<br />
<br />
I do a lot of duoing with my wife's cleric, and I dont really have problems holding agro off of her (she's a good cleric) with any combination of weapons so long as it's just she and I.  So, I'm wondering which combination out of the possible options in my current inventory would kill the mob the fastest on average.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
By 50, your primary hand damage bonus has increased to a level where the faster Defiance is laying it on often enough to compensate and outdamage the slower Wurmy.<br />
<br />
Wurmy would be a great offhand weapon though.............. if only you could use it there</div></div><hr />
