<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, i noticed alot of different posts this weapon vs that weapon and DW vs 2h and blah blah blah. <br />
cutting to the chase, i was looking for sort of a chart of how all these weapons rate against each others as well as the lesser known weapons. reason? currently my guild is advancing and as much as we'd all love to run around with duel EB, realistically, the mobs that drop EB weapons are on high demand by close to every guild on any server capable of taking them down. we've taken AoW at least twice but saddly he's only coughed up 1 BoC likewise with our numerous trips to cursed only to have 1 BF, and XtC, who we've taken more times than i can remember, is always so disapointing when you finaly get there to see him holding a baton, or a bonechiller.<br />
i was hoping for just about everything from velious to tier 3 PoP with stats reasonable for a lvl 65 warrior, but we might as well throw up everything for everyone, perferbally with stats, weather some one is working on their epic, or battling elemental gods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">forgot to mention, i was hoping for people to post their personal opinions from actual experiance with the weapons, but i guess everyone's opinion is ok, since everyone's will be different. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Atilette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is that what you are looking for ? (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=683)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pretty much, but where as those are grouped by weapon type, i was looking for a grouping by agroing abilities, or at least  first hand accounts of how well they held agro. i was also looking to drag out some of the lesser known weapons. i think the list looks a little short,  i know there are more weapons. i remember the first few weeks of pop there were warriors running around with the rotting fist, and Sot4W didnt seem to make it on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That are the weapons with the best aggro potential in game and are listet from the best aggro to the lowest aggro. <br />
<br />
Outside of this there  are lots of weapons but their potential for aggrogeneration are not so good.<br />
<br />
Rotting fist has a Dot proc ( not so the real aggro thing ) nice for offhand but nothing real for mainhand.<br />
<br />
GSot4W is a beautiful weapon. Dishes out lots of damage. Procs real nice rare resistet, but you will only hold aggro with it when your offensive AAs are nearly maxed. I use it as a non aggro damaging weapon when I am nontanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great Blade of Storms is a nice agro weapon that is easy to get.  At 14/18 with stun + DD proc I'd rank it above almost all weapons except EB weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EB is overrated. Kickass, but overrated.<br />
<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled is HIGHLY underrated and an easy kill for anyone in Ssra. Just not that common. It's my huggy little aggro machine. I love it when she procs 3-4 times in a row... which is common at 305 dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah the BBotE is a real procing mashine, but with 17 delay its not the real choice in some Pop zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GSot4W is a phenominal DPS agro weapon.  I usually get 5-10 seconds of whacking on a mob before my guild finishes up the previous mobs and works on mine.  Since you're not relying on procs, the agro is consistant and highly effective.  I notice FAR less agro bouncing between me and a fellow warrior who uses a CHSD+GBoS.  The flip side is, the longer the battle, the less effective at keeping agro the GSot4W seems to become because eventually other guildies will catch up to you in damage output.  The weapon is great for exping and trash clearing due to the short duration of the fights, but I only find it to be decent at best for boss tanking.  <br />
<br />
Still, I wouldn't give it up if my poor little halfling life depended on it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">we are 1:20ish on BBoTE lol<br />
<br />
its not that easy to get - if you blow Cursed you'll feel silly =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, my experience of aggro weapons went something like this:<br />
<br />
frostbringer<br />
wavecrasher<br />
red epic<br />
willsapper<br />
cord hilted spiked driver<br />
<br />
Then PoP came out. . .had to switch to 2h.<br />
<br />
Windblade<br />
Greater Poleaxe of Sorrow (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25849) <br />
Obsidian Greatblade (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25997)<br />
<br />
If you don't have sol ro tower access, then by all means, go for greatstaff of 4 winds, it's the next best thing for aggro imho, and it will serve well as a dps weapon later.  Greatstaff of thunder is next best to that imho.  It's a shame they made it so common so that it's value is obscured.<br />
<br />
If for some reason you want 1h weapons, cordhilted spiked drivers are pretty easy to get from dragon in PoI.  Not as good as BoC, but better than SoD, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunately the list is pretty complete. About the only weapons left out are the Troll remanufactured Yaks.<br />
<br />
The best &quot;entry level&quot; aggro weapons are probably Copper Hammer of Striking, Great Blade of Storms and Greatstaff of Thunder. If these aren't available the Troll remanufactured Yaks can be substituted. Blade of Strategy can be used in zones where it isn't resisted. Cord Hilted Spike Driver is probably the easiest to obtain step up.<br />
<br />
Since I'm at the next stage with aggro weapons, I'm going to provide my experiances -<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with my CHoS at level 65. I use it with a BoC instead of Blade of Strategy, Ichorflow, and Trident of the Deep Sea which I also have.<br />
<br />
I use the Acrylia Handled Broadsword and Jalen's Katana when I'm fooling around with green/light blue mobs or soloing to kill time - they are not aggro weapons IMO.<br />
<br />
I like Gaudralek a lot. It is my only 2H aggro weapon. In PoP I take a lot less damage with a 2Hdr. While I've been in many groups that believed it held aggro much better than my 1Hdr set up, fellow guild Warriors believe the opposite is true. I've tried a Furious Bash shield and have not been happy with it.<br />
<br />
If there's a lot of competition for aggro weapons you'll just have to be patient.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1h and *easily farmable*<br />
great blade of storms - BoT tower boss, 6 hour respawn or something.<br />
CHSD - poi dragon, up everyday too<br />
BoC - we normally get at least 1 if not 2 per kill, keep watching for him, hes 4day + 4ish hour repop.<br />
<br />
<br />
ppl mentioned a few good 2h up there, not sure which ones are easily farmable though. GSoT is cheap in bazaar from what ppl say. i used a norgtal for long time, but its not real common off HP either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Up untill last night I used the 2HS Epic.  I purchased a GSoT for 850p to try it out.  <br />
<br />
In veksar with the JBOW if my Necro slowed right away he would get summoned, which isnt a big deal he can just FD it off.  But last night with the GSoT he could slow immediatly and wouldnt get summoned.<br />
<br />
I know its not scientific and only a few hours in one camp but im sold on the GSoT over JBoW.  A 850p weapon with better DPS and Agro than my epic makes me /cry.</div></div><hr />
