<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to find a solution to help agro generation.<br />
Some solution that will not be overpowered, and will not<br />
give us paladin/sk lock down, just a lot of initial agro.<br />
Because thats what most warriors need. 5-15 seconds of soloing the mob.<br />
<br />
I think i have found it : The Initial Agro Multiplicator <br />
<br />
Its based on 2 simple ideas :<br />
- When a mob is alone, its agro/hate list is EMPTY<br />
- When you take a hostile action towards that mob you ENTER that list<br />
<br />
Once that is said, the solution becomes obvious.<br />
<br />
Multiply by a specific (or semi-random) number the Agro value<br />
of the hostile action that puts the warrior in the hate list. <br />
<br />
That number should be between 10 and 20.<br />
<br />
What will that do ? <br />
Very simply it will give us great snap agro, or i should really say initial fight agro.<br />
All raiding warriors will agree that a 5-10 second head start<br />
assures very good agro lockdown.<br />
The Initial Agro Multiplicator gives an Virtual / Innate 5-10 second<br />
head start on every single mob that agroes a warrior.<br />
<br />
Simulation : <br />
- Monk pulls a mob (so only the monk is on the agro list)<br />
- Warrior either bow tags or melees the mob <br />
(thus entering for the the agro/hate list)<br />
- the bow tag or 1st melee hit, does 30 dmg for X hate points<br />
- Initial Agro Multiplicator kicks in<br />
- the warrior is awarded 10-20 * X agro points as bonus<br />
- the warrior now has insane initial agro rivaling a PAL/SK<br />
- the warrior 2st hit does 60dmg to the mob for 2X hate points<br />
(thus his 2nd entry in the agro/hate list)<br />
- Initial Agro Multiplicator will NOT kick in ANYMORE,<br />
 because the warrior is already on the agro/hate list.<br />
<br />
What will this do ? In essence the mob will hate the warrior as<br />
if he had hit it for 300 to 600 dmg (depending on the random generator)<br />
<br />
Over the course of the fight, keeping the agro will remain just as hard.<br />
Exept we now get a 5-15 second  &quot;virtual head start&quot; <br />
On every single mob we agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
 PROS : <br />
- Will give warriors what they really need : great initial agro <br />
- Will not give warriors the snap agro of a pal/sk (still hard to regain)<br />
- Will not break the game trivialising agro control<br />
- Will not affect raiding agro, because in raids we are already<br />
given those  5-10 seconds head start.  <br />
- Reducing a boss fight by 5-10 seconds at most <br />
(since head start wont be needed) will not affect the triviality of the fight.<br />
-  Very very very very Easy to code <br />
IF the person entering the hate list is a warrior THEN multiply the<br />
agro factor of that action by 10-20 ELSE multiply the agro factor by 1<br />
<br />
<br />
 CONS : <br />
- If Proximity agro (beeing seen by the mob) is coded the same<br />
way as Action agro (taking a hostile action) this will make<br />
warriors mob magnet (like wearing a &quot;HIT ME&quot; sign on the back)<br />
<br />
So it has to be coded to work for &quot;hostile actions&quot; and not &quot;proximity visual agro&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The Initial Agro Multiplicator seems to me the best and simplest solution that has been proposed so far.<br />
<br />
It will give Warriors Virtual / Innate INITIAL AGRO <br />
bonus that will rival or even surpass pal/sk without competing <br />
on the long run Or trivialise agro control in raids.<br />
<br />
Any Comments ?<br />
<br />
PS : If this has already been proposed then i'd like to give credits<br />
to the original author and apologise, but i dont remember ever<br />
 seeing a proposition like this one.</div></div><hr />

the wizard could then manaburn and the necro could lifeburn without agro, even if the random number was only 30.<br />
Even a single average hit from a windblade would make this solution overpowered and it would pretty much kill bows for warriors and also kill rangers as pullers with bows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It needs to be something that can be used as required. Some sort of inate skill with a hate modifier built into it, with a decent refresh timer on it to stop warriors abusing it.<br />
<br />
AA skills doesnt seem right either, warriors need this skill from 40 onwards.</div></div><hr />

unlimmited charges or give that stun on some warr only Items.<br />

Don't think that sony will do this neither make some bigger programmings for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It only works for the FIRST hostile action.<br />
<br />
Remember a miss generates agro too, and you miss 40% of the time.<br />
So 40% of the time you'll get the bonus from the minuscule agro a miss generates.<br />
<br />
As for a windblade hit i agree, but thats luck.<br />
(You could get Flurry + Triple critic too)<br />
<br />
I got a BoW, and know a 528 x 30 agro will make me god.<br />
Thats 15k dmg agro in less than 1 second. Overpowered agreed<br />
<br />
Lets take ...  200 which is my average hit... <br />
10-15 factor would be more reasonable.<br />
<br />
So mob inc :<br />
I miss, i get miss agro (small) , + Miss agro x10-15 (small) thats 40% of the time<br />
<br />
I hit for 200, i get hit agro (200dmg), + 200 x10-15 (bonus) thats 60% of the time<br />
<br />
My 1st hit (if its a miss) will give me almost no agro bonus<br />
My 1st hit (if its a 200) will give me 2000-3000 worth of damage agro<br />
<br />
At 150dps , 2000-3000 dmg worth of agro if my 1st slash is sucessfull<br />
is about the agro i would generate with a 10-20 second head start.<br />
<br />
Remember Virtual 10-20 second head start that will only work 60% of the time.<br />
(Miss agro is minuscule)<br />
<br />
10-15 is more realistic, 30-100 was absolutely insane.<br />
(doing correction as we speak)<br />
<br />
Or you could recode  The Initial Agro Multiplicator bonus <br />
To multiply by 10 the agro generated by the first successfull hit.<br />
Would be awesome and very reliable.<br />
<br />
That would be even more reliable, but mayber harder to code.<br />
<br />
Even a single average hit from a windblade would make this solution overpowered and it would pretty much kill bows for warriors and also kill rangers as pullers with bows. <br />
<br />
Why kill rangers ? <br />
The Initial Agro Multiplicator  Only works once, and<br />
that is when the warrior FIRST enters the agro list<br />
<br />
How often do u critic with the windblade ?<br />
How often do you swing with the windblade ?<br />
<br />
You could miss (almost no agro)<br />
You could hit (Hit agro bonus x10)<br />
You could critic (Critic agro bonus x10)<br />
You could max critic (Max critic agro bonus x10)<br />
<br />
Its based on a random number generator.<br />
You need to look at the overall results not the &quot;best possible scenario&quot;<br />
<br />
(Fixed the RNG in post, which was supposed to be random number generator and not ranger) <br />
<br />
As for warriors pulling... well i never pull unless i tank (xp) or tag (raid)<br />
<br />
If i pull for another warrior, well he'll get The Initial Agro Multiplicator bonus too.<br />
<br />
If i pull for a hybrid ... well his agro is godly anyway<br />
The Initial Agro Multiplicator bonus wont affect him<br />
<br />
I agree initial agro is lacking, but what happens when a warrior doesnt want aggro?. If assisting the warrior/s would be top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed, you can not not want agro.<br />
<br />
1) If the person you worry about stealing agro from is a warrior<br />
then you dont have to worry. They benefit from the bonus too remember ?<br />
<br />
2) If the person you worry about stealing agro from is a hybrid ...<br />
Well guess what ? <br />
You dont have to worry they already have insane agro</div></div><hr />

<br />
 The Initial Agro Multiplicator Bonus <br />
<br />
Multiply by 10 the agro generated by the first successfull hit.<br />
(Warrior only)<br />
<br />
Could be a 1 point AA, Or an innate skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, our RP tank usually shot a few arrows at the mob on incoming to get on the hate list, but he does not want the agro.<br />
<br />
I can also think of several situations where our MT needed to switch target and the have a non-warrior to offtank the old target, because some special mob added.<br />
In those situations it would not be good to have the old mob hit the MT for a long period because he got a huge headstart on agro.<br />
<br />
I do actually not like the idea of the huge agro at the start of the fight.<br />
I like the way the warrior agro works now.<br />
I think the problem is the knights ability to generate huge agro at fight start and thereby allowing all others to turn off the brain.<br />
I prefer to add randomness to spells, so a knight can not be 100% sure that a mob is agro locked with a certain number of casts, unless its a considerable amount.<br />
If a pally currently has to cast 2 stuns to make sure the agro is locked, then a randomness addition to spell agro could increase this to 4.<br />
The pally could then either choose to cast 4 spells, which take a few secs extra and might require the pally to med now and then, or he could choose to cast 2 stuns as before and risk a few pingpongs now and then.<br />

<br />
Many good soloutions have been offered.<br />
<br />
Many good soloutions will be ignored.<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, No one left at SoE really knows how aggro works, and what they can and cannot do to fix the current situation. Aggro is like bards only much more complicated. change one variable and dozens or hundreds of problems exist. <br />
<br />
Heal / Slow Aggro when PoP came out is an example. <br />
<br />
Now adjust the warrior baseline aggro from damage and who knows what happens</div></div><hr />
