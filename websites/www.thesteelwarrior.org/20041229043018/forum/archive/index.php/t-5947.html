Can someone say definitively if weapon delay caps at 10 and how exactly haste is calculated. It makes a difference in what weapons I want to wield.<br />

Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no &quot;minimum weapon delay&quot;.  The effective delay of your weapon is delay/(1 + haste_percentage_as_a_decimal).  So if you are 41% hasted, with a 22-delay weapon, the effective delay is 22/(1+.41), or 22/1.41, or 15.6, which I believe (but am not certain) rounds up to 16.<br />
<br />
Basically, you can ignore haste when comparing weapons.  It scales linearly without regard to absolute damage, delay, or ratio.  The same weapon combination that is best at 0% haste is still best at 100% haste.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
The myth about a minimum weapon delay comes from parses inaccurately calculating weapon speed due to the log file time stamps being in 1 second intervals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I grabbed one when it was unwanted by anyone else when our guild did cursed a few months back...threw a ykesha proc in it.<br />
<br />
It's a great offhander - still waiting for BoC/BF/HG/GBoS, but until then my current set-up works a treat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone worked out if delay is rounded after haste is applied?<br />
<br />
Eg.  Assuming 100% haste, is there an advantage to using a 15/19 weapon over a 15/20 weapon?</div></div><hr />

i wouldn't quite say that i mean if u have 40% (cause it's 2/5 of 100 exactly) and theres a 14/20 weapon vs a 17/25 the haste could matter a difference. I might just be fooling myself</div></div><hr />

Actually, I don't believe it rounds.  I used to believe this was a huge detriment to the 5% overhaste from primal guard and odd delayed weapons.<br />
<br />
However, I was parsing to see if my 20 delay weapona nd 19 delay weapon stayed in synch with each other at 100% haste.  As far as I could tell they did not stay in synch.  After 20 seconds the hits were reversed.  ie I crushed before I punched while before I punched before I crushed.  It was pretty hard to tell exaclty the interval at which they overlapped, but they for certain did not stay in synch with each other.</div></div><hr />

I might just be fooling myself  Haste never ever ever ever ever makes a worse weapon better when applying the same amounts of haste. Haste absolutely scales linearly, you can go parse and prove it yourself. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way -<br />
<br />
If A &gt; B then A+40% &gt; B+40%<br />
<br />
This is always true no matter how hard you try to say otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and even you get the same ratio the applied db still makes the faster weapon better. to a certian point like if the 17/25 was 17/24 the ratio would be the same as 14/20 but you still get 10ish extra attack rounds in a 60 second fight. giving you +130ish damage just in db if you hit. <br />
<br />
i tried to say that and failed, but if you did a per fight parase the 2 weapons would over lap alot random misses and hits putting #'s allover the place. if you did a hour or two on the banker or whatever you would see the difference.</div></div><hr />
