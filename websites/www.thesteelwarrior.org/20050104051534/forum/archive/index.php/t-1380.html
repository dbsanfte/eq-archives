<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baarell</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just recently started a warrior too help cure some of the bordeom i've recently been having playing EQ. I've always played a caster and am quite ignornant concerning some issues with the gear I have chosen. Your MB doesn't appear to have a newbie section and searching wasn't very productive either. Please excuse my ignorance :<br />
<br />
First my gear: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=721267<br />
<br />
Question 1:<br />
I bought the 1 hs weapons solely based on the stats they gave my warrior. Should I replace 1(or both) with weapons that have a proc?<br />
<br />
Question 2:<br />
The Hammered Golden Hoop has -15 AC. Is this a problem? On my necro main hp's are king. Is it true for warriors also? Un-equipping the earring gives me much more then 15 AC in return. Should I replace the earring?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time</div></div><hr />

(Not to discourage you in any way....:D )<br />
<br />
1. You're 36, so a few weapons should start proc'ing(sic?) for you...I recommened Honed Blades of the Ykesha....I can't stop singing the praises for how well they holds aggro.<br />
<br />
2. 15 AC won't make much of a  difference in the end game. The hp on the other hand, will. Just remember that STA can be maxed, but HP can't =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here be my suggestions.  Your weapons are more than adaquate.<br />
<br />
Neck = Clattering Bone Necklace.<br />
Waist = Runebranded Girdle<br />
Range = Goranga Idol or Idol of the Thorned (easily obtainable with a necro, both are easy camps to solo, did it with a wizzy, so you should have no probs with a necro)<br />
Fingers = Fire Velium Wedding rings (Valorium rings when you get high enough)<br />
<br />
Everything else Fierce Heraldic.<br />
<br />
and you should be set for a long time</div></div><hr />
