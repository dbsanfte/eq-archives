<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so a guildie of mine made improved dodge II aug(8sv magic base)...lucy says its 20% better dodge...<br />
<br />
it fits in teh same slots as teh 10ac ldon aug. would this be a viabale option to equip instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">good question.<br />
<br />
I'm also curious how it was made.  The list of available augs on eqtraders is sooooo loooooong.  :P  bleh.  <br />
<br />
I have a couple of voidflow stones (resist magic i think) and a kyanite (hit points) that are used as raw components for the augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The path to making them is a long and difficult one.  I was talking to a hardcore tradeskiller in my guild who is 250 Jewelcrafting and 250 poison.  The first step is to make the augment into something better:<br />
<br />
Augment + Gem Cutter + &quot;Other random storebought component (50pp)&quot; = Finely Cut Augment.... or something along those lines.  <br />
<br />
These alone are very good, the Kyanite turns into a 45hp aug and worth it's the effort right there, but it has a extremely high trivial, 3** something just to make it with Jewelcrafting.  At this point you can go many directions, you can add haste, cleave, strikethrough, stun resist, dodge, and a few others.... but it takes two more steps also with very high trivials and very high chance of losing it all.  These last two steps can only be done by rogues with poisonmaking skills.  If you yourself don't have the skills to do the first step  ask someone to do it for you, because a 45hp aug &gt;&gt;&gt; 10hp aug.  And if you fail at the first step, no big deal.  10hp won't carry you that far anyway.  But if you don't have the skills, try and find someone with the new OoW AA's to do it for you, so they can possibly salvage some of the parts if they fail.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is kinda scatterbrained, I'm at work right now and my boss could glance over my shoulder at any moment!  Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I have read, the last two steps can be done either with PoisonMaking or Alchemy. There's a lot more GM Alchemists than GM PoisonMakers out there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My impression is that it's going to take tradeskillers a while to work some of this out, not just to do the combines, but to figure out which are the best to do. Many I know are working on &quot;salvage&quot; AA, because obviously losing everything is, well, not the optimal outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, I only have 1 kyanite right now so I'll probably just hang onto it until someone I know has salvage and I make sure it's someone with JC AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks, I only have 1 kyanite right now so I'll probably just hang onto it until someone I know has salvage and I make sure it's someone with JC AAs.<br />
<br />
If you can, pick up a couple more of them too.  They are going for around 1-3k in the bazaar on my server now, but just because most people don't know what they do.   I would tell you to pick up a few more than 3, but they can only go in three different slots.  For my money, it doesn't get much better than 135hp for less than 10k.  Go for all you can get..... and if you're feeling brave try to get some haste or one of the other focus effects on them, but remember the trivial is so high you can lose all of it in one try.  Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where'd the kyanite drop for you?  Heard it's all just pretty random but got a regular loot + spellshield 1% aug to mod off named in riftseeker's so thought maybe named drop them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, here's what I've learned about these augs.<br />
<br />
There are 21 dropped augs in OoW that are Attunable.  They start out with certain stats, and can be upgraded to one of three levels by a character with high jewelcraft.  <br />
<br />
Levels go from Base -&gt; Polished -&gt; Brilliant Cut -&gt; Radiant Cut.  A stat aug will go 4/6/8/12, respectively.  Ability augs tend to go 1/1/2/3 (Polished doesn't do anything, it seems), with DS aug going 2/2/4/6.<br />
<br />
Then you can have a Shaman or a Rogue use their class ability (Alchemy or Poisonmaking) to add a Minor effect to it using Marks (bought from vendors).  They can then upgrade those minor effects to either Medium effects or Pure effects.  These special effects comprise of both Caster Foci and Melee Foci.<br />
<br />
The higher the level, the higher the trivial for the combine (more difficult).<br />
<br />
Also, stat augs can only be placed on FACE, WAIST, BACK, NECK, SHOULDERS.  HP can only be put on HANDS, ARMS, FEET.  Mana/Endurance can only be put on HEAD, WRIST, RANGE.  Ability augs only fit in one spot, and it depends on the aug.<br />
<br />
All augs are type 7 and 8.<br />
<br />
The base gems are as follows:<br />
<br />
Bloodflow- Strength<br />
Mudflow - Stamina<br />
Waterflow - Dexterity<br />
Fireflow - Agility<br />
Starflow - Intelligence<br />
Boneflow - Wisdom<br />
Skyflow - Charisma<br />
<br />
Emberflow - Fire Resist<br />
Stormflow - Cold Resist<br />
Voidflow - Magic Resist<br />
Mossflow - Disease<br />
Shadowflow - Poison<br />
<br />
Kyanite - HP<br />
Sodalite - Mana/Endurance<br />
<br />
Titanite - Regeneration - CHEST<br />
Tourmaline - Mana Regeneration - HEAD<br />
Sphalerite - DoT Shielding - BACK<br />
Apatite - Stun Resist - NECK<br />
Citrine - Damage Shield - SHOULDERS<br />
Howlite - Strikethrough - FACE<br />
Celestine - Spellshield - WAIST<br />
<br />
Effects:<br />
<br />
Melee:<br />
<br />
Mark of Ferocity - Ferocity Focus<br />
Mark of Dexterity - Dodge Focus<br />
Mark of Haste - Haste<br />
Mark of Battle - Attack<br />
Mark of Sundering - Cleave Focus<br />
<br />
Caster:<br />
Mark of Aggression - Improved Damage Focus<br />
Mark of Alacrity - Enhancement Haste Focus<br />
Mark of Celerity - Affliction Haste Focus<br />
Mark of Efficiency - Mana Preservation Focus<br />
Mark of Extension - Extended Enhancement Focus<br />
Mark of Healing - Improved Healing Focus<br />
Mark of Potency - Affliction Efficiency Focus<br />
Mark of Quickening - Spell Haste Focus<br />
Mark of Sight - Vision Effect<br />
Mark of Virility - Burning Affliction Focus<br />
<br />
You can end up with augments that give 45hp and Ferocity III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=75334) or Strikethrough 3% and Cleave III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=74774).<br />
<br />
Pretty useful, IMO.  There's a downside on that except for Regeneration, a warrior cannot get any of the special abilites without losing a slot for a 10ac aug.  Lack of AC augs or Shielding kinda make it lack effect...but the ability to gain Dodge/Ferocity/Cleave is pretty nice, as well as the 45hp augs.<br />
<br />
Note: I left out the information on the actual combines other than the main items.  On both cutting the gems or adding marks, you have to use 1-3 other items as well.<br />
<br />
Edit:  To remove the augs later, you must use a Class ** Augmentation Distiller that's appropriate to the level of the Gem:<br />
<br />
Base - Class I<br />
Polished - Class II<br />
Brilliant - Class III<br />
Radiant - Class IV</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoS.  I've killed a ton of mobs in wos though and only seen one.  I forget what mob it was on, but I assume it was a named.  I've seen 2 or 3 voidflow stones drop there and a couple others like sv cold or something.  I couldn't tell you how random it is.  The multiple voidflow stones could be coincidence, or it could be that certain zones or sets of mobs only drop certain augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow, and not being lore, those are some pretty amazing items.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I was only able to find this one (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=74407) on Lucy with haste; I assume 40% is the highest level of haste for these Augs?  Very nice, but just curious.<br />
<br />
Also, this probably doesn't belong here but I'll slip it in - Anyone know whether Cleave/Ferocity/Etc. type ability-effects stack with each other, or does your highest level ability cancel out the others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah 40% is the max.  Yeah most of them go into a 10AC aug slot but the best one I'm probably gonna try for is a 45hp improved dodge 3 aug for my gaunts.  Also can swap ldon 40's for 45hp ones just so you can get the other effects like fero/cleave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I were a warrior, the results I'd be shooting for is 3 separate Radiant Kyanite.  One with Cleave for gauntlets, one with Ferocity for arms, and one with Dodge for boots.  (Seems to fit best there...:D)<br />
<br />
If you really need haste...grab a mana/endurance aug, put haste on it, stick it into wrist or range or something.<br />
<br />
This is awesome twink fodder if you got the money  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Most of the stuff is fairly expensive, though, and rare components are a pain : /  A friend of mine was with a guild group and some Discordant Scoraie (sp?) dropped.  Cleric looted and destroyed it 0.o!  Augs seem to drop from almost anywhere in &quot;standard&quot; OoW zones.  I doubt you'd see too much in the lower end of stuff, like bloodfields or dranik's scar, but even in NC, WoS, Hollows, RCoD, etc, you should be hoping the RNG are kind to you with drops.  On one of my first treks into hollows, I think we got 2 or 3 augs.  A +CR, +FR, and DS.  Since then, I've hardly seen any.  Somebody linked me some spellshield, shielding, and strikethrough aug that he got from the same camp I'd been in the past few days and had nothing drop.  Goes without saying, but make sure that you're having the &quot;best&quot; people making these for you.  Make sure they've got the mastery aa and salvage and all that stuff.  Losing rare tradeskill items makes baby jesus cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This falls on borderline lying and is definately a bit deceptive..... but I do it from time to time when I need something either for myself or for a guildmate.<br />
<br />
If a component drops that I have been looking for and someone else loots it, I can usually ask politely and get it.  But 1/2 of the time I get the ever-inquisitive person that wants to know &quot;What's it for&quot; before he forks it over.  9/10 times these people aren't interested in using it themselves, or giving it to a friend, they want to make a quick buck by gouging someone else in the bazaar for it.  At times this can actually work to your advantage, but other times they can start to get on your nerves.  Just try and play it down as not being that important.... and as soon as they find out you don't care that much they usually give it to you.<br />
<br />
The other day I was in a group when a Kyanite dropped (10hp that turns into 45hp).  The other melees in the group said that it sucked, and I agreed and proceeded to say that I need all the HP that I could get.  Without another thought they handed it over.  You can usually pull that off with the saves augs, but when it gets to the Stat ones and the Regen/FT ones........ people generally want to roll on them for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
Just stay sharp, and take advantage of your less knowledgable players that think these augs suck.  They are far from sucking.</div></div><hr />
