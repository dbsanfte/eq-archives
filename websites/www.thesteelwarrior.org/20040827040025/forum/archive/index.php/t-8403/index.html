<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>budtron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello was just wondering if anybody here that plays it would be able to answer me a few Q's.  first,  i used to play awhile ago, about 3 or so years and left in favor of EQ, i just played a demo of it with no expansion and even though it was only a short time playing, i realized its a freakin awesome game and i wanna start up again, i need to know if after all this time, can i still re-new my account? and i fso what information would i need to do this? also, any idea how much the cost is nowadays? when i got it i bought diablo 2 for about 30, then got the expansion for 20 i think, im looking to get both again.  and if anyone would like to keep in touch with me so they could kinda give me a quick rundown of the type commands and friends lists and that sort of thing, in game prefferebly, but out of game is ok too, that would be great, thanks.<br />

You're account is long dead, Blizzard deactivates accounts after 90 days of in-activitiy. <br />
But you dont pay anyway so its all good <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep in mind that as of 1.10 patch, exp over level 60 or 70 really, really slows down.  Really.  Monsters also got alot tougher is nightmare and hell modes.  It took the fun out of it for me, since I didn't have godly (or even good) gear, it really slowed down my progress.<br />
<br />
A couple of nice changes to b.net though, are that they have a counter to when your char will be deleted, and the rules for creating a HC character have been relaxed.<br />

I haven't found the english version of it so it may not be available, so you have either the batlechest (http://shop.blizzard.com/section2/?user=Q00U4ZXyPfNaHufEH0wSFD4kGDSaoulK6J4qdm0D%2Bic=) at 40$ or the separated one D2 (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005A3I8/qid=1091777452/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1_etk-vg/104-1757520-7906366?v=glance&amp;s=videogames&amp;n=468642) &amp; LoD (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00002CF9M/qid=1091777452/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2_etk-vg/104-1757520-7906366?v=glance&amp;s=videogames&amp;n=468642) for a bit less.</div></div><hr />
