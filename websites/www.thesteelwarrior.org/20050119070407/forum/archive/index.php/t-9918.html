<br />
The totem or rolfron zek(2 sec cast stun+dd) and the Sceptre of Forlorn(Snare/dot insta click).<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there was any other nice cliky items easy to farm that could help produce snap agro at start of fight? The item only needs a few charges as the plan is to use on names  while raiding so can call assist sooner and feel more comfortable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never really saw a point to those myself, but there are also:<br />
<br />
Swollen Fungusbeast Gland (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28758)<br />
Ball of Burlap Yarn (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20116)<br />
Greater Shockstone (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=8249)<br />
<br />
and I'm sure there's more. But again, I've never seen the point. Shoot a few arrows on inc, have the puller FD or run past you, Incite, taunt after slow lands, melee a little more and maybe taunt once or twice again to keep up with debuffers and call assist.</div></div><hr />

Taunt / incite again for agro.  Can't say I've ever lost a debuffer doing it that way.  Mostly only MA on Ssra stuff, and pre 2nd tier PoP.</div></div><hr />

THe biggest prob I guess is building a nice buffer of agro asap. We have a war in guild now with Time+ gear and on enrage I will loose my agro to him. <br />
<br />
I guess that is more of grabbing some new weps + maybe anger 3 augs vs 2. I just looking for somthing that will grab the mobs attention at the begging since my procs always seem streaky on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If another warrior is stealing aggro from you when you're the maintank of the raid, he should know better. If he's not the main tank, make him put away what ever aggro weapons he's wielding and bring out the dps setup.<br />
<br />
When ever I'm tanking stuff in a group I'll usually tag it on incoming with an arrow and have the puller run past me. That usually gets me initial aggro, then if I haven't proc'ed by the time malo lands, I'll use Bazu Bellow before slow lands and that usually keeps the mob on me. In the case of an enchanter landing tash a bit early or on incoming, well, there's not much I can do about that the first time it happens, but if it's consistent, I'll tag and then use Bazu on incoming instead of hoping for an early proc. This usually keeps me the target of the mobs attention, occasionally the procs will be streaky or downright non-excistant, but I guess that's the power randomness. Most of the time a couple of swings will get the mob back on me and if not, there's always the 1 in 5 chance that the first taunt will be a successfull one  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Loved clicky snare on RZ events, instant superb aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well guess this is all there was I could find will have to make due maybe do some more ef ldon shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, charge item clicky aggro sounds a bit marginal, but hey, under the theory that every little bit counts and considering how long LDoN augments take, here's another potential aggro-producing item (which, by the way, Haass's Magelo at one point reminded me of):<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3674<br />
<br />
Note that the alla listing says this is 1 charge, but at some point that was changed: it's now 3 charges of insta-cast root. The Jailmaster's spawn point is correctly marked on the EQ Atlas's map of Permafrost, if you aren't familier with the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">right, BTW Brable, Lucy is your friend : Wooly Spider Silk Net (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14316) (any slot, instant cast, 3 charges, not lore but unstakable) not so bad for an item.<br />
<br />
EDIT : want a snare (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28758) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, aye Yoda.<br />
Magelo, however, is not my friend while I'm at work.<br />
What are my employers thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">employers follow the boss ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On our first successful RZ kill:<br />
<br />
I pulled and burned about 15 charges of Fungusbeast Gland snare on Incomming.  This allowed our casters and melee's to completely drain their mana and discs from the very start.  The extra burn in the first 20 seconds of the fight probably meant the difference between passing and failure ... after all we only had around 50 people with mediocre gear ... so our overall dps potential is not very high.<br />
<br />
Do you need them to function?  Not a chance in hell, but it can help.  If you want to farm them i suggest the FB glands as they have 10 charges of instaclick snare and are not lore.  I got all mine shakerpaging multiple kegs at once, though, so it may take forever and a day to farm a few a more legit way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shrug well last night I snap agroed like a mofo with them I think they are a bit better agro then you might believe. Gonna have sk friend go help me parse out about what hate I can get from them.</div></div><hr />
