<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I access this site, Nortons warns me of a trojan (Bat.QuickFormat.Trojan) in the file &quot;chatbox.php(1)&quot;.<br />
<br />
... This may prove useful to someone.  If your machine didnt detect the trojan... I'd update your definitions and scan your machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty sure its due to a line someone put in the chatbox.<br />
<br />
The problem though is that same line is keeping me from clearing the chatbox. sHORTY will have to change it later since he hacked it into the board to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trueit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah its nothing guys. Its just a certain thing you say that makes norton think its a trojan when its really nothing at all. It doesnt do anything to you. Its a problem with norton not the website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmmm... Norton AV says its a trojan, random-internet-user-01 says its nothing.  Tough call ....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How much you wanna bet Trueit's IP is the same as duppolfg?<br />
<br />
Ban them!  Come on, you know you wanna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">in any case; anyone who had the chatbox on from 1pm EST to 4:30 pm EST should run some kind of virus protection or trojan killer.<br />
<br />
fake or not or whatever; let's all be smart about this and nip it in the bud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is indeed the same ip.<br />
<br />
Both accounts have been banned as well as the ip. He can email me and explain himself if he wants to be unbanned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hah, Haass 1, Wannabe Hacker 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">goood :D winners buy beer kthx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is there no way to disable the chatbox until it can be cleared?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it is disabled .. least mine is. hmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I mean like hide it, or stop it from loading up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">chatbox is basically dormant now ( won't update itself ); with as much shut out of it until sHORTY comes by and purges it.<br />
<br />
I just ran my trojan killer 3x and the PC was clean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Despite being dormant, I keep getting the damn trojan message as well and on a work computer (*laugh*) it makes me nervous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Same here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I sent 7x messages to our IT guys before I figured out what was doing it.<br />
<br />
Hell yes, they asked me what was up. <br />
<br />
Luckily the words, HaXXor and L33t came into the discussion as I proved what a Sw33t Dood I was and he said np thx la~!<br />
<br />
p.s. &lt; - - - 30 year old guy working in Finance ha ha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ramirezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Noob on computers does anyone got a good site to get some kinda of trojan killer so to say?    I got norton Antivirus .. I go to the forum and I get a message about a virus or something I just follow the step but not sure it did anything?   Is there something I should do to make sure it is gone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use this from Trend Micro (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/housecall); seems to work the best for me for most of my virus scanning needs; plus I had another Trojan Killer program I got somewhere a while back...if i get the URL proper I'll make a note of it ASAP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Everytime you visit the website IE will check the page you look at against the old one it got saved in its cache.<br />
Clear the cache and it should stop bugging you and at the same time lower the cache size to something more real.<br />
If you are using a fast connection, like ADSL or better, then set it to a number around 15-20MB.<br />
If you are using a dialup, like Modem or ISDN, then use a number around 50MB.<br />
Too high a setting (usually the case on bigger harddisks) makes windows search through several thousand files each time you visit a page.<br />
<br />
<br />
To clear the cache: Tools -&gt; Internet Options... -&gt; Delete Files...<br />
To set the cache size: Tools -&gt; Internet Options... -&gt; Settings... -&gt; Enter 20MB in input box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks Shikarii, that website helped and got rid of one Trojan for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Would like an update on this as soon as possible.  I had been relying on my firewall software to keep me out of trouble, but because of this nonsense I have reinstalled my McAffee software, with all of the attendance pita that goes with it.  So far as I can tell, nothing bad is going on, but if we can get any sort of indication what this fucktard was up to, I would really like to hear about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Chatbox is gone until further notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Can one of you admin type people please refer the IP to your host?  Not only does this shit bug me, but its actually illegal.  <br />
<br />
And thanks for clearing it up so fast.<br />
<br />
*edit* fyi, i just tried to use my microsoft outlook contacts folder on the work computer that I accessed this site through yesterday and first got the notification and immediately received the same Norton AntiVirus Notification concerning the Bat.QuickFormat.Trojan /gulp*/edit*</div></div><hr />
