I don't need much in the way of advice on what to get but would appreciate some advice on what slots to upgrade next<br />
<br />
So if any of you have the time to check my magelo, linked at left, and offer some opinions on what slots should be my highest priority I would be grateful. Just try not to laugh too hard. :p</div></div><hr />

Actually with yourself and a healing type friend you can duo for it easily enough and upgrade that slot for free whilst still making AA points at a decent if not outstanding pace. And could go hit flame seer Japal for kingly boots of splendor while youre there.<br />

The items would give you +51ac, +60 hp or net around 82 ac, 66 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mukaz</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the input you guys<br />
<br />
Rodney, Iksar faction with Katta + casual playtime = Loyalist shield is a months long endeavor, not an easy upgrade. <br />
<br />
As i said before, I don't need item advice I need priority advice and I got that. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do more LDON.<br />
<br />
Get Helmet and Haste aug. Ditch RBG and buy Rubi Girdle.<br />
<br />
100 hps and more haste. No Plat, no raids.<br />
<br />
P.S. Then dig up 100 more hps by finishing Strength of Elements.<br />
<br />
(IF you can take a Vindi-ish mob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shoulders first id say too. if you want an easy pair do the draconic pauldrons quest in WW. dont even need a full group and the quest mobs are always up. cant say no to 12 sta..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mukaz, actually Loyaist Shield isn't hard with an Iksar, it just takes finess. Having illusion potions can get you to where you want to be. Also, keeping the faction items ( dust and fangs ) from the vamps makes faction better. <br />
<br />
I did everything but the final vamp in less than 3 hours. Then I spent an afternoon camping the vamp with some friends and we popped him back-to-back after about 4-5 hours. It is a pain but it is hard to beat the shield for the risk vs reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mukaz I am having a problem with your statements, 50 ac on one item is more then anything you have, you CANT one group a better back.  Why do assume I know nothing about faction, hell  I killed Nathyn 6 times my faction was as LOW as it gets for this quest.  Did you even check on the shoulders?<br />
<br />
Rodney<br />
<br />
ps how can you know all the upgrades but not know what to upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question on the Loyalist Shield.  I have the ashes already, so I mainly need to work on faction.  Dark elf, killed Lcea and Nathyn several times. <br />
<br />
What faction do you need to work up?  I've heard Magus Conlegium, which I can kill vampyres for.  But I've also heard Concillium Universus, which I would have to drag a group to Seru I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a problem with my statements all you like. It isn't just a matter of &quot;Item x is one groupable&quot; its also a matter of time and availability of the other people in the group.<br />
<br />
I didn't assume you know nothing about faction but you apparently think i'm exaggerating when I say getting the faction and completing the quest would be a months long endeavor. <br />
<br />
Casual doesn't equal uninformed. I am aware that your shoulder item comes from a named in Plane of Nightmare. Are you aware that:<br />
1. he needs to be spawned during my playtime <br />
2. enough of my friends/guildmates need to be on/available to go off this guy<br />
3. there are a few tradeable shoulders that are comparable to those with the addition of a cheap +10 AC augment? these for instance http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11799<br />
<br />
I don't know all the upgrades for the slots in question but I know the upgrades that I feel are within my reach in what I consider a reasonable amount of my time. The original question wasn't what to upgrade but what to upgrade first. In my opinion, even if I think I know the answer to a question, it is reasonable to ask my peers if they agree or for some friendly advice.<br />
<br />
 I appreciate the time everyone took to answer and gained confirmation that my shoulder slot needs looking at first. Primarily because its the only item of gear i'm currently wearing that has zero hit points I imagine. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does NOT take a month to fix faction, I have seen peeps do it over a weekend, you just have to know who to kill.  The risk for the Crystallized Acid Pauldrons is much higher and for LESS value then the Horn Spiked and on CT very few kill the named to get em, only takes 8-9 peeps.  Ya know I dont really care what you do but others reading should know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd sure like to know how an Iksar can fix Katta faction in one week-end.  I know an Iksar who worked on it a week straight and was stilll KoS.  I can't say for certain, but I think Iksars may not be able to fix Katta faction completely.  I'm sure they can fix Lceas faction, but that's only 1 of many in Katta.<br />
<br />
That being said, I did the entire Loyalist Shield quest except I could never get Valdanovs ashes.  I camped Valdanov for 3 months straight and he would never spawn (this is with clearing the castle, too).  Unless you happen to get lucky and get his ashes by pure coincidence, I wouldn't waste the effort or time on it.  If you want to do the quest, I'd recommend trying to get the ashes first.  That way if you don't get them you haven't wasted yours or your friends time on a quest you can't complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of no one that completed the quest that camped the vamps, not to say it does not happen but drive by checks seem to work the best.  You dont have to go though the castle to get to the top floor, levi across from the hill behind.  There are 2 lvls of KOS and I think the first is about 1000 low lvl mob kills and the next is 500 so if your killing low lvl mobs (greens) its gona take one hell of a long time, you need to be killing at least lvl 60 mobs.  One more thing I know of at least two cases when he pop'd twice in an hr so getting help should not be a problem.</div></div><hr />
