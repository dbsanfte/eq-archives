I'm not used to the pure melee style of play, even though I've played long enough to know the basic tricks-o-the-trade.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is this:  What are all the other methods I keep reading about but have no clue as to how/what they are talking about?  Peeling:  I would gather this means using your bow or whatnot to pull a mob off of a puller, such as a monk or SK.  Am I correct?<br />
<br />
What are some of the more 'advanced' things warriors do in a group or solo to increase their stature as a 'good warrior' or a 'great player'.<br />
<br />
I want to make sure I'm not going to flop when I hit the plains and get booted out of a raid or a group because I don't know what to do.<br />

by Norok &quot;I'd hit it&quot; Zek<br />
<br />
1. (The &quot;Golden Rule&quot;) In the event you can not get aggro on a mob, begin complaining about how warriors are broken. If anyone tells you to shut up, ask them if they'd like to tank. If you don't have an enraging blow weapon, complaining about not having one is also useful.<br />
<br />
2. If you find yourself going berzerk, complain that the cleric is not doing his/her job and ask for a replacement. If a druid or shaman is doing the healing, ask for a &quot;real healer&quot;.<br />
<br />
3. When a mob is mezzed, don't bother taunting it, just attack it. If it attacks the enchanter, see #1.  <br />
<br />
4. If you join a group with a pal/sk, do not let them tank under any circumstances, no matter how much better their gear is than yours. If they overaggro, call them a &quot;wannabe tank&quot; and talk bad about their mothers. Also, suggest that they leave the group so the group can find some &quot;real DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
5. If a monk is overaggroing, even if he immediatly feigns, let him know he sucks at playing a monk and needs to learn how to FD. The same goes for a rogue and evade. If a shaman overaggros, even if it's because of slow, suggest to him that he reroll as a monk and FD.<br />
<br />
6. If a ranger is in your group, bug him for arrows, even if there is a mage present. If he does not have a tolan's bracer or is below 45 and can't use one, tell him to learn how to play his class properly.<br />
<br />
there you go! 6 EZ steps to becoming an awesome warrior. hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest things are positioning, flexibility to a changing situation, anticipation of problems, and just having good situational awareness etc. The basic job is pretty simple - it's how well you do the less obvious stuff that sets you apart...<br />

<br />
Thank you for your comments.  I actually feel more confident that I'm not doing anything wrong and that I'm doing just fine as a warrior.  I just got a little worried when I saw all these different warriors saying all sorts of warrior things that I wasn't familiar with.<br />
<br />
Woot!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanmer</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't be so concerned about being a damage DEALER if you are the main tank. Concentrate on being a damage TAKER. That is a big mistake a lot of warriors make. (Including me at one time). Set yourself up with AC/HP type gear and when ya get to AA's. I personally went with all my defensive, damage taking abilities first. Clerics love a tank that is somewhat easy to keep alive.<br />
<br />
Kan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mob awareness is one. when pulling put every brain cell you can muster into observing if the arrow you shoot is going to agro five mobs at once. if you think it might .. think twice about that arrow. many wipeouts can be avoided by the puller simply using care. you know those times you have a different mob targeted than the one you THOUGHT you had targeted? that type of thing. mistakes happen but try to minimize them and your group will find less to complain about.<br />
<br />
here's another one. when the enchanter is getting beat upon by a bad mez attempt and is very low on hitpoints its usually NOT a good idea to try to force agro back onto yourself by swinging at it. reason being is you KNOW this enchanter is TRYING to mez it. he may have low hitpoint agro as well. if he does succeed in mezzing it you are likely to break mez on the very next swing and guess what? dead enchanter. good example of good intentions leading to bad result. you may feel free to attempt to regain agro by sitting down.<br />
<br />
many more little things like that but ill leave the advice to those 2 for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  And if his/her health gets too low, all the mobs will rush over to pay their last respects.<br />
<br />
This is a good time to back over to the Enchanter, and hit the &quot;/shield Enchanter&quot; social that you created before your group headed out to kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be a total waste of the use of shield... You should always /shield Monk, I mean the poor monk is allready down on the floor moaning... think he needs more protection then some silly robed git running around in circles screaming 'get it off get if off get it off'............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Connir</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a good tank I think is definately being aware of your surroundings and mobs. Example:<br />
<br />
When on an adventure or any exp situation and whoever pulls multiple mobs. If the enchanter is having trouble mezzing a mob I will try and taunt it fast  or shield her. I also pay attention to what mobs are mezzed in what order. That way I dont attack a mob that was just remezzed while the other mezzed mob is breaking. Just a few examples.<br />
<br />
I am only 51 now and have been using provoke for a while, and I love it. But never break a mez with provoke or any other combat taunt. Always use your traditional taunt, seems to work a hell of a lot better for me.<br />
<br />
Just a few things I have picked up, not sure if they are the consensus, but they work for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best thing you can do is play.  Work on maxing your skills. Check the bazaar for weapons and then go find where they drop.  Learn about equipment.<br />
<br />
The tricks (tactics) come to you in time. When you raid, watch the others and ask questions if you need to (without interupting.. might want to write them down and ask the warriors after the raid is over). <br />
<br />
There are a lot of opinions on this board. Some good, some bad.. try things out and do what works for you.<br />
<br />
Learn to master agro.. not just &quot;taking&quot; it, but &quot;not taking&quot; it as well.  Learn how to manage push. Learn to manage positioning.<br />
<br />
The skills you build playing a warrior won't come from this board, or from your friends.. it comes from you putting in the time and learning to play your class.<br />
<br />
Playing a warrior is easy, playing a warrior well is most difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raznok Razorwit</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things to learn for warrior:<br />
<br />
1) how to help the puller split mobs<br />
2) how aggro works and when to use your taunt button<br />
3) mob positioning<br />
4) mob kill order (cleric mobs, nuker mobs, melee mobs) as well as mez order (if you don't know which to attack next, ask the enchanter they appreciate it)<br />
<br />
By the time you get near the 40s, you pretty much know how to pull, but now, the monks and bards are getting alot better at it than you.  So, learn to help them.  Let the monk know you have a ranged attack.  He'll teach you how to help him split them.<br />
<br />
You need to know how aggro works more than any other class.  You need to generate as much as you can for yourself and know how to fix the aggro gen of other members.  Learn what the shaman and chanter slow and tash spells look like when they hit the mob.  It doesn't always say 'slows down'.  When you are looking for those things, you are more prepared if you lose aggro then.<br />
<br />
Mob positioning is pretty easy to do and is one of those things that gets me 'great tanking' compliments the most often.  If I pull, I bring mob in and turn it around.  I'm looking at the rest of the party with the mob between us.  If another is pulling, I usually stand looking at the rest of the group so that I can grab aggro when the puller and mob run by me....putting us in the same general position of me on one side, party on other.  Learning to circle strafe will help if you have a rogue in party.  As the mob gets pushed around, just always keep the mobs back to the rogue.<br />
<br />
Mob order can be a little tricky, but it's probably something you do without thinking by now anyway.  Keep in mind that the party is going to look to you for their kill target.  So pick which needs to die first and let them know it.  I usually kill any healer/slower mobs first, then nukers, then all others, but situations vary depending on the mobs.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this is all of some use to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alot of good info here.  One of the biggest in my mind is adapting quickly when any number of things go wrong and having a good awareness of the little things going on around you.  If  you can do those things, your groups will appreciate it.  And you're already doing one of the best possible things, which is coming here for information.  I know I'm a much better tank now than I was the first time I looked at this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Peeling: I would gather this means using your bow or whatnot to pull a mob off of a puller, such as a monk or SK. Am I correct? <br />
<br />
Also known as 'tagging'. When a monk or sk FD's most of the mobs on them will walk away, sometimes 1 or 2 will stick around a little while longer. That's when you want to tag them.<br />
<br />
Procs: I've found that weapons with procs that include a stun portion (not just damage) really help to draw agro. I don't have any anger or enraging blow procs yet, but stuns work well too.<br />
<br />
It's not about the damage that you do, but how you take it. If the cleric is CH'ing you many times during a normal fight, you might want to check your gear. In BoT I can usually go 2-3 fights before I need a complete heal (unless a named shows up :P). Items with regen help as well. If you regen for over 60 per tick with buffs, that will save your healer some mana too as you will heal up while waiting for the next pull.<br />
<br />
Know when to use 2h over 1h dual wield. If a mob hits for a lot more than you are used to and you find you are getting riposted a lot, change to 2hs or 2hb. You will get off less attacks, which means fewer chances of being riposted (I don't think mobs get this ability until around level 35 anyway), but the damage bonus on the 2h weapon makes up for it usually. Dual wield is good to use if you have the hp/ac to take the additional blows or if you are just a DPS warrior on a raid, etc. Always be ready to switch your weapons around depending on the situation you are in.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of right now, the best way to learn is to just play and find ways to make stuff easier for yourself. The best way to learn is by making mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of good advice here. The stuff about mob positioning and working with enchanters is very good.<br />
In some areas with lots of mobs that can be single pulled (Overthere, dreadlands, for example) I wouldn't necessarily assume other classes can pull better than you can. Get yourself a 125 or 150 range bow, make yourself some 150 range arrows, pull away. <br />
Whether or not you pull, immediately start figuring out the pathing characteristics, the spawn rates, agro range, &quot;toughness,&quot; casting abilities and so forth of the mobs you are fighting. Also, pay atention to how your group is functioning, and who is doing what. If you are in a pick-up group, people come and go and that sometimes radically changes how fast you can kill mobs. If you know what everyone's been doing, you can anticipate how changes in mobs and changes in group make-up will influence upcoming fights.<br />
<br />
I also always liked to fight facing my group. Tell your group you will do this. It helps not only rogues, but to some extent pets do max damage. Also, it allows you to react faster if a mob heads for your casters (especially an add or someone else's train comes up from behind the group). <br />
Do make a shield hotkey and use it. You might have to explain how it works, because so few warriors use it in the 30s and 40s. <br />
Pay careful atention to your casters' mana, expecially your healer's mana. Ask periodically. It will give you a pretty good reading about whether the group can stand faster pulling or not.<br />
Don't run outside your caster's range when he starts casting on you. Especially if you are pulling, the impulse is to run off, but it's very irritating to your healer if you do that.<br />
<br />
You will make mistakes. Try not to make the same one over and over, heh.<br />
<br />
Keep track of your buffs, and mention when one goes down. In theory, your caster (say, shaman) is timing them, but practice sometimes that's very hard for them to do.<br />
<br />
Don't be a loot hog. Call for casters to loot if the melee have been grabbing all the loot. But don't allow corpses to pile up either, as they can cause targeting problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casca</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raznok mentioned some of what I think makes a good tank.<br />
<br />
I don't play a warrior anymore, fell into the roguish crowd years ago and never looked back.  I do have a lvl60 warrior though that I haven't logged on in years, but I think playing the part of the rogue has really allowed me to notice the difference between a good tank and a tank that thinks all he/she is there to do is hit taunt.<br />
<br />
For LDoN, many times you are fighting in long narrow halls. Do you:<br />
<br />
A) Turn the mob so you are pushing him down and up the length of the halls so the rogue can always backstab, so all your other melee's don't have to fight from the front and possibly take reposte damage.<br />
<br />
B) Turn him width wise and push him real fast halfway up the ceiling and then keep him that way from the beginning of the fight to the end so that your rogue can never backstab and all your melee's are taking reposte damage and if you are really good maybe even completely push him into the ceiling so he becomes untargettable but still alive or a corpse that you can't loot .<br />
<br />
It's frustrating, but more then half the pick-up groups I do, the tank is clueless on this. <br />
<br />
You can control where you fight the mob. Choose a good open area whenever possible. Don't fight right in doorways!!<br />
<br />
Your puller...or you, pulled more then one mob. Do you:<br />
<br />
A) stand there fighting your one mob in the midst of all the other added mobs while your enchanter  clicks one mob to the next trying to find the mobs he needs to keep  mezzed<br />
<br />
B) stand there fighting one mob while your root class roots the added mobs, then continue to stand there as the rooted mob beats up your rogue?<br />
<br />
C) Seperate the mob you are fighting from the mobs that are being mezzed/rooted so ther are no wasted seconds trying to maintain mezz or mana, healing DPS melee's cause they have to stand right next to the rooted mob in order to kill the current mob tank is on cause the tank is too clueless to just back up away from the rooted mob a little more.<br />
<br />
You are fighting a mob that possibly will enrage. You have pet classes in your group. Do you:<br />
<br />
A) Don't pay attention to this at all and if pet's get killed on enrage, it's the casters fault (which, yes he can stop attack, but you can also make things easier for all ...)<br />
<br />
B) Since you are pulling, run away to pull right before enrage so that the mob will turn right on your other melee classes unexpectently.<br />
<br />
C) Notice that the pets are fighting mobs from the front, so you back up and turn and do whatever you have to do in order to make the pets reposition themsleves on the mobs back.<br />
<br />
More then one mob are incoming. You have choosen your target and other melee's have assisted, do you:<br />
<br />
A) switch targets for no reason.<br />
<br />
B) Switch targets because an add is a healer class or unmezzable/rootable mob.<br />
<br />
Ther are times when you need to change targets, but really, in most cases just pick a damn mob and stay on it.<br />
<br />
 Yes, you can do this and really it does not take much effort on your part and when I see a tank that pay's attention to things like these, I am happy because I know I am not playing with some clueless hack.</div></div><hr />

All three on social hot keys. I rarely pull BUT when I do if i get more than one mob I usually call the number or just eat a death to save the group. Not sure if eating a death and taking a 96% rez is smart but it seems to work for me...1 death = less downtime than a whole group wipe...as for raiding I am RARELY MT but i play second fiddle very well. I think I will become an even better tank now that I have became a member of a &quot;community&quot; of my peers! Thank you all.<br />
<br />
**Edit** Wanted to add this on the chance of sounding big headed...I rarely get a complaint about my tanking skills, and if I do make a mistake I am usually the FIRST to recognize it. Therefore I would be the first to try and RECONSILE it. Most of the time I get things said to me like &quot;Great job out there today Jens!&quot; or I never knew dwarves could run so fast with 8 mobs on they arses! :D J/k</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are the MT but not pulling and the puller announces the mob coming to camp, Assist the puller and when it gets fairly close,  Hit Provoke (or Bellow when u get a bit higher in levels) and the mob will shift its attention to you as it arrives in camp. Similar to the Pally Cease/Desist tactic. I use this all the time and so far no real glitches to speak of.</div></div><hr />

You need one that readily gives you access to swap out weapons, view your hp's your groups hp's insta click's etc.  I use Sars. I've changed it a bit but overall I think it's a great UI for melee. Organize your chat boxes so that you can see what's going on. It's a good idea to put battle spam in a different box than your group chat (hopefully no needs me to explain why) if you play on a low resolution screen change the font size to accomodate more than one text box. Knowing what's going on and catching important command's or comments while grouping or raiding can make or break ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lot of good info here, people really have gone far beyond the call of duty on this topic :)  I would like to add, what to me, is the most useful discipline order to use on boss mobs or multi pulls.<br />
<br />
When fighting a boss mob of some sorts, I find that Incite - Furious - mighty strike (if he isn't hitting too hard) - defensive/evasive is a sweet series.  With the current lack of endurance items, this pretty much drains you out, but if you remove mighty strike, then defensive/evasive will last their entire cycle.<br />
<br />
The beauty on this is incite gets your aggro building then furious gives you those few ticks of no melee damage hitting you, yet you dish out a fair amount back to the mob (riposting all his melees).  This gives the rest of your group plenty of time to wait and debuff/slow as this starts to wear off.  No more having to debuff/slow off the bat and risk a dead enc/shm/brd.  It really works very very well.<br />
<br />
Also, never underestimate the combo of AoE taunt and furious.  Get too many mobs?  Tell folks in this scenario to follow your lead, while you keep all the mobs pinned to you (may or may not need aoe taunt depending on scenario) you hit furious and begin riposting all the mobs attacks.  This gives your group time to either evac or start mezzing / slowing all the mobs.  The nice part is you are building decent aggro and can pretty much slow/mez the mobs without the slower/mezzer getting aggro, in most cases.<br />
<br />
For me, my warrior is the meat shield, so it is all about taking the punishment.  So, think defensively, use shield, incite on pulls or splitting mobs, keep those mob backs wide open for the other folks, position the mobs to the best of your ability and last but not least, have fun doing it !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pull higher con mobs first.   This reduces the chance of getting an add.<br />
<br />
Know when to bow pull and when to prox pull (aggro from close proximity to the mob).  Bow pulling can cause the mob to use default pathing, which can sometimes be very bad for you.  Prox pulling, or very close bow pulling will cause the mob to go straight for you rather than using the default pathing.<br />
<br />
Mobs that have their backs turned to you have a lower agro radius, use this to your advantage when trying to pull singles.<br />
<br />
If you have an enchanter or cleric helping with pacify, establish a pattern of always pulling the left mob (or right one, it doesn't matter which, it just needs to be consistent), so the pacifier knows which mob to pacify.<br />
<br />
If you are pulling mobs that respawn, try to break the camp and then establish a pattern of pulling the mobs in the same order.  This will save you from having to rebreak parts of the camp constantly.  It always takes more time to break a camp than it does to single pull repops, so once you have a pattern of keeping the spawn down, you can usually weave a few more mobs from outside the camp into the spawn cycle.<br />
<br />
If you pull caster mobs, don't pull to camp and let them nuke you from a distance.  Duck around a wall and they will come for you, as they need line of sight to start casting.  If there are no walls, move past your camp such that the mob will stop in the middle of your camp to start nuking you.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple pulls, do not let them all bunch up, this makes your chanter's job very difficult.  Rather, step into the mobs as soon as the first mob gets to the place where you want to fight.  There is a bit of skill involved here, but it causes a very nice effect:  the first mob will be behind you, all the adds will be in front of you.  Then turn around to fight the mob you pulled.  As a result, you will be facing the camp fighting the mob you pulled, with adds beating on your back.  Yes, you will take more damage because your back is exposed,  but it becomes so freaking obvious to the chanter which mobs he needs to mezz.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned this above, but once a mob is mezzed, pull the mob you are fighting away from the area (move and then sit down if you don't have strong agro)<br />
<br />
If you pull multiples and your healer is going to have a hard time, or your chanter is slow locking mobs down, train your group.  Yep, train your group.  Run over to someone who is not the healer/chanter/slower and let them get prox agro from the adds.  Think of the rest of your parties hitpoints as your hitpoints, until the mobs are under control.  The idea is not to kill your group mates, but rather to lessen the burst dps you are taking at the start of the fight.  (Now the better rangers and shamans out there will snare or slow one of the adds to help ghetto mezz, so use this technique only if your party doesn't really click well)</div></div><hr />

If you have a mezzer in your group and the mobs are powerful enough that they will attempt to cast gate when low HP and you get a pull like this:<br />
<br />
Warrior mob<br />
Warrior mob 2<br />
Enchanter mob<br />
Cleric mob<br />
<br />
grab one of the warriors and stay on it, mezzers often go for caster classes first especially if they are gaters so they can be killed last with the least risk if a gate actually happens.<br />
<br />
The last thing you want is for the cleric mob to be engaged first and the others mezzed and the cleric gates and starts summoning people away from the party and other 3 mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
With the above mob list when mobs are powerful enough to gate/summon I would kill in the above order, top to bottom.<br />
<br />
Enchanter mob shouldnt be awake at all at the start of the fight, its going to tash your whole crew and start mezzing your healers or CCers and its going to hurt.  Cleric will just gate over and over and CH repeatedly after every gate before they come back to the group so thats why I would take them last, so the mezzer can possibly chain mez them on refresh at the end to make extra sure he doesnt gate/ch.<br />
<br />
Oh and ask the puller if they would prefer that you assist him on inc or if you target with f8 on inc.  It can help to remove a lot of confusion or bad things happening.<br />
<br />
One example is a bard comming in with 2 mobs casting mez on the way, he hits camp, you assist him and shoot arrow that hits what he just mezzed and makes he mez/his plan worthless.  Whereas a f8 would have caught the unmezzed one when you see it pass the mezzed one and everything is perfect.  Its a rare situation for stuff to play out like this, but scenarios like this happen more often than one would think.<br />

Question on taunt though, I was under the impression that didnt stack, i.e once taunt has succeeded on a mezzed mob taunting it again is meaningless. Admittedly I have no idea why I believe this so  guess the question is, am i wrong? Are two successfull taunts better than just one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is better, but only by as much as doing about 1 dmg to the enemy with melee.<br />
