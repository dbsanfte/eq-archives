<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minowara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, many of you know that I am 'made from paper', and if you don't, well, now you do. I am one yellow from 65 and have a sick 3737 unbuffed hps...I have gotten all the equipment suggested, but still to no avail, have a pitifuly low hp total...What are some good upgrades? Dropable, questable, raid encounter drop type thing -- I am planning on joining a guild that is around AoW level I would say, they farm NToV, Yelniak (sp?), Dain, etc.....So considering that I will have about 3800 hp unbuffed at 65, what gear do i need to make a difference! <br />
<br />
Magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=452089 <br />
<br />
<br />
I have 5k to work with for tradeable gear: I could always play the market/sell stuff and get more $$. On another note, my AA path for the future is:<br />
<br />
run 3<br />
sta 3 (No, I cannot cap my stamina)<br />
nd 3<br />
ae taunt<br />
No clue after AE taunt<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, I am sick of going into a beserker's frenzy every time I see a sick little twinked sub 55 warrior that has more hp then me.../sigh<br />
<br />
*note* I ran out of the pp to afford the food on my magelo and I am too lazy to change it <br />
<br />
*note 2* There has been a history of 2 GSoT for sale on my server, one when i was level 55 and it went for 33k, and one a few days ago for 125k+, I have tried to get one-- its not going to happen. Also to note, I do not own a 2hs..I had a windblade, sold it for the gear I am using<br />
<br />
Edit: I have almost completed my epic -- only need PoA, PoF, and chardok. I could, in theory, sell my green/red scale for a total of around 60k. I also keep an incarnadine bp around for invis, could get around 25k for that...any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looking at your magelo I reckon you've got pretty decent gear as far as whats available tradeable / MQable.  Once you have ND3 you'll be sitting over 4k which I would say is a respectable amount for a non raiding warrior or warrior just starting the NToV / Velious &quot;ubers&quot; level.  I was in a similar boat when PoP came out being light on HPs so I stuck it out at level 60 till I had ND3 under my belt and figure it was worth doing getting groups easier in PoD rather than getting known as a paper tank in Tier 2.<br />
<br />
The only spot that really jumps out at me for being cheap and easy to upgrade is the boots - Fine heraldic would score you another 12hps and 5AC.<br />
<br />
With a bit more cash some other upgrades you could plan for:<br />
Weapons - neither of your weapons has HPs on it, so maybe planning for a fleshgrinder or Horn of Hsagra.  These might be too big a sacrifice on agro for you though.  <br />
<br />
2 New tradeable weapons from the revamped Droga could be good options and have procs that should generate some taunt, so keep an eye out for:<br />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009<br />
<br />
With a bit more cash I would look at getting a CT earring (you might even be able to drag a group there for this one).  Mosquito Leg earrings, Lizard Bone/tooth Earring, Blood Metal Earring of Engagement or Iron Scream Earring are all significant upgrades to the Vah Shir Earring.<br />
<br />
Kylong Shinguards from Veksar would be a small upgrade to the legs with 4sta, 45hps, 35AC.  Theres also barbed Rubicite legs with 65hps but they only have 22AC and can be a bit pricey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think your biggest problem is your lack of AA points.  With ND3 you'd have about 4.4k hp, then you'll get a little more with PE.<br />
<br />
Eoden was right, you should get some weapons with HP.  SBoZ has 100 hp on it and if you're joining a guild capable of AoW you'll get one pretty quick killing Statue.  BoC also has 100 hp and 15 sta.<br />
<br />
You can get a Vindi BP and boots pretty easily as well.  Mosquito Leg Earrings have also dropped in price a lot since the Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement has been around.  <br />
<br />
Go hard on AA exping when you hit 65 and you'll be fine :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, pretty much I'd agree with everyone here.  I would also think about getting another Silver Chitin Wristband, or at the least a Bracer of Benevolance (if you have the CoV faction still) to replace the Bracer of the Myrmidonn.  Also, if you can't cap your sta you might want to think of trading down your hat for a Champion's Helm, it has more sta on it.  At least till you can get the hat off of AoW.  Vindi's boots would be a huge upgrade for you, and the BP would be hella nice as well.  Really, your earrings are the only loot that really needs work.  Get Tactics flagged, (if you aren't already) and try and fight down there as much as you can.  I watched 3 Highly Polished Gems drop there two days ago (all in about 4 hours) and that's the most expensive part to the Bloodmetal Earing of Engagement.  Another good Earring is the Arachnid Antenna, drops from Rallius Rattican in PoD, I've seen 3 drop in 5 kills so it's not that horribly uncommon.  He's single groupable if you have a real good chanter, just make sure to fight him in his room.  And to entice people to come with you, Rallius's head is used for the Intermediate Manual of Steath quest.<br />
<br />
Those are mostly just nitpicking things that will come with time, overall your gear is nice for a non-raiding warrior.  Get 65 and grind like mad.  There are a ton of good guides for AAs here buried somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As others have said, the best upgrades you can get right now are AA points.  ND3, PE, PD3 will get you 6-800 hps probably.  If you are joining a raid guild I wouldn't worry too much about gear now, anything you buy will just get replaced when you start raiding.  Right now is your chance to build up some AA points before you start raiding and don't have as much time to grind AA.  If I were you I'd get a group together and go live in droga for a while.  Exp in there is great, and mobs don't make your hp evaporate quite like tier 2 PoP.  Also those two weapons Eoden mentioned would be a nice upgrade for you if you can get them to drop.<br />
<br />
If you do go to Droga, be sure to go down deep.  The mobs near the zone-in are too low to be good exp at 64-65, but if you go in deep the mobs go up to level 61 and are nice exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From what I can see your gear isnt too bad for your level and aa.  I would say try to work on some more SS quest armor to upgrade your champs, and try to look for some new weapons.  In this day and age having 0 stamina and 0 hps on your weapons is just sad.  Dump the frostbringer and wavecrasher and try to get some hps in your weapons.  Fleshgrinders have 75 hps each and are much better taunt than wavecrasher and frostbringer IMO.<br />
<br />
Camping 4c in CT is pretty easy at level 65, there you could get fleshgrinders and some nice earring upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you're ever in ToVN keep an eye out for a katana of pain; can't really argue with a 300 hp weapon ( pretty much the only reason i kept mine )<br />
<br />
rest of the gear the other summed up nicely; and nail some more aa's down. don't go worrying about being a paper tank though; it's all relative to what you got.<br />
grind out the aa's; fill in the gear as you get the coin/raid..and soon enough you'll be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morgred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They arent upgrades in ac but definate up grades in STA/HP are Moktor Boots and Greaves (Umbral Plains).  That is what I currently use and both add 10Sta.  I only sacrafice around 24 total ac for about 100 or so HP and more sta for ND to work with.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well aa path after ae taunt:<br />
cs/ca 1<br />
pe<br />
cs 3<br />
ca 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here is what I would suggest. Grind like there is no tomorrow for the next 3-4 weeks. This should be enough time to get at least ND3 if you play fairly regularly (if you play a lot, 4 weeks is enough time to get upwards of 40AA so ND3 should be cake.)<br />
<br />
Try to grind in Droga, ChardokB, or Veksar. There are some pretty nice drops coming out of those zones that would be upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
While you are grinding away, play the market as much as you can. You are going to need some PP at the end of your grindage. Save every copper you can. You might consider selling some easy profit items - like celestial essense (player made like 90% profit) to help build up some pp.<br />
<br />
When you finish your grind-a-thon, you should be sitting pretty good at around 4400hp unbuffed. Ornate molds are dropping like rain in the Karanas now. The best zones require flags (Tactics and Sol Ro) but Bastion of Thunder seems to be decent as well. At 4400hp you should be able to tank BoT well enough to move your grinding there. If you are lucky you can win a drop or 2. Any drop will do since you can trade/sell for plate drops.<br />
<br />
Start watching the baz in the next few weeks. Right now, ornate is still pretty expensive since everyone wants to be the first to get the armor. However, I can pretty much guarantee that the market is going to be flooded very soon. On my server it's not unusual to see 40+ people in Sol Ro at 1am in the morning. People are farming the living shit out of that zone. Some for twinks, some for plats, but it accomplishes the same thing. The price for ornate molds is going to sink like the Titanic. You can also bet that this trend will drag down the prices of BD cultural and other nice tradeable items including player made jewelry. <br />
<br />
Some items you should start watching for:<br />
Mosquito leg earrings<br />
any ornate plate molds<br />
bloodmetal earrings<br />
veksar shinguards<br />
<br />
As far as your weapons are concerned, sell that wavecrapper while it is still worth something. I would sell the frosty as well, but if you are worried about agro, keep that for offhand use. There are a ton of quality weapons you can get with some HP or STA that will be much better for you.<br />
<br />
Some nice weapons:<br />
Horn of Hsagra<br />
Swiftblade of Zek<br />
Shortblade of Lightning<br />
Fleshgrinder<br />
Razorfang club<br />
Disemboweler<br />
<br />
Hang in there a few weeks, upgrades should be a lot more affordable with all of the new items coming out of the new and upgraded zones.</div></div><hr />
