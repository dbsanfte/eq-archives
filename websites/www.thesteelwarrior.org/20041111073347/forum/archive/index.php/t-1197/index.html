<br />
I play a 61 Ogre Warrior quite often and I've always heard/read and witnessed that we are immune to frontal stuns from mobs.  That was until I started MTing in PoV for the first time last week.  I was at the Lever camp and fighting Golems and Spiders and I kept getting stunned. Not just once but multple times.  At first I thought it was because I wasn't positioned directly in front of the mob so I corrected that but still continued getting stunned.  This went on for the 3 hour tanking period that I spent in PoV.  <br />
<br />
I haven't had this issue any other time prior.  I submitted a bug report but wanted to check here to see if there was some other explanation that I might have missed.  Are there any other Ogre warriors out there getting stunned from the front in PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are getting stuned from pure melee combat ( bash/kick/slam )?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">THat is because that stun is from a proc/spell and not from melee combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, Gulug is right.  PoV spiders and golems have procs that stun, and ogres are only immune to frontal melee stuns.  Buff up your mr, will stop those stuns =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kodi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Makes sense now. Thanks for all the responses and advice, I'll have to work up some of my resists then.</div></div><hr />
