<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, notice that this is not the outhouse. I fully intend for this to be a constructive discussion.<br />
<br />
I was purusing another thread here on mitigation vs avoidance and a derail brought to mind something that I mentioned before, but never really gave it much thought.<br />
<br />
Concern - AC values shown on the inventory and how each class has a softcap coded that after that point the recieve less benefit from AC compared to before.<br />
<br />
Now that I've clarified the topic, I'll post my comments.<br />
<br />
I believe that AC should have the same value across classes. It should be an absolute across classes similar to they way HPs are across classes. It doesn't matter if its a warrior or a wizard, if they have 4000 hps then they can take 4000 points of damage. AC should be the same way. There should be no ambiguity to it. A 1500 AC wizard should have they same DI distribution that a 1500 AC warrior has. Obviously if the warrior will make a better tank because he has more hps than the wizard, but IF they have the same AC and HPs they should tank equally well.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that there should be no AC differences between classes. Class differentiation should come from itemization and class multipliers/skills. The warrior would have a vastly easier time reaching 1500 AC compared to a wizard. Warrriors have a class multiplier to their HPs and AC that is much larger than a wizard. Also, warrior gear has more AC and HPs than the same tier wizard gear.<br />
<br />
Yes this means that I think that the innate warrior mitiagation bonus shold have been a larger AC multiplier instead of a hidden DI mod. I can imagine why they did this though, to keep player from being able to quantify the warrior advantage in a real way. (read: knights whould have fucking lost it if warriors would have been given an even larger AC bonus)<br />
<br />
In short, if I group with a wizard with more hps and AC then, hell, they should be tanking. No matter if its 1000 AC or 2000 AC.<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
On a related topic, and what got me thinking about this is that monks commonly say that they tank worse than a druid or beastlord, all of which are leather classes. I'm unsure if this is true or not, but if it is, I think we start to see the flaw in the system. Rogues being on chain mitigation tank better than monks and put out more DPS. Am I that only one that sees the flaw in this? They both have similar levels of utility, whats they justification? Rogue damage is situational? I thought all mobs had backs...<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, if the rogue is tanking, he can't be at the mobs back.<br />
<br />
I know that's not what you meant, but still haha.  Rogues damage is very situational, as a tank I try to be aware of the presence of rogues to make sure that the group (raid) doesn't push the mobs back up against the wall.  This tends to happen a lot in places like LDoNs were there are a ton of small rooms.  BST pets just push the prick right into the wall and won't let him up.  <br />
<br />
That being said, it's as situational as your group.  If your tank knows what he's doing, you will always get a free back to stab.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree 100% with this.<br />
I dont see a reason why AC from different classes should be handled different. It only makes things hard to compare.<br />
If i had to program this i would split AC in two values: one for Avoidance and one for Mitigation. I would eliminate all hidden modifiers like AAs, things like Shielding mods on your armor and class specific modifiers.<br />
All these modifiers would still exist, but you would be able to see immediately what they do on your mitigation and avoidance values.<br />
<br />
Thats the way it should be, just my opinion of course. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your forgetting that Melee get a higher defense cap than casters, they also get things like parry and riposte so naturally they' would have more &quot;Defensive&quot; capability's than casters who only receive dodge.  Which does make sense in my opinion.  It'd be cool to see an exact value of what every mod did in some calculated form though :p But a druid in full plate just isnt realistic in a fantasy genre and have less ability's available to them for them to be defensive at than a melee would have tha ability to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's simple why it needs to be this way.  If it wasn't, you would need 4 pieces of loot from every mob to serve the same purpose as all/all loot.  You would need a 10ac Robe, a 15 ac leather tunic, a 20ac chain tunic and a 30ac Breastplate. <br />
<br />
That raid would be real fuckin boring in about 3 weeks when all your druids and monks have their BP's and you're watching leather rot week after week after week after week.<br />
<br />
Make 1 all/all item, and modify the classes so that each class recieves the beneift that you want them to have, and you have a much better loot system.<br />
<br />
Mind you, that's not the best loot system that a MMO could have, but if they're not going to implement one where you get to pick your loot, then it's a much better system than watching no drop shit rot every week while the rest of your guild waits for upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass, there would be no need to itemize all armor types. All/all equipment could still exist and the class multiplier makes the difference. Just as it is now. Did you miss the class multiplier part, or am I misunderstanding you about the reason why all current all/all items could continue to exist (first sentence).<br />
<br />
Celestias, I'm not sure I made it clear, but the change I'm talking about would calculate AC based on all factors involved with mitigation. Avoidance AAs, skills, and mods would preferably be factored into this final AC value.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you got the druid in plate armor thing from, but thats not what I was trying to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
After thinking about it a little more, I think that changing the way AC is calculated, while it is a possible solution, would not be preferable. Perhaps an &quot;Defense Rating&quot; calculated simply for the sake of comparison would be preferable.<br />
<br />
Idealy, though, both a &quot;Mitgation Rating&quot; and an &quot;Avoidance Rating&quot; combined together to form a total effective &quot;Defense Rating&quot;. I'd be happy with AC being changed to this &quot;Defense Rating&quot;, but I know many people like things to stay as they are so maybe they would be happoer with the &quot;Ratings system&quot;.<br />
<br />
In either case, 1 AC should always equal the same effective mitigation regardless of class. AC should be just as valid of a progression path regardless of whether I wear silk, leather, chain, or plate and am at 1000, 1500, or 2000 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In EQ beta, 6 years ago, the avoidance and mitigation number were splited. Developers thought it would be too hard for players to fully understand how it worked and they combined it in a single number.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it would be time to split it back and let effects such as LR5 be visible on avoidance for exemple. (i.e each time you raise your LR, you see the avoidance number go up, like for HP and ND indeed ).<br />
<br />
Dodge, parry, block, riposte are all inherent to classes and then it's hardly something you'll be able to show up like AC. <br />
After all, AC is a way to see how good is your gear. For dodge and others, you check your skills..<br />
<br />
Shielding and stuff like that being not &quot;stats-based&quot;, I more likely think they are not part of your defensive abilities..<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
1) Raw mitigation AC between all classes should yields equivalent results for equivalent numbers<br />
2) Raw avoidance between all classes should work the same as mitigation, but there you won't be able to see the improvement given through parry, doge, riposte... So there will be a difference..</div></div><hr />

There already is a class multiplier.  As you can see, it's doing a fine job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Haass, and lets suppose for one second that I left off mentioning class multipliers or itemization and someone like you would correct me. Perhaps I should have said &quot;Class differentiation should and does come from itemization and class multipliers/skills.&quot; (I don't mean that the way it came out, but I'm too tired to rephare it. I mean no offense.)<br />
<br />
Anyway the point is, that I don't think it is doing a fine job. The current implementation is more ambiguous than it needs to be. Players still have no way of seeing how some skills, AAs, and mods have on their ability to take damage. What I'm proposing is something as clear and defined as HPs are today. Such important information I would think to be desirable from a very stat dependant class.<br />
<br />
Squizer, thanks for your input. I had almost forgoten that they had that in beta. As for parry/dodge/block/reposte, what I'm suggesting is that there should be a way to approximate the effect of these stats on tanking ability, and that they should be just as visible as the other stats. Players shouldn't be require to pour through message boards and run endless parses so that they can make a choice on gear and AA upgrades. Searching item databases to look for AC and HP upgrades is one thing, and you can be sure what effect those stats will have on your character. Skill mods, shielding and avoidance type mods are just as important as other stats except that with mods you have no clear way to tell if any or how much a difference that mod will make.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, I got that all out right. I'm very sleepy.</div></div><hr />

Oh I see what you're saying.  We gotta dumb down the game more because something like &quot;Armor Class&quot; is entirely too difficult to comprehend.  We really need stuff like this, cuz I wasn't sure what my Fungal Regrowth was doing on my Fungi Tunic for so long..until they changed it and told me it was regen 15 now.<br />
<br />
Here's the point.  SoE is run by a bunch of monkeys.  They can't even get the shit done that they have on their plate. I'd rather have them working on legitimate issues rather than working on explaining to us how the game works in an area that we're perfectly capable of figuring out on our own.  Sure, it would be nice if the game was set up like i hear WoW is, and we don't have to do parsing or shit like that, but the fact of the matter is that you currently can figure these things out if you take the time to do it.  And honestly, I'd rather have you wasting your time figuring it out than SoE wasting their time doing it when they could be doing something useful with my 13 bucks a month.</div></div><hr />

AC levels should be relative to the kind of armor you're wearing. What should make the distinction is the special effects it awards you.</div></div><hr />

The reason I don't like your idea is that it serves no purpose other than the cosmetic one of having the AC values that are displayed be more meaningful.  If SoE did what you suggest they would have to waste their time to go through and change AC values on almost all items.  Right now itemization is designed around the idea of AC meaning different things to different classes.<br />
<br />
I think a better solution would be to have the AC value that is displayed in your character screen to reflect the class DI in addition to AC values from item and defense level.  Then you would have an accurate, meaningful AC value without the need to retool so many caster items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are misunderstanding what is being suggested here, and I do think it is a valid point.  SoE should rework what is being displayed in the AC field of EQ, but not the 'RAW' AC value of any piece of armor...<br />
<br />
If a piece of armor contributes 10 RAW AC, then thats exactly what it adds.<br />
<br />
The issue that currently exists is the way it displays on your toon when you add it.<br />
<br />
If a warrior equips it, it automatically adds 16 or 17 to your total AC number, if some other class equips it, they get something different.<br />
<br />
What should be happening, is that when you equip the armor, your AC value should then reflect what the REAL change was to your AC (softcap included in the calculation).  In other words, if your sitting at 1500AC given the new calculation and you equip it, you should get a different number that you would if you were sitting at 1000AC and equip it.<br />
<br />
This would let players see exactly what the benefit of equipping that piece of armor would be at least from the perspective of mitigation. <br />
<br />
 I expect if the monks are ticked now, they would really be ticked if this was implemented, because I believe that once they hit the softcap, they are getting about the same benefit from RAW AC that casters get when they hit the soft cap, and that all other classes get more benefit from RAW AC.<br />
<br />
Frankly, this should be cake for SoE to implement, as they must be doing this calculation dynamically just to calculate mitigation during fights as it is.<br />

No Haas, your wrong...AC does have very much to do with it...the comparison of your ability to mitigate and the attack rating of the mob your fighting combine to determine how hard you get hit...but your AC is still your AC and it does not change.  SoE was quite clear in saying that the cap was the cap and that AC additions after the cap was mitigated..and that the cap was only changed by shields<br />
<br />
The current number shown is effectively only meaningful when comparing within a class...<br />
<br />
There is no reason SoE could not make the number meaningful across class boundaries...<br />

<br />
Well, if this is the most profound argument you have, then I rest my case.<br />
<br />
The current number shown is effectively only meaningful when comparing within a class... <br />
<br />
You know, I'm getting sick of people thinking that this is some kind of revelation.  Here's a fact -- You're uninformed, and just jumping on the bandwagon because someone convinced you that something drastic has changed recently, and now AC is no longer a viable number.<br />
<br />
AC has ALWAYS been only comparable between different classes, and that is because of defense caps.  A 500ac wizard takes damage much differently than a 500ac warrior, AND ALWAYS HAS.  Yet we don't see people campaigning that AC has been broken from the beginning, we see it now, after all the fucking monks came here and whined about it and convinced you people that this is news.  It's not, it's been around forever, and it doesn't change the fact that if you aren't retarded, you can figure out what your AC number means in relation to other people's.</div></div><hr />

I simply wish to join in this conversation as I saw it before the flames hit.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: This information is how I see it, if I am incorrect please feel free to correct.<br />
<br />
In the original game I believe ac=ac, the deciding factor was your defensive skill cap. You can test this now by creating a level 1 character and placing a 10 ac breast plate on him. Say at level 1 your ac is 0+agi making your displayed ac 5 (arguable just making a point) now with a defense of 0 you have 15ac. Take off the chest piece and put one skill point in defense. Your ac will now be somewhere around ac 6. Put the chest piece back on and your ac is now somewhere around 18. The higher your defense the more ac you got out of the item. Melee classes tended to cap their defense much higher than the other classes (and some still do) meaning they get more ac out of their gear even if adding all the displayed ac number on the gear is the same. (I.e. a full set of plate may equal 500ac put that on a cleric and their ac in the inventory window is now 650. Put the same armor on a warrior and their inventory ac is 850) In this way itemization balanced out all the classes. (Keep in mind with was before shielding and war innate bonuses and such, or even monk nerfs) At this time ac equaled ac for all classes.  Coincidently monks had a higher defense skill cap, BUT the best armor they could get was cured silk. (Average ac on cured silk I think was around ac3). I remember this because I used to watch my ac go up when my defense increased. And I tested this out by removing the armor to see how much ac I actually got out of it after a skill up.<br />
<br />
Enter Kunark, as the levels increased to 60 the skill caps for all classes also increased, but due to a flaw in the game engine the max you could get was 252 in any skill. Monks were already pushing this cap so to balance it out Verant gave monks a small increase in ac gear. Things were still kind of balanced.<br />
<br />
Now enter Velous, due to an increase in gear again and no raising of the skill caps Monks got even closer to warriors in over all ac. Thing were probably out of balance in the top end of gear.<br />
<br />
Then came Luclin and it got out of hand, Monks got their hands on gear with ac values on them they should have never had. This shot monks above warriors. To correct this, monks got a decrease in what their ac meant over all. So now for the first time ac does not equal ac in comparison to each class.<br />
<br />
I’m not sure if Warriors acutely got a bonus to what their ac means or not or how that 5% innate thing works maybe you guys can fill in the gap. From what I can gather for most of the other classes ac equals ac across the board only limited by their defense skill cap which makes that 10ac bracer more useful to a bard than a wizard because the bard gets maybe 15 ac off it and the wizard gets 12 ac. But still ac equals ac.<br />
<br />
Please don’t get me wrong I’m not trying to argue here about any nerf or how things SHOULD be. Just how thing were and why they changed. (As I see them) So from what I can tell yes, long a go AC did equal AC. They only difference was your skill cap.<br />
<br />
I think the reason why monks are so up in arms is they want to go back to the old way that they (we) had a much higher defense cap but the AC on our gear was WAY low. Realistically we can never go back there. But having AC=AC again would be nice.<br />
<br />
To be honest I don’t think there is a solution to this that will please everyone; there are so many factors involved now it would take rocket science to figure it out.<br />
<br />
I’m not saying everything here is fact, it’s what I’ve always believed. If you show me where I’m wrong I will digress, I don’t want this to turn into another flame war.</div></div><hr />

How can making AC reflect as much meaning as HP currently does be a bad thing? It's not exactly rocket science either, these calculations are already being made by the combat engine. I'm just proposing that SOE make AC mean the same across classes. Better mitigating characters have high AC scores. Its a simple concept, shouldn't be too hard to implement, and lets the player know when AC stops being an effective avenue of advancement for some classes. For instance, monks would know exactly what benefit a higher AC item will have on his ability to mitigate, so he can choose his gear in an informed way instead of the ambiguous system that is in place now.<br />
<br />
Forget all that stuff about &quot;defense rating&quot; and the like. Just make it so that if one character has a higher AC than another, you can know for sure that that person will mitigate better than one with a lower AC value, despite whether or not it is the same class or not.<br />
<br />
Showing avoidance separate from mitigation wouldn't be a bad idea either, but thats not the main thrust of this arguement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, if you don't seperate avoidance from mitigation in AC, you can't EVER make an AC value that means definitively that person A takes damage better than person B.<br />
<br />
Second of all, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK.  This is a non issue and it has been a non issue for a long time.  The only reason that it even looks like an issue is because one class is pissed off about being put in their place and is taking miniscule fragments of data and using them to justify their position.  <br />

What's the title of this thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the original game I believe ac=ac, the deciding factor was your defensive skill cap. <br />
<br />
I believe in beta (I'm sure a beta EQ person is floating around here somewhere) they had 2 values in the UI: mitigation and avoidance.  This was later watered down (for perceived usability/comprehension concerns) to AC...so goes the story.  Your history sounds about right.<br />
<br />
Haass has a very good point here; don't focus on AC, focus on getting the mitigation and avoidance buckets shown in the UI.  That will allow you to make observations regarding relative classes performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed. Splitting avoidance and mitigation (or having the option to) would be nice. <br />
<br />
However, my AC didn't change when I got my defensive AA's, so it's really not going to do much unless they drastically change the way the displayed AC value is calculated to include softcap effects such as AA and shield bonuses.<br />
<br />
Sadly though, even that is not going to do much for us given all the new modifiers that <br />
don't appear in AC, and would probably be very difficult to include (shielding, spell shielding, avoidance, DI-1, dot shielding, parry I-III, and whatever else).<br />
<br />
I would be surprised if at this point EQ has a single number they use for mitigation or avoidance comparisons, so asking them to display it instead of AC isn't likely to go anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Title of the thread is semi-irrelevant Haas.  And really, there should be no difference in concept between mitigation and displayed AC...that is the point I believe Vikken was trying to make.<br />
<br />
This is not about monks....not sure where that is coming from<br />
<br />
This is about being able to judge the value of adding an AC item to your toon just as you can judge the value of adding HP items to  your toon.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way and maybe it will penetrate what I am hoping is a haze caused by too much EQ and not enough sleep.<br />
<br />
If you get a 230hp item, its pretty easy to know what its adding to your character regardless of class...<br />
<br />
If you get a 230 mana item, its pretty easy to know the value of adding the item (useless trash for a warrior)<br />
<br />
If you get a 50AC item (was gonna use 230AC, but lets not be silly), you really have no idea what its doing to your character.  <br />
<br />
It displays as adding a certain value to the AC field, but the actual change to mitigation has, as you yourself have stated, very little to do with what that does to your actual mitigation, and you have no real basis to make a judgement call as to the value of the addition to your toon.<br />
<br />
This is just as applicable to warriors as it would be to monks or any other class in EQ...we all take hits at some point in time...<br />
<br />
There is no reason that SoE cannot address this.<br />

Hop over to the outhouse and browse around.  You'll figure out very quickly just what this thread was hinting at.  This thread is a continuance of a rant about class mitigation and the grey areas surrounding the &quot;ac&quot;.  Quite frankly, it has no business being in this section.  Please move this over to the war room (class balance) or the Outhouse.  Better yet, just tack it on to the existing rant and remove some of the clutter.<br />
<br />
There should be no difference btw mitigation and displayed ac?  Fair enough ... i want to see my ac go up with every defensive aa i buy.  I want to see my ac go up with every level that i get (levels, not skill, mind you).  I want to see my beefy Class ac bonus that lets me mitigate 10 or more % better than every other class out there (You know .. the one that lets me tank like a knight of equal hps with 700 more ac than me ... or a monk with 2000 more ac).  My guess is that if these numbers were visible you'd just have more people pissing themselves in outrage over something that has been an integral part of the game and class balance since day fucking 1.<br />
<br />
What do you see in the end?  Warriors will still end up tanking a certain % better than knights who will tank a certain % better than ....  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The numbers are there ... you just cannot see them.  But in the day and age of mana regen +5 versus Flowing thought 5 and Regen + 15 vs Fungal Regrowth ... i gues it isnt all too surprising that you have 101 fuckwits actually worrying about shit like this.<br />

Heh, damn some of you are full of yourselves...by the way Ap, this has nothing to do with dumbing down the game, just because I havent posted here much before does not mean I am clueless...I have been playing this silly game longer than you have...since beta in fact.<br />
<br />
I was one of the people against the combining of mitigation and avoidance numbers, and yes, I do mean that your magic mitigation number would change when you bought a defensive AA or leveled up...why not?  I also think your ATK number should change as offensive AA's are purchased or you leveled...<br />
<br />
I am an old tabletop AD&amp;D player...what I am against, and always have been, is the constant mis-direction, mis-representation, sleight of hand and pure deception that has gone on in the EQ codebase.<br />

Each class is going to mitigate differently than the next.  Beef your ac up as high as you can and just enjoy the game.  It really is silly that everyone is so obsessed with numbers these days.  Last time i checked, this was a video game ... not an accounting class.  The more and more numbers you start tossing out, the less mystery and (dare i say) magic there is in the game.  Showing the numbers wont change a damn thing in the game ... i'll just give people reasons to be pissed off.

What is the importance that you know what the mitigation value is?  A piece of gear has 45 ac and another has 55ac.  WHICH WOULD YOU TAKE?????????<br />
<br />
And the AC displayed is just like HP's for a warrior.  Both get a mod.  If you put on a 100hp piece of gear, you're going to get more than 100hp from it.  If you put on a 100ac item, you're going to get more than 100ac.<br />

Quite frankly, this discussion is retarded.  Holywrath is right, this isn't going to change a fucking thing except tell you things we already know.<br />
<br />
If you don't already know it, then I suggest you spend about 1/10 of the time you spend worrying about this learning game mechanics, and you'd probably be set.<br />
<br />
Hell, if you want, you can just spend that time reading this board, and reading the archived library posts, and they'll tell you exactly what you need to know about the game mechanics.  I would rather have people down at SoE working on things that need fixing, rather than this worthless bullshit that you should already know if you're reading this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read these boards will not tell me what I want to know. If my druid has the choice of an item with more AC and one with more HPs, which will benefit me better. If my monk has the same choice and is at 1300 or so AC, which would be the better choice. What I'm saying is that with current in-game stats, theres not way to tell which will improve my character better. For warriors, its pretty obvious, however for other classes its not so obvious. Each class after a certain level of AC has a point in which AC is no longer an avenue of development. How about letting these classes have the benefit of useful data when choosing upgrades instead of the sueless numbers they currently have.<br />
<br />
If a druid at 1300 AC mitigates nearly the same as a druid with 1500 AC, how about letting them know. 1500 AC shouldn't be displayed if it effectively acts like 1350 AC. (made up numbers) The current system in inaccurate and misleading.<br />
<br />
This is not about class balance, this is not about monk mitigation, this is not a rant thread. Do not make it so. I have a hard time believing that anyone would be apposed to this change. I guess I was wrong. Change is not bad, only bad changes are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 1ac = 6hp formula isn't working for you anymore?<br />
<br />
Changing AC into mitigation and avoidance still isn't going to give you a way to compare it to HP, so I still fail to see what you're talking about, and honestly, I think you're grasping at straws at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is different for all classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass, you're still missing the point. This isn't just for warriors. This isn't about hp to ac conversions. This is about the way that 4000 HPs on a caster means exactly the same thing as 4000 HPs on a tank. It's absolute, it doesn't matter how my hps currently are, if i add a + 100 hp item i get a full 100 hps off of it, it doesn't matter what class I am, 1 HP means 1 HP regardless of class.<br />
<br />
Now AC is different. Adding AC does not add an absolute bonus to my mitigation. It matters what class I am. It matters what my current AC already is.<br />
<br />
For instance, and this is just an example:<br />
<br />
A rouge has 1500 AC and he gets a new breastplate with 50 more AC than his current one does. When he equips that BP it shows a 50 AC increase, but the effect is quite different. He will not mitigate like he increased AC by 50. He's not even going to mitigate with 1500 ac like a warrior mitigates with 1500 AC. So essentially the numbers are useless. Sure, a higher number is better, but how much pay off are you getting for your upgrade, how much better will you mitigate.<br />
<br />
I'm saying is if your AC shows 1300AC, all classes with 1300 AC should mitigate the same. Does this mean that if this is changed, some classes will start showing significantly less AC in their inventories? Yes, Monks come to mind, those currently 1800 AC monks I suspect will be showing around 1400 if they are lucky. This will mean that they mitigate exactly the same as a warrior with 1400 ac.<br />
<br />
Another benefit is that they could modify how items are inspected to show what actual effect they will recieve by wearing that item. Similar to the recommended level ()'s show differently than the base (full) item stats.<br />
<br />
I don't know how else to better explain it. I'm not saying to improve or nerf other classes mitigation. Just change the numbers shown in game to reflect the actual benefit the wearer recieves in mitigation. These calculations are already made, just show the final result. As it is, some classes have no idea what real beneift they will recieve in mitigation from increasing thier AC.</div></div><hr />

So, er, the only alts I've been playing lately are those so I haven't looked around at other classes. The zerkers might not have got too far figuring out relative importance/availability/etc of gear but the classes I sorta know have.<br />
<br />
The game is complicated and parts of its engine obscure and much of the hard math behind it has for its goal the production of variation within unknown parameters, so that when you square up against mobs at least some of the time you have no idea what will happen. Because if you did, you'd stop playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Player had already worked out mana numbers well before they were displayed ingame. This is a similar change. Why can't displayed AC be normalized across classes? I just don't understand why there's so much contempt for such a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CLASSES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF AVOIDANCE AC BASED UPON THEIR DEFENSE CAP.<br />
<br />
THIS INFLUENCES THE AMOUNT OF AC YOU HAVE, AND AS SUCH, DETERMINES HOW MUCH OF YOUR AC IS MITIGATION AC AND THAT IS WHERE THE DIFFERENCE LIES.<br />
<br />
It is not that fucking difficult.  A monk has a higher avoidance than a druid due to his defense cap.  For him to have the same AC as a druid, the druid has to have much more mitigation AC to make up for the fact that he doesn't have as much avoidance AC, AND THEREFORE HE WILL MITIGATE BETTER.<br />

This isn't the &quot;monks think mitigation &gt; avoidance&quot; thread. If you would kindly reread this thread, and throw out that junk that going on in the monk thread, I'm quite sure you'll see the error in that last statement. I'm not talking about druids mitigating better than monks. As I've stated multiple times in this thread as clearly as I can.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am aware that currently AC is a composite of avoidance and mitigation AC if that's what you are trying to get at. I'm saying that the mitigaion portion should be normalized across classes to reflect similar numbers for simialr mitigation. If adding X amount of mitigation (item) AC as shown in my inventory nets me Y amount of mitigation, as a warrior, it should also do so no matter what my class.<br />
<br />
Same should apply similarly for avoidance AC. They should carry the same weight as shown in the inventory. 100 avoidance AC as seen in the inventory should reflect the same amount of avoidance regardless of class. I think it works this way already with avoidance AC though I don't know for a fact.<br />
<br />
Similarly, mitigation AC should provide the same DPS reduction over time that avoidance AC point for point. Again, this may be the way it works now.<br />
<br />
I really can't explain it much simpler than that.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is, that I'm not being dense. You are misunderstanding what I am trying to say. I can only guess that maybe my english is not so good, but I'm quite sure you are missing the point instead.</div></div><hr />

What I do want to see changed is to have more information shown in the inventory window. This is in light of the recent about face change to decide to display mana numbers.<br />
<br />
What I want to see is post formula mitigation (and perhaps avoidance) AC values.<br />
<br />
You can go ahead and keep the current AC value.<br />
<br />
But I also want to see the real AC post cap value.<br />
<br />
This would allow me to see that when I add 50 ac to my bp slot, my real AC post cap goes up by only 50/10 = 5 points. <br />
<br />
This would allow me to see when I add that same 50 ac to my shield slot, my real AC goes up by a full 50 points.<br />
<br />
This would allow a warrior to see that going from 1400 to 1500 ac, his real ac goes up by a full 100 points, while a wizard going from 1400 to 1500 ac, his real ac goes up by only 100/10 10 points.<br />
<br />
Now, these examples are using made up numbers for the break points, and while I have heard that the max cap tier is 1/10 to AC, it is not direct enough for me to be sure thats really what it is (what I heard was 1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, but that might be incorrect).<br />
<br />
The point is, by just displaying one additional number, we would be able to see this.<br />
<br />
This would be a huge win when you are trying to argue for that AC augment that a monk wants. You can say, look, when you add it, your real AC is only going to go up this much, while when I put it on my shield, I will get the full benefit, etc.<br />

Would love to see the real Modified AC after the cap calculations have been done.</div></div><hr />

So the cap is beyond 3000 ac.<br />
<br />
Also, mitigation and avoidance ac is the SAME for all classes except monks.  A cleric mitigates the same with the same MITIGATION ac as a warrior.  An enchanter mitigates the same with the same MITIGATION ac as a warrior.<br />
<br />
Warriors have higher avoidance than clerics or enchanters, so with the SAME AC will be hit less but mitigate worse.  In other words if you have a warrior with 1000 ac and you compare that to an enchanter at 1000 ac you will find these items true:<br />
<br />
1) The enchanter takes higher DPS.<br />
2) The enchanter takes less damage per hit.<br />
3) The warrior is hit significantly less often.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure, no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's true.<br />
<br />
A 1000 ac chanter is pretty fuckin uber, and has a massive amount of mitigation AC.<br />
<br />
A 1000 ac warrior is pretty weak, and doesn't have jack shit for mitigation AC since the majority of it is in his defense skill (avoidance AC).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why is defense skill &quot;avoidance AC&quot; instead of mitigation? Has somebody actually parsed it out to affect avoidance instead of mitigation? My anecdotal evidence says a 1000AC cleric still gets the hell beat out of them mitigation wise compared to a 1000AC warrior, which would put an enchanter in an even worse situation.<br />
<br />
It seems as if dodge, parry, riposte, etc would constitute &quot;avoidance&quot;, leaving defense as the only skill affecting mitigation. But wtf do I know about it...<br />
<br />
By that line of reasoning, the only thing affecting class mitigation is the warrior DI-1 advantage or &quot;damage tables&quot; whatever the heck those are, since the effects of skill caps affect avoidance only. I've gotta say I'm skeptical of this. Aside from avoiding less, a cleric with more AC than I have (and possibly even less of it coming from avoidance since they only get dodge) appears to get hit FAR harder than I do.</div></div><hr />

Your anecdotal evidence is confusing mitigation with DPS.  Let's revisit Haass's earlier quote and apply it to the example you just made.  The 1000AC cleric mitigates better than a 1000AC warrior, but has far worse avoidance than the warrior, so overall the cleric takes more DPS.  Make sense?<br />
<br />
Why does the cleric mitigate better? Because he has more AC on gear.<br />
Why does the cleric avoid worse? Because he has less defense skill.<br />
Why does your anecdotal evidence say otherwise? Because all you see is the cleric getting the hell beat out of him, you don't see why.<br />
It seems as if dodge, parry, riposte, etc would constitute &quot;avoidance&quot;, leaving defense as the only skill affecting mitigation. <br />
Here you are wrong.  Defense skill and agility provide you with avoidance, which causes you to see &quot;misses&quot; in combat.  (Monk and iksar AC bonuses are also pure avoidance).</div></div><hr />

Don't mean to be a dick or anything, but a lot of these things have been common knowledge for awhile now.  Yes, it has been established, and yes, that establishment has already been lost to the sands of time.  If you take issue with it, prove it wrong, I'm not gonna be burden of proof for every new question about old topics.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm not trying to be a dick, I just don't know how else to put it.  I spent enough time on the parsers in my day proving people wrong.  Time for someone else to do it.<br />
<br />
Sassinak pretty much covered everything else.  This is why statements such as &quot;We mitigate worse than XXXX, we must be broken&quot; are complete bullshit and have no relevance on real game discussions, because mitigation does not equate to DPS taken in any way, shape or form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to be clear to some of those that just started playing EQ last week:<br />
<br />
1) Defense skill is used in calculating mitigation *** AND *** avoidance AC.<br />
2) Parry, Dodge, Riposte, Block are all used to increase Avoidance.<br />
3) PoTime Avoidance mod items increase avoidance.<br />
4) Shielding decreased DB (one could say a form of mitigation.)<br />
5) Improved Dodge/Parry provide a bonus to avoidance.<br />
6) It has been parsed between classes with near identical mitigation AC (+/ 10 AC) that have the same spread of intervals (DI) on the hits;  They had different AC totals but had the same mitigation AC (and the warrior had a whole lot more avoidance AC); The non warriors took far more DPS due to d/p/r skill caps.<br />
7) The developers have &quot;suggested&quot; there is special code to limit mitigation just for monks.  It has been recently hinted this may soon be removed.</div></div><hr />
