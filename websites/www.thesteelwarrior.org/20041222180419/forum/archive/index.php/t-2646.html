<br />
My sta is over 200 with equipment..  when my bar is empty during battle does that effect my dps negatively at all?  <br />
<br />
I was just curious.  I didnt think it mattered but thought I should double check... also if anyone is bored, could you check my magelo profile &amp; suggest some upgrades? I know I could use some ornate upgrades...<br />
<br />
My weapons are WMBS and GSoT and Windblade )  TY :)<br />

<br />
Is your base STA under 100? If yes, then your stamina bar does all kinds of crap... glad I don't fall in this category :P<br />
<br />
Base STA means naked, without gear or buffs, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually it's not your base but your curretn sta. base has no bearing whatsoever on anything other then what your sta will be with the buffs/items you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Base stamina includes gear and buffs as well.<br />
<br />
The only time you suffer detrimental effects, such as not being able to jump, and some reduced stats is when your stamina is under 100 and the bar is empty.<br />
<br />
At 200, you are fine, and the only issue is being unable to jump while fatigued.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it's general knowledge that stamina means nothing over 100, but can someone find a parse?  I prefer having something to point towards so people don't think I'm just pulling stuff out of my ass, even if others agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck you can even buff casters with stm, so they are over 100, and they can cast oos.</div></div><hr />

I think Brutul parsed it way back...but that was like when I started posting here, so it's been awhile, could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Casters do not need stamina to cast.<br />

Ever.</div></div><hr />

If your current Sta (including equipment and buffs) is 99 or below, you do suffer negative effects.  If it's 100 or above then the only problem is jumping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there was the idea that even if your stamina was over 100, if you were out of the stamina bar you'd miss a lot more or you'd do less damage per hit, or something like that.<br />
<br />
I believe someone parsed it, and found no real change.  So either it does nothing if Sta is over 100, or there is something that happens, but is so small it's statistically insignificant.  Need to find the parsing so our words are backed up tho.</div></div><hr />

My UI has no stamina bar <br />
at all<br />
 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matsuri</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not to stir the pot but I was under the effect that warriors do not suffer from low stamina bar with below 100 base stamina, and other melee (monks/pal/bard/ranger/sk) suffer effects from reduced strength/sta to even slowed attacks.</div></div><hr />
