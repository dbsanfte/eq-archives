I also have a Swiftblade of Zek and a Greatstaff of Thunder.  So my question is what should I use to keep aggro?<br />
<br />
The Stormrider Carapace has 54 ac, 15 sta, 125 hp, Furious Bash IV.  So that increases my bash hate by 40%.  It works on every bash too.  However, my bash skill is only about 30 for the time being.  So will the Blade of Carnage and Stormrider Carapace generate more aggro than any of the other weapons/ combos?  If not, would skilling up bash help?<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping in advance :)<br />
<br />
Just as a side note, I felt so dirty looting a sheild.  I look like a friggin paladin when I use it.<br />

I don't think it will do more aggro than your other combos, but it should do around the same aggro.<br />
<br />
I have been tanking for months now with Bloodfrenzy and a Furious Bash shield. (Once a FB3, now FB5), and have had no problems keeping aggro when I need to.</div></div><hr />

I've been messing around with the BoC and shield combo and it seems to be working really well.  I'm assuming it will work better once my bash skill is maxed.<br />
<br />
In an exp group I was able to hold aggro with the shaman maloing and slowing right as I engaged and the enchanter tashing.  Only lost aggro a few times so I'm hoping that's just cuz my bash sucks, I don't even remember the last time I lost aggro using a Greatstaff of Thunder :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you can ghetto bash with it, but by using Stormrider carapace to ghetto bash, I find that the increase in agro is offset by my lack of attention to people in my group casting... I.E. I forget to time my taunts well, and I lose agro /blush.  Perhaps when I get more used to it it'll work better.</div></div><hr />
