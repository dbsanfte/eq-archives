<br />
Flameforge Hammer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18863) <br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010) <br />
Cord Hilted Spike Driver (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16391) <br />
<br />
None of them seem to stand out from the rest. From what I have seen most seem to agree that a stun is ~400 hate and if DD damage is 1 hate per point of DD then the procs of these weapons should be:<br />
<br />
Flameforge Hammer  ~475 hate<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking  ~579 hate<br />
Cord Hilted Spike Driver  450 hate<br />
<br />
So the procs are all pretty close and none have an increased proc rate. DPS the Flameforge Hammer should win that one in agro. Any opinions?<br />
<br />
I tend to think the Flameforge Hammer is the better one of the 3.</div></div><hr />

So lets not look at what is currently auged and just what is the best of those weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd use the flameforge hammer. Best ratio, probably close to the same aggro per proc (DD hate isn't 1:1, btw, though I don't know what it's at) and the most hp. The fact that it stuns up to 65 is also pretty nice, compared to straight hate. If it looks unique at all, that'd be a cool bonus too.</div></div><hr />

The ~579 was the estimate hate of the proc itself Force Strike. As you said the potential damage of Force Strike is 179 (as a side note this spell is hit ot miss. There is no partical resist for this and all magic based Wizard spells I believe but not sure about all. I know this is all of nothing though which makes it easier to resist) and has a stun component to it. So I was saying if DD is a 1:1 ratio to hate which Fitemore is saying is not true (I honestly am not sure) and stuns are estimated at 400 hate then the total hate of Force Strike would be ~579. That is what I was saying. Your BoW (assuming you do mean Blade of War) is a hate proc only (Enraging Blow) and does no DD damage so not sure what you meant by that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DD is NOT 1:1 for casted spells.  There is no reason to assume it is 1:1 for procs.<br />
<br />
Also, the estimate of 400 hate for stuns is just that, an estimate.  It may be as low as 300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Oth,there's no way the CHOS produces that much hate relative to EB weaps and CHSDs etc.The CHSD is slightly better aggro imo and I would offhand it over the other 2.Any of the 3 will work great, especially auged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i meant that hate isnt 1 damage to 1 hate generated. my BoW has the potential swing of about 400ish non disc (im just guessing as i dont watch my damage all that much) if the ratio was 1:1 then i would be generating 400 aggro per swing of my BoW which is very far from accurate. i was saying CHoS isnt 579 because the proc isnt going to be 179 hate. if the ratio was 1:1 then ethereal destroyer from time wouldnt be the crap for aggro that it is, because it would be 700ish hate on a 1:1 ratio. so if we think that stun is about 400 hate, and CHoS has a 179 DD i would put that about 420ish hate from the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've always stun hate to be 450-500 ... not sure where this new default of 400 is coming from.  a stun proc &gt; anger 2 proc, and we know that anger 2 is exactly 400 hate.<br />
<br />
i'd say the proc on hammer and CHSD are pretty much =</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw stuns as being 350-400 aggro when people were doing hate testing. I chose 400 as a likely and easy to work with number, but there is no way stuns in general are as much as 500 hate imo. That'd put ykesha procs almost on par with anger 3, which just doesn't seem to be the case. Ykesha procs *seem* to be more on par with anger 2, which is reasonable. Stun procs were being rated as better than anger 2 because they add DPS for the same aggro. This is, at least, the way I have understood things. I don't have an hard and fast facts or links for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it seems to be accepted that CHSD proc is better than GBoS proc but the GBoS ends up better because of dps, which proves that stuns arent 450 hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er some people are rating stun too high Imo.I actually preferred anger 2 to stun proc's and ma'd with an a2 CHSD mainhanded  against yak auged stun procers well.They're close...certainly eb was a distinct jump from anger 2,stun,taunting blow etc.I don't believe that stun alone &gt; taunting blow or even anger 2.Possibly equal to a2 or probably slightly less for pure aggro  imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use flameforge hammer and it is noticably a lot more agro than a CHoS, thats why I got rid of my CHoS for my off hand weapon.  Flameforge has a better ratio and seems to do more dps than the CHoS also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW+A3 and SEWS+Ykesha are my 2Handers<br />
<br />
Ratio are identical while i have 3 different proc :<br />
Rune3 = Minimalistic agro, need 3 4 to turn a mob.<br />
Ykesha = Moderate Agro, Usually One , sometimes 2 procs will do the trick in LDoN.<br />
A3 &amp; EB = 1 Proc is very often sufficient to turn the mob.<br />
<br />
It is impossible to tell the difference between EB &amp; A3  (700 vs 600).<br />
It is possible to tell the difference between EB/AE  &amp; Ykesha (So the gap must be 100+)<br />
Rune3 is really low agro the difference is huge.<br />
<br />
My guess ?<br />
EB = 700<br />
AE = 600<br />
Ykesha = 350-450 (hard to tell)<br />
Rune3 = 200 at best<br />
<br />
<br />
As to &quot;funky 1hander agro&quot;<br />
I have found Etheral Destroyer (16/22 DD750) and JoS (29/25 DD60 -9AC)<br />
To be more than decent agro.<br />
<br />
With some lucky procs on the ED, i can generate almost the same agro as the sews+ykesha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personnal opinion is for Hate value:<br />
Stun = 400 <br />
DD = 2:3  (this is the aproximate hate ratio of DD found on Graff's board)<br />
if so (with WA5 and Ambi and Sinis. Strike, that you have) I estimate the value of theese three weapons as (in % , 100%  goes for the best of them, and it decrease for the other):<br />
Main Hand : CHOS=100%  &gt; CHSD=97%  &gt; FH=90%<br />
Second Hand : CHOS=100%  &gt; FH=98%  &gt; CHSD=96%<br />
<br />
if we use a Hate value of 350 for stuns, we get<br />
Main Hand : CHSD=100%  &gt; CHOS=99%  &gt; FH=89%<br />
Second Hand : CHSD=100%  &gt; CHOS=99%  &gt; FH=97%<br />
<br />
we can see that they are prety close, especially the CHOS and the CHSD so you can use whatever you want. CHSD is a sure choice because it is not subject of estimation, moreover it is not as common as the CHOS (&quot;oh no, another chos ~&gt; bazard warrior, again!&quot;), but the CHOS looks a little bit better to me.<br />
<br />
So if your CHOS (or your CHSD if your magelo is exact) is already auged, stick with it till you can transfert the aug to the one YOU prefer.<br />
<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE : I made this estimation without counting any aug nor spell proc and with a 41%  haste (it doesn't change hate from proc, but it change the number of potential swings and thus hate from potatial DPS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So assuming you are right or at least close to right Yoda then it would sound like the FH is better cause if in the offhand the procs are really close then the DPS of the weapon would be a deciding factor and the FH should win that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe past tests have shown that the offhand generates negligible &quot;DPS aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With CHoS+Anger2 aug and un-auged SotBS I can out agro a BoC+GBoS (both unauged), so I would put stun hate ~400-450. It's definately better than any DD proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHSD had slightly better aggro for us than CHOS.It's a better aggro weapon than the other two imo.Upgrading to the CHSD for our warriors was a  noticable improvement over the CHOS not a big one though.Heck even in the mainhand one of our warriors was forever swapping his CHSD and GBOS around.I'd agree with the general view that the GBOS is a little better due to it's much better ratio,but,it was very hard to notice a real differance in practice.<br />
<br />
A really significant jump comes with the next level of weapons with eb procs or comparable hate weapons with proc mods and debuff procs etc.The FH never seemed great to me ,but, I never owned one ok for dps I guess.I'd tank with the CHSD once it's comparably auged and whatever of the other 2 offhand.The augs will make a huge differance.Much more then the weapons innate contrast in aggro.I think the CHSD is the best unauged.Bear in mind we don't really know the exact value of a stun and dd's blow for aggro.Just imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need like two warriors with same WA, and similiar dex.. to duke it out with a mob, one using an unaugged CHoS, and someone else with a non proccing 13/20 aug an anger 2 or 3, then we can know alot better far as comparsions..</div></div><hr />
