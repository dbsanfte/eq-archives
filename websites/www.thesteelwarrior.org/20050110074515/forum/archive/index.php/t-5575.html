Purchase the boxed retail version of EverQuest: Gates of Discord and get a special in-box and in-game item (while supplies last). The Taelosian Staff is a great keepsake, sure to be the envy of every Norrathian - and it will o_nly be available in boxed versions of the expansion.  <br />
<br />
translation: Hello all you suckers that pre-ordered the expansion for the full retail price... look at what you could have gotten, a free in game item with your expansion. Yes the box set costs us more to make, ship, sell but with any luck you suckers will buy it as well just for the *cough*rare item.<br />
<br />
next expansion I would not be suprised if they charged you more to pre-order it (most places had ldon 10 bucks cheaper o_n release day here so that has happened already)</div></div><hr />

Maybe and thats a BIG maybe, the faction adjust will be worth a TINY bit, thats it. A lot of us want a disk, not download anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really curious about the faction modifier.<br />
<br />
If it is the only way to raise that faction, or if that faction is a bitch to raise, then it really fucks over others.<br />
If it is low enough to not fuck over those who download, then it's not worth bothering.<br />
<br />
Having a special look, whatever, don't really care.<br />
<br />
Fucked up way to treat the people who are usually the more loyal group though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I suspect the faction modifier is on par with the PoK faction modifer from that book  ... don't remember the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's no different than say if you buy a game at Best Buy when they've a special offer you get like an extra thing you can redeem online.  It's been done plenty of times to try to get retailers a slight boost.  In LDoN you get an Abu-Kar's Satchel or whatever if you bought it retail.  It's also no different thanyou don't get your Firionia Vie statues anymore when you buy EQ now, at least I don't think you get those anymore.  Just normal marketing tricks, unless the item turns out to be actually powerful, which I doubt.  I'd imagine that faction with the Taelosians is tied to the storyline, i.e. no matter how many yard trash you kill you can't get the quest for the end zone unless you actually killed uber mob whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the LDoN bag kinda sucked.<br />
<br />
But the QUEST to improve it made it pretty good. I actually want one for my warrior alt. But I already have LDoN. /sigh<br />
<br />
The faction stick may SUCK right out of the box. BUT, what if, with a small quest, like the bag, it then becomes good?<br />
<br />
Not a bad deal.<br />
<br />
I dunno. I'm waiting on the boxed version anyways. Gates does not excite me enough to DL it. And, to give you an idea of how sucky that has to be ... I DID Download Ykesha, because dyes and bankspace excited me enough to DL it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am actaully fucking sony, not the other way round on this. <br />
<br />
I have never preordered an expantion, though I have predownloaned GoD.<br />
<br />
I am planning to by a GoD box (same price as the DL version) and get the free stuff, while never inserting the CD into my system. So I will get the free stuff and SOE will have to play for me getting the game twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">YA, WAY TO STICK IT TO THE MAN!<br />
<br />
Er, wait.  How exactly does that stick it to the man?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Haass said. You'll get the keychain for what? $30, but no ingame item since you're account will be registered as a download. If I understand it correctly you'll be paying $60 instead of $30 and putting money in their pocket.<br />
<br />
I sure hope that was meant as sarcasm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You download it for free, activating it is what costs money.  Buying the store one and using the code from that gets you the items, and you don't have to use the CD.  I still don't see how it screws SOE at all though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what they mean is that SOE puts the downloads for GoD up on the patcher, most everyone and their mother is downloading what is made availible now before release, to cut down on installation time, ie, using up SOE's resources. (I have no idea what it casts them, if anything, to have 10's of 1,000's of people downloading the GoD packets from their patcher)<br />
<br />
Then they just go out and buy the disc that has most of what was on the patcher, and enter their registration key. All they are paying for is the Key and whatever gifts are in the box, and getting automatically, everything those that preordered got.<br />
<br />
Personally, I see it as those that buy it retail are getting something physical, as well as digital, for the same price as those that are preordering and only getting data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinklehimer</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Acutally I am going to buy the box set just due to the fact that I am on dial up and cant tie up the phone line for 16+ hours to download it.  Well let me restate that the WIFE doesnt want me to tie up the phone line for 16+ hours lol.  If i had a better connection then i would download it but i live in BFE and dial up is my only option at this time lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pff, if you can't tie up the phone line for 16 hours, it's not even worth playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your statement rings true on SO many levels haass :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashemz</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seperate phone lines        /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what Kailyn means is that Sony sells both for the same price.  On one they have to pay for bandwidth/server hardware for you to download it, on the other they have to stamp a CD and print a box.  If you download and then buy the box they have to pay for both.  I don't imagine the download really costs much, but it was just a joke.  <br />
<br />
Too much of this board is just looking for something to flame about.  My two cents is that I don't really give a crap if you think everything sucks.  Especially if you're saying the same thing for the 50,000th time or (this happens a lot) parroting some flame you read on the FoH board.  At least try to be original.  Nothing is more pathetic that plagerized whining.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinklehimer</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually not going to spring for the second phone line just due to my ISP sucks major horse parts.  We are suppose to get wireless in the next 2 months so i will splurge on that.  Connection will be more stable once that comes out. Its sad when your ISP boots you every 2 hours or so.  Call them up and they say they do not see any issues as to why it would do it.  /shrug dealt with it for this long guess a couple more months wont hurt lol</div></div><hr />
