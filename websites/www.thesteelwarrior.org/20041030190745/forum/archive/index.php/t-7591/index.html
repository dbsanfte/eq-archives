<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current guild is slowly dispersing.  We were moving along till the summer hit and we took some heavy person loss which has started to really snowball.  As it stands now I dont see us being able to *Raid* much past the BoT Towers in PoP, and while I havent spent much time in GoD I dont see that as an option for us.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
<br />
Based on my current magelo am I going to be looking at LDONs for upgrades or can you all think of other areas I might be able to hit with say a solid group of 65s (Non E-Planed)?<br />
<br />
Cash isnt really flowing, but if it can be bought its an option so let me know.<br />
<br />
Magelo is here:<br />

<br />
Sorry for the Same ? Differnt Day post, but didnt see one yet today.<br />
<br />
Hala<br />
<br />
PS Looking at finishing up PD and PP AAs, then working WA and Sturdiness 2 or 3, then maybe some DPS type AAs unless there seems to be a better route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not sure how the economy is on your server, but on Eci those boots go for huge obsene amounts of cash.  I would sell those boots and either buy Boots of the Storm if they are less cash or just get the points for the LDoN boots from Nro.  Or better yet, farm the boots from the hard MM adv (Bloodied boots of dark rites or something).  Almost same stats as Boots of storm.  <br />
<br />
In fact, I would suggest hitting hard ldon advs a lot and getting the Neck piece from Nro, bracers from EF and Gloves from Nro.  I would farm ldon points for the Nro pants.  I would buy a Heavy rubicite girdle or farm on from CT (25 ac 80 hps).<br />
<br />
Your other slots are pretty decent for your level.  If you sold the boots you could probably buy a Steel ring of earthen energy, but the upgrade would not be that large.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd recommend the following drops from LDoN hard:<br />
Mir:  Haste back, regen ring, bracer<br />
MM: Boots, ring<br />
Ruj: belt, neck, gloves<br />
Tak: earring, mask<br />
<br />
You'll have to repurchase the ac augs on some of that, or perhaps you can wait and see if they actually make it so you can reuse em.<br />
<br />
Might want to look at copper hammer as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would agree farming LDON hard adventures with your friends till AAs/drops start piling up.  After that, I would head on over to GOD and farm sewer trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you wanted to sell the boots for big bucks but didn't have a ready replacement and needed a tide-me-over piece, the tundra cultural might be an option: you'd gain 1 AC, 2 Dex; you'd lose 2 STA, 10 hps and, er, 60 END (which might be an issue, but if the boots are worth bucketloads of plat, you might be able to put up with it until you can loot/LDoN your way to better).<br />
tundra greaves are perhaps a very slight upgrade (3AC, 10 STA, 35hps, but -5 DEX, -10 magic, -35 END) to the bone golem greaves you've got, but since the bone golem stuff is no drop, you wouldn't get much purchase there.<br />
Minor points.<br />
Back to your regularly scheduled program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a better offhand imo for holding aggro.  A greatblade of storms from BOT towers would be great if you're able to get one.<br />
<br />
Feet: you'll get +5hp +6ac with boots of storm, or +15hp +5ac with the HardBB boots<br />
<br />
Legs: Look into getting ornate...camp if you have to, or try to get your guild to raid Tagrin in tactics (he's kinda rough, harder than bot towers imo).  Alternatively, you can get the tak LDoN legs, which are arguably a little better, but you'd be spending points on them instead of on +40hp or +10ac augs.<br />
<br />
Back, there's a haste back from hard EF ldon that has already been mentioned.  Definately worth getting<br />
<br />
Ring: EF hard has a decent ring (100hp if i recall?)<br />
<br />
Wrist: This is the slot I'd definately suggest going to get a tak bracer.  Reason: you can +40hp aug the ldon bracers, but you can't for the ornate.  However, considering you already have ornate, you may or may not want to do it (you'd lose 6ac and the attack, but have the ability to get it up to 110hp)<br />
<br />
Hands: get the Ruj hard gloves, definately.<br />
<br />
Neck: I'd suggest the hard neck from Ruj, 14ac 90hp 6svall.  Once you can move augments around, that's definately worth doing</div></div><hr />
