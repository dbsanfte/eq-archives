Ive thought about the charged but last i saw that on torv was priced at 450k for a pair of legs lol.I'm planning to take a group down to acidic mass for bracer in ct for an arm upgrade and get the flame one from oow to upgrade my other wrist. Also have a cloak of treachory in inventory waiting on lvl 65 so i can wear. What i need is a few ideas for other upgrades, I've got a few in my maby profile, but if anyone can think of anything else i can get through one groupable content, remember i cant tank in mpg and rcod yet with current gear so that wouldnt be possible yet for grouping content. Or any bazzar gear that doesnt run over 100k a slot please let me know &lt;3<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For back - cloak of the fallen defender, conquerer's cloak or the warrior only cloak that has a level 65 requirement.<br />
<br />
<br />
For shoulders - horn spiked shoulders<br />
<br />
For gloves - buy the ornate glove mold, it gives nice stats plus a self clicky haste (haste is weak, but its a long buff and excllent trash for a dispelling mob).<br />
<br />
Face - Kuaa Facemask from Harbingers<br />
<br />
I would reccomend getting tribute haste and upgrading the belt to one of the nice new droppable ones<br />
<br />
I would check on the rock something-another bracer - 30ac with some stats and hps, also check on a flame marked or flame linked bracer<br />

Most of your gear looks solid though, so if you are in a raiding guild, use your money for larger purchases and let your guild help fill you out on other items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tardis420</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well got a few upgrades on gear, the upgrades i am working on getting now are claw earing,dark rites boots.and bracer of flame for wrist.  What I am looking for are any other suggestions that are groupable with my gear as tank or bazaar buyable. I could wait on my guild to gear me up more, but would like to hit 7k faster than waiting on guild drops &lt;3. As far as my belt upgrade, really dont wanna spend all the money on tribute but will think about that. Thanks for all the help have gotten so far.</div></div><hr />
