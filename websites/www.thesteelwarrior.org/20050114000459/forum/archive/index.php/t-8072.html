<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok my aggro setup was chos and fssoy both anger2 auged. today i got an ornate broadsword on raid (im a trial member so its only weapon i can get) and after playing with it some i went for broke and sold my anger2 augs back and bought an anger3 for my ornate broadword. i know that the ornate isnt really an aggro weapon but since its such a step up from my old setup it shpould work for agro? i dont MT for raids, just xp mainly and some TM duties but not often<br />
did i screw up or is this gonna be as good as my old setup for aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you made something wrong in your post because the Ornate Broadsword (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=23497) is a Paladin only weapon.<br />
<br />
But is you wanted to speak about the Ornate Greatblade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25981) which is a warrior usable 2Her, then yes I think you screwed your aggro. I would have auged the CHoS with Anger 3 to improove my aggro. <br />
with an A3-auged Ornate Greatblade you should have more DPs than your farmer combo but same aggro (maybe even less cause the dot aggro is weird and rampent).</div></div><hr />

Yes you had more aggro before, but your not totally SoL.   Just get a better weapon and use your Anger3 aug for it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remove the anger 3 from the 2hs, put it back on one of your DW setups for now. You'll have much more aggro that way, and you can use the 2hs for DPS.</div></div><hr />

Are you posting because you are having problems, or just worried?  I grouped with a warrior who had really good agro with an unaugmented ornate greatblade, but who kept complaining about the poor agro.  I probably would not have put the anger3 in it in the first place, but since it is there, at least try it out.  Maybe a damage augment and use it for dps.</div></div><hr />

That weapon has a dot on it, which could get you into trouble on a raid if they need to switch targets fast.  But yeah, since you can unaug the weapon at any time, not a big loss in the end because you can always switch the aug around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not having problems just wondering, just tried it out today in sol ro and it held good agro even when i was tanking 3 mobs at a time. I didnt really have aggro probs before but i know my dps was crappy and the ornate blade gives me a nice boost to ac and hit points as well and fewer ripostes cant hurt either.  not really worried about the dot, i dont think its actually landed on anything ive tanked so far. obviously this isnt the weapon i plan to eventually main tank with for raids but it was the best i could get currently and i was curious what you guys thought about it. i will probably save up and get another anger3 and reaug my 1handers for aggro and then maybe aug the ornate with a lifetap or something for when i duo with me cleric<br />

ps. jaz i notice neither of your weaps has an innate aggro proc, i think i could have had he sparkling shortsword by now but i knew it wasnt as good as either of the weaps i had already for aggro. do you really feel the weaps you are using are better than the droga combo for aggro? if so why.</div></div><hr />

The dot is horrible for agro, and for mezz breaks. The sword is good dps,, but not something for tanking.</div></div><hr />
