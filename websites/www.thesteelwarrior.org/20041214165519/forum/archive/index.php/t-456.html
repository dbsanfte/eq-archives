<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">General Concensus says.. that if you replace said cleric with a shammy you'll be better off in POP I might be wrong tho but that is what I gather from previous posts such as this one.<br />
<br />
If you ask me, get that cleric and add an enchanter and you will own kunark and a good chunck of velious content doable by a group.  <br />
<br />
Advantage of having a druid?  DPS isn't as good as shammy but you can evac.. if your point is POP tho.. who cares about evac if you have a graveyard.. unless getting a rez is that much of a pain for ya.</div></div><hr />

I have done a little bit with a Chanter, and  Necromancer too. They all are good to partner with. The key here is to know what strenghts and weakness each of these classes have. Then to use them to the benifit the partnership. To me it's hard to say one is better or worse than any others. It also has to do with how the person plays thier toon. Just my 2cp worth.</div></div><hr />

We have been tossing around the idea of a shammy or cleric to duo with this warrior of mine. There are many factors involved as well that tend to complicate the matters like the race's appearence ect.<br />
<br />
She wants to be Elven...shammies cannot be elven race. :( I personally would be happy with her as a cleric but even happier if she goes Barbarian Shammy (shammy something...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you make the cleric a dark elf you can do a quest for a necklace with right-click snare which is pretty handy.  They also get hide which is great for medding in a dangerous area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eezyt</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a 62 warrior and am approaching a point irl where I can afford a hydra. I'm getting a Cleric. A DE Cleric, no less. <br />
<br />
Where a shammy is GREAT for hydraing from the get-go, a cleric has got a huge advantage in a situation where your warrior is already significantly leveled-up. He'll be useful at level 39. I can't think of any other class that'll be so beneficial so early. A shammy would go oom trying to heal me past a bubble at that level. So if you're planning on starting your hydra late, like I am, I highly recommend a cleric. I've had a ToD sitting around in the bank for a real long time and am looking forward to finally using it! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo'd my warr and cleric before PoP came out for months to farm aa's and what not. The general population suggests shamans as better partners, but if you dont have that option, clerics definately work as a duo partner. Having some extra accessories make this duo make up so much easier though. <br />
<br />
A slow weapon (Willsapper, ToD, Wavecrasher) will help immensely, I also learned that you need something to snare a mob with (I ended up with a Silken Whip of Ensnaring), if the cleric can do the quest from Neriak for the snare necklace, all the better. <br />
<br />
A self haste item definately wouldnt hurt but I wouldnt say its necessary (Ornate gloves, Eyepatch of Plunder, Belt of Marvelous Visions, etc). <br />
<br />
I also made it a point to have as much of a self damage shield on myself as possible (Blazing arms of Fennin Ro from Zordak and the 8th ring worked great for me). Also make sure the cleric drops a Mark of Retribution or Mark of the Righteous on the mob for another 15 or 34 pts of damage every time it lands a hit.<br />
<br />
None of the things i mentioned are really must haves (well, maybe the slow weapon is), but will make duo'ing with a cleric soo much easier if you can get any of them. I personally prefer the cleric as a partner, mostly because i can get a rez if i do something stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinguran</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank god my wife is a shaman!  <br />
<br />
It is completly crazy the things we take together.  We can and do duo in PoS/PoV/BoT pulling can suck/HoH another pulling can suck/PoTactics.  Can probably duo in other zones also those are just the ones we are flagged for.  If I could choose only one class to group with a war I will take a shammy in any an all situations.  The only time I can duo with a cleric in BoT is if they are 65 with all spells/tricks and blow their mana on me, as compaired to little down time with my wife.  <br />
<br />
Of note I always have virtue with or without a cleric since I have access to friends accounts.  Also of note she has torpor and cani 5 which has saved her rump and mine on many occasion.  I can care less on malo but the wizzys love it and she almost never gets a slow resisted.  <br />
<br />
So basicaly for xp we start our own group and people join us, only thing people add is how fast we kill :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ibash</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank god my wife is a shaman!  <br />
<br />
Here here!  Yes my wife's barbarian shammy and my barbarian warrior completly wreck everything...unbuffed that is. We don't go out and get KEI or Virtue. We just use her current buffs and have at it. We are slightly twinked so I am sure the gear has alot to do with our success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OgreOverlord</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only time the shammy will hurt is from 50 to 58 ove 58 she would be able to keep up healin you... but the buffs are nice.<br />
<br />
I have a 60 Shammy RL friend and im a 65 Warrior we can duo reall well in most places in the T1 pop zones and some places in PoV PoS. once he gets a Few more lvl's on him im sure we will be able to do more, but anyway the new heals the shammy got + the slowes makes them a great Duo partner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strikingone</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty neutral, I bot a cleric, but I also hang out with a shammy/monk player. <br />
<br />
One thing I do know tho, is that he is WAY more cautious than me :)</div></div><hr />
