<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Out of the following weapons which should I keep bagged to use, and which should I bank/sell?<br />
<br />
Blade of Strategy<br />
Blade of Tactics<br />
Jagged Blade of War<br />
Fabled Mithril 2 Hander<br />
Split Blade of Destruction<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
<br />
Currently I'm working on unlocking Anger 3 Augs, out of the listed weaps, which should be the first to get em...<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind I'm in a smaller, non-raid oriented guild. Probably won't ever see a BoC, BoW, or even a GBoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
keep CHoS and red epic for dual wield aggro closeby<br />

keep Fabled for low aggro dps closeby<br />
<br />
bah/sell the rest of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd have to agree with Apolyon on which weapons to save.  Red Epic/CHoS for DW aggro, GSoT for 2h aggro, and fabled for DPS.<br />
<br />
One thing though.  Unless you really don't plan on getting weapon upgrades anytime soon, I'm not sure if it would be worth it to spend so many points putting an anger 3 on the red epic/CHoS, you may just want to go with anger 2 augs for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sell the SBoD for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Too many weapons  <br />
<br />
There is no such thing!  Someone said this a while back, don't remember who though... &quot;if you have empty bag slots, you don't have enough weapons&quot;.  So true!<br />
<br />
Anyway, sell the split blade for nice cash.  Buy a Sword of the Bloodsworn.  Aug SotBS and CHoS.  Use extra money to buy up other essentials.  Keep GSoT for when you want 2h aggro.  Fabled for dps.  Either bank or bag epic.  Preferably bag so you can wear them for looks occasionally =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*shrugs* Prolly the ratio of the GSoT is better than the 2h Epic, but the proc is not better, dont tell me a stun is more than 500hate+175DD?<br />
Ok, maybe Im biased because I have had a GSoT, and Im using the 2h Epic now, but Im really happy with the agro it deals auged with Anger :)<br />
For DW I would use the CHoS and Red epic (actually, thats my DW setup, with the hammer auged with Anger II).<br />
For DPS, the Fabled.<br />
<br />
Sell the SBoD :)</div></div><hr />

Everyone says to sell the SBoD? I've actually kind of enjoyed it... always getting compliments on the looks and the 90HPs, 15DEX, and 20AC weren't too shabby.<br />

I'm not debating with anyone, but what makes this such a bad weapon? No aggro procs? Couldn't I fix this with an anger 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kenlaien - with regard to the stats on your weapons, keep in mind you have 21 slots to get more HP, AC, str, dex and stamina.  You have 2 slots to work on your DPS, and agro.<br />
<br />
When dealing with weapons you should be looking to maximise agro 1st and DPS 2nd.  Other stats on your weapons are a bonus, but shouldnt be a priority for those slots.<br />
<br />
Edit - and dont put anger 3 on your splitblade.  Do a search, theres a 5page+ thread on it from just a week or so ago with discussion so compelling that even Sam Deathwalker had to agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">but what makes this such a bad weapon? <br />
<br />
Sure, you could put anger 3 on it.  But then again, you could put anger 3 on a stun procing weapon and get 2 procs instead of one, increasing aggro by a good bit.<br />

2) I am very new to this class (level 12 warrior) ...by the way, hello all !</div></div><hr />

It is nigh impossible to have too many weapons!!<br />
<br />
Especially, weapons with special procs (snare, slow, stun, DoT, etc).<br />
You just never know when those might come in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The main reason to use a 2hander as an aggro weap is to reduce damage taken from a mob's ripostes or damage shield. Most people use 2h for dps weapons when they are not tanking because 2handers generally do more damage than dualwield.</div></div><hr />

Would it be best advisable to sell off the Bloodsworn and offhand the Hooked So'Shar, or bank the Hooked So'Shar and use the Bloodsworn offhanded.  I'll probably place an Anger 2 aug on the one that is best suggested.  Don't see the value of placing an Anger 3 on it when I could better use those points for armor.   That is until I get a significant weapon upgrade like GBoS or GSo4W.<br />
<br />
My appology for the piggy back on your thread Kenlaien.  Jus found it odd how we are almost in the same situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As to whether you should offhand the soshar or the bloodsworn, I think there was a similar post a while back, not sure though. The so'shar would probably be a little better dps offhand, but the SotBS would still be better aggro... they both have default proc rates of 1/min if offhand, and the dd/stun on the SotBs is around 400-450 hate, so it would be better for aggro.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, they are probably fairly similar in offhand, but the SotBS would be more aggro. If you can sell it for 8k or whatever they sell for, and can gain a significant amount of hp/ac/stats/saves with the cash, using the so'shar would probably work just fine.</div></div><hr />

imo a true warrior is well trained in the use of all weapons  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">to the one who asked why the preference for 2 handed weapons, its because there are quite  a few available relatively easily (the fabled ones, GSo4W, even BoW if ur in a raiding guild), which offer better dps than most 1 handed combos until you get access to the time/GoD 1 hananders. From an aggro persepctive, there have been countless threads on the GSoT v CHoS/bloodsword and BoW v BoC/frenzy combos etc and really, either option is good, but 2 handers bring the added advantage of less ripostes.</div></div><hr />

Guess I need to re adjust my point of view and come to your conclusions, thanks for the answers all and sorry for interfering in your post Kenlaien !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stifh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Im not sure if anyone has posted it, but im under the impression that if you put a proc aug (anger or otherwise) on a weapon that already has a proc... the chances that the aug will proc is slim.  On each attack, it rolls wether you proc or not on your first proc (the original one), if it procs, then it skips the second proc totally, if the first proc fails however, it does the same roll with the second proc.  and a great 2hs weapon, ive only ever seen one on Rallos Zek so far, is the Massive Flamberge of Alacrity, its 25dmg / 23dly with decent stats, got my 2hs skill from 16 to 200 in about 2 hours of xping. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">the chances that the aug will proc is slim <br />
<br />
Not really.  Yes, if the regular proc goes off, the second cannot, however that only happens on two swings in every minute of swinging.  Consider how many times you swing per minute, there is very little negative effect.  Proc augs go off at the standard 2 times per minute.</div></div><hr />

I experimented with them all, CHS, bloodsworn, JBoW, GSoT, ... <br />
these are my OPINIONS;<br />
the most effective for aggro (and dps isnt too bad) out of what you have is the blade of strategy. if you havent done your LDoN turn-ins yet, use a mage summoned sword of runes in your scabbard to get your 1 handers while your JBoW is equipped. then do your turn-ins. this will yeild you 2 versions of the red blade. <br />
stun+DD procs are great aggro, but the straight unresistible hate element of the rage of vallon out-does it by far. i auged the new red blade with angerII, main handed it, and off-handed the original one. My aggro issues were pretty much solved for my duel weild set up.<br />
Unless you play a whole lot more than i do and have LDoN points to spare, I wouldnt blow the cost of anger III on any of your current weapons. <br />
I'd sell the Split blade thing. <br />
I found the JboW to be much better aggro un-auged than the GSoT un-auged. GSoT is however way more DPS. <br />
hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PURELY ON AGGRO considerations, (DPS is for rogues) does anyone have an opinion on the quote above?  Like many I suppose, I went and picked up a GSoT.  I found it to be a complete and utter piece of shit wrt aggro.  Worse than my impression of the JBoW.  Now, I didn't do any parses, and the GSoT sucked so hard I only kept the it in for a while before tributing it, so its not like I have what would be a good sample I suppose.  <br />
<br />
Am I the only one with this impression of the GSoT?  Maybe not bad considering the price and all, but compared to epic 2-hander?  or am I just on crack? <br />

My set up is easy enough to get OSoW and BoC, both with AngerIII, and with 9.75 procs per mintue of hate you will probably outdo a BoW... about as good Hate you will get pre BoW and possiblely even pre DBoW.<br />

That's interesting.  Never seen a JBoW proc come up as resisted.  <br />

Ok, so if GSoT is better than JBoW, (and still sucks for aggro) there has to be something else out there before killing RZtW.  I'lll do some more homework.  <br />

<br />
before killing RZtW you have the DW combo that rules (just need two auged aggro 1Her of our list in library). or if you really want 2Her you have above the GSoT only the Anathema (PoP Bertox) or a PoT/GoD High DPS 2Her (Vanazir, Great Maul of Mighty, Halberd of Endless Pain, Staff of Shattered Dreams) and the BoW of course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">before killing RZtW you have the DW combo that rules (just need two auged aggro 1Her of our list in library). or if you really want 2Her you have above the GSoT only the Anathema (PoP Bertox) or a PoT/GoD High DPS 2Her (Vanazir, Great Maul of Mighty, Halberd of Endless Pain, Staff of Shattered Dreams) and the BoW of course.<br />
<br />
You're saying the next step up from the GSoT drops off of Inny (not Bertox), Time/GoD, or Rallos Zek?  So, as a warrior in a guild trying to do Bertox for the first time I should stick with my dual wield combo and just deal with the ripostes.  Or rattle off some LDoN's and drop an Anger III onto one of those GSoT's.   <br />
<br />
Odd that there isn't a middle ground.  Would be handy to have a decent agro 2hander accessable to you at around this point.  Gonna take another look at that Library post.... Cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Inny's sword really is the middle ground.  If you're trying to do Bertox for the first time, then you are able to farm Inny. :)  He actually has a very shrewdly designed loot table that fills many gaps in POP tier 2/3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Aggro is generated whether JBoW is resisted or not (as with GSoT on resists), so I'm not sure about Varalla's logic.<br />
<br />
The logic was I assumed zero aggro on resist.<br />
School me!<br />
There a thread on this?<br />
And thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">detremental spells generate agro no matter what. thats why wizzys can pull with cocnussion a -400 agro spell.<br />
<br />
think of it this way,<br />
<br />
the agro is resolved befor the resist check and sub effects. like our procs resolve befor we swing.<br />
<br />
mob 001 say hay you cast x on me i hate you weither or not you effected it.<br />
<br />
<br />
the wizzy concussion thread is a good one http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18638</div></div><hr />

I accept that stuns, DD&quot;s and such all have the same aggro cost, resist, crit or whatever.  Its the same thing with mellee aggro:  Its the potential damage that gives you the aggro, not the actual damage done.  Or at least thats my understanding.  <br />
<br />
So... when an Enraging Blow (or other direct aggro bump) proc gets resisted does it still generate the same aggro?  <br />
<br />
Kind of a thread derail I suppose, but really one of those sound-of-one-hand-clapping-tree-alone-in-the-forest kind of deals... <br />
<br />
/em passes the water bong along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Enraging Blow (and all other pure hate procs aside from epic) is not resistable, but if it was, yes it would still generate the same aggro.  Resists never spare you from aggro, period.  Anyone who's played a class with a mana bar understands this.  It works this way as a detriment to spellcasters; but it works to the advantage of proccing warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Cool.<br />
Makes you wonder why the JBoW is resistable.<br />
I figured it was done for a reason *LOL*<br />
Must be for the DD portion of the proc and not the hate.<br />
<br />
Very informitive derail.<br />
Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Haven't looked at the thread in the library for a while, but theres quite a few 2handers that fit into the grey area between Epic 2hs and the BoW<br />
<br />
JBoW -&gt; GSoT -&gt; ??? -&gt; BoW<br />
<br />
Some other 2 handers you could use until you get your hands on a BoW:<br />
Norge'Tal<br />
Gauldralek<br />
Bloodied Berserkers Blade<br />
<br />
The only one of the 3 I have used is the BBB which I used to tank (un-aug'd) as far as Reparm in fire and in ele XP groups / hard LDoN's, was definitely a solid agro 2hs for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Aye.My point was imo the aggro loss for pre bow 2 handers is &gt; extra riposte damage taken for dual wielding on pre ep mobs.If you just want something differant for fun go for it.GSOT worked ok for me when I had it and I imagine with augs a lot of 2 handers would be fine.I don't remember riposte being a huge deal on Bert and Rydda.For myself the gettable 1 handers at that stage  offer too much advantage over pre BOW 2-handers.</div></div><hr />
