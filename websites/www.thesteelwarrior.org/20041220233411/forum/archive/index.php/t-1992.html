Opportunity exists most for people who work hard and are willling to network well.<br />

Government should act as a safety net for people who need it most, to assist those who TRULY cannot help themselves, and to provide a framework for other countries to deal with the states as a whole.<br />

Frodlin, you trying to be ironic? From your stance, I would beleive that you would be pro gay rights....so labling things you find negative gay is odd. Or not very sensative to gays. *shurgs*<br />
<br />
That said, driving is a right, there for laws proscribing some types of behavior while drving are fine by me. Otherwise, I have no problem with your list. I would go with wrong, instead of gay, though.</div></div><hr />

Well then pay the extra on insurance so I don't have to cover your dumb ass on my insurance for the additional injuries KNOWN incurred from that stupid behavior. Your stupidity effected me, I wear my seat belt and YOUR insurance wasn't raised when my car was broadsided by an idiot who decided right turn on red meant right of way. I probably would have sustained injuries WITHOUT a seat belt, but didn't with one. So I saved anyone with State Farm insurance money, as they would have had to pay the hospital bill.</div></div><hr />

I'm pro seat belt and helmet laws, don't be a moron, put em, on, if not for your own safety, then like Rumblingdeth said, leave my rates the fuck alone.<br />
<br />
I'm an insurance agent, I see this shit all the time, the more idiots that drive, the more rates increase.<br />
<br />
If you die in an accident, someone pays out more.  I'f you're not wearing a seatbelt, you're most likely going to die in a major crash.  So th eamount of money spent on your sorry ass just went astronomical and I have to share the cost.  Don't be a dipshit and think your actions and in-actions dont affect other people.<br />
<br />
In other news:  Fuck Bush.  He's a dumb ass piece of shit.  I'm all for him bombing the shit out of Iraq, but damn, did he have to say &quot;They got bad mojo weapons, we kill em and show you&quot;...  Pissant didn't even know for sure if he could nab em.<br />

But what is the different between the two parties? I was talking with Vermont's governor (who is a republican) and I asked him what the difference between Republicans and Democrats really was, he gave me a blank eyes stare for a little while, and when I was starting to wonder if he had died on me, he started listing off the positive things Republicans put to the tabler and the negative things Democrats do, But I did not buy it because on the new I hear both Democrats and Republicans ask for the same things and they say that the &quot;other&quot; guy does not support that but they do. <br />
<br />
So far my view is their are two major parties that are the exact same they just support whatever they think is currently the &quot;popular fling&quot; and change their mind as soon as it turns sour. Its kinda like somebody who is your friend when your rich, and doesn't talk to you when your poor. <br />
<br />
So I am undecided and fairly happy being undecided. I am a American Citizen who loves his country, but is sick of the political bullshit I see. <br />

I feel like playing EQ, and I haven't had much of a chance to do so.  Damn that whole life thing!  Thinking about giving up EQ and scooting over to Star Wars Galaxies - would do both, but I don't have the time or money to keep up both accounts.<br />
<br />
But damnit, I still really like EQ, but I really want to play Star Wars.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think I'm a crossbreed of Republican and Democrat.  I agree and disagree with both about the same.<br />
<br />
So I don't know what I am partisan wise...  I think the line is no longer clear.  20 or 30 years ago, most people were very clear on their political affiliations and alliances.  Now, we're more concious of what's going on, and at the same time, we're held more in the dark about things.  We're more in tune with our fellow American, and again, we're also more at odds with our neighbors.<br />
<br />
Times are definately changing, and have been in a pretty large turmoil for quite some time.  I think the American paradigm is movign somewhere new.  Corporate America and Media America are shifting to people moreso than government.  <br />
<br />
I'm excited to see what might happen in the future.  The next 1- years, I truely believe, will bring a lot of positive change for us.<br />
<br />
But I still think those who voted for Bush should hurt themselves.  They owe it to society.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um.. If Insurance is required by law, then why do you have to have UNINSURED Motorist insurance? <br />
Insurance is one of the biggest scams there is. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do not want helmet or seat belt laws, although I do wear a helmet, and mostly a seatbelt. I make an exception for minors, as they need to be protected, at least until they are old enough to know its dumb...<br />
<br />
I believe in the right to own guns, as many as you want. Hell, I believe it is almost a responsibility for you to own a gun.<br />
<br />
I believe in gay rights, and feel that there should be some form of 'official' relationship  accepted by government, same as for unmarried couples. I do not believe in any 'extra' rights, just no discrimination.<br />
<br />
I believe in lower the taxes the better. I do not think its right that people who make money can pay up to 50%  of their income to the government. NO ONE should ever be taxxed that high. <br />
<br />
I believe the government should not provide generations of entitlements to  people. Too many people are given a free ride, and live off of the working people.<br />
<br />
I believe we need and should be a very strong if not strongest MIlitary.<br />
<br />
I think smoking and drinoking are bad, but do not think they should be outlawed or taxxed the way they are now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel that it is too much of an invasion of personal rights. <br />
What is next? <br />
<br />
When the Government starts taking away your rights to protect you, at some point you need to decide that there is an acceptable level of risk, to maintain freedoms. <br />
<br />
Hell we could solve the whole terrorism problem easy... Implant a lo-jak in every citizen. Have them request permission to travel anywhere outside of their eresidence 48hrs in advance. arrest everyone without the proper papers and permissions to be where they are  at... Would make it hard to be a criminal or terrorist.. Now, Do we want that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, and you think it would be beter with AL-IINVENTED THEINTERNET-GIVEEARTHACHANCE- Gore as president?<br />
<br />
Instead of attacking Afganistan/Iraq/whoever needs it next.. we would be having case studies on how the toxic wastes from all the people dying during 9-11 are killing the Earths Ecosystem..<br />
<br />
Do you really think that any War sold to the people has been about what really happened? <br />
<br />
WWI - sinking of the Luisitania... yes the US was supplying weapons to Europe, we lied we entered the war...<br />
<br />
WWII - We knew they would attack Pearl Harbor, is it a coincidence that it was Battleships in harbor and not a single carrier? Or the little realized fact that EVERY SHIP sunk at pearl harbor, except the symbolic Arizona, was raised and back in combat by end of the war?<br />
<br />
Vietnam - was originally about RUBBER plantations. the guise was stopping communism, sadly halfway thru the war they created artificial rubber, but couldnt just end the war.<br />
<br />
Iraq -  Does anyone seriously think that Iraq was better under Sadaam/ or that he did not WANT and TRY to have WMD to terrorize others. Or that he had not several  times in the last 25 years commited campaigns of aggression against others?<br />
<br />
9-11 was many years comming, we got very lucky. Terrorism contained outside USA. Now that they have struck here, they made the mistake, they thought that we would act like all the  other terrorism acts. We would roll over and leave, do something symbolic and give in. <br />
<br />
I for one am glad that we are not doing that...<br />
<br />
We know were these terrorists are, its no real secret, they have been there and sponsored by these people for years. They need to be eliminated...<br />
<br />
The only way to defeat terrorism, is to out-terror the bad guys. Make it  so that the losses they incur far and away exceed what they inflict...</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't a single state in the country which saw a general reduction in insurance rates when a seat belt or helmet law was passed, or even a slowed rate of increase.   Therefore, the laws have no effect on your rates.<br />
<br />
Of course you WANT to believe that they do, because you WANT to think that your insurance rates are based on cash out vs. income, and that unbelted drivers are a major drain on insurance companies, but they're not.   The major drain on insurance companies are minor collisions and people who fluff up minor injuries to take advantage of the insured, but it's simpy false that seat belt and helmet laws have any affect on your rates one way or another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh...as hard as this is to say: yes.   At least we wouldnt have an idiot landing on aircraft carriers and &quot;saying bring em on&quot; like life is a video game.  Not that I think Gore was the big win either...I woulda voted for McCain given a chance.  <br />
<br />
The only way to defeat terrorism, is to out-terror the bad guys. Make it so that the losses they incur far and away exceed what they inflict... <br />
<br />
Yes this approach has worked SO well for the Israreli's.  And for every other nation state that has tried to destroy partisan (as opposed to Nation-state) resistance in the last 200 years (see Soviets in Afghanistan &amp; checyna or Germany in occupied Europe or Napolean in occupied Russia).  Yes you can cow countries this way but you can not stop an idealogy of hate with it.<br />
<br />
I mean other than the explanation blind hate how much work has been done into the WHY or terrorism against the US?  Not saying force isn't part of the answer...but naked force inexperately applied (see Iraq &amp; Afghanistan) actually makes the situation worse.  We are a international hate generating machine these days...no amount of &quot;homeland security&quot; is going to protect us from the consequences.</div></div><hr />

His answer was, &quot;Because I, like 90% of the American people, am somewhere in the middle.&quot;   <br />
I tend to agree with that assessment.   Both sides are corrupt as hell and act to promote their own interests and the interests of their friends and associates instead of the common good most of the time anyway.  Typically presidential elections have nothing to do with which party a candidate belongs to, but instead amount to &quot;which of these canditates is the least idiotic&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We should try to help the deserving needy among us, children, the elderly, and the disabled.<br />
<br />
The middle class should not be treated as a cheap labor pool and a source of rank-and-file soldiers willing to fight to extend the empire.<br />
<br />
Those of us who are successful in business or finance should give something back to the country that made it possible.<br />
<br />
Valued institutions like public libraries, public education, etc. should be preserved and strengthened. They are the only true and lasting monuments to America's greatness.<br />
<br />
The goverment must always be held responsible to the electorate. They are our employees and we should not hestitate to fire them for improper behavior or sub-standard performance.<br />
