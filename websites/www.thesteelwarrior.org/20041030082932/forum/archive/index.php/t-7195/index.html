<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see some good AC/HP range items out there, but seem to have to give up my pulling item(a bow) to use them.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in a pulling item other than a bow. Are there any good pulling items that can be clicked from inventory?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You do have to equip it though, so will take a big hit in stats.<br />
<br />
Can use incite, but I would personally never pull, MA a raid where I have to tag, without a bow equiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been pulling with Berate ever since I got it. About the same time I happened to pick up Grodan's Idol (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7164) and stopped carrying a bow in my range slot. Berate seems to work fine for pulling, though I do miss the extra range of the bow and that little bit of &quot;Howdy Damage&quot; that you get when the arrow thumps home.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That only has a range of 50 though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just use incite or setup your UI where you can switch your bow in/out quickly, or a combination of both.  That's what I do anyway /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Blazing Bracer of Fennin Ro is the best pulling tool for wars in the game imo, with line of sight zones too you can single pull, just nuke - then run behind a pillar or wall and wait for it to hit (bolt effect) then you've got yourself a single pull. (atleast most of the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
I already have a bracer of fennin ro and its a nice thing to have(though it has to be equipped).<br />
<br />
I might just use it or switch out like i am currently doing. My hope was that there was an item out there that could be used from inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grongl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Incite/Berate/Bellow etc. is the best pulling tool you have, no question.  It is non-damage agro meaning it triggers much less assist agro when pulling, so you're much less likely to get adds.  I've pulled singles or doubles out of clumps of mobs in LDoNs and Ikkinz trials that other people didn't even want to try.  Pulling with it also gives  you a significant agro bump for when the mob gets to camp.  If you haven't tried pulling with Incite, you really should.  Once you get used to it, you won't go back to arrows or clickies.  You also don't end up locked into a bow as a range item.<br />
<br />
Blazing bracer is a nice tool to have for really, really long pulls in clear areas, but the cast time is a pain in the ass if you're trying to keep things fast.  It's also a bolt spell, so it will frequently get blocked by trees, rocks, shrubs, stalagmites, etc.  And in those situations you're probably better off with a long range bow.  But I haven't run into anything that needed to be pulled from that far in a long time.  I still keep my bracer on me for nostalgia but I rarely use it or my bio orb these days.  I've even got Snakefingers in the bank!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does the bracer care about the z-axis?  can you pull something way up or way below with it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had the same dilemna for a bit...<br />
<br />
had an Idol of the Thorned and a gimp bow... had to switch between em all the time... ended up just causing me to never pull with a bow...walk up and smack mob(not always great idea) ... luckily i very rarely pull anymore but i bought a bow with stats and gave up the annoying switching back and forth.<br />
<br />
stonewood is a good one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I am too lazy to use my bow I use incite, but I will always prefer a bow over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What is the range on incite? Didn't think you could pull with it?<br />
<br />
I remember the first day I had it after it was patched in...we were in BoT and a mob gated at one of the lower camps. I had incite on it. it reset when it gated and never came back to us. but a little bit after that I got the message about incite wearing off, so I always assumed that with out me actually being engaged in combat with the mob that incite did nothing. Guess I was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">incite is good for pulling but i prefer the range of a bow, shoot a couple arrows, run back, and incite when its almost to camp. although as its been said incite seems to be alot less aggro to creatures near by</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have used Incite, berate, etc. I am mainly talking about long range pulling scenarios and for tagging when distance is a factor.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to overcome the slight inconvenience of swapping out when those situations arise.<br />
<br />
The bows that elementals provide are fairly decent, but from what I can see so far I am not going to drop any worthwile amount on DKP when non bow range items are vastly superior in AC/HPs. I think I will just swap out and keep my Warbow of RZ. I had Stonewood for a long time but sold it. My range slot won't be holding bow other than to pull long distances or if I am tagging and I personally do not want to have to use incite where gauging distance could compromise tactics and time.<br />
<br />
GOD kicks out some pretty nice AC/HP bows but my guild hasn't explored GOD alot - we mainly just elementals and occasionally stick our heads out to GOD zones. I think this will be changing though shortly, especially in light of the revamp of GOD from the patch.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the wonderful ideas, and suggestions.</div></div><hr />
