<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been nerfed?  The last 2 or 3 times I've done the encounter we've had only 1 item drop as apposed to the usual 2.  No bracer in like 15 killings but that goes without saying =X.  Anyone else notice the drop rate being gimped(not on bracer just in general)?  Or am I just really damn unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Done it twice recently,  1 piece of loot both times, no bracer :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">is the ring of slime event worth doing?  How long does it take? how many people do you need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">An enchanter, cleric and Myself kill it everytime we find it up during non-raid hours. We've never gotten 1 loot in probably, 8-9 kills. No bracers though, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say I have killed RoS about 20 times and not seen a bracer drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it's worth doing.  There are two noteable *awesome* pieces of loot that come out of the event.  One of them is the 15/20 15sta 100hp rogue dagger and the other is the 25ac 8sta 100hp warrior bracers.  Both are incredibly rare. :P<br />
<br />
Difficulty wise, the RoS is not hard.  The Acid Mass casts a wicked AE though, so you absolutely must resist it every time.  To do that, you must have your MR higher than 250.  For warriors, this isn't hard to do with buffs, a bard, and our MR advantage, but other classes may find it slightly harder to do.<br />
<br />
The Acid Mass is fully slowable, thankfully.  He quads for 700's, if I remember correctly, and dishes out ~100-120dps over the course of the fight to a fully defensive AA's warrior.  The fight itself is -LONG-.  The bastard has a ton of hp.  Let me take that back.  The bastard has a metric fuckton of hp with Luclin style ac.  Expect the fight to be ~20 minutes or more, as he has anywhere from 750 to 850k hp.<br />
<br />
He drops 1 to 3 loots every time.  Usually when he drops 3 loots, 2 of them are duplicates.  His loot is either insanely awesome or absolutely pathetic, so expect to be let down a few times. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im pretty sure he triples for 850 not quads, though its been quite some time since I have done this.  The bracer is exetremely rare, the FT4 caster gloves are even more rare, I even heard they were taken out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great event for parsing weapons when its just 3-4 of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">with that many HP how can only 3 people do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The FT gloves still drop, we got them a couple weeks ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I would like to know... Also, how do you avoid / deal with repops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's a very long fight, but a single healer can keep a tank up on it indefinately if he's kept slowed.  If you don't have enough with you to manage repops, you can pull the non-rooted one to an area with no spawns before killing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Killed it yesterday,FT gloves dopped.<br />
I'm pretty sure they nerfed the droprate a long time ago so usually you get craploot.<br />
Still the 3 good drops are worth it.<br />
If you pull it all the way to the beginning of the tunnel you only have to deal with one roaming ooze</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the reply.  I'm beginning to think it's not worth my time to jack with it ;)</div></div><hr />
