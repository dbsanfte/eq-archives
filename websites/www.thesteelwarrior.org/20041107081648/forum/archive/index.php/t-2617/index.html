<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don’t know if this is going to get me kicked out of the beta but its not like I can get a goddamn group there anyway...<br />
<br />
Warriors are only going to get worse in Ldon. <br />
<br />
I normally 2 box a cleric (thank god) on the beta I cant. Normally it takes me a while to make a group by pulling people that are lfg.<br />
<br />
But now people on the beta are getting smart. You have x time to collect x number of things. <br />
<br />
Pally/sk as a tank.  <br />
Nuke that thing into the ground as soon as he stuns it.<br />
Warrior as a tank. <br />
Wait 30 sec so he gets aggro. 30 sec x 60 mobs = 30 min of time that you could be nuking.<br />
<br />
And there is not one damn thing in there that requires defensive. So as we all know. No need for defensive = sk/pally better choice for the group.<br />
<br />
Hell one group I got lucky to get into had an sk in it.. the cleric decided to melee because he did not have to heal. <br />
<br />
Clerics better watch out as well. You are not needed as much. Hope you get some dps soon.<br />
<br />
Back to warriors...<br />
<br />
First week <br />
<br />
I had no issues getting a group. Put the lfg tag on and get 3-4 tells.<br />
<br />
This week. <br />
<br />
Put up lfg and open the lfg window. <br />
2 hours lfg not one tell. Seen 5-6 sk's lfg in the same time get snapped up within 5 min.<br />
<br />
As an example <br />
<br />
/who all sk1<br />
sk1[lfg] commonlands<br />
5 min later <br />
/who all sk1<br />
sk1 some zone I cant go to without a group<br />
<br />
<br />
The expansion looks really cool. Too bad we will (as always) be left behind. <br />
<br />
My solution is simply not buy the expansion until warriors are needed in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Only way that will happen is if we get what we have been asking for. <br />
<br />
What I am asking for is simple.. if you are a warrior do these 2 things. <br />
<br />
1. Do not order Ldon or cancel your Ldon pre-order<br />
2. Send one feedback in. State if warriors are not balanced in time for Ldon you will not be ordering it.<br />
<br />
Get every warrior you know to do the same thing. <br />
<br />
Money talks. If you want us fixed show it to SOE by demanding it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im not saying 30 sec to attack.. im saying 30 sec before going all out.<br />
<br />
normal 55th lvl warrior grouping with high dps class like say a wizard will not be able to hold aggro if the wizard hits a 4k nuke on it 10 sec after its in camp.<br />
<br />
most casters wait 15-20 sec before casting.. long cast time.. 30 sec.. its not an insaine number.<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe uber 65th lvl bow wielding warrior might not have an issue but thats like what 1% of all warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warriors are favored in endurance tests.  If it turns out that many dungeon features slug fests then Warriors are fine.  However if LDoN has dungeons that are &quot;races&quot; or &quot;beat the clock&quot; Warirors will find themselves stretched.<br />
<br />
Its all hypothetical anyway.  Until people get LDoN and excirse the environment we will not know what is in it.  Even those in Beta will not see everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't like to fan rumors, as I'm really dubious on all sources (not a hit against you, you may be right about it all, it's a general distrust of rumors of mine, don't take offense).<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping whatever they decide to change about warrior agro goes in before LDoN...or even at the same time about.  Having one more expansion come out with no improvements whatsoever is going to cause a lot of warriors to retire...hell, a lot of pure melee in general to retire, unless they're a gimp/alt.<br />
<br />
If there are time limits, and you have to be somewhat quick, and /defensive isn't required, warriors are going to have problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all of them have a time limit. So far i have seen<br />
<br />
kill x things and collect x things before the timer runs out<br />
get to x before it gets killed by mobs. timer there too<br />
<br />
<br />
And beta has all of the doungons on it so far. I have not seen all of them becasue frankly its a bitch getting a group if your a warrior.<br />
<br />
and i refuse to play a pally/knight (with the betabuff) as I do not know that class as good as a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/sigh<br />
i expected as much, but i will never give up on my own sorry warrior ass</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never beta tested before have you Aeka? the whole purpose of beta is to get coverage on your code. So the coed in beta is functionally complete IE any changes they make will be bug fixes no new features. So it is not hypotheticall if we have a beta tester saying this here then it is what SoE is planning to release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also note, you will not get a lot of beta reviews for a while.<br />
<br />
Most likely you will only get negative reviews of ldon because the people who are enjoying it are less likely to risk violating the NDA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And yes the beta for POP had all levels.  It was so thourghly tested there were no problems.  Time was bug free and works perfect with great tuning!  Right?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but you'd have to have a pool of testers the size of the current player population test every duneon in the biggest expandsion to date (SOE's claim no less).<br />
<br />
There are people under NDA so they won't comment.  There are going to be zones that are just not reachable due to time constraints (especially if its in a long progression).  Even if beta testing was near complete players will still excirse the game differently than testers.<br />
<br />
So have you done beta testing?  Don't get me wrong.  Having people pound on the product certainly is good.  I just think you overestimate its usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Akea,<br />
<br />
first off, pop was not even close to having anything beta tested. PoP is huge compared to this. <br />
<br />
Nobody in beta got to time. It was not finished yet. <br />
<br />
this time they are doing it the right way.<br />
All the doungens are there. Maybe 1-2 more they might hold off on? Maybe.. but most of the content is there and in 100% of the content that is being tested, an sk/pally is 100% of a better of a choice than a warrior.<br />
<br />
sorry that does not sit well with me. We are being phased out while whiners of norrath get everything they ask for on a god damn platter. (little whiny bitches never have an issue calling for a nerf if it does not affect them)<br />
<br />
Simply put. You feel like allowing your class to suck more than it ever sucked before, by all means send soe your money. Sit on your ass and keep saying to yourself <br />
'im not gimp, Im not gimp, I am a better tank than any pally, im not gimp, im not gimp'<br />
<br />
want devs to finally listen to us and not promise us somthing they will never deliver on (hello *uckers its been 6 months and you have put upgrades in for other classes) .. send in the feedback.. don't order the expansion. <br />
<br />
The carrot at the end of the stick has turned into a glob of festering moldy goo. Still want to eat that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So have you done beta testing? Don't get me wrong. Having people pound on the product certainly is good. I just think you overestimate its usefulness.<br />
<br />
I overestimate noything as someone who sees the direct result of beta testing I know that as a company we are funtionally complete before we ship to beta meaning no noew content is planned (doest not mean if something needs to be added prior to ship it wont be.) Beta is to weed out the normal computer user bugs. and get usability results and feedback. When you go beta you are not planning on making any big changes to yuour code.<br />
<br />
I never beta tested PoP but I can assume Time was off limits to beta testers because it was not ready. So if there are any zones not beingbeta tested they will not be attaniable when LDoN comes out so would have no bearing on the expansion whatsoever as far as warriors in general are concerend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As a beta-tester would it be possible for you to get word to the devs about how LDON perpetuates the inclination to favor knights over warriors in xp groups?  <br />
<br />
No, they probably won't listen but it's worth a try :(<br />
<br />
I don't want LDON to be reminiscent of doing that damn POJ trial over and over again and fricking losing aggro all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Feedback for issues, but I haven't seen anything come out of it. I don't think you've violated anything NDA related but I wouldn't risk it by posting the specifics of x before y runs out if you get my drift. Never know if they'll yank your play account as well as beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Betaing does not work like that in MMOGs near as I can tell, just look at EVE or SWG. I would expect that there are things betaers will not see (or test) but, they will have a fairly accurate piture of the overall product.<br />
<br />
So big things, like warrior/knight balance I would wieght as likely to be accurate.<br />
<br />
And all classes whine. Focus your anger at SoE not the one paladin who will admit to having to piss :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tight time limits will in fact further the case for 'perfect groups' because wether Sony say they're balancing to the particular group or not, people aren't gonna accept a 'weak link'  class if they can help it. <br />

'Dungeon crawls' shouldn't be 'dungeon sprints'.... :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I dont see aggro as a big an issue as it used to be (in grouping anyway).<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn did 2 things. <br />
#1 Provided a decent stat/aggro weapon that was extremely(maybe even too) easy to access<br />
#2 Dropped prices on other similar aggro weapons because why pay 50k for a FG wehen you could get SotB for 15?<br />
<br />
FGs are down to 18-25k on my server and SotB are down to 14k<br />
<br />
I have one of each now and i occasionally lose aggro when the shm slows or a caster over nukes etc.Simple solution is to have the shm call when he slows, and hit taunt right after,usually shm/chanter doesnt even get hit.<br />
The only class ive seen regularly pull aggro without even trying lately is Beastlords.I regularly duo with a BST friend and he has to specifically try NOT to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Point is, I dont see LDoN as being &quot;death for warriors&quot;.You have to have at least decent equipment and know what you are doing.<br />
I personally have very little trouble getting grps in tactics/bot/pov etc unless everything is just plain camped up/full.<br />
Besides,LDoN makes it easier for you to get a grp of your friends together,I doubt i will do very much &quot;pickup&quot; in LDoN,pretty much just friends and guildies</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly. so if your having issues now its not going to get any better. the clerics are already seeing it that they are not going to be as needed in ldon.<br />
<br />
30 days. groups will be war cleric slower 3 more clsasses<br />
<br />
after that its knight class, druid/shammy, 4 more classes.<br />
<br />
As for the bone.. yes they chos procs a lot.. usually right after the chanter gets plastered<br />
<br />
on demand aggro is not the same as please god proc.. for the love of god proc already... (i know i exagerate as the mobs in there really can be tanked by an enchanter so far)<br />
<br />
maybe hard setting will require a warrior.. or maybe make a nightmare difficulty.. where every 10th mob quads for 1000<br />
<br />
unless ya see that there is no need for a warrior in a ldon group.</div></div><hr />

Riiiiight. .. cause flags (which one would assume would be the major thing they tested) weere barely tested at all.  How bout that rathe encounter... that was really tuned.  Or time, the zone that was ready, you just couldnt see it in beta because its super secret.<br />
<br />
The amount of bs you waded through for that expansion rivals few experiences you could ever reasonably have.  Amazingly, the beta testers themselves (well, some of them i guess) actually would do more... if it were less about &quot;look, we actually do beta, see?&quot; and more about actually fixing things.  When talking to a friend on a different character, the best quopte i will ever take away was  &quot;Yeah, we could have fixed testing. If they ever implemented it seriously I guess&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fun times. Wait, no, cause nothing really was fixed. Amazingly, somewhere in the neighborhood of &quot;most&quot; issues reported in Beta... made it to live.<br />
<br />
Thats great testing.  Sorry, this is the first thread ive vented on about this subject.  My advice   is to not sweat much, cause if there really is a problem, its not going to get fixed anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The problem you have is mindset.<br />
<br />
LDoN is a completely different game from EQ as we know it. <br />
<br />
There is NO Camping.<br />
There is VERY little pulling.<br />
There is no it back and wait for MT to get aggro then kill.<br />
There is not much CC.<br />
<br />
There is NO MEDDING.<br />
<br />
You want to play LDoN? You want an adventure?<br />
<br />
You get a SLOWER, any Healer, 2-3 tanks and dps.<br />
<br />
Why 2-3 tanks?<br />
If you want to complete mission, you will be killing 3-4 mobas at a time, CONSTANTLY for 90+ minutes.<br />
<br />
PoT9, BST crack, C5 -- SK's OOM in 30 minutes trying to do the SK tank thing... Pallies same thing... In LDON they tank the old fashioned way.<br />
<br />
LDoN has the potential to be a great expansion for tank classes in general.<br />
<br />
If you wait for single pulls, if you mezz everything, if you pacify pull... <br />
<br />
You will run out of time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As long as the time limit is not like 'do this in 15 minutes' I am quite confident even the uberest of casters can use up their mana in that time.

<br />
No. Not at all actually, completly not this at all, that is what you described as other expansions, not LDON<br />
<br />
Just as Landrain said, But we didn't slow any mobs.  Because mobs have such low hitpoints we just used dmg shields.   This expansion is nothing like the other expansions.  Take a Cazic Thule / Droga mob and then remove 3/4 of their hitpoints. <br />
<br />
If you wait for single pulls, if you mezz everything, if you pacify pull...  <br />
<br />
Yes, and casters won't go oom.. well they shouldn't.  My enchanter could barely get an Insanity/Dementing off before the mob was dead.   This expansion takes everything you thought you knew and changes it.  You can get by in these adventures with any healer/caster/melee group.<br />
<br />
It seems some of the folks in this post/on this board wouldn't be happy palying ANY character, wether its a warrior or not.  They'll just whine and complain about anything. <br />
<br />
I guess in &quot;theory&quot; every class availble right now could solo any of the mobs that we have come across on our adventures, now put that in a group killing one or three of these at a time and the make up the party really doesn't matter.  <br />
<br />
SK's OOM in 30 minutes trying to do the SK tank thing... Pallies same thing <br />
<br />
I don't know how much mana pool is needed to cast non stop for 1.5 hrs but that's the whole point of this is you don't have to use these methods to keep agro.  Just go attack some mobs in a room and kill them, chances are the casters might only get in one nuke and there probably isnt even a reason to slow them, let the shaman/enchanter nuke/atk/charm/dot whatever.  <br />
<br />
If you understand the taunt button and proximity agro your going to be keeping enough agro to not worry.   Let the BST tank, who cares, get the mobs in control and go get another, since you pulled and are attacking while they are finishign the others you will keep agro enough to not worry about anything.<br />
<br />
I had origianlly defined these adventures as a modified PoJ trials but it seems that most folks have only done the Executioner trial and probably used a &quot;warrior&quot; to try to keep agro on one mob continuously.  Whatever, think outside the box and go try a different trial.<br />
<br />
Im starting to sound bitter and I apologize, Im going to stop posting about LDON or succumb to the &quot;I hate warriors but I am a warrior&quot; threads.  Enjoy the game folks, see yas online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This has really got my goat.  I don't want to dungeon crawl so I can hurry through the dungeon killing things as fast as I can.  That totally seems to eliminate the fun part of scouting, planning, and executing an attack that makes dungeon crawls fun.  A time limit will boil the entire thing down to if you have CC and DPS so you can clear large amounts of mobs in a short amount of time, and those two things are things warriors have in very short supply.  If this is true, and EVERY dungeon/mission has a time limit, I may have to rethink ordering this expansion until it goes live and I hear more about it.  <br />

<br />
see your helping prove my point. <br />
<br />
In the game right now the knight class is king of exp groups. Nothing in any of the crawls I have been on required a warrior. <br />
<br />
As I said thats not good for us, most people would rather have a sk/pally if you dont need a warrior. <br />
<br />
Simply put if your having issues lfg now (and if you have enough friends and a guild that can provide you exp groups that does not count) you will continue to be lfg in this expansion.<br />
<br />
There is no reason for the war/cleric combo in this expansion. <br />
<br />
any healer - any tank - slower - dps will work<br />
<br />
thats not a good thing when warriors bring dick to a group. When pallys can rez 90% and the druid can snare/nuke clerics will not be as needed (not like they have issues getting a group but still)<br />
<br />
you probably do not have any issues getting a group. As I said.. i don't have a problem becasue I make my own. But for a lot of warriors finding a group is a chore. I never had that issue till I played on beta. After 2 days of lfg and not one group (loggin in for 2 hours lfg while I was watching sk/pallys get groups 15 min after puting up the lfg tag) I realized that this expansion was going to hurt us. <br />
<br />
and like I said. Its not going to get better for them when ldon comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Apothes, the more you talk the more convinced I am you are not in on design decisions.<br />
<br />
The only thing you use open beta for is to check features implemented.  Features are supposed to be complete before beta.  The only things testers are supposed to do is check to see if it works.  If something is missing (like Warrior issues) then its too late.  It will be released with it missing.<br />
<br />
No sane product manager asks testers for feature ideas.  Besides, it is plainly too late in the design process.  Especially in a MMOG you really don't want random people injecting their opinions on class design.  Why would SOE believe some Warrior over some Paladin over anyone else in the beta program?  Even if they did its too late anyway.  To implement something NOW, two weeks away from the LDoN release would be hard to complete let a lone hard to test.</div></div><hr />

One that comes to mind, was camping Frenzy in LG and I was pulling. Pulled the hand (long pull if you don't know LG) and had pops on the way back. I think when I arrived in camp, I had about 6 mobs chasing. Everyone took a half second to panic and then we turned into a killing machine. I know we had a mage in the group, becuase part of the greatness of that fight was gettiing the mobs that pet was on agroed and mezzed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">There seems to be some mis-conceptions regarding testing here.  Beta testing = UAT (user acceptance testing).  The goal of UAT (depending on the product) is to get a group of users to agree that there are no &quot;show stopper&quot; defects in the software.  This is not the same as system testing in which a development team validates that all the design has been replicated and performs as expected...system testing happens BEFORE Beta/UAT.  As far as I am aware of the MMORG population does not participate in this testing (and its debateable on the measure of input they get into the design phase).  Generally the software is frozen at this point UNLESS a &quot;showstoper&quot; defect is brought out.<br />
<br />
Now in the case of MMORG a &quot;showstopper&quot; has a much narrower context than say in a air traffic control system or an OTC trading application.  I'd guess (because of economics aka release date and the fact that the &quot;users&quot; of an MMORG are alot less in power than a normal user say the head of a trading desk who ponies up 10 million for an app) that the ONLY showstopper defects would be for performance or &quot;gross&quot; functional defects (say leaving a zone entrance out).  IMHO all of you that are hoping that &quot;gross functional defects&quot; (like balancing issues etc)will be &quot;tuned&quot; are IMHO setting yourself up for your expectations to not be met.<br />
<br />
As for the release itself, /shrug  I think that raced encounters isn't dungeon crawling at all but more of the POJ trials dressed up as something else.  Personally I think this is crapola (if I wanted to do team-timed-objective on line activities there are games INFINITELY better at it than EQ already on the market).  IMHO good design = satisfying (within an established scope) the desires/needs of your customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree with this, I do not find it at all disapointing.  Once I learned the tricks tanking PoJ trials, I began to enjoy them.  I now use my mage to help guildies get thru trials as part of backflagging, and enjoy the hell out of it.  So for me, the idea that these events are races sounds kinda fun and enjoyable, and I am looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
As far as how this will affect our class, simply put, I do not have neough information yet.  2 different views here, and it is very hard to say without experiencing it how it will affect things.  I suspect that perception will be a big part of how it impacts warriors.  If people feel that our slightly higher DPS, and ability to /disc defensive is important against some end mob in each dungeon, then we could be sitting good.  If, as one person suggests, more than one tank is ideal for the encounters, then warriors will be sitting good.  If agro control, and utility is more important than tanking, we are screwed.  Either way I am looking forward to this expansion, both because I like dungeons, and because I liked the idea of timed events(tho I dread the idea that soon cold and flue season will start, and timed events + a need for frequent trips to the bathroom will create some discomfort).</div></div><hr />

What did you want? A group only dungeon that lasts forever and allows you to move through it killing one mob and then AFK medding full for the next pull?<br />
<br />
These adventures are fun for me and the folks I've gone in with.   We have to watch mana and the time while racing through these dungeons trying to accomplish a goal.  WTF do you want to do? sit and study the moss on the rocks?  Pull each mob ONLY if your ENTIRE group is full mana and full life?<br />

Listen, they got rid of spawn camps, they got rid of having to maintain agro for a 2 minute fight, they got rid of quad hitting semi truck mobs, they are giving you your own private dungeon for 90 minutes, they are giving you customizeable armor... <br />

<br />
Maybe theres something wrong with your warrior but don't be so general as to lump me into your prejudice.<br />
<br />
And we've always had 15 minutes or more left for each adventure.  Just don't be a gimp and wait for everyone to be &quot;ready&quot; like you do in PoP grinds.  Just move through the dungeons, fight the mobs, pull more while moving forward (crawling).  <br />
<br />
Think outside the box... you don't have to have just one mob in camp at a time, you don't have to have the monk feighn pull, you don't have to keep agro on each mob the entire 30 seconds.  I guess you don't recall palying in LGUK when EQ was first released and no one understood &quot;agro&quot; and the point was &quot;kill the mob&quot;.

Too bad we will (as always) be left behind. <br />

My solution is simply not buy the expansion until warriors are needed in exp groups.<br />

What I am asking for is simple.. if you are a warrior do these 2 things. <br />

1. Do not order Ldon or cancel your Ldon pre-order<br />
2. Send one feedback in. State if warriors are not balanced in time for Ldon you will not be ordering it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Apothes, the more you talk the more convinced I am you are not in on design decisions.<br />
<br />
umm did I say I was in on design decisions? I merely stated that when a product goes beta it is feature complete. I am talking beta not specifically to SoE all companys use the same priciples for beta that i have experienced.) I have shipped quite a few products to beta and RTM (release to manufacturing) so I know what is required to ship a product to teh public. I am in no way saying SoE does it this way as we can see with PoP and Luclin they were not zone complete when those 2 released. but you cannot say one un beta zone will make a difference to the expansion that people will not see for months. (in the case of luclin, PoP)<br />
<br />
you should already know this ( I believe I stared it before) but my rl job is as a STE (software test engineer) atm I have worked in the industry 9 years done everything from simple testing to building. SoE test practicies are not the best but as a large corporation that has devs that come from all parts of the world and testers they have the same basic knowledge as any tester or derv does with any company and certain things must happen before you go beta.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is if someone is on beta and posting what they are posting nothing major is going to change with the beta release. SoE has stated they so not use expansions to class balance so that means maybe the warrior will get a upgrade before or after LoN and the same applies if they decide to nerf knights.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
If something is missing (like Warrior issues) then its too late. It will be released with it missing.<br />
<br />
Not true at all that's why there is war well what we call it here every week and daily as the product comes closer to beta or final release. The powers that be get together and go to war over bug's/issues and if it makes it through war then the fix is taken. Just because you forgot something and find it after beta does not mean you will not take a fix fir it cause you have to ship it right now. it all comes down to how important do the powers that be believe the issue is and how many of the end users will experience the issue determines if a fix goes in or not.<br />
<br />
It really all comes down to the almight $$ and public opinion on wheater something gets fixed as a result of beta or not. usually though if the fix requires a new feature it will not go in untill the nex rev of the product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">actually I have no issues with aggro. Or getting groups. But then again looking at what I read and other warriors I talk to thats not common.<br />
<br />
 I am not whining for me.. im fine, like I said.. i have my own group. Being in the beta has opened my eyes to what everyone else has been bitching about. Sitting in a zone lfg for the first time since i was lvl 45 (when I had problems getting a group) for a few hours made me think<br />
<br />
If i was a 59th lvl warrior with 59th lvl gear and maybe a ok weapon and ok stats with no guild (or a small guild) and no friends on at the time.. could I get a group over a pally/sk? From what I read. Yes but not if provided a choice the pally/sk would win 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
My argument is simple. Right now knights are the undisputed kings of xp groups. This expansion will not change that. So if you have issues finding a group now, do not think that buying this expansion will get you in a group any faster than you can get one now.<br />
<br />
if you think thats wrong, think of this. In any exp group that you are in where you do not need defensive, a Knight will be 100% better than you at holding aggro and have 98% of your tanking power. <br />
<br />
If you  played a caster and you could use a warrior or a knight to tank..  who would you pick?<br />
<br />
If you say warrior your the minority. Look around at the wizard/druid/shammy boards. They all agree.<br />
<br />
as far as that time with 30 sec left to finish it.. no we had 2-3 fighting us at any one time. It was just fooking huge with lots of mobs. We asked for the drop rate to be upped a bit as the one before we finished with 30 min to spare<br />
<br />
and this was a real no betabuffed group. at 65aa's i was the lowest in the group. everyone else had 120+ aa's so we were tearing through it.<br />
<br />
put a group of 64's in there and they would have never beat it. But it was still fun.</div></div><hr />

There are so many options for a dungeon crawl (going back to the D&amp;D days) that dont involve black &amp; white solutions (think outside the box....there are other ways to change the content w/o having either a &quot;wait and pull&quot; or a &quot;super mario brothers rush against time&quot;.  <br />

My point was simply they did it already with PoP 1 group trials.  Of course I havent seen the beta so I'll reserve judgment until this thing is released.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Something happened to me last week that really put the agro differece into perspective for me. In LDoN, there are really two types of characters. People who already had elemental access and got a character in full time gear, and those who created stock 65 characters with asstastic gear.<br />
<br />
I was in a group, and was foolish enough to group with 5 character in the stock asstastic player category. One happened to be a Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
My character used:<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord / Edge of Eternity / Symbol of the Planesmasters<br />
<br />
and tossed around a bit because of this pissant SK. He wore a Primal Velium Claidhmore the whole time, and had approx 3.5k hp unbuffed in my best estimate. Most of the gear was 30 hp or less on it.<br />
<br />
I annoyed him early on because I bitched him out for taking agro on EVERY SINGLE MOB from me. He chalked it up to me sucking, since despite the fact that I've played a Warrior quite comptetently since Beta 4, and was wearing the best gear in the game possible, short of quibbles in 5 or so AC or avoidance, this little shitface was able to pull agro from me without trouble at all for the entire group.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with LDoN except for the fact that yes, in the one group encounters you won't need a warrior, and the fact that its so easy to test a crappy SK vs BEST POSSIBLE WARRIOR and the SK wins in agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Knights are basically idiot-proof tanks.  For that reason it is very unlikely warriors will ever come close to them in aggro (because it makes everything too easy), and also if you really believe aggro is the only thing that matters, you will never be desired over a Knight.  The game does not support Warriors having Knight-level aggro so if aggro &gt; all, you are always inferior anyway.<br />
<br />
While I think the better thing to do for the game is to nerf Knight aggro so that people will have to learn how to be good players, if there must be a change without nerfing Knights, then do something like what Kreugen suggested, make Warriors able to taunt mobs of their level or lower vastly better (increase aggro by about 25% on even or lower mobs would probaly do it).  You can even make it trivially easy to get aggro and it won't effect the high end since I can't think of any high end mobs that are lower than level 65.  Though I think this won't really solve anything because either it's not enough, or if it's adequate which in today's terms seems to mean anyone can try to kill themselves but cannot, why would you ever want a Knight, especially Paladin, in such a controlled environment?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Nope, answer me this - if it won't affect your superiority in grouping why do you give a flying **** wether it gets a 'nerf' or not? Despite how you keep telling me it doesn't make a difference you hang on tenaciously to that advantage don't you.<br />
<br />
I half agree with you btw, given similar aggro and similar tanking the knights still bring more to the table particularly for LDoN. <br />
<br />
However wether this 'balances' Warriors and knights or not it is still a neccessary first step that no particular plate tank class has a MAJOR advantage in either mitigation or aggro. Having massive aggro but no tankability was proven not to work in Kunark, Having major differences between tank classes in their ability to gain aggro was proven not to work in PoP. As the knights like to tell us over and over  having utility does NOT compensate for lacking in the basic tank requirements. Once plate tanks mitigate and aggro comparably - only then will secondary benefits be used to determine who you take - once we all have relative parity i would suggest utility can then be tweaked for whomsoever needs it (probably warriors).<br />
<br />
Parity in aggro is required, you could do that by giving warriors similar aggro to knights currently, however just about anybody I   speak too feels their level of control is 'too good' at this time thus my arguement that a new aggro point that still requires classes to excercise some thought needs to be decided on and all tank classes have their aggro adjusted to suit it. <br />

<br />
Basic fact, pure casters can solo exp faster than they can group it(mostly).  And yet many, if not most, pure casters prefer to group.  Partly it is because the chance of downing a named is better(chanters are partially the exception here) in a full group.  Also, a full group offers a little more safety, combined with a nice social situation.<br />
<br />
Let me offer an idea:  we nerf knight agro.  Knights can now agro slightly better than warriors over a long period of time, and can create large agro spikes for brief times.  We up taunt success rates for all taunt classes, and slightly lower refresh time on taunt.  Would this work?<br />
<br />
You would suggest that if we do that, then rangers, bards and BL's will move into tanking roles(at least, you have sugggested this in the past...think it was you anyway).  If this becomes a problem, either turn up mob damage a bit more, or turn down these classes mitigation(if they can tank successfully, they are mitigating too well, they are not designed to be able to tank well).  Over the course of couple months, tweaks and adjustments are made.<br />
<br />
Why would this not work?<br />
<br />
Edit:  I want to add I do not suggest this is the only, or even the best, solution to current balance problems.  It simply is one solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">something i found quite hilarious recently  was a thread (may have been FoH board) where a warrior complained at the dull one note role (hit taunt, attack, kick etc) he played in a group.

<br />
(not a direct quote btw, forgot the names of the stuns akilae and something :p)<br />
<br />
What is so amazingly silly about this is that the whole reason his utility isn't useful is that the mob is never out of control.

I was off working on faction(GoDS and BoDS soon, got the drops, just need the faction, and we have stopped doing Dain/Yeli, so killing dorfs is keeping me busy).  Some one in guild asks if any tanks want a BoT mid south group.  Guild SK(elemental flagged and high end gear) says he will take it.  A bit later he says in /gu to the guy who invited him 'Tell your idiot chanter to not tash, slow and then immedietly sit down'.  I guess the chanter left the group in a huff, throwing a fit about non agro SK's.  How did some one, with that little of a clue get to be 65?  Upping warrior agro is only going to make the game better for people like that chanter.  They want snap agro and agro lock so they do not have to use any sort of ingame skill.  I prefer a solution where some small bit of skill is needed by all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">You know, I can see we have a major difference of opinion here.  I just can't stand how fubared Warrior aggro generation is currently.  It is literally unpleasant for me to tank in PoP because it is pretty much a foregone conclusion that the slower is going to be tanking slightly less than I am and my tools to prevent that are less than steller.  I'm not adverse to risk, I am adverse to being given randomly sporadic tools which may work or may not do anything at all.  And while I understand the logic involved with the concept where Knights get their aggro generation nerfed this may open up more group slots for Warriors, I just don't see it making the game more pleasant when we'll still be relying on randomly sporadic tools.<br />
<br />
Why exactly is it fun in your opinion to have abilities that just can't be relied on and why is it fun to try and make everyone else have similarly unreliable tools?  Challenge should come from the envirornment, not from the inabiilty of a class to reliably impact the environment.  If you think experience grinding is too trivial, than you should be advocating mobs that mitigate slow more, that can't be single pulled even with lull or a monk.  Or any number of things which will add challenge without gimping every tank into marginal usefulness and forcing them to cringe everytime a mob is pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">An interesting thing I said over on PON basically went like this:<br />
<br />
If you are in an mobile guild, then exp groups should be easier since you can have your pick of any dangerous and risky but rewarding events.  If you aren't in a mobile guild, then you are stuck with flat and easy exp group that are somewhat boring.<br />
<br />
This is where I believe the division lies.  The most times I've died during a day was 10 and that was attempting a new event.  The last thing I wanted to find after a break was declared was to die to some Valor yard trash.  On the other hand someone who has to hang out in Valor all day is probably begging for something different to happen on the next pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Knights are basically idiot-proof tanks. For that reason it is very unlikely warriors will ever come close to them in aggro (because it makes everything too easy),  <br />
<br />
It does with knights now, so what's your point?  It's obviously ok for them to have aggro dominence, and in some cases better hp/ac (plus a wonderful array of spells) but to give a warrior the same level of aggro would be game breaking? I don't see the fine line difference between the two. If we had the same aggro ability we'd still be lacking heals, rez, LoH, etc..<br />
<br />
I'm one of those asstacular stock 65 warriors, and I regularly run into knights that have really close to or better hp/ac than myself. How did they get that? Through the same AA's we use to beef up with. The difference being that they get snatched up into a group as soon as they put on the lfg tag.<br />
<br />
For those of us that didn't manage to get into the elemental planes and beyond we're a far cry behind the curve from those that did. The playing field is going to be so skewed from here on out that most will never catch up. Right now we have 65 warriors with 4k and some with 8k unbuffed hit points. Before this expansion the top end wasn't double what the mid end was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the point, during an exp session with Red there are going to be more occasions where the mob is not hitting the tank but still nobody needs to die! There should be at least some bloody risk to it though! <br />
<br />
Glatius, you want more control because you feel inadequate, do you really want aggro on demand as the knights offer though? <br />
<br />
Aeka, you raid, you die more but you also garner the rewards for doing so. That is the trade off. You cannot gimp a section of the game that many people rely exclusively on for entertainment just cause you want an easy life. <br />
<br />
We're not talking edge of the seat excitement every second here, where every button push spells the difference between life and death (although that'd be fun in small doses). We're talking reasonable entertainment with acceptable levels of risk.<br />
<br />
There is miniscule risk associated with knight level aggro. By all means change the environment and other factors as well, but there is no arguement that seems valid to me for the ability to totally secure the mobs attention with a couple of button pushes, not for any class that doesn't wilt under the hammering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Val, that sums it up very nicely.  As I stated in the post I made with my little proposal, I do not suggest that my solution is the only solution, or the best, but it would work.  It combines more safety when grouped with wariors, more risk when grouped with knights(after all, what it all boils down to is safety for the casters, and I am shooting for a middle ground), no one overpowered or underpowered, and hopefully all 3 tank classes equally desired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I know is that when the mob is pulled to camp, I want to represent as much of a viable tank as any similar Knight.  I want to know that if the Shaman feels like slowing right now, there is something I can do about that and it will work.  I don't necessarily feel that the entire group should be able to stand up and blow their entire mana bar on a single mob and it should never leave me.  But I do believe that PoP was designed with slow as a requirement.  And since slow is a requirement, I don't believe it's fair or reasonable for the game to give a quick and easy counter to the aggro of slow to two tank classes while leaving the third with a clunky sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and we aren't even going to tell which time this is, ability.<br />
<br />
Should I be able to fail a taunt?  Sure.  Should I be able to fail 4 in a row?  No freaking way.  Come the third taunt the odds of my regaining the mob's attention should be a foregone conlusion.  I should almost never have to taunt a third time and only once in a blue moon have to taunt a second time.  Either that, or the number of times I'm allowed to taunt in a fixed time range should be increased.<br />
<br />
And the reason I feel inadequate is because my freaking tools don't work.  Kind of hard to feel adequate when your major aggro control tool fails around 40% of the time and can easily fail 3 or 4 times in a row and result in the death of a teammate, not because you took risks, not because you took on more than you could chew, but because your so called &quot;abilities&quot; just don't always work.  I mean why don't they just have CH fail 40% of the time after you've already spent the time to cast it and the game not even tell you it's failed?  That'd be some challenge, eh?  I wonder how adequate Clerics would be feeling if that happened?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">The way I view the game (and many other do) is that you can spend two hours taking a big risk killing big monsters to get a shot at something worthwhile (a flag or a piece of equipment).<br />
<br />
Or we can take your route on the game.  Take next two hours taking a big risk killing low yield monsters for the shot at killing the next low yield monster.<br />
<br />
There is no comparison.  If I'm going to risk my time, plat, and exp then I'm going to kill a big monster that actually makes me eating an occational death worthwhile.  Exp is not worth dying over.<br />
<br />
I wonder where this idea that &quot;difficult = fun&quot; came up.  Accomplishing a difficult task by outsmarting the setup is fun.  Killing exp groups is pretty far from either of these.  I can pick any number of ways to die.  I pick to not die in exp groups. <br />
<br />
I find it amusing when people get mad about dying in exp groups, having them stolen, or any number of penny ante stuff that surrounds exp groups.  In the POP environment it plainly isn't worth the trouble at the moment.  That might change with LDoN so who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit!  If you want it that way, lets just set up an exp vender in city zones.  Farm some greens for cash and buy aa's.  Sounds rediculous doesn't it?  And yet that is basically what you want, no risk, mindless exp.<br />
<br />
Let me clue you in on something, dying is meaningless in PoP.  You loose a few minutes while you recover, then go back at it.  At most 30 minutes after you have died, you have all the exp you lost back, and usually a lot more.  If you are unwilling to risk a few minutes downtime then you have no business even bothering to exp.  <br />

Glatius, again, you are right, taunt fails too much.  Taunt succuss rates should be tuned up a little bit.  But do you really think that agro lock is good for EQ?</div></div><hr />

I think anything is good for the game that keeps people playing and they enjoy.  If I enjoyed killing greens for cash and buying AAXP, then that would be fine with me.  Maybe the vendor does a little dance everytime I buy an AAXP point that is enjoyable, who knows.  I play the game to have fun.  Reasonable challenges can add to that fun.  Dumbass challenges added by making things fail routinely detract from that fun.  As far as whether or not Knights should be nerfed, I'm not getting on that wagon.

This strikes me as funny.<br />
<br />
There used to be a bug with CH, where you'd heal someone who was close to death, and it would full out say the heal landed (even how much it healed), but the game still acted like the heal never landed when that person got hit next, and they died.  Healed for 2000+hp, yet a 100hp hit kills you.  Never happened anywhere close to 40%, it was somewhat rare, but it happened.<br />
<br />
Took a while for it to be fixed, if I remember right...and it still keeps popping up every so often (the bug is how the heals are reported to the server and the other player)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Listen up, you devs who are reading this thread.  <br />
<br />
You have pushed the warrior class into an increasingly narrowing specialized tank position.  We have very little utility (we have our discs and /shield).  We rely completely on specialized equipment, namely EB weapons, which aren't even fucking dropped every time, or near as I can see, every other time, off the mobs they drop from.  Yeah, that's right, 3 AOW kills with no fucking BoC.  2+ XTC kills with no HG, the list goes on and on. <br />
<br />
The other day a paladin tanked over the warrior on a raid, because he could hold aggro.  This was in addition to healing his group, buffing, and even battle-rezzing to help out the clerics.  What was the warrior relegated to?  DPS.  And a crappy DPS at that. Why would the premiere TANK be reduced to that?  That's what POP has done you fucking dev fruitcake cocksucking asslicking mongrels.  You've given casters nice upgrades, I won't even list them all because a lot of people here agree that casters have gotten the lion's share of every single fucking upgrades in every single god damn patch for the past 4 or so months.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but until you, as a dev, play an 8k+ tank in an exp group and are asked to STEP DOWN as tank, and let a 6k paladin knight DUE TO AGGRO ISSUES, then you don't know fucking jack ass, you fucking hippy caster-loving ball of slimecoated dog shit.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm talking to you, you DEV reading the board, it's NOT FUN anymore to not have any utility or use outside MAYBE being asked to tank a mob that would be more efficient with a /disc warrior tanking.  No, I'm not in EPs yet, perhaps its different there.  Don't tell me I'm not uber, I don't care.  I represent a middle-class warrior, with access to Sol Ro tower and ornate molds, but I often find myself taking what pickup groups I can find in places like BoT where I helplessly watch (or press /shield) as the chanter slows after 10 seconds of me working up aggro, and goes down to 50% hp wasting the fucking cleric's mana and me standing there going sorry, sorry, as the mob takes a nice big swipe at everyone's hp when it pingpongs.<br />
<br />
You think I enjoy that?  Don't get me wrong, I love the warrior class, I've spent 2 years working on my toon and I'm not rerolling, don't even ask me to you Dev shithead, you can blow it out your fat ass.<br />
<br />
FIX.  WARRIORS.  NOW.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, NOW.  Before your precious expansion comes out and you lose MY revenue.  I hope you copy and paste this to whatever shithole you devs read, I hope you laugh at me, maybe you'll remember my words and how frustrated I get with *some aspects* of playing a warrior/this game.  I've sent /feedback in game, I've even gone so far as to cancel my account for a few months to go back to DAOC and reactivate it (at the urgings of friends).  Don't tell me to quit the game again, I don't want to.  I play this game mostly for the social aspect, keeping in touch with friends, doing fun stuff,  and raiding.  It's a fucking tough blow to eat when my main, my favorite char, the toon I've invested 2 years and over 90 days /played, the toon I levelled up from level 1, un-PL'd, untwinked, is.... frustrating in the extreme to play due to lack of utility.  Due to being so over-specialized that when the one thing we can do well, tank, is usurped on a daily basis by knights, I feel utterly useless.  <br />
<br />
Tell me, Mr./Ms. Dev, what utilities a warrior has outside of tanking?  <br />
<br />
Now, what does a knight have?<br />
<br />
Balanced?  OH I HAVE AN IDEA.  Why don't you tweak the living hell out of druid heal spells, give them supernal elixir, cleric style CH, and the rest of the cleric heal spells.  Take away EVERYTHING else the cleric has save rez. Can you see the similarities between this situation and the one that exists now between warriors and knights?   <br />
<br />
What is LDON going to bring to the table for warriors?  Kindly post here and inform this community just what exactly we'll be getting out of our $25 or so.  Because I sure as hell am not paying for a few new dungeon zones and an extended version of the POJ trial where mobs are fucking bouncing all over the goddamn place and I can DO NOTHING ABOUT IT but run around like a chicken with my  head cut off.<br />
<br />
You bet I'm frustrated.  Maybe you as a dev should pick up a copy of EQ and actually... play it.  As a warrior.  In a BoT group, on a random server somewhere.  Without EB weapons,  And then maybe you'll start to see our lack of utility and frustration.<br />

Again, note above.  Let's step back from the elitist crap tho and remember that not everyone has the time, nor the inclination to raid.  Should the game not be balanced for them, so you can have your gimme exp?  I enjoy challenges, and I want a game that is challenging at all phases.  For exp, if you are not willing to accept a small risk, and a small challenge, you don't deserve exp.  Nothing should be free, or else they might as well have /dotestbuff on regular servers, and let you just make a level 65 with max aa's.<br />

The game has already been gimped to a certain degree, by SoE.  It's already the case that casters don't need tanks, if the don't want them.  They can easily work around them with pets, charmed pets, aggro kiting, fear kiting, and so forth.  Every time you make grouping harder, you increase the number of people, who are perfectly capable of doing without a tank, do with out that tank.  People are passing by Warriors left and right and going with a Knight instead.  But if you reduced Knight aggro lock and people found grouping with them trying, many of them have perfectly viable alternatives.  So, are we going to have all the tanks, monks, and rogues standing around LFG while everyone goes about figuring out ways to get by without us?<br />

There are ways around those problems(tweaking group exp bonuses and ZEMs to make grouping more rewardable, more mobs that simply require a plate tank to beat, etc).  There are no easy solutions, but that does not make the problem unsolvable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">If the need for tanking is an issue, then just make mobs summon.  It's a cheap fix but summoning guaranteeds that you need tanking in some form.  The reverse is also true.  Mobs that do not summon never requires any tanking, Warriors or otherwise.  I have never heard of any group of casters taking a paladin when they're aggro kiting because it's simply not needed.  As long as mobs do not summon basically all tanking classes are equally undesirable to casters in the long run because they could avoid the mob forever on their own.</div></div><hr />

I don't think LDoN is responsible for this :) Much of EQ has been flat, dull, boring, etc for years...<br />
<br />
As they say, it's not the destination, it's the journey!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">ya, and LDoN will be the final blow, the &quot;Coup de Grace&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I've had little trouble getting into groups on LDoN. Its pretty fun, and the groups are going as the people become available. Knights rarely tank, and all is well. LDoN is in happy perfect land right now! Warriors could use a little more agro, nuttin else, quit your bitching.... We don't need to hold agro from start to finish effortlessly.. We just need to have enough agro that the group doesn't have to be quite as conservative with theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I have serious misgivings about LDoN.  Why?  Because it's going to require people to be in a group of 5 or 6 to play there at all.  Well this is a grouping game, so why would this concern me?  I'll tell you.  I got sick and tired of the raid game a while ago.  It became a second job to me, and not a very enjoyable one as one of the last tanks in the line up.  And many of my guildmates were much like coworkers to me, people who were pleasant enough but many not people I'd hang around without outside of work if I could avoid it.  And on top of that, people had already figured out that Warriors in PoP were the suck and so I had a hard time getting groups as well.  So I began to double box more and more, attend raids less and less, and finally I left the guild.<br />
<br />
So here I am, a 65 Warrior with only 45 AAXP a year after PoP has been released (keep in mind I was level 60, one mob from 61 when it was released) who pretty much hates PoP and has no guild anymore.  <br />
<br />
Now what does LDoN offer me?  It sounds like many of the encounters are going to be about DPS more than anything, and of course Warriors are not a major DPS class.  It sounds like most of the mobs can be tanked by almost anyone, so no big driving need for Warriors there.  It sounds like LDoN is going to be an expansion where Beastlords will rock.  Where Monks might be attractive.  Where the Knight's ability to allow massive DPS might be of benefit.  Where the light tanks will probably shine.  But if anyone can tank the mobs and DPS is a priority, where does that leave the Warrior?  Cast aside, is my suspicion.<br />
<br />
With no guild and it looking like my class will only be included as charity, I suspect LDoN may be the expansion that finally pushes me into telling SoE to do something rude and causes me to leave the game.   This expansion certainly doesn't look, at first glance anway, as anything that will help Warriors and there seems to be fair potential that it will hurt us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Knight aggro lock will allow groups to dish out some serious dps fast without much risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Here is some perspective on aggro lock for those who are still considering that it trivializes the game.  I was double boxing with my 54 Beastlord and 55 Druid today.  I was pulling with the BL and using him to Cleric the pet while the Druid was pure DPS.<br />
<br />
As an example a Mature Wurm I was killing, the Druid cast snare, two drones of doom and 4 casts of ice and the mob never flinched, never left the pet at all.  Altogether the Druid did something like 5200 points of damage on this mob and the pet did the rest.  I'd hazard the guess that the Druid did 2/3 of the total damage, and the pet held aggro far better than a Warrior would have and probably better than a Paladin unless he was seriously chain casting.<br />
<br />
Now, once we get done getting the Knights nerfed, are we going to target pets next?  And what else will need to be nerfed in order to not &quot;tivialize&quot; the experience game?  Who should have their current abilities whacked so Warriors can have only slightly better aggro than currently and everyone else has to be brought down to match?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who pissed in my wheaties?<br />
<br />
Why is it not the same pile of crap if you guys refuse to try them and then whine about how boring the game got?<br />
<br />
Right or wrong this is what SOE dropped on guilds. POP puts the challenge in events not exp groups. Argue the merits of this system if you want but please don't play the &quot;pity me this game is boring&quot; because all you do is sit in exp groups.<br />
<br />
That elitist trash did a good job of getting my temper up. Aeka is telling us that anybody who doesn't choose to raid and spends their time in EQ exp. grouping (that's you btw) is a whiny, sub par player who refuses to take risks and properly play the game.<br />
<br />
She can take that attitude and shove it up her shiny-plated arse. <br />
<br />
I think perhaps you're not thinking through things completely. If we're no fun to play with, Knights included, people will just play without us. And how much fun will that be for us? <br />
<br />
Warriors, with aggro worse than whatever the 'future balance' may be still get groups - it's just unaided taunt makes it difficult to do the job, and third choice behind knights. So obviously there is not going to be a total removal of tank using groups otherwise none of us would ever get a group would we? <br />
<br />
You may also remember that in my thread on Tank (not just warrior) utility I proposed that plate tanks in combination should be able to form a viable exp group via a combination of their secondary abilities. Then we wouldn't be absolutely borked without the casters :p (although it'd be balanced to be more efficient with). WTF are casters when it comes right down to it, able to sidestep their main weakness (lack of durability) for anyway? I'm well aware we're dealing with an imperfect game but that doesn't mean we shouldn't push for corrections.<br />
<br />
I don't think Aeka want's to gimp the game.<br />
<br />
The way I view the game (and many other do) is that you can spend two hours taking a big risk killing big monsters to get a shot at something worthwhile (a flag or a piece of equipment).<br />
<br />
Or we can take your route on the game. Take next two hours taking a big risk killing low yield monsters for the shot at killing the next low yield monster.<br />
<br />
There is no comparison. If I'm going to risk my time, plat, and exp then I'm going to kill a big monster that actually makes me eating an occational death worthwhile. Exp is not worth dying over. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see how she could be more explicit about her views Glatius. She feels she should not risk death  at all in experience groups cause she gets all hung up about dying while raiding (lol). I've died countless times raiding in the past, i accepted it like most people as part of the deal instead of whining about it and offering that 'debt' as a reason to remove any challenge from exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">And as the final nail...<br />
<br />
<br />
The Vie spells <br />
<br />
I just did a very small test of this spell (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4091&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Without Vie: max hit 110, min hit 34 <br />
With Vie: max hit 99, min hit 31 <br />
<br />
Vie didnt drop before the duration ran out - despite me taking a good deal of damage. <br />
<br />
Thus it seems rather obvious just how it will be working - and I would say its a very usefull buff.<br />
<br />
we are so fucked when this expansion comes out...<br />
<br />
Pally/sk with that will tank as good as a warrior without it.. and like i said.. nothing yet has shown a need for defensive.<br />
<br />
So with this buff knights can tank as well as a warrior while having 100% better aggro lock.<br />
<br />
guess the devs do read the board... <br />
<br />
&quot;What? knights can tank 95% as well as warriors... Quick make a buff that makes them take 10% less damage. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I guess they couldn't come up with a way to balance the warriors with the knights and they just gave up. Perhaps they wish we would all re-roll to make their job easier?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">*scratches his head*  I'm really wondering what that is about.  A 10% damage reduction for any of the tank classes would certainly be considered nice.  But getting a tank with head and shoulders better aggro generation and a 10% damage reduction would be far better than a tank with clunky aggro generation and the same 10% damage reduction.  And the recent tests of Paladin versus Warrior posted on Monkly Business show only a 10% gap in tanking between the two.  Which means that a Paladin with Vie on them and otherwise similar to a Warrior in the gear department, would tank JUST LIKE a Warrior without Vie.<br />
<br />
I'm lost at this point.  This will be much more of an improvement for the Knights than the Warriors.  What's next, they're going to make shields have critical bashes for 10x the base damage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I think you guys are missing Aeka's point.  The goal for most people in an xp group is to get as much xp as possible, as fast as possible, with as little risk as possible.  If you're going after some miniboss you're not after xp, you're after the challenge of killing that miniboss and the possibility of the loot it drops.  Because of the way EQ is set up, it's ALWAYS more xp to kill large numbers of easy mobs than it is to kill 1 or 2 really hard mobs.<br />
<br />
So to review, the goal of a raid or a mini raid is to have a challenging fight or to go after loot from some named mob.  The goal of an xp group is to have risk free xp rolling in as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
If knight aggro was nerfed to the point where it was as unreliable as warrior aggro it would not help warriors in the slightest.  The casters would just switch to rangers and beastlords as tanks and NONE of the plate tanks would get groups.  Healing ANY melee class in a traditional xp group is already trivial.  Because of that it is MUCH more efficient to heal any melee class who can hold aggro than it is to heal a caster.  So a caster is either going to use the most efficient tank who can lock aggro or they'll use a non tank who can lock aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">I grouped in BoT today and the shaman complained that he was bored because I never needed any healing.  Yes I have all the defensive AAs, yes I have good aggro weapons and never lost aggro once after getting it initially, and yes we had 5 deaths in 2 hours because on 2 pulls taunt failed 4 or 5 times in a row and I got zero procs.  I did nothing wrong, the tools I have for generating aggro simply didn't do anything on those 2 occasions.  No other class is forced to rely on abilities that are required with such frequency that fail almost 50% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you are saying is that if you do not choose to raid, the game should be boring and mindless.  I tend to disagree.  If there is no risk, no challenge, then there should be no reward, and yes, exp is a reward.  I say this as some one who spends 3/4 of her time in game raiding.  I simply do not feel that Aeka's concept of exp as nothing but a mindless timesink are right.  Aeka(and you I suspect, and I for sure) have the time and energy and drive to experience another facet of the game, most people do not.<br />
<br />
he casters would just switch to rangers and beastlords as tanks and NONE of the plate tanks would get groups. <br />
<br />
High end rangers and beastlords can tank in some situations, but most cannot.  While an ele plain ranger can tank BoT with ease(my best friend in game is just such a ranger), a ranger in bazaar gear(of which there are many more) simply loses health too fast, even on a slowed mob.  I cannot believe that a pickup group is likely to pick random_ranger_01 to tank for BoT, or HoH, or Tactics, or even a tier 2 zone.<br />
<br />
we had 5 deaths in 2 hours because on 2 pulls taunt failed 4 or 5 times in a row and I got zero procs <br />
<br />
Again, I firmly believe that taunt success rates need to be tweaked up.  I also feel that knight levels of agro generation are game breakingly unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

No Red, what they're saying is that you should be able to choose your challenges, not have random deaths thrust on you simply because your tools and abilities randomly fail at strategic moments.  If I want to do mindless yard trash that I know will be little or no trouble for the group I'm with, then I should be allowed that option.  And not have it turned into repeated CRs simply because my tools have been designed to sometimes fail me when I need them.  If I want challenge and risk, I should be able to find that by going places that are challenge and risk for my group because it stretches our reactions, our ability to think, and the critters are tough as nails.<br />
<br />
You know what sucks the most?  Doing everything exactly right and having it not work for no particular reason at all.  While that might be some people's definition of challenge, it sure isn't mine.  I don't want to have my groupmates dying to a PoS yard trash that we've just done 30 in a row with no sweat what so ever, only to have the 31st wipe the group simply because my tools suddenly go whacky.  That's just stupid.  That's just a random death touch.  And it's not challenge.<br />
<br />
I understand you feel taunt's success should be increased slightly.  But your idea of challenge is not my idea of challenge.  And your idea of challenge should no more be the required standard than my idea of challenge.  There are places you can go and things you can do that will challenge your group, even if you aren't big time raiders.  Therefore you shouldn't be trying to force me, or Aeka, or Khumak, or any number of other people, to be required to play constantly at a level of challenge that you consider sufficient.  If you don't feel challenged, then you're free to go find a zone or a spot where you do feel challenged.  While if I feel like doing mindless yard trash because I don't want to think too hard that night or I want to make up lost experience from raids, or I need a couple of AAXP in the most efficient way possible, then that should be left available to me and not done away with just because it doesn't meet your or any other person's level of required challenge.<br />
<br />
We all play the game.  We all have our individual styles in how we want to play the game.  Your style isn't right and mine wrong.  Yours isn't wrong and mine right.  There should be room in an environment the size of EQ for all different styles of play.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sucky group if that's ever happened without someone making a mistake in Valor (probably cause they were asleep at the wheel). Lets turn this whole thing around though shall we - if you want mindless exp. with little to no risk why don't YOU go to some of the older exp zones that still offer blues to kill. Heck go to chardok and mow through multiple mobs at once - it's even fun :p and tank loosing aggro is not so big a deal. You get less exp per mob but then you're puting in less effort so why not?

A resisted slow, a failed taunt, and down goes the chanter.  Now if you want to argue that there are things the group as a whole could have done to try and mitigate that possibility, I'll grant you that, but then we go back into the whole, why do they want to do that when they can get a Knight and not bother arguement.  I want my tools to work.  I see no reason why they shouldn't.  And I don't think it's reasonable to expect the entire group to have to work around my clunky tools.

Maybe so.  But when one faction is screaming add more challenge, add more challenge, all I can do is look at the grief Warrior taunt has brought to my entire EQ playing career and wonder wtf they are thinking.   <br />
<br />
I would never ever try and condemn the rest of the EQ community to trying to deal with anything resembling Warrior taunt/aggro control.  It is without a doubt the most frustrating aspect of the game I have run into for any class, and I've played most of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tank should not be able to garantee his control of the mob either though of course other group memebers actions should have bearing on the group, unless there is room for people to fuck up there is no sense of ajob well done when you don't fuck up. You continue to ignore the fact that those of us arguing against you agree that taunt needs to be more reliable than where it is now, however it should not garantee that the mob stays glued to you which is pretty much the case with knight level aggro generation. <br />

Deaths are not random, as you point out in another spot, there are things a group can do to avoid them.  100 % successful taunt, 100 % successfull agro takes any and all sense of challenge, of risk vs reward out of the game, and turns exp into a simple mindless timesink.  <br />

Knights still die.  Groups using Knight MTs still wipe.  Having your tools work doesn't mean no one ever dies.  It means that your tools work when you use them.  Just because I was to get a successful taunt every time I pushed the key doesn't suddenly make me immune to damage.  It doesn't make my group immune to over pulls.  It doesn't make my group immune to adds brought by gaters.  It doesn't suddenly improve my reactions.  It doesn't suddenly improve the Cleric's reactions.

You're expecting the unreasonable.  It's not reasonable to have things flowing along the same way for a period of time, and then due to no player generated problem what so ever, suddenly the Warrior's tools get all whacky and everyone is supposed to flawless spring into action.  They're supposed to sit there on the edge of their seats waiting for exactly the moment the Warrior's taunt goes to hell, realise exactly when it's happened, and respond exactly correctly to that percise situation.  <br />
<br />
You know what, I have built up almost a spider sense for when my taunt is going to fail.  If I don't get the mob to turn back to me on my first or second taunt, I usually am saying oh crap, here it comes.  But do my teammates know this?  Can they see my button being pressed and it not having any impact?  Do I have the chance to try communicating this to them?  No.  So suddenly after half an hour or 45 minutes of everything going fine, my taunt does a melt down, and everyone is suppose to know that and react accordingly?<br />

*shrug* Your idea of what should be the &quot;required&quot; level of challenge doesn't agree with mine.  Why exactly should yours be the one that gets implemented in the game and not mine?  Why exactly is your concept of enjoyment and desirable challenge superior to mine?  We're both players, we both pay our fees.  Why should I have to accept that you have a better understanding of how challenging the game needs to be for my enjoyment?  Answer is, there is no reason.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather leave well enough alone on Knights because the majority of people have found that they enjoy the way Knights allow them to play the game.  While I'd also like to get closer to being able to offer something similar to a group.  I really don't think that it's fair or reasonable to take away from a Knight's enjoyment of the game solely because some people think it's not &quot;enough&quot; challenge.  If you're feeling underchallenged, you have options.  If people are feeling underchallenged now, they can use a Warrior tank.  But people for the most part lean away from that.  Why?  Because they don't want the additional challenge.  Even if you say it's for their own good, they'll enjoy the game more.  They don't believe you.  They seem to be enjoying the game just fine without the challenge you say they have to have.<br />

<br />
No Red, I'm not misrepresenting what is being said.  It's actually pretty clear.  You feel that there isn't enough challenge when a Knight is used as a group tank and want to decrease their ability to generate snap aggro in order to increase the group's challenge.   To me this equates to making the game less fun.  To you it seems it equates to making it more fun.  But I don't see that, nor do a lot of other people.  People don't pick Knight tanks currently because they increase risk, but rather because they decrease it.  You say they're wrong, the should have to have more risk in order for the game to live up to your expectations.  Yet it seems to be living up to their expectations just fine.  I'm not seeing threads on EQCleric or DruidsGrove to nerf Knight aggro.  Monks aren't screaming about how it trivializes the game and damn it they should have to FD at least a half dozen times per mob just to keep things interesting!  Most people seem perfectly happy with the level of challenge they're able to find in the game.  The exception seems to be a small hand full of Warriors.  And my question is, if people aren't dissatisfied, why must they be forced to adhere to someone else's idea of challenge?</div></div><hr />

I know for a fact, having had several such conversations in groups that  casters think knight mob control is overpowered!<br />
<br />
You argue that we shouldn't restrict your 'fun' when you want to do some mindless exping. There's plenty of places you can go where the threat level of the mobs is such that you can happily snooze your way through without absolute aggro control. Why don't you go there?<br />
<br />
Oh yes, you don't get the same amount of exp as in Valor or better. Man that's a drag eh.<br />

But hey, lets continue to encourage the trend whereby you get a bucket of exp for nothing, lets keep promoting the pointlessness.<br />

<br />
Actually, I do go there Valeris.  I haven't stepped foot into PoP beyond PoT and PoK in almost two months.  When I play my Warrior I double box in places like Nadox, Droga, Nurga, Veksar, Sebilis, Fungus Grove, and so forth?  Why?  Because I'm frustrated with Warriors in PoP and feel like I'm actually doing a group a disservice by asking them to include me.  I don't want to feel as though they're carrying me when they would be substantially better of with a Knight.<br />
<br />
So I have intentionally gone off and gotten third rate experience simply because I hate how badly the game is out of whack for us.  So how about you practice what you preach?  If you're feeling underchallenged by the experience grind, why don't you go find someplace with more challenge, but less experience?  Oh, you can't be pried away from the buckets of experience you get in PoP and would rather be bored than lose out on that?  Hello, Mr. Pot, this is Kettle calling....<br />

Good question.  And why exactly do you think everyone should have their difficulty raised to a level that makes you happy regardless of their wishes?   If pure casters and priests or even other melee were crying nerf the Knights, I'd probably shrug my shoulders and walk away, expecting that things would work themselves out appropriately.  But here we have a group that is in direct competition with the very people they're trying to get nerfed.  Don't you see how that is a biased outlook?  Don't you see that your motives aren't necessarily as pure as you think they are?  Isn't there some healthy self interest involved?  And even if you can honestly claim you are without bias and have no self interest in seeing Knights nerfed, can't you see how that won't be what other people see?<br />
<br />
And, Yet again, you continue to ignore that we do feel unassisted taunt should be better than it is at this time, just not a near perfect garantee like knight aggro.<br />
<br />
I haven't ignored it, but it isn't your main point, while it is mine.  You think first Knights need a good sound beating with the nerf bat and then maybe Warrior taunt could use a little tweaking, nothing too extreme mind you.   My stand is and has always been, Warriors aren't functioning the way they should in the current game and need a remedy.  I'd much rather see a fix for us of a larger degree than a combination of a smaller fix for us and a kick in the teeth to Knights.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I find trying to get a class nerfed just because a small handful of people think that the people who group with that class aren't dying enough and they get to actually contribute signficantly in each fight, is just majorly fubared.<br />
<br />
Will I concede that maybe Knight aggro is a touch too good?  Yes, I will.  Do I see any real good coming from continuing to try and get them nerfed?  No, I don't.  Just because you and I may agree that it's a touch too good, there are going to be many who disagree.  And it's not such a major situation that it's actually denying people an enjoyment of the game, except for Warriors who can't currently compete.   So fix the Warriors already.  Not a hard conclusion to arrive at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Nice slant you put on everything there - no wonder you like aeka :p<br />
<br />
You called me a hypocrite, pot and kettle remember? I feel perfectly justified in insulting you back :p<br />
<br />
How do you fix the warriors without giving them the same level of control as the knights? if you do fix warriors to knight levels it's not just 'a touch too good' when you can weight the encounter so that caster aggro, slow aggro, backstab aggro the whole damn aggro system is virtually redundant and can be circumvented at range. <br />
<br />
For your information, back when this problem was first identified late last year(?) I originally went along with the idea that warriors just needed aggro improved, my first thought was not a knight nerf, hell i supported moves to improve knights ability to tank as it seemed they'd gotten the short end of the stick. More fool me eh? <br />
<br />
I've thought beyond that point now though to the wider implications, which is why i continue to support such an unpopular view as making it 'more than trivial' for tanks to keep aggro. (Similarly I've always preffered tank heavy groups as more fun, I don't really like mezzing unless it's tank-mezzing /shrug but i don't try to cause the destruction of the enchanter class, nor do i think that an aggro nerf will in anyway return knights to Kunark, In those tank heavy groups i mention I'm constantly seeing both SK's and Paladins adding to the group beyond simple aggro lock).<br />
<br />
Making everything easy is good for the instant gratification generation but ultimately bad for any sense of satisfaction gained from the game experience. i play a cleric in the 30's and it's pretty damn clear exactly how piss poor the enjoyment factor can be for everyone in the group from steamrollering single mobs that never leave the tank. Hell I've pulled multiple mobs to the group to make things more interesting! Why exactly should the onus for creating a challenging situation be upon me rather than inbuilt into the game's mechanics/environment?<br />
<br />
All this has been said already though.<br />

<br />
And the fact that you keep ignoring is that casters are used to risk free xp whether it's solo, grouped with a knight tanking, or fear kiting with pet classes.  If  you remove the aggro control that knights have so they're no longer risk free xp then they just won't use tanks anymore at all.  <br />
<br />
You seem to operate under the assumption that a tank is required for xp.  It isn't.  If easy xp with a tank is not available then groups will just get easy xp without a tank.  If you want xping with a tank to remain viable while increasing the difficulty of it then you have to nerf all other types of xping as well.  I can guarantee you that won't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll believe that when i see it. Why the hell do you think warriors still get groups at all if that's the case? Because whilst knight superiority makes it harder to find groups, groups still function well enough with a warrior tanking even with taunt so messed up as it is at the moment. Making all tanks operate with aggro control better than current warrior taunt will make people who already exp with warrior tanks no longer group with them? <br />

How hard do you think the average player looks at the game, most will just accept the surface idea (knights are safer) without looking beyond that.

And since you're the one making the claim, the burden of proof is on you.  I don't have to show proof that people other than Warriors aren't crying for a nerf of the Knights, your lack of evidence speaks for me.<br />

What I would like is something like Crits having a 0 Sec stun (it needn't be an unresistable stun). Without any additional coding, this would scale from a relatively low stun rate for lower level Warriors to a very nice stun rate for high level Warriors with a lot of AA's. This would not nerf Knights since they could still MT in groups and raid mobs that required the MT to cast spells rather than swing weapons. The hate generated by stun could be adjusted so Warriors wouldn't get an unbreakable lock. Aggro weapons and Taunt would still have a place in the game for the actual MT. Mid level Warriors might not be nearly useless if they didn't have one of the 15 or so weapons in the game that generate Hate.<br />
<br />
Then I would like to see the strength bonus resored to 2H weapons with &gt;= 22 Delay to give the classes that can use them improved DPS.<br />
<br />
See? Adjustments that could be done very quickly, would have real impact, and would not make warriors into something else.<br />

<br />
Actually, for me anyway, it is the other way around.  Improve taunt success rates, then lower knight agro so that they are still better, just not nearly as far.  The change to us comes first, and then knight agro scales from there.<br />
<br />
if you want to make a case that more than just a hand full of Warriors think that nerfing the Knights is a good idea <br />
<br />
I personally do not think it matters how many want what, but what is good for the game.  Look at any classes dream balance type thread, and you get druids asking for 90 % rez, mages asking for forms of slow and snare and root, etc.  Just because they want them does not mean they should get them.<br />
<br />
Remember the charm nerf?  No charm class member wanted this nerf(tho a few did admit it was overpowering), but for the good of the game, it had to happen.  It had thrown the risk vs reward formula out of whack.  Too much reward for almost no risk.  It is my contention that 'agro lock' does the same thing.  I point out this is strictly my opinion, and since this thread is about LDoN(boy did we get sidetracked), will add a couple comments on that and bow out of this particular rehashing of our old discussion.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
I am excited about LDoN, and from everything I have heard, cannot see it seriously hurting us more.  From reports I have heard, mobs die fast, and everything is times, so potentially the higher melee DPS of warriors might in fact help us.  Absor has said that it will be possible now to have 2 procs on weapons, and that offers some exciting ideas as far as agro weapons(and imagine if one of those enhancement things you can place on an item was 'increased proc rate').  I think the predictions of doom and gloom are premature(tho possible), but only time will tell how this expansion treats warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">I personally do not think it matters how many want what, but what is good for the game.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how perfectly a game is balanced, if the game is unpleasant to play, people will most often find other things to do with their time.  And while I agree with you that what is &quot;good for the game&quot; should hold some sway, who decides that?  Me?  You?  Phantron?  Seventhsword?  Brik? Aeka?  Many people will have many ideas on what is &quot;good for the game&quot;.  To make changes based on that, I believe the case must be very compelling that something is significantly detrimental to many people's enjoyment and adds to a negative perception of the game for a fairly significant portion of the player community.<br />
<br />
Remember the charm nerf? No charm class member wanted this nerf(tho a few did admit it was overpowering), but for the good of the game, it had to happen. <br />
<br />
Excellent case in point of what I mean.   Prior to the charm nerf you could go to The SafeHouse, Monkly Business, Paladins Of Norrath, The Steel Warrior, The Shaman's Crucible, EQCleric, or just about any other class board you care to name and find at least one thread where the power of charm was being hotly debated.  And more times then not the only ones defending charm were the Enchanters themselves.  To me, this shows a pretty compelling case that there was a significant negative perception being generated for people regarding the game and that the power was detrimental to people's playing.  Sure, Enchanters were in hog heaven, but everyone else who wanted to try to take on a mini-boss in BoT was SoL.  Enchanters were taking on areas that an entire group might have problems with.  It was obvious there was a problem.  And you had many sources on which to base that conclusion.<br />
<br />
Where are our many sources?  Where is the consensus within the player community?  And if you think the player base shouldn't have any say in what's &quot;good for the game&quot; then who does and why should it be you or me?<br />
<br />
You go looking for consensus on Warrior aggro and the consensus is clearly there.  The vast majority of players say Warrior aggro generation sucks arse.  Very few say that Knight aggro generation is overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple things here.  First, you again make it a point to turn it into an either/or thing.  It is not.  I feel warrior agr ogeneration should be higher(via raised taunt success rate) and that knight agro generation is overpowered.  You always imply that it is one or the other.<br />
<br />
Second, you cannot balance a game by majority rules.  Dev's have to decide what is good for the game, how to keep the game interesting and compelling so people keep coming back.  When it is all said and done, we will have no voice in what change happens, some Devs at SoE will.<br />
<br />
Third is to repeat my mantra(it seems):  Risk vs Reward.  Every gain you get should have some balancing risk associated with it.  An example would be tradeskills.  You do not risk death and exp loss, but rather that you will fail on each combine(losing the value of the items combined).  Exp should have some risk, and the better the exp, the greater the risk.  PoP minimized the risk of lost time(GY's ensure no lengthy CR's), and with the easy availability of 90 and 96 % rezzes, exp loss on death is minimal.  Exp tho is coming in faster than ever.  And yet you are still unwilling to risk an occasional death due to loss of agro to gain this exp?<br />
<br />

<br />
No I don't.  Let me repeat that.  NO I DON'T.  I am merely saying that to reduce Knight aggro generation based on the perceptions of a minority of the players of the game isn't justified.  While increasing Warrior generation based on the majority perceptions of the players of the game is.  I don't rule out the possibility of both.  I just don't see the justification for one while I do see it for the other.  And you haven't shown that the people who agree with you are particularly numerous, so you're assuming that what you believe is right in defiance of what it appears many other players of many other classes think.<br />
<br />
Second, you cannot balance a game by majority rules. Dev's have to decide what is good for the game, how to keep the game interesting and compelling so people keep coming back. When it is all said and done, we will have no voice in what change happens, some Devs at SoE will.<br />
<br />
So you're right, everyone else is wrong.  And the Devs will see the wisdom of your suggestion and implement it.  Fine, I'd have no beef if the Devs independently came up with the idea on their own.  They make the decisions and we live with them or we go play another game.  But to continually push the concept, when it's apparent that it isn't highly desired by anyone but a few Warriors does us no good as a subset of the player community.  Garners us no good will from other subsets of the player community, in particular Knights.  And creates the perception that we, as a group, prefer a misery loves company approach rather than focusing on improving our class within the game.<br />
<br />
It's not too hard to think about what's &quot;Good for the game&quot; from a develop point of view. Things like aggro lock are for sure NOT good for the game. It should be very obvious why.<br />
<br />
Maybe to you it is.  But the dev team gave it to the Knights.  It's been there for years.  And it's only been recently that it's been a major concern.  And this is because the environment has changed, Warriors haven't, and Knights have.  Now they're in the favored tank position under pretty much the majority of circumstances outside a raid.<br />
<br />
If warrior aggro is improved then in the game everything will be harder to aggro to balance for this aggro and it's exactly the same thing as nerfing Knight aggro. Or maybe everything becomes trivial... but I don't think that's going to happen. But for those for you saying you don't want to nerf Knights, improving warriors IS nerfing Knights no matter how you look at it because the game has to get harder when a baseline class like Warrior gets stronger, which indirectly makes Knights less effective.<br />
<br />
Looking at it in the perspective means that all the improvements they've done to Knights over the years have been a nerf to Warriors then, right?  Wrong.   What has happened is two classes have progressed within the game and kept pace, while the third has been left behind.  Bringing us up to speed within the game environment will only be a nerf to Knights in that they'll have to share the available groups more.  Otherwise their powers remain the same.  If SoE feels like they need to adjust the environment more, great.  That's their call.  At least the three tank classes will be on somewhat level ground when that happens, rather than having one left behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">The game is balanced around Warriors not Knights.  Therefore improving Knights especially back when Knights are far behind Warriors do not affect the overall game balance.  Improving warriors, however, necessarily requires the game changed to compensate which indirectly weakens the other classes.  The other outcome is the game itself is even more dumbed down if it remains the same difficulty while buffing up one of the baseline class.  It's possible SoE may choose this path but it does not seem like a good one to me.<br />
<br />
Unless you improve Warriors such that it only effects XP mobs (maybe something like more taunt/aggro versus even or lower mobs), every major encounter has to be retuned with the new abilities in mind, assuming the new abilities are meaningful.  Even then, Knights are probably still too good.  I saw a thread where Paladins are complaining that because they're all so great at aggro control any random other Paladin can fill their spot in the group so they can't get good groups since another Paladin already took that spot.  A random Knight can have aggro better than a Blade of War easily.  Unless Warrior are to a point where every LFG warrior can produce Blade of War+ aggro (which is very very unlikely), you'll still be behind them, and there does seem to be a good number of groups who still can't function with BoW aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">And you haven't shown that the people who agree with you are particularly numerous, so you're assuming that what you believe is right in defiance of what it appears many other players of many other classes think. <br />
<br />
Just because something is popular does not mean it is right.  I have never claimed to represent a majority, I claim to express my opinion.  Your argument there is weak, you are smarter than that and can do better.<br />
<br />
So you're right, everyone else is wrong <br />
<br />
Huh?  Where have I claimed to do anything other than offer opinion?  Some things I have said:  'for me anyway' and 'I point out this is strictly my opinion'...note that I am not the one claiming to be right, I simply offer my opinion.<br />
<br />
But to continually push the concept, when it's apparent that it isn't highly desired by anyone but a few Warriors does us no good as a subset of the player community <br />
<br />
I have just as much right to my opinion as you have to yours, and I am not about to bow to pressure to tow the party line when I think that the party line is wrong.<br />
<br />
Garners us no good will from other subsets of the player community, in particular Knights. And creates the perception that we, as a group, prefer a misery loves company approach rather than focusing on improving our class within the game <br />
<br />
I make no claims that my opinion represents anything but just that, my opinion.  I am not speaking for you, or for anyone else here except myself, and that should be plainly obvious.<br />
<br />
Glatius, time for you to come down off that high moral horse you are on and get real a minute.  We have two different idea on how to fix the imbalance between plate tank classes, nothing more.  Neither of us will make any decision on how to actually fix the imbalance, if in fact it does ever get fixed.  Trying to suggest that your opinion(and it is only that, an opinion) is better than mine because more people agree with you is false, and wrong.<br />
<br />
Instead of debating the actual issues, you put words into my mouth, and you accuse me of being bad for the community.  You try and tell me I should not express my opinion(while you certainly should).  If you do not want to debate the topic(or what the topic of this thread has turned into), fine, don't.  But please do not sink quite as low as you do here, it is kinda sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">A couple of glaring misconceptions need to be addressed:<br />
<br />
Redhenna sprache:<br />
&quot;Dev's have to decide what is good for the game....&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev's have to decide and they have to be right the vast majority of the time and never significantly wrong. EQ is in some ways like the M:TG card game - it is re-invented and expanded in order to keep the customers buying. M:TG lost a big chunk of it's customer base when it decided to de-emphasize Type 1. In return it was able to go after a new and younger market. Unfortunately the game was a bit too complicated for this market and the game has all but disappeared from store shelves.<br />
<br />
EQ faces simular problems. The game unfortunately has a goal - PoTime. If a guild reaches this goal, players tend to retire. If they don't reach this goal and stall out significantly, players tend to retire. If in later expansions there are new and more difficult goals, then mudflation can become a problem. Also there is some difficulty attracting new players to begin at the bottom of a very very long adventure.<br />
<br />
LDoN is an effort to transform the game into play-sessions where the final goal is de-emphasized and random encounter generation tuned to the strength of the adventuring party keeps it fresh. (BTW, be careful here. Finding a group in a lobby or among friends does endanger guilds and these are the communities that have kept people playing for 3 years).<br />
<br />
(As a side note - it will be very tempting to stop supporting high level guilds and players. Their existance tends to discourage lower level players somewhat, and requires a stream of new and harder expansions. They make up about 15% of the server population and it's a lot cheaper in the long run to use the flater LDoN product model. Hmmmmm! Maybe neglect and transitioning to the flat model would cause the high level guilds to disappear naturally with minimum loss of player base!! Eureka!!!!)<br />
<br />
In other words, don't assume the Devs are right and we are wrong because they are Devs. We have a lot of experiance playing this game and are smart enough to have an idea what the design issues are.<br />
<br />
Phantron sprach:<br />
&quot;The game is balanced around Warriors not Knights.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh my. When this was first said we were told the classes were balanced. Then adjustments were made. You have been sucked in by the buzzword &quot;balanced&quot; as if it were being judged by anything other than a few test methods and playtesting. Imagine a teetertotter. One side goes up. How do you get it back in balance? I'll help 8). by adjusting the force and the distance it is applied from the fulcrum on EITHER end. In this case it is either nerf a bunch of other classes, change mob behavior, or give us an upward adjustment.<br />
<br />
EQ is a GREAT product. The Devs are doing an AWESOME job. But we are right about our criticisms. Perhaps not our suggested fixes - we don't have the resources to find out. But we are correct that Warriors do not compare favorably with Knights in the group MT role because of aggro control and melees in general are underpowered.<br />
<br />
We (the players) were correct about Manaburn and Enchanter Charm being overpowered even though the Devs put them into the game as overpowered. (In their defence - 100,000 playtesters &gt; 2000 playtesters). Why do some believe somehow that we aren't correct about these issues as well?<br />
<br />
I believe SoE management is aware of our longstanding  complaints, can not be told forever that no problem exists, and will insist that denial and neglect is unprofessional.<br />
<br />
I'm sounding too much like a know-it-all, so I'll butt out. But check Graffe, The Safehouse, etc. and see what they think about Warrior aggro. We aren't making this stuff up.<br />

<br />
Here you imply that although your opinion is in the minority, it is more correct than the opinion of the majority.  Otherwise emphasizing that because something is popular doesn't make it right wouldn't be relevant.  What you're really saying is that sometimes the minority opinion can be right and the majority opinion is wrong.  Who's minority opinion are we discussing?  Yours.  The implication is therefore that your minority opinion is right and the majority opinion is wrong.  No, you don't come right out and say, but you do imply it all over the place.<br />

Huh? Where have I claimed to do anything other than offer opinion? Some things I have said: 'for me anyway' and 'I point out this is strictly my opinion'...note that I am not the one claiming to be right, I simply offer my opinion.<br />
<br />
Every time you say, &quot;for the good of the game&quot;, &quot;the popular opinion isn't always right&quot;, and so forth, you imply that you have a better understanding of what is good for the game than others and even though your opinion isn't popular, it's more correct.  Yes you're as entitled to your opinion as anyone, but can't you see how you're projecting the impression of &quot;knowing&quot; what's good for people in spite of themselves?<br />
<br />
Glatius, time for you to come down off that high moral horse you are on and get real a minute.<br />
<br />
Red, you're the one that rode the high moral horse in to the place.  Me, all I've been interested in from the get go is getting a little lovin for Warriors.  I have no interest in getting Knights nerfed, because even if they are a little too powerful in the aggro department, it's not anywhere near as game disrupting as Charm, Manaburn, and so forth.  I don't claim to understand what is &quot;good for the game&quot; per se, although I do have opinions.  I do claim to have at least a small idea of what is &quot;good for Warriors&quot; and right now that's all I care about.  I leave the rest to the devs for the time being.<br />
<br />
Instead of debating the actual issues, you put words into my mouth, and you accuse me of being bad for the community.<br />
<br />
I claim that the constant emphasis on a Knight nerf in combination with an aggro change for Warriors is bad for the community.  You as an individual aren't bad for the community.  You're entirely free to express your opinion, but maybe you should think about how you're expressing it.  Claiming that a nerf to Knights is good for the game even if unpopular with the majority of the player base seems to imply some things that perhaps you don't mean to imply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">How is our view and the arguement we express any worse for the community than your own? I would assume that those who design the game will be just as capable of deciding wether they agree with us as they are able to with you. The common expectation is that something will be done to address the current aggro imbalance, surely the fashion in which that is done is valid arguement? Why further break the game (assuming you agree with our assessment) first? The arguement is a) something will be changed b) perhaps that something shouldn't be a simple upgrade if there is a problem with it.<br />
<br />
Wether aggro lock is but a part of the overall problem with exp. and just a minor one in comparison with some things makes no difference to the fact that if you are specifically fixing something you ought to fix it 'right'.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Here you imply that although your opinion is in the minority, it is more correct than the opinion of the majority <br />
<br />
No, opinions are almost by definition not right or wrong, they are merely what we think.  I stated your argument was week, not because we disagree in our opinions, rather because you suggested that without large support my opinion was without merit.<br />
<br />
What you're really saying is that sometimes the minority opinion can be right and the majority opinion is wrong <br />
<br />
Opinions are points of view, not right or wrong.  Maybe this will help, a definition:<br />
<br />
opinion:  the view somebody takes about a certain issue, especially when it is based solely on personal judgment <br />
<br />
I went out of my way to point out that I was stating opinion, not fact, and you still accuse me of saying that I am right, you are wrong.  In truth, on the issue of warrior balance, we disagree.  No more, no less.<br />
<br />
Who's minority opinion are we discussing?  Yours. The implication is therefore that your minority opinion is right and the majority opinion is wrong. No, you don't come right out and say, but you do imply it all over the place. <br />
<br />
You are either trying to put something there that I have never said, or seriously need to work on reading comprehension.  No where have I said, nor suggested, nor implied that I am right, only that I am expressing that magic word, opinion.<br />
<br />
you imply that you have a better understanding of what is good for the game than others and even though your opinion isn't popular, it's more correct. Yes you're as entitled to your opinion as anyone, but can't you see how you're projecting the impression of &quot;knowing&quot; what's good for people in spite of themselves? <br />
<br />
So now suggesting that I think the game would be better balanced a certain way means that I think I am essentially smarter than everyone else?  Where are you coming up with this stuff?  It certainly is not anywhere in what I have written.  When I express an opinion, it simply means that it is how I think and feel things should be, nothing more.  Please stop trying to read all this extra stuff into it, it simply is not there.<br />
<br />
 I don't claim to understand what is &quot;good for the game&quot; per se, although I do have opinions <br />
<br />
So I get damned for expressing my opinions about what is good for the game, and then you state that even you have opinions on the subject.  The word for that is hypocracy.<br />
<br />
Claiming that a nerf to Knights is good for the game even if unpopular with the majority of the player base seems to imply some things that perhaps you don't mean to imply. <br />
<br />
This just puzzles me.  I claim that in my opinion, knight agro generation is overpowered, and should be lowered.  I am implying nothing, there is no hidden meaning in that statement.  Whatever you see as being implied, I simply do not see, nor follow.  I make no claims that I am right in my opinion(I should not even have to state that, but if I do not put it there, you will cry that I am stating that I am right and everyone else is wrong), only that it is my view of the situation.<br />
<br />
I am sorry we disagree, but that is how things are.  I actually still have a great deal of respect for you, you generally are well spoken, and insitefull(sp?).  I do resent tho this attack on me for stating my opinions, I have just as much right to state mine as you do to state yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">I am implying nothing, there is no hidden meaning in that statement. <br />
<br />
I've laid out exactly how you're coming across with exactly the implications in question, and you deny that they're even there.  When you go from saying, &quot;I think Knight aggro generation is a bit too powerful&quot;, to saying, &quot;it is in the best interests of the game that Knight aggro generation be nerfed.&quot;  Or when you go from saying, &quot;while my opinion may be in the minority, I still be believe Knight aggro generation is too powerful,&quot; to saying &quot;the popular opinion isn't always the right,&quot;  can't you see how you move from experessing opinion into the realm of seemingly expressing facts?<br />
<br />
Is there a difference between, &quot;I believe Knight aggro trivializes the game,&quot; and, &quot;Knight aggro trivializes the game?&quot;  There is, one is a statement of opinion, the other is a statement of fact.  If you say the first, you don't have to back it up with anything because it's your opinion.   However, don't expect it to necessarily carry much weight unless you can back it up.  The second requires some proof beyond it just being your opinion.  Up until this point, you have pretty much been stating your opinion as fact and not backing it up with any proof.  Now, you've shifted to emphasizing that you're merely expressing your opinion.  Which is fine, you're free to express your opinion.  And I'm free to express my opinion in counter to your opinion.  But once you start in with &quot;for the good of the game,&quot; you're clearly trying to elevate your opinion over mine because yours is &quot;good for the game,&quot; and mine is not.  Or so is the implication. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is this.  You have an opinion.  I have an opinion.  Your opinion is that a nerf is in order.  My opinion is that a nerf isn't in order.  You imply that your opinion is &quot;good for the game&quot;.  I show that my opinion appears to be shared by a significant portion of the player community because no one other than a very few people express an interest in a nerf to Knights.  You say that just because a bunch of people don't see the value in nerfing Knights doesn't make them right.  The implication being of course that your minority opinion in some way carries more weight than the majority opinion, because you're right and they're wrong.  I point out that vocally endorsing an unpopular position as being factual when it's really based solely on opinion is not good for the Warrior community.   <br />
<br />
This is the core of our disagreement.  Now, you want to continue vocally endorsing a nerf to Knights &quot;for the good of the game,&quot; I can't stop you.  I've done my best to point out your arguement is flawed.  How you sometimes state things as being obviously factual that are really merely your opinion.  And how your opinion isn't a particularly popular one with the majority of players.  None of this seems to carry much weight with you.<br />
<br />
I'm not attacking you personally, I'm merely attacking your opinion, in particular how you express your opinion.   And while everyone has as much right to express their opinions as anyone else, when challenged they should be able to defend their opinions with something more than, they're my opinions, if they want their arguements to carry much weight.  Particularly when they're attaching things like, &quot;for the good of the game,&quot; and &quot;the popular opinion isn't always right,&quot; to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Lots of crazy arguements are being thrown around here.  I can't possibly address them all in one post but I'll try to make some general points.<br />
<br />
First off there is a logical disjunction between &quot;improving Warriors&quot; and &quot;nerfing Paladins&quot;.  Improving Warriors does not nerf Paladins nor vice versa.  This is one of the biggest reasons why I remind everyone why nerfing Paladins is bad: it does not improve Warriors one bit.  You can claim I have a vested interest in seeing Paladins thrive (I do) but that doesn't give one license to ignore logic just to make a point.  If Warriors were changed (good or bad) I can login and see how I didn't change.  If Knights get nerfed, you can login and see how Warriors are still sadly lacking the skills necessary in POP.<br />
<br />
Please explain how it is &quot;It should be very obvious why&quot; because it isn't connective at all.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;difficulty = fun&quot; I admit both factors are highly subjective.  What is &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;fun&quot; for one is not for another.  What many of you don't admit nor can prove is that &quot;difficult&quot; leads to &quot;fun&quot; because that is also highly subjective.<br />
<br />
Anyone can claim POP exp is boring just as easily as anyone can claim POP exp more fun than doing anything else in the game.  That is their opinion so I can't object.  However I object to the idea that there is no fun or challenge in POP.  Its out there...whether or not you choose to do it is up to you.  You don't need to be standing in TimeB to get some good work out of POP.  Try doing the maze for TT or the TT event itself.  You maybe surprised how difficult and how much satisfaction it there is when you succeed.  That is the stuff you will not find sitting in any exp group in any zone.  After doing these events you see how exp groups will never be as challenging and turn into just a footnote.  You use them recover a little exp.  You use them for raw materials.  Neither of which is worth dying over since you can do that other ways for better effect.<br />
<br />
I'm also bothered by the subtile implication that its okay for a Warrior to create a stable exp environment but it is not for a SK or Paladin.  What is the deal?  Some how Warriors work at it more because they have one skill?  Are you really sure this is happening or are the five others in your group working around you?  So Warriors with agro lock = good while SKs/Paladins with agro lock is bad?  Whatever....<br />
<br />
Take a look at the /gu comic posted.  Why does this sound so familiar?  Have I been saying that for awhile?  If all of you really believe that Knights have placed you in your current position then you have set your sites on the wrong target.<br />
<br />
If you guys want to argue that SK/Paladin agro generation is too good compared to Warriors that is fine.  We can do that when Warriors get compariable skills.  Right now its nearly a joke.  What possible skills can a Warrior bring to a group that is even remotely compariable to other things SKs and Paladins bring?  &quot;Just tanking&quot; has all but killed Warriors, yet some want to continue to hang onto it.  I suppose one can still hang on to it.  Just don't be surprised if you get left out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">can't you see how you move from experessing opinion into the realm of seemingly expressing facts? <br />
<br />
Actually what I see is you reading things into what I am saying.  I am not stating facts, as in a mater such as this, it is very subjective.  The ideal fun situation for you may not be the ideal fun situation for me.<br />
<br />
Up until this point, you have pretty much been stating your opinion as fact and not backing it up with any proof. Now, you've shifted to emphasizing that you're merely expressing your opinion <br />
<br />
Let me take you back to my very first post in this thread wher I mentioned lowering knight agro.  I made a statement there, and it is as follows:<br />
<br />
I want to add I do not suggest this is the only, or even the best, solution to current balance problems. It simply is one solution. <br />
<br />
Does this sound like I am stating these things as fact, or as opinion?  I go out of my way to make sure no one can see things as any more than one persons opinion on balance, and you still miss that point.<br />
<br />
The implication being of course that your minority opinion in some way carries more weight than the majority opinion, because you're right and they're wrong. <br />
<br />
Again, you are simply seeing something you want to see, not what I said.  I stated that just because the majority of people hold an opinion does not make it right, or the best opinion.  It also does not make it wrong.  No where did I say that it was wrong, simply that it was possible.  You can think I said anything you want, and you can accuse me of implying anything you want, that does not make it so.<br />
<br />
I point out that vocally endorsing an unpopular position as being factual when it's really based solely on opinion is not good for the Warrior community.  <br />
<br />
I never stated my opinion was fact.<br />
<br />
I've done my best to point out your arguement is flawed <br />
<br />
And I was enjoying the discussion, and trying to point out where your argument was flawed.  Then you changed tacks and attacked me for having an opinion.<br />
<br />
How you sometimes state things as being obviously factual that are really merely your opinion <br />
<br />
And I have pointed out how you are reading things that I did not say.  How many times have you used the word 'imply' lately'?  I do not imply anything, I state what I think, no other meaning is there.  If you cannot defend your opinions, it seems you switch to trying to make me defend things I am not saying.<br />
<br />
And how your opinion isn't a particularly popular one with the majority of players. None of this seems to carry much weight with you <br />
<br />
So should everyone who feels differently from the norm simply shut up then?  If most warriors did feel that knight agro generation was too high, and should be lowered, would you then simply follow along?<br />
<br />
 And while everyone has as much right to express their opinions as anyone else, when challenged they should be able to defend their opinions with something more than, they're my opinions, if they want their arguements to carry much weight. <br />
<br />
I did defend my opinions, as you did yours, then all of a sudden, you stop talking about the game issues, and start talking about presentation.  Why this sudden change in tactics?  If you want to go back to discussing balance, I would be more than happy to, but if you are going to keep attacking me for daring to have an unpopular opinion, then it simply should end now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Now on to Aeka, this at least should be more fun.  Rather than another long quote filled thing, will not use the quote function here and hope it comes out clear.<br />
<br />
You comment:  'Improving Warriors does not nerf Paladins nor vice versa'.  I would argue that since the major issue with balance now is the disparity in agro generation between warriors and knights, and since we compete for the same spot in groups, that improving warriors would in fact nerf knighs, at least as far as group desirability goes.  You follow with:  'If Knights get nerfed, you can login and see how Warriors are still sadly lacking the skills necessary in POP.'  I will point out that I do seem to have the skills neccessary for POP, as I group, and successfully, almost every day in POP.  I would further point out that I am far from high end(tho getting closer).<br />
<br />
You are right that a change to knight skillsets will not change warrior skillsets.  My idea of balance is measuring two things and hoping they come out equal.  If they are not, you can remove some from one, or add to another, or both till balance is achieved.<br />
<br />
'After doing these events you see how exp groups will never be as challenging and turn into just a footnote.'  I love raiding, and I love some of the POP events, think some wonderfull events where made.  Yes, since I began raiding, it certainly did make exp less enjoyable, because I would rather be raiding.<br />
<br />
'Neither of which is worth dying over since you can do that other ways for better effect'  Trouble is, not everyone raids, so their perception of exp may be different than yours.  I know mine was before I began raiding.  And I return also to the point that I think there needs to be a decent level of risk to balance the reward of gaining exp.<br />
<br />
'So Warriors with agro lock = good while SKs/Paladins with agro lock is bad? Whatever....'  I missed that.  I know I never said it, and I missed reading it.<br />
<br />
'If you guys want to argue that SK/Paladin agro generation is too good compared to Warriors that is fine. We can do that when Warriors get compariable skills'   Why wait?<br />
<br />
'&quot;Just tanking&quot; has all but killed Warriors, yet some want to continue to hang onto it. I suppose one can still hang on to it'  Tanking is the role I signed on for, and tanking is what I want to do.  If I wanted to be a utility class, I would have rolled a hybrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Okay Red, I give up.  You and Valeris haven't been systematically pushing for a nerf to Knight aggro generation based on your minority belief that it would be good for the game, add more needed challenge, and that people in general need to die more to make the game interesting.  It's completely untrue that you feel that people should be challenged at what you believe is an acceptable level of challenge rather than what they, the player community in general, is happy with.  *walks away shaking his head*</div></div><hr />

Gladius said:<br />
Maybe to you it is. But the dev team gave it to the Knights. It's been there for years. And it's only been recently that it's been a major concern. And this is because the environment has changed, Warriors haven't, and Knights have. Now they're in the favored tank position under pretty much the majority of circumstances outside a raid.<br />
<br />
Why do people insit on twisating this fact into some bastardized form? for the slow I will say it real slow.<br />
<br />
When knights went into the game they had aggro lock.<br />
knight dmg midigation sucked ass we were no better tanks then rangers<br />
aggro lock for knights back in the day was a last ditch effort to get a cleric camped out.<br />
<br />
so for the slow of mind (yes I am being condecending sorry it's a talent i have) aggro lock was balanced with the fact that if the knight had aggro he/she was not going to live long but with LoH sometimes that was enough time to get a cleric camped out.<br />
<br />
Velious changed all that knights get a MAJOR increast to dmg midigation but no decrease to aggro generation.<br />
<br />
So riddle me this.... How is it you can vastly improve one form of a class without taking something away from the opposite of it and not make the class out of balance?? Obviously the devs did not want tanks to have aggro lock or they would have givin it originally to the warriors the baseline of the game and tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
it's kind of like humm what's a good anology. hell take trhe monks situation a bit different but cause and effect the same.<br />
<br />
Originally monks could not tank due to HP they mitigated dmg good but not enough hp to matter. well when through kunark and veliolus quite  afew monk warable hp items came out and they became vastly over powerd due to them being able to tank as well as they could. So SoE saw this and said well hell we gave them hp items without relising what would happend we best nerf them pansy assed monks right quick. and so it happend.<br />
<br />
SoE lately has been reluctant to nberf any class (I would guess subscription rates are down and I know I for one would not want to be the guy that says nerf this class then loose a few acpounts and have to anser to the boss why we lost more people) but they need to quit qorring about pleasing everyone and simply make certain things fun for each distictive type of player. but keep a overall goal in mind. <br />
<br />

Well, since we're going to be condescending, let's just do that, shall we?  Look brainiac.  Just because you got kicked off the PoN board for being a twit doesn't make you an expert on much of anything.  You might like having your class crippled, but there are many Knights who would disagree with you.  Your arguements are weak, hard to understand many times because you can't communicate them well, and often times amount to not much more than semi-incoherant babble.

<br />
humm not so common where i come from we used rangers to take the first DT one zone in to fear cause they were shit tanks. The following is a fact. ( I should have said it up above but I assumed it was common knowledge) knights were on their own mitigation table they were moved to the war mitigation table to improve their tanking ability, which means in effect their tanking ability was sub par to warriors lets use facts gimmel not opinions please.<br />
<br />
Just because you got kicked off the PoN board for being a twit doesn't make you an expert on much of anything.  never saiod I was a expert at fucking crap show me the quote where it says I am please. I have my opinion you have yours. you seem to be some spoiled fucking rich brat that wants the world handed to them. I don't give a fuck about what i have what i give a fuck about is a challenge I receive much gratification from achieving something difficult yes even grinding exp back in the day when I looted my rubicite bp (the good ole days) death back then meant a week of grinding to make up the exp loss if you couldn’t find a cleric to rez ya. so the risk was heavy yet so was the reward. Nowadays the risk is minimal with knight aggro and the rewards are even better see the problem here? No I bet you don't because you fucking want the world handed to you on a silver fucking platter. all I really see is penis envy here or spoiled brats that want thier cake.<br />
<br />
Eiterh way I am done not really sure for good or not but I have cnaceld my accounts and have no plans to come back. So I could give a fucking rats pimpled ass what the fuck happens to knights and warriors.<br />

I just see a lot of different opinions I for sure can't say who is right or what makes the game better I can only speak for my own prsonal experience and the satisfaction I got from that. Yes I disagree with the mjority and I do not want the class I played gimped but I do want it toned down. ATM there is no risk to group EXP grinding using a knight tank none whatsoever period. and I belive there should be because grinding exp you are rewarded with EXP (which is damn good in PoP) and plat and the occasional loot there should be a risk involved. anyway back to my corner. (teach me to read a thread after saying I wont be around ;P )<br />
<br />
btw I doubt you all that want aggro lock have to worry about people like me SoE has lost it's spine so you all will prolly get upgraded close to knight aggro. and the miority like me that belives kinight aggro to good will not say anything because they take advantage of it, just like some use exploits even though they know it is wrong they still do it cause they benifit from it.<br />

<br />
Valeris all I'm saying is you're expressing an unpopular opinion.  And unpopular opinion that is perceived as coming from a class that has the most to gain from nerfing the Knights, the very thing you'd like to see happen.  And while you may feel that no one outside of TSW should perceive your opinion as being representative of Warriors in general, the fact is people do.   Monks over on Monkly Business still bitch and moan about how the Warriors got them nerfed, even though for the most part only a very few Warriors felt that they as a class needed to be nerfed, and more felt it was the gear that needed to be adjusted.  People over on the Knight boards bitch and moan about how the Warriors are out to get them nerfed and what did they ever do to be so hated, it's all SoE's fault anyway.<br />
<br />
So do what you will.  But realize that no one outside of TSW will perceive it as being solely Valeris' opinion.  And will instead see it as being Warriors in general.  And you still haven't made a case at all that it is disruptive enough to the game to warrant a nerf like Manaburn and Charm clearly did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Why do people feel warriors need to not hurt another class's feelings or something to fix something that is obviously wrong?  Improve warrior aggro to be tolerable with most braindead groups and in a few weeks you'll be seeing Knights complaining that they can no longer get into group because Joe Warrior over there can aggro almost as well as he can, but Joe Warrior does more damage and can tank better so they pick Joe Warrior over the Knight.<br />
<br />
Someone has to be unable to get into a group, and if it's not the warriors, it'll be someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">the Question you have to ask is... Do the devs agree with a pally/sk being able to tank as well as a warrior in exp group while a the same time having no-fail aggro lock?<br />
<br />
To me thats game breaking. The downside of defensive SHOULD be that you have harder time gaining aggro. The downside of being able to tank the highest lvl mobs in the game Should be that your aggro is not the best. Downside to having the best aggro should be you tank less effectivly than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Simply put. The only way to get balance is to nerf sk/pallys in one of these ways.<br />
<br />
1. No more aggro lock. Warriors sk/pallys equal in tanking  in exp groups but cannot lock aggro down creating a bunch of fooking retards that cant control aggro once they hit a raid.<br />
<br />
2. Reduce damage mitigation 10% or more. Make them take more full on hits. Make people in the group have to heal them. Most exp groups the cleric can toss a heal everynow and then but not really worry about mana.<br />
<br />
3. Reduce the amount of hp per sta for plate classes. This should be at least so that the same lvl warrior would have a 25% hp advantage over a knight. <br />
<br />
Am I calling for a nerf of the night class? hell yes. They should have penaltys due to the increase of power they recive from spells/mana/hp improvments.<br />
<br />
Or you can jsut give warriors a 700 eb on each taunt. But... BUT... you cannot give the same to a knight class. <br />
Dont give us &quot;Assreamer Sword of Hate&quot; that procs every other swing if it says Warr, Pal, Sk   on usable classes.<br />
<br />
Items/weapons wont fix this. for one reason.. A knight does not need it to do his job.<br />
<br />
Best (buyable) aggro for a warrior.. Boc 325k on my server. Best aggro for a pally... 40-60pp at a vendor.<br />
<br />
Not like this matters as ass-sore said. We are planning on looking into melee balance... Planning? Go eat a bowl of dick ok?  I plan on winning the lottory but that does not mean I am. Planning to look at is not we are looking at it. It means we have that on the whiteboard at the office right under the Epic 2.0 idea.<br />
<br />
Warriors are falling farther and farther behind each expansion. We dont want a dps upgrade. <br />
<br />
we dont want some retarded plug in for a weapon that a pally/sk could use but will probably rott becasue they dont need it and there is no warrior in that group.<br />
<br />
We want Balance.. We need balance or this class is going to die out. We demand balance for all the 50th lvl warriors lfg for 2 hours becasue twink pally #2343 gets picked over him. <br />
<br />
This is not a endgame only issue. Its a middle, highend issue. <br />
<br />
For the last time. <br />
<br />
If you have no issues finding a group, Or have the best aggro weapons in the game. Buy the expansion. You will have fun with it.<br />
<br />
BUT... if you are a warrior that has any problems getting a group.. This expansion will make your life worse. <br />
<br />
Cancel your Order, send in your feedback.. they actually read that stuff. Tell them Fix my warrior or I will not buy your expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u161"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p161">Phantron, where have I ever said that Warriors can't get an upgrade due to infringing on SK/Paladin skills.  I have never ever said that.  In fact my entire arguement is based on the inequality of the situation.  Bringing Warriors up to speed can't hurt Knights as much as it helps the game.  Giving Warriors more interesting things to do a monster than just face it with auto attack on has got to make the game more interesting at least for Warriors if not for the group as well.  With added skills, agro generation will follow.  Its that easy and its that simple.<br />
<br />
Calling for a nerf of Paladin and SKs is extremely short sighted.  To do it right you would have to nerf down a wide range of Caster spells (note this is more than just SK/Pal spells) and redesign all of the exp POP monsters to take into account the weaking.  No one ever advocates this.  Instead they just want the righteous indignation toward a class.<br />
<br />
Did anyone notice how weak melee is?  Some of you have this brilliant idea: lets make melee WEAKER!  I'm sorry if I don't jump right into that boat.  What possible purpose is it going to serve to weaken any type of strong melee now?  This above all convinces me that most of you aren't interested in balance and just want nerfs.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where some get their ideas of balance except from some short sighted perceptions of Warriors vs Paladins or SKs.  Weaking SKs and Paladins will not make melee exp groups stronger.  Boosting Warriors will.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Rasorwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">Well being a ranger on the Bertoxx server i see Warriors get groups all the time in PoP, Velious, Luclin and so on. LDoN is NOT gonna be the only thing to do on EQ anymore. There are still VT raids, outings to kill Seru, and vacationing in Time. all of which are places you need a warrior as MT. i dont know what the big deal is about this since warriors have been one of the &quot;key&quot; classes needed for any group from the begining of EQ. yall have ruled for four expansions. is it so bad sharing the spotlight with pallys and SK's which are very neglected on Bertoxx? if you think classes are unbalanced try being a ranger. i didnt become useful til i hit 65 and that was only a few days ago and its still hard to get a group with all the other DPS classes out there such as rogues, beastlords, monks.... warriors are the only ones with the mass hp and AC pallys and SK's can come close but dont get as much and same for mitigation. as far as 30 seconds for warr to gain total agro, nukers shouldnt be nuking that soon anyway, even if the paladin stuns off the bat if a wizard nukes the mob for 4k 10 secs into fight he will gain agro. and as for speed warriors have higher DPS than SK's or Pallys. i dont study pally and SK DPS but i have not yet seen one top 80 DPS on a regular basis because they dont duel weild and if they use 2handers the delay is usually slow. but this is all just my opinion on a different server than all of you. and after all im just a ranger : P</div></div><hr />

One that comes to mind, was camping Frenzy in LG and I was pulling. Pulled the hand (long pull if you don't know LG) and had pops on the way back. I think when I arrived in camp, I had about 6 mobs chasing. Everyone took a half second to panic and then we turned into a killing machine.

We were camping Assassin and had dropped down the ladder to kill off a runner when we got trained, the runner got away, it brought back friends. Then we got trained again. People were dying. Our healer went down. Then a friendly cleric turned up from god knows where and starts healing me. Mobs are coming from right, left and centre and this cleric is still going at it. My entire group dies, just me and the cleric left. I finally die... 30+ froglok corpses at my feet. <br />

<br />
You're attributing your keeping aggro to the fact that you're so uber and good at tanking. That's not the case. The wizard at 96% is likely using a low aggro draught spell and managing his aggro.<br />
<br />
Indeed, just about any class can take aggro from a  warrior should they choose. The fact that they don't reflects just as much, if not more, on their aggro management skills, as your uberness.<br />
<br />
In fact, the challenge for those classes is NOT getting the aggro.<br />
<br />
I know. I've done it. i've taken aggro from a BoWar and Time equipped warrior with ease with a shaman, enchanter, and wizard. Easily. If it's that easy with an uber warrior, imagine how much worse it is for those that aren't as well equipped....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">Of course you're supposed to get slapped for being stupid.  That shows the game is working like it should.  <br />
<br />
A warrior produces plenty of aggro for anything sane anyone might want to do, and no casting nukes as fast as they refresh isn't one of them.  If it is, they might as well remove aggro from nukes.  <br />
<br />
While the Warrior isn't doing anything particularly skillful to keep his aggro, neither are you at controlling your aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">Uhm, no. You're readin crap in that isn't there. And, you're also missing my point. you say that shows the game is working like it's supposed to... I disagree. The hybrid aggro is a lot easier to work with. Working with warriors, it's a challenge to not get aggro... I have to work at not getting it. With hybrids, it's not much of an issue at all, and I don't need to worry nearly as much. This difference should not be nearly as extreme as it is. Therefore, the game isn't working as it should, IMO.<br />
<br />
See, I never said I DO always get aggro like that. I said, I CAN. If I choose to... or sometimes when I'm forced to. I can USUALLY handle my aggro well enough with the tools I have at my disposal where I rarely get hit... and usually if I DO end up getting hit it's from situations like several mobs hitting camp at once. And you saying that it doesn't require skill, I disagree. It does take a fair amount of skill, or the proper word is judgement, to determine when and how often to use your aggro reducing spells and abilities to keep the mob from hitting you... as well as which tool to use in a given situation. For example, chanters can mem wipe, mez, boggle, or root, stun, etc etc etc.... and what does the warrior do? Mash taunt. That's it. Well, there is the second thing. The praying for it to work.<br />
<br />
See, my point is many top warriors have this case of what I like to call &quot;uberitis&quot;. They think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread... taking all the credit for holding aggro, thinking there's no issues cause they have this uber aggro weapon or that amount of AA's. They'll see a nuke spell effect at 95% going off and thinking they're holding aggro because they're so uber. In essence, they're blinded by and utterly convinced of thier own superiority. Warriors with &quot;uberitis&quot; routinely ignore or are simply unaware of the fact that other people's aggro management has far more to do with thier own aggro holding than they do themselves. They also, when presented with a issue symptomatic of the warrior class, often times insist that this is not an issue. Perosnally, I think they say that either because they don't like to think that there's anything that detracts from their own image of how good and powerful they are, and/or secondly are so well equipped (and usually have no idea about class balance at anythning BUT the ultra high end) that that issue really isn't as big for them, as it is for most warriors. Probably, it's a mixture of both.<br />
<br />
It was a simple reminder and call back to reality for the warrior who figured it was cause of his uberness that if a someone casts at 96%, he still keeps aggro. That's not usually the case.<br />
<br />
By the way, not all warriors produce enough aggro for anything sane someone might want to do. Not all warriors have high aggro weapons. Even the ones that do are vulnerable the first few seconds of the fight until they can build that aggro and get a proc or two in.... it's been like that forever.</div></div><hr />

It was a simple reminder and call back to reality for the warrior who figured it was cause of his uberness that if a someone casts at 96%, he still keeps aggro. That's not usually the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of those warriors here I assure you. What you do have is a lot of pissed off warriors who are fed up of the other classes telling them they'd rather have so-and-so tank. We know what's broke, we've been discussing it endlessly. Still there is no point discussing it as regards a new expansion! <br />
<br />
I am looking forward to this expansion more than any before it and if people really want to boycott it because a long term issue isn't solved... all the more groups for me. If anything this expansion does include something for warriors... spell casters will have to split their adventure points between spells and gear, we just have gear to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">spells will cost like 1 point or something....<br />
<br />
and warriors will have to worry about getting those extremely expensive or rare proc mods to get on their sword so they can actually find a decent group....<br />
<br />
Because knights will be hauling all the groups... it's pretty obvious...<br />
<br />
what does KILL FAST go with?... Warrior? or Knight?....<br />
<br />
and yes, the basics of all the dungeons will be killing FAST!<br />
<br />
<br />
ooh ooh... and did I mention I had my first dungeon success with a betabuffed paladin? while with my warrior we usually failed?<br />
<br />
and saying that my paladin heals, buff and root saved us quite a few times, isnt really important either... <br />
since knight utility isnt what gets them groups! right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">Actually, Sarelin, when I was posting that, I was thinking specifically about some of the warriors that post here. Not all, but some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">If your group can't use up their starting mana in 90 minutes which is how long the dungeons take from what I've heard, you might be too uber for this game.  Get real.  It's not like you'll do one of these dungeons with 0 mana on all your casters 15 minutes into the dungeon just because you can use that much mana up.<br />
<br />
Actually the augment system sounds like there is hope because you can put warrior only augments that have better stats than the typical all plate counterparts without having it screw up balance.  Since it seems like at least some augments will be bought you don't have to worry about the class specific item rotting problem.  <br />
<br />
For example if the best augment a Paladin can buy is 10 AC 50 HP 50 Mana (not necessarily all on one augment), then you can put the equivalent Warrior augment at something like 12 AC 65 HP and maybe throw in an extra 10 attack in there.  Of course if all augments are just bland generic all/all bunch of HP/mana stuff, then we'll come out further behind, but I'll wait until seeing what augments are available first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">A member of my guild is involved in beta testing the raid protion of LDoN., He was talking to us about how cool the new spells where, when one of the warriors asked 'What are warriors getting, the shaft again?'.  His comment was that on hard difficulty(and this is for raiding only I believe), warriors are king.  Mobs mitigate slow or are unslowable, hit for 800ish, and knights just bleed too fast tanking this stuff.  So for one portion of LDoN, things may turn out good for us.  Still playing wait and see for most of it, I like the sound of the expansion, and the way the encounters are set up, but am nervous about whether knight utility is going to come to the fore, and we get left behind.  I think my biggest hope is that multiple tank groups might be an expecially good force in LDoN.  Then you could combine a knight for utility, and a warrior for tanking...kind of a win win scenario for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Right... because all we are good for is raiding right... pray tell sir... how is timmy the 50th lvl warrior going to get to raid lvl when this expansion makes the knight even more of a better choice for a group?<br />
<br />
we are not talking about boc/bloodfrenzy eqipped warriors, we are not talking about Warriors with a bow (even though a 50th lvl pally could pull more aggro than you)<br />
<br />

<br />
We are not talking about the raid crap that they put in. We are talking about exp groups. Think 99% of the people are going to pick &quot;hard&quot; ?  <br />

 As a 65 warrior I still get plenty of tells for pick up groups, even tho I RARELY, IF EVER JOIN A PICKUP GROUP!  I don't know where all this whining about not getting a group comes from.   If you can't get a group:<br />
<br />
a) make some friends who will group you regardless of you status as a useless warrior<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) go play a solo class<br />
<br />
And, from what I have seen, there is some pretty nice loot coming, that does NOT require that you are in a time or elemental guild to obtain.  It might be more difficult, but it certainly won't be impossible. (Kind of like how they said non-VT geared guilds would never get past Rallos Zek The Farmlord)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">Now that it's lifted, while I dont' share the same optimism for LDoN as Fulorian does, simply because I see the repetitive nature of the &quot;adventures&quot; getting old rather quickly, what I AM in agreement with him in and am impressed with is that there seems to be a real place for warriors tanking in &quot;hard&quot; level dungeons.<br />
<br />
The advent of &quot;time&quot; as a factor, while seeming to favor unleashing DPS people, doesn't seem to favor knight tanking because we're not dependent on mana to perform our function, and thus suffer no downtime to perform our functions, and the timers on the adventures can be pretty tight on some.<br />
<br />
The other factor is that in &quot;normal&quot; adventures, a Knight is almost overkill, for a ranger can tank these with little problem.  I forsee some good for us coming out of this because... <br />
<br />
1. The mobs in &quot;normal&quot; dungeons aren't so much of a threat that the aggro advantages of Knights are mandatory.<br />
<br />
2. The scope of &quot;adventures&quot; is such that if you're able to kill in the allotted time, then there's no major benefit to doing it 5 mins faster.  The only time it'd be a big plus is when you're just at the edge of not being able to complete an adventure.<br />
<br />
3. The melee damage output in &quot;hard&quot; dungeons is hard enough that groups are motivated to let you tank, and as I said earlier, with the moving that you do in a dungeon, medding by the tank will be a collossal waste of time, which risks the failure of the adventure.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty optimistic overall about LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">I see the repetitive nature of the &quot;adventures&quot; getting old rather quickly<br />
<br />
What doesn't though?<br />
I agree with Frodlin on everything. Warriors, while not mandatory for hard, are a very nice plus, AETaunt is invaluable on multiples that can kill your cleric in a pinch, and in normal shit doesn't hit hard enough to necessitate fast aggro.<br />
<br />
I think LDoN owns, I've had as much fun in Hard Guk than I used to have in Sebilis back in the days, I'm glad to see hard pulls again, 4 mobs that can't be split, CRs in xp group that were totaly anihilated by PoP, the expansion is very promising.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen people comment that the &quot;hard&quot; setting is a challenge even for an elemental geared group.  How likely is it for the average non-elemental group to succeed at such an encounter and if there is little likelihood of a non-elemental geared group to succeed, what incentive do you see for people to include a Warrior for &quot;normal&quot; levels of challenge given how easy mobs are to tank at that setting?<br />
<br />
I guess my question really is, if the &quot;hard&quot; setting is going to only be for the uberest of geared groups, yet that is the setting that makes a Warrior the most attractive, what does that do for the majority of Warriors who don't meet those &quot;uber&quot; standards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">That is excellent to hear.  Although POP designed events are interesting, they should have not geared an entire expandsion around them.  <br />

<br />
And warrior tanking groups do just fine on hard, provided you have a BoW+ Warrior, but honestly if you're going for hard and don't have the basic elemental gear setup, you're suiciding. <br />
<br />
Does that relate mostly to the tanking or just to the entire groups set up for mana pools, regen, durability etc?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to hear some response to Glatius' point, heh. <br />
<br />
additional queries,<br />
<br />
Assuming pre-elemental equipped characters, Do 'normal' difficulty mobs need (or 'favour') a traditional style plate tank to tank? <br />
<br />
Also, I'd have thought a tank that can sustain himself (take some of the load) rather than sapping the groups mana supplies would have a natural advantage there?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the skeptiscism :p<br />
<br />
..and all the edits heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u207"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p207">My impressions on Beta:  The missions are all about rushing around, kill this ASAP, pull the next mob, let's go, let's go...<br />
<br />
Hybrids being able to generate more aggro, they are much better equipped to handle the frenzied, rushing pace than the warrior, who requires time to build his aggro.<br />
<br />
Tanking on normal is trivial enough that rangers can do it, so on normal, which I believe the vast majority of players will be, there's no benefit to picking a warrior, save perhaps the slight<br />
 DPS a dvantage from that warrior. <br />
<br />
Rogues are needed in many dungeons to scout the proper way in many of the missions, if you don't go the right way, you won't succeed in assassination or NPC rescue missions. There are a LOT of dead ends.<br />
<br />
Pally/shaman healing combinations work great, druids work just fine as healers, you really don't need a cleric in LDON.<br />
<br />
DPS classes are KING in LDoN IMO, all the dungeons are about getting things done ASAP. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, you NEED some sort of CC, that can be a bard, chanter, or another plate class, but you pretty much need a CC of some sort, as well as clarity and speed (as it slows you down bigtime without them) however on the bonus side you can usually find achanter in the wayfarer camp who's prepping to go out on a journey to cast em for you if you don't have a chanter.<br />
<br />
LDoN augmentations are interesting. Most that I saw were +6 to a given stat or resist. however, this I would suspect will change in balancing.<br />
<br />
Traps on the boxes are goddamn brutal, they can wipe out a party in under a minute if you're not on top of cures of various kinds. ALWAYS a far better idea to have the box disarmed and opened by soemone who can do it.<br />
<br />
Mobs at level 65 usually are level 56-62 in con.<br />
<br />
There's various kinds of mobs in the dungeons, depending on the &quot;theme&quot;, for example I've seen mobs with predominantly undead some with elemental, some with lots of animals... charm can last for quite a while or for no time at all, charmed pets make GREAT additions to DPS, however they can wipe the group if charm breaks at the wrong time. If the group wipe, you pretty much are guaranteed a fail, you usually can't CR and get back in and expect to finish in time.<br />
<br />
That's bout all I can think off of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Nearly every piece of gear outside of LdoN can be augmented.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We saw this a couple nights ago. Basically, it worked like this: We started a &quot;normal&quot; adventure with an amazing group, and we beat the adventure in less than 30 minutes. We were then stuck and unable to get another adventure for about 15 minutes. Some of the other guys in the group had seen this before, and were saying that it is to stop the uber strong groups from doing very fast normal adventures and racking up the adventure points. That makes sense, as 4 slay-undead paladins, a cleric, and a bard can utterly destroy the undead &quot;normal&quot; dungeons.<br />

This example is an extreme situation, though, as the group was unusually strong. (The group had four top-of-their-servers paladins, a certain bard, and an uber cleric. The paladins all had their PoTime swords, were proc'ing group heals like mad, and were proc'ing Slay Undead 3 left and right. It was pretty amazing :) )&quot;<br />
<br />
The group described above is pretty much the ideal killing group for harvesting points with zero risk, yet still nice DPS because of SlayUndead3+Bard. <br />
<br />
But I guess it would be a positive thing if all the paladins grouped up in harvesting groups like that, maybe the rest of us can then actually get groups too :p</div></div><hr />

My impressions on Beta:  The missions are all about rushing around, kill this ASAP, pull the next mob, let's go, let's go...<br />
<br />
Hybrids being able to generate more aggro, they are much better equipped to handle the frenzied, rushing pace than the warrior, who requires time to build his aggro.<br />
<br />
Tanking on normal is trivial enough that rangers can do it, so on normal, which I believe the vast majority of players will be, there's no benefit to picking a warrior, save perhaps the slight<br />
 DPS a dvantage from that warrior. <br />
<br />
Rogues are needed in many dungeons to scout the proper way in many of the missions, if you don't go the right way, you won't succeed in assassination or NPC rescue missions. There are a LOT of dead ends.<br />
<br />
Pally/shaman healing combinations work great, druids work just fine as healers, you really don't need a cleric in LDON.<br />
<br />
DPS classes are KING in LDoN IMO, all the dungeons are about getting things done ASAP. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, you NEED some sort of CC, that can be a bard, chanter, or another plate class, but you pretty much need a CC of some sort, as well as clarity and speed (as it slows you down bigtime without them) however on the bonus side you can usually find achanter in the wayfarer camp who's prepping to go out on a journey to cast em for you if you don't have a chanter.<br />
<br />
LDoN augmentations are interesting. Most that I saw were +6 to a given stat or resist. however, this I would suspect will change in balancing.<br />
<br />
Traps on the boxes are goddamn brutal, they can wipe out a party in under a minute if you're not on top of cures of various kinds. ALWAYS a far better idea to have the box disarmed and opened by soemone who can do it.<br />
<br />
Mobs at level 65 usually are level 56-62 in con.<br />
<br />
There's various kinds of mobs in the dungeons, depending on the &quot;theme&quot;, for example I've seen mobs with predominantly undead some with elemental, some with lots of animals... charm can last for quite a while or for no time at all, charmed pets make GREAT additions to DPS, however they can wipe the group if charm breaks at the wrong time. If the group wipe, you pretty much are guaranteed a fail, you usually can't CR and get back in and expect to finish in time.<br />
<br />
That's bout all I can think off of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Nearly every piece of gear outside of LdoN can be augmented.  <br />
<br />
The last 'hard' adventure i was in, the mobs were blue-yellow cons, which would make them closer to 64-66th levels. The xp was decent, just over a full AA in one adventure, plus loot, plus points. Not bad IMO.  Tons of undead in the Mistmoore ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u213"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p213">The reason those paladins were 'top of the server' is the time shopping spree. Those paladins might have been in tier 2 on live, of PoP. Gear meant nothing.</div></div><hr />

I'd given up on pick-up groups in PoP due to hours of LFG.</div></div><hr />

first 14-30 days (if that) people will want a warrior/cleric combo<br />
<br />
Once they learn the adventures it will be back to the old ways. <br />
<br />
If not.. I was wrong. <br />
<br />
Too late now. Everybody ordered it. <br />
<br />
And to all the warriors that say we are fine... By the time you think we are not balanced the other 60-70% that think we are hurting now will be playing knights :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
man my group is screwed then. last night my friends at i throw together a group, was 3 warriors 1 druid 1 chanter and a cleric. we tried the moderate lvl and basically owned everything in sight. we finished one adventure with 59 mins left. don't think we ever went under 30 mins left with an adventure. only times that happen was cause we went into a dead end not cause of our dps.  so far we have done 6 of them. i guess warriors really do suck.... but my group will continue to take 3 warriors /shrug.<br />
<br />
normally i just read the warrior boards ever so often to see if anything new as come on and as of late there has been a lot of whining on this board. ii come to this board and after reading a few threads fine it amazed that some of these warriors even pass lvl 50 since paladins and sks are so frekkin uber.<br />
<br />
maybe i am just lucky tho,  i have been in the same guild for 2 years now i have a close knit of friends, we always group together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">On the day of LDoN's launch i recieved a tell to group right as i logged in. Sure it was a nice suprise, but i just got on and figured id see what my guild was up to. I dont think we're quite so out of demand as most here would think...but i do have to agree with the idea that once people catch on to time factor in the adventures, quick aggro + chain nuking will rule the day. Then we could be in some trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">Ocide, Just so I drive this point home once again, <br />
<br />
Take that group, drop them 10 levels, take away 3000 hp from all the tanks in that group, and say they only have 6 aa's<br />
<br />
Now. Who is going to do better at keeping the mobs off the chanter ?   probably the cleric trying to heal him.<br />
<br />
This post was not for lvl 65 warriors with 100 aa's and 2 EB weapons and 10khp<br />
<br />
This was simply for people that already had issues grouping.<br />
<br />
You (like myself) have no issues getting a group. As I said.. you will love the expansion.<br />
<br />
Look at the magelo profiles of the people you say are whining. They dont have 7600 hp unbuffed. They dont have a BOW or 2 eb weapons. (granted I whine but I see it as a class issue) <br />
<br />
Pallys now have an entire section of this expansion where they are gods if they have su3. <br />
<br />
What do we get... Maybe Hard was ment for us. But that goes back to what does 99% of the people that play eq want.<br />
<br />
71 points for scratching kicking fighting and barly winning brfore the timer runs out?<br />
<br />
or 51 points for finishing a dungon in 30 min.<br />
<br />
Hard should give no less than 100 points. Make risk=reward.  30 min for 51 points. 90 for 71. People pick easy. Thats why people hug a wall when they camp an outdoor spot. why they dont roam in places like hoh. <br />
<br />
And I do not think hard was made for us. Sk/pally with the same hp unbuffed as us could tank as well as us there. Unless you only kill one mob every 12 min due to they all need defensive.<br />
<br />
anyways.. it too late now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Ocide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">what incentive do you see for people to include a Warrior for &quot;normal&quot; levels of challenge given how easy mobs are to tank at that setting? <br />
<br />
for dps. you have 6 slots to fill and groups don't have to be perfect by any means. like i said i had a 3 warrior group and we finished with tons of time left on moderate lvl.<br />
<br />
but then again i don't do pick up groups i just ask hit my who all friends hot key or i get invited when raids are done. i haven't MTed in one adventure yet even tho i have dual EB i just bag it and use 2h. of course having 3 warriors is kind of a waste but i'd much rather have this group then a warrior paladin wiz rogue cleric enchanter because those 2 other warriors in my group are close friends. i guess that is why i love LDoN so much, i can adventure with my friends.<br />
<br />
maybe i am just not seeing your point, when my group goes on adventures we just invite friends as long as we fill the healer and CC slot we invite anyone. hell i did a adventure with 2 warriors 2 clerics a ranger and chanter and we still finished in 30 mins.  maybe my friends are just nice enough to invite me along the adventures for dps, thats all i have been so far. i don't complain i am not MT, its still fun as hell to charge a room not knowing whats it in with danger around every corner.<br />
<br />
you guys make it sound like you only have 20 mins to start and finish a adventure. you are given 90 mins, dps is king but its not as important and you make it out to be. hell let the paladin in your group tank and use your 2h. its better that way, hitting assist hot key and pressing a and going afk is more fun then pressing taunt every time it pops up :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u221"><b>Blargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p221">FYI I'm an sk, and warriors have been picked in front of me plenty with LDoN to be &quot;the&quot; tank.  Plenty of other times I've grouped with warriors and we did fine, finishing the dungeon with lots of time to spare.  This four paladin example really illustrates the fact that slay undead is quite overpowered and deserves some kind of adjustment.  But they were way uber anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">Much as at the start of POP people love 'boring' warriors as a 'safe' option when visiting someplace new (although to be honest I think that's a false perception, certainly on normal difficulty mobs just don't hit hard enough to be a danger to the main tank 9 times out of 10).  <br />
<br />
As far as warrior desirability goes, I'm skeptical. DPS has never been a primary selling point of any plate tank last i checked and as mentioned our durability is WAY above the required amount.  Ironically, It sounds like anyone not elemental equipped will struggle in Hard setting which is the only place our durability would appear to set us apart..../shrug<br />
<br />
So it appears I must hope that the ability to just scrape together a random group and succeed keeps me in work and/or hope more people accept multiple tanks /group as the norm. Not from any true advantages I bring. <br />
<br />
I'm witholding judgement, however, until the newness of the expansion wears off. Once supply of tanks exceeds demand in/for groups, then people will start making choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u223"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p223">My last LDON was my first with a Warrior.  If I am building another LDON group, it will be built around the warrior.  <br />
I am a Paladin.  In my last adventure, I pulled, and pulled right at the warrior.  We only had a couple adds the whole time, but each time, I off-tanked and kept the adds attention.<br />
Our group shaman (this was a pick up group) had to be beat with a stick to get him to haste us, but the Warrior and I still took care of business.<br />
At about 30% the warrior would call for me to pull next.  Pull after pull went like this.  This was a kill mission, and I believe we had 15 minutes to spare when completed.<br />
I hear on the SK board where they brag to be able to take agro when they want to.  I hear warriors say that Paladins can steal the agro if they want.<br />
To that, I say, why would I want to?  I never met this warrior before, and we worked as well together as anyone I have met.  He masterlooted as I pulled the next mob, he kept control, and I never bothered to try to see if I could get the mob's attention.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way:  I could probably get Jennifer Anniston's attention away from Brad Pitt if I chose to throw a drink in her face, but why would I want to do that?<br />
<br />
The difference between CAN and WILL is the prudence to know when it is a good time to use the power.  Our warrior kept the mobs off me and everyone else, why should I take more hits than neccessary?</div></div><hr />
