<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was found on Monkly Business by Hintae. It's not the complete post, but the part we should be concerned with :)<br />
<br />
We are in the process of adding +endurance to existing items. It will be about as prevalent as +mana is for hybrids.<br />
<br />
The opening system as it was on Test will probably not return. The goal was to make combat more interesting and add some reactiveness, but the attention required and randomness of it didn't do much to help with the class balance aspect. We'd rather use skills like the Phantom and Incite line, disciplines, and innate abilities to define and refine the class' role.<br />

Good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, they are saying what we got in the first round is all we are getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, what they are saying is that they not only listened to our opinions about the Openings system, but are agreeing with us.  The Openings system, while interesting in print, didn't help class balance.  So instead they are now working on skills that are on demand.  But it will take more time, due to both practically starting over, and having an expansion on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They should just give us some of the opening skills as regular ones with a fixed timer and endurance cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is encouraging news. I notice as it stands that endurance can be a problem when trying to get the most out of my offensive/defensive skills as of late. <br />
<br />
Maybe we'll start seeing the hp/end items soon much like we see hp/mana items all over the bazaar and from drops. I even hope we can convert our mana to endurance so I can benefit from my 441 mana, but I doubt that's going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got 2000 mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am hoping they add +  endurance  to EXISTING<br />
items, instead of making us fight extreme named<br />
&quot;GOD&quot; mobs that drop items.<br />
<br />
The fair thing to doThat would go a long way towards class balance:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure I speak for 99 % of the warrior community<br />
when I say we would all love to log in and see our existing gear<br />
modified with + endurance that matches to the mana on it<br />
that we dont currently use, even better, on class only gear that does not have mana, add endurance as well.<br />
<br />
This should include existing weapons, not just armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe Raex armor will get +Endurance. ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SgtSarros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">okay.. i'm confused.. does that mean the &quot;disciplines&quot; or openings or whatever you call them named &quot;back swing&quot; &quot;flurry&quot; etc don't exist anymore, as they were for openings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pretty much; yeah. anything dealing with 'openings' was scrapped.</div></div><hr />
