<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello my fellow meat buckets,<br />
<br />
I did a search on the Stone Etched Mallet and read all that I found but the subject on weather a warrior should bother getting one or leave it to the DPS classes is still up for debate.<br />
<br />
Here is the thread which discusses the Stone Etched Mallet:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2439&amp;highlight=stone+etched+mallet <br />
<br />
I still can't decided if warriors should leave this guy alone or use it as an upgrade for their DW setup.<br />
<br />
Last night one dropped and the only person who put in for it was a BST. All other DW classes were just confused I think if this was right for them.  Hell, I'm confused. <br />
<br />
What do you guys think? Should a warrior pick this up if he is using a BoC and a GBoS ( my current setup)? Should I be happy with what I have and just wait for a 2hs agro weapon or do both?<br />
<br />
Sorry, just not sure about this weapon.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very nice offhand DPS.<br />
Very decent mainhand DPS.<br />

Lowish agro.<br />

Grab a sews, put Anger3 or Ykesha and you will love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SEM is not too bad, but yeah, SEWS are better for a War at this point of the game imo. Yet if it's cheap or no one care, you might want to loot one, especialy if you are close to time, could be cool to have one in bank when you loot an EoE and are waiting for DB. Did some parse EoE + SEM with aug it's better dps, better stats, and better aggro wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info. I mentioned last night that I was interested in a SEWS if one dropped but some pallies in our guild started to  get defensive. They were looking a the SEWS as a pally weapon using the logic BoW = warrior, SEWS = pally. <br />
<br />
What do you think of that?  Is the SeWs the best a pally can get before Time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">other than the 2h rathe drops, sews is the best 2h available prior to time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's fine if your guild farms RZ for BoW.  Many of them don't.  SEWS makes a great warrior weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry guys didnt realize he had gotten out again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bakaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SEWS is very good, heck I still use it from time to time also in time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">tell your pallys to quit griping. its a v good alternative 2 hander for warriors to a bow. besides, its not that there arent decent dps 2 handers available to pallys in eles - crowfooted lance and that ornate gayblade that drops in fire.  and its not like pallys to need the aggro that rune gets.</div></div><hr />

Seems very successful with it $$</div></div><hr />
