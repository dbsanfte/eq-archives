<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainingvodka</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was at the coterie camp tonight just messing around and apparently the named mobs have changed.  There are only two of the old named mobs and two new ones.  One spawned on top of the center coffin on the top floor -- is a conceited coterie (or something, i probably have the name wrong somewhat) and is for the new pally epic (KoS to me).  On the balcony was the Insatiable Coterie spawned in the center of the balcony against the eastern wall -- cons indifferent and does not respond to hails...my guess is he is for SK epic?<br />
<br />
I met a pally and his friend that were there for the pally mob and so I helped them kill that and the other KoS nameds but Grolden did not spawn.<br />
<br />
caveats:  I have never been to the castle before having just tonight finished the prior step in katta so I don't know exactly where Grolden or Zevfeer spawns.  We only cleared the castle once.  We never killed the indiff mob.  Fearing it was broken I didn't want to call in friends or ask my new mates to stay and *really* waste our time<br />
<br />
has anyone been to the castle lately and has grolden still spawned despite the new mobs?  I'm afraid these new epic mobs have broken the quest...</div></div><hr />

Grolden spawned and me and my brothers mage killed him to spawn Valdnov.  Unfortunately we died at 17% and my brother whined and logged  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the new named didn't kill Grolden?<br />
<br />
I did this camp the other night as well and killed those two named.  The thing I noticed on my way up the tower before getting to them was the message &quot;Xenithen Sterbla has been slain by a Coterie insatiate&quot;.  The new named, whom spawns directly on Heratius Grolden's spawn location, will kill the other named vampyres.  This worried me that he would also kill Heratius, since I thought Heratius was just another one of those same named vampyre, only difference being that Valdanov Zevfeer would trigger off his death.<br />
<br />
But if you were killing Grolden without this new named assisting, all must be well and the quest isn't broken.<br />
<br />
I wondered about this new &quot;a Coterie insatiate&quot; however, what he's for I mean.  Is it an epic quest or not?  He dropped &quot;Volatile Vampyre Blood&quot;.  He was immune to melee and required vampyre bane weapons to attack just like Valdanov, he also has the same 1K proc just like Valdanov.  No where near the HPs of Valdanov, but those same similarities in abilities, and the word &quot;Volatile&quot; in his drop, that made me giddy that this might be a part of an alternate quest to get the ashes for the shield.  Would be sweet if it is, but doubting it now and rather chalking it up to unoriginal mob cut and paste design on the epic quest designers part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found out finally.  &quot;a coterie insatiate&quot; is for the enchanter epic 1.5/2.0 quest, and has nothing to do with the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest.<br />
<br />
Here's what still worries me though...  he's still right on top of Heratius' spawn location as far as I've gathered.  While the insatiate cons indifferent to me, and I was able to fight the vampyre's right next to him without him assisting, he &quot;did&quot; assist when I pulled a vampyre directly through him.  Meaning, he does assist, but just that his aggro/assist range is so small that the mob he's assisting has to pass right through him for him to notice.  If Heratius spawns right there on top of this new dude, am I going to have to constantly keep this stupid thing cleared so I don't get stuck fighting both Heratius &quot;and&quot; this new 1k procing epic mob at the same time?  While doable, it's kinda of a hassle.<br />
<br />
Anyone had any experience with this?  Has anyone seen Heratius spawn on top of this new mob, and was able to pull him away without aggroing it?  On the flip side, does Heratius even spawn if this new mob is up?  I mean, SOE is usually pretty good about not having two mobs spawn directly on top of each other, and it doesn't strike me as something they'd purposely do.  Or has Heratius' spawn location changed slightly so that they're not directly on top of each other now?<br />
<br />
80+ hours at this camp, and I've never once seen Heratius spawn, so I don't have any of the answers to these questions, nor do I even know his &quot;exact&quot; spawn location other than what friends have told me (in the center of the balcony, which is where I see this new mob sitting).</div></div><hr />

Cleared up to the top level.  Grolden was spawned out on the balcony.  One of the &quot;normal&quot; nameds was even still up at that time. Coterie Corruptor was up.  He did not aggro my grp at any time.<br />
<br />
Pulled Grolden to stairs.  He died and Zevfeer spawned out on the balcony -- NOT where the Corruptor was spawned on the center coffin. Went out to balcony and proceeded to whup on grolden.  65 war (me) 66 ranger.  60 ench.  65 druid.  68 wiz.  we weren't having any trouble...and then the insatiabel coterie aggroed us.  Not sure if someone got on the wrong target or if it was just helper/social aggro or what...<br />
<br />
just be careful not to get close to that guy.  He ended up making us wipe at like 30% on Zevfeer.  <br />
<br />
luckily we got back and reformed before Zevfeer despawned.  we took him on the balcony (with the addition of a 67 necro who came up to reaggro Zevfeer just in case while we all ported in, ran back, and CRed) and kept him away from insatiable...it never aggroed and I got my ashes =)<br />
<br />
yay me!</div></div><hr />

So Heratius and the following Valdanov spawns don't spawn directly on top of the &quot;a coterie insatiate&quot;?  The coterie insatiate spawns out on the balcony right where I had thought Heratius spawned.  The Coterie Corrupter is inside, away from the balcony, so I know that he won't add.  It's the insatiate out on the balcony itself that I was worried about, cause he did add when I pulled one of the greenies &quot;through&quot; him.  So if he didn't add on you guys while fighting Valdanov out there, I can assume that Heratius/Valdanov did not spawn directly on the insatiate's head?</div></div><hr />

heratius/valdanov both spawned in the center of the balcony near the EDGE, away from the wall where the insatiable was.  in other words...NO, neither mob spawned on top of the insatiable.  the social aggro range on the insatiable is small enough that you can pull and engage heratius/valdanov on the blacony without getting the insatiable as well...just need to keep close to edge of the balcony (we were near the south end archway into the castle) and watch your push.</div></div><hr />
