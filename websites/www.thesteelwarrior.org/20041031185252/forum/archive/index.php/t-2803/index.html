<br />
Could anyone confirm or not if this item cast a &quot;buff&quot; on the target for a duration of 3.3 min?<br />
<br />
Is it worthwile to equip BF+stormrider carapace on boss mob to proc the shield once, then switch to Blade of War? <br />
<br />
Or does the +40% hate on rage proc only affect the Bloodfrenzy when the shield is equiped and bashing?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how other focus effect fuction, and if this work in a similar fashion.<br />
<br />
To me +40% on BoW rage proc would be overpowering, but i'm hoping the shield still allow it for 3.3 min after bashing.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm or not pls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The FB effect doesn't effect EB procs, or any other procs or rightclicks for a warrior. When it works, you get a message the shield glows, same as when any other focus works. This happens every bash/slam, but never on a proc or rightclick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think furious bash was originally intended to work for procs but for some reason it only ended up working on cast spells. Rather than fix this, they just nerfed it altogether (doesn't add hate to cast spells now either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Furious Bash works great for paladins though.  I would assume shadowknights as well.  A paladin friend has the FB3 shield off Rydda Dar and it glows when he bashes, procs with his weapon, procs with a buff that gives procs, casts stuns or flash of light.<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, Furious Bash is not broken if you are a hybrid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, it used to but now it only &quot;glows with a red light&quot; on bashes. Doesn't work for spells anymore (never worked for procs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WTF!? It doesn't go off on procs? I picked up my FB4 shield up from Chaoswind the other day (grats me creating a 10 man raid and being the only warrior!) and haven't used it yet. Was hoping that it with GBoS might be useful for tanking the odd mob here or there. Its kinda nice to gain 90ac from wielding it if you could keep aggro at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm very disappointed with FB.  They say with a bloodfrenzy, you can still maintain aggro fairly well using a shield.  But then again, they also say you can maintain aggro pretty well just using your fist for an offhand with BF.<br />
<br />
The uses i've found for FB shield are:<br />
<br />
1) rampage tanking. . .this is actually the only good use i've found.<br />
<br />
2) offtanking a mob for extended periods where damage is not desired. . .this is extremely rare, and it doesn't really matter if you have a shield anyways.<br />
<br />
3) buffing a magelo profile. . .by far the most common use of warrior shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just picked up an Aegis of the Earth (FB5 sheild) and have a question. Does the FB effect only go off on succseful bashes? IE: A bash that does dmg. It glows red everytime I bash, matter if I do dmg or not...just unsure if it 'procs' everytime. Thanks ahead of time for any answers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No clue on that, and no clue how you could really test it either.  I am pretty sure that you'd want to have your bash skill maxed to really use the shield.  I got mine up to 189 I think just using it now and then on trash mobs.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess, i'd say that FB increases the hate of a bash by a percentage.  If a bash misses, does it create hate?  If not, then i'd say the focus effect does nothing on a miss.  I think all swings do count for hate, but very very little.<br />
<br />
The only way they're going to make FB a viable aggro option is if the effect starts working with aggro procs, as I assume it was originally intended.  And still, the lack of dps is gonna be significant for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just got this shield and tried it out.  <br />
<br />
I used it in BOT and had it equipped on pulls.  When mob came in bashed once, then swaped out till bash refreshes.  Swap back in and bash one more time, then put it away for rest of fight (byt this time mob slowed and equip offhand weapon).<br />
<br />
Anyway, didn't lose agro on slow once (have GBOS and Jesus-Hammer as weapons)<br />
<br />
I like using it on pulls before mob slowed.  The extra AC/HP + lack of ripostes on unslowed mobs is nice, and it does seems to get some agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gazarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">a mob that is slowed or unslowed won't affect in anyway he's ability to riposte you... so using shield when mob is unslowed only gonna help mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use a BF and SRC for main tanking - seems to hold aggro about like a dual wield combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did see this (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19919) for 1500 in bazaar, would i have any use of it at 32? nice stats at least :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, if you want to cut your dps by half, then yeah, perhaps that shield is for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">BF / SRC is no worse than BoW or BF / BoC from an aggro point of view, maybe BF / BoC is a little better than the 2 other in the long run, but slightly lesser in the short term.<br />
If you are in an xp grp your dps might matter, but in raid if you are tanking, who care ?<br />
A shield is a way to maintain aggro with a 1hander and to cut down riposte to about the same as 2handers, but it also provide the best stats ( 90 AC is not something to be look upon, for a SRC, like 120 for Aegis of Earth)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, what exactly is a level 32 going to be raiding where he doesn't care about dps?  That was kindof my point.<br />
<br />
You say BF and SRC is good aggro?  Perhaps it is, but my point is that BF and SRC is only marginally better than BF and a fire beetle eye in your offhand.  By all accounts, BF is really about the only 1h weapon you'll be able to have a chance at maintaining aggro with a shield, due to BF's higher than normal EB proc rate.  A BoC and shield certainly isn't going to work well unless you have very forgiving guildmates.</div></div><hr />
