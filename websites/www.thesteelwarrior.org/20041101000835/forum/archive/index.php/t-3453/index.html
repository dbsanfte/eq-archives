<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Numtini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, just what everyone needs. Yet Another Thread begging for advice about equipment. <br />
<br />
In addition to what's on magelo, I have 4 dex augment on the breastplate and 4 stamina on a bracer.<br />
<br />
I have 4000 to spend and I'm not part of a raiding guild. I'm mostly doing LDON missions right now, but mostly I've squandered points on quick upgrades for stuff I was way way behind on. My guild is mainly 30s to 50s, we're talking about doing some Kael runs, but so far nobody's managed to get past the talking stage. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm having reasonable luck holding aggro with either the frosty/lammy or with the Felhammer. So I'm at least not totally displeased with my weapon choices. The lammy could go, but I don't see a good return on limited money if I replace it? My only thought has been to toss in a barnacle covered axe in the offhand just cause it's so cheap and would free money for something else. Along the lines of cheap, I figure I'll switch to a greatstaff of thunder for 2hb at 55 (required level of 55).<br />
<br />
On armor, I've poked a lot in the bazaar, searching for sta, hp, and ac items, particularly for the neck and mask, but haven't seen anything that struck me on the mask and clattering bone necklaces seem to be pretty pricey. And no, nobody seems to be doing Kael raids, but I'm hoping my guild can get something together.<br />
<br />
Any advice, either quick bargains or long term upgrades?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How low has the GSoT gone on your server?<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes for face?<br />
<br />
Blood runed Greaves might be down to 4k now?<br />
<br />
Not sure what else, yes you are in a little bit of a pickle for upgrades without Thurg stuff.<br />
<br />
My advice is get to 55 ASAP and see if you can borrow some people for Plate Cycle.<br />
<br />
You could upgrade instantly with almost every item.<br />
<br />
God forbid Legs or a BP drop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iksargo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dunno what server he plays on, but last night on torv in bazaar, saw a GSoT for 450pp. These are ranging from 400-800pp these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen GSoT for 100 pp on my server, and 300 pp is about average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup,<br />
Bought a GSoT for 100pp in bazaar on Prexus today....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">get an earring of the solstice. 3k<br />
crinose cape of the werewolf 1k<br />
some type of HP item in alot of slots, I notice you have stamina, that's ok but generally the AC gets compromised as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rings are fine for now, stick with those until every other slot is upgraded.  head is fine.<br />
<br />
Greaves - Clockwork Observer - Arms - clockwork observer.  High ac and decent HP on these items with right clicke ffect.  I would get the bp also.  right click invis is a win.<br />
<br />
mask - Grobb Hide <br />
<br />
Neck - Amulet of Mummy Wrappings - LDON Amulet of Forggten Magic, from MIRAGUL(EVERFROST) 150 points.  &lt;very good<br />
<br />
Wrist- Clockwork observer again, there's not really any other good choice here that is cheap.  I HOPE it goes for cheap on your server, goes about for 1-3k on my server since there's not really anyone buying it right now.<br />
<br />
I think gnomes are able to use brellium too but I'm not sure, the clockwork is better because it has some right c lick good fx on them.<br />
<br />
Gloves are a tricky matter.  However you have your haste item there so I guess I shouldn't worry about it.  However, I only have been using belt haste items. from 24 percent to 31 percent to my next upgrade a 36 percent.  I'm a 56 warrior.<br />
<br />
Range: I use a bow, nearly every time I adventure.  When I don't use a bow.  I use a blody ancille's pouch, it has nice stats. about 2k<br />
<br />
Weapons, use a GSoT until you get all these good armor slots.  Look at my profile if you wish.  I'm modeling it basically the same.  except if I wasn't a rallos warrior I would probably go this route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IF you elect to do 1h weapons.<br />
<br />
I recommend an elite steelslave blade for 1k.<br />
<br />
13 dmg 20 delay.. pretty easy to acquire.<br />
<br />
Then I would recommend a sword of the bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
then a copper hammer.<br />
<br />
sword goes for cheaper on my server and nearly every other server I've been on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got mine for 38k about a day before they changed the drop rate....:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gladious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GSot goes for about 200 to 500pp on my server and got crinose cape for 100pp thats right 100pp,  best thing is to keep going on adventures and save those points for armor which is comparable to culutral.  Also depending on your guild mates a few groups of 50+ can go to PoG and get decent armor as well!<br />
