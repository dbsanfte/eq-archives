<br />
Are there things I could ask them to do differently? Timing issues with slows or pet? Spells they should stay away from, or use at different times in the fight?  Anything i should be doing differently?  Basically, I'd like to know what to talk to them about if things get ridiculous about bouncing agro around.<br />
<br />
Its not an emergency issue or anything (and really, a lot of times it doesn't really matter) But it is annoying enough that if theres an easy fix I'm open to suggestions.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed lots of pet classes get more aggro, including my own Enc, if you sic  pet before a high aggro spell because you're already on the hate list.  We all know the pure hate spells like Incite line give crap aggro if you dont tag first, and I think that aggro cap extends to any first action on a mob.  Way back when I was leveling my chanter in bot, I tried linking /pet attack to my Tash button, and then to my Slow button, and noticed I got summoned a lot more often, with same tanks, until I just waited and sent pet in after it was debuffed.</div></div><hr />

If BST is the slower for the group its harder yet as slow is large aggro, number 2 and 3 are incapacitate(step down from cripple) and poison dots.  There is no reason to ever use Incap in xp groups, i mem it sometimes if im the tank and use it as a taunt button.

Sometimes i just end up tanking xp groups even if there is a war or knight if they dont have very good aggro capabilties, otherwise i just end up standing around FM doing jack.

Problem I have had lately is a 63 necro we have in guild. Have had him group several times lately doing ToSoRo and stuff and he is constantly getting aggro. I know any caster can get aggro if they want from a warrior but it is still aggravating having to chase the damn mob then watch the necro FD. He has a 65 pally too so I would think he would understand about casting to early and such.</div></div><hr />

 Odd, your experience is exactly opposite of every shaman/ench in my guild, and my personal experience when botting..<br />
<br />
When doing ikkinz for a while, I ended up botting both a shaman (or ench) and a cleric at time to help farm items for friends. I always found that sending the pet in for innitial hate almost guaranteed no summoning fromd ebuffs/slow. After playing with it during botting, I encouraged them to try and most indicated they could easily see an improvement.<br />
<br />
This follows my understanding of the wizard experiments showing that a low low low agro debuff, nuke or any initial agro would prevent summoning and allow them to nuke faster with less risk.<br />

 The only thing I can really think of that is causing it is the beast stacking poison DoT(s) + slow pretty soon after sic'ing pet. I have a heck of a time getting aggro back from a beastlord who does that on inc, and its annoying yes, but if he dies its really his fault and not mine for launching his two (possibly more) biggest aggro spells right off the bat. I usually let the beastlords I group with know that they should wait about 20 seconds (for me to tag + bazu followed by cyclone blade) before slowing/DoT'ing the crap out of them.</div></div><hr />

He says it feels like the DoTs are what do it the most.  I have grouped with him as main slower and not had problems before, but he is very very good at playing the edge of aggro.  I run into big problems with other beasts and aggro.</div></div><hr />

I believe this to be true as well.  It does seem to help against mobs that rampage but other then that for most mobs I believe it is useless.  Has anyone parsed it to be sure?  <br />
<br />
As a small rant I think part of the problem is BLs think that they can tank pretty good.  Since I box a BL with my warrior I know you can keep your DPS up there without always taking agro if you exercise the smallest amount of control.</div></div><hr />

Redhenna,  Well said. correct, wiz at graffe parsed their initial DD as being 30% more hate than all the following, that's why they suggest to enter the hate list with a very low aggro tool (lvl1 DD or preferably concussion ~&gt; zero aggro spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahes</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed myself pulling aggro a lot more lately as well.  No idea if it's anything specific though.  In experience groups I generally slow from right next to the tank and then sick the pet on the mob and turn on attack.  This alone still seems to pull a ton of aggro.  Add to that the fact that mobs are resisting slow a lot more than they used to.<br />
<br />
Personally, as much as I'd like to play my class to it's potential, I don't DoT in exp groups any more.  Going &quot;all out&quot; will always pull aggro off a warrior.  I usually stick to slowing, then using my top 2 cold DDs.  No Poison DoT and no Incapacitate.  The only time I can actually go all out is with a good, top-geared SK.  It definitely sucks to not be able to use your maximum dps potential though.  Playing a BST in experience groups defintely requires walking a fine line of aggro.  If you never see a BST pull aggro, they're not doing much, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you're having an issue with the BSTs, I'd let them just pull aggro and deal with it.  As mentioned before, we have our own version of Stone Stance every 3.5 minutes or so, and a 15 minute refresh aggro-reducer.  General knowledge of the class combined with those should allow a BST to either avoid aggro, or deal with it when they get it.  Personally, aside from instanced Nest runs, if I end up tanking a mob for the duration it's not a crisis.  We're no plate class, but can usually stay on our feet when needed.</div></div><hr />

They are the only slowers that have steady DPS along with their slow, so if they sic their pet, slow, DoT, and start in meleeing they are just pissing off the mob severely.  I don't have any problem with the BL I group with most often, I'm not sure what he does differently but he seems to manage aggro pretty well.  I have definitely grouped with some BLs that pull aggro a lot though.  <br />

Used to have a necro in guild that liked to sit 50 feet away and DoT up a mob, then FD.  He didn't see a problem because he didn't get hit, but didn't understand why it was a bad thing for the mob to go charging off in his direction 2 or 3 times a fight with all the melees running around after it :p.  He died a lot too, but didn't take that as an indication that he should do anything differently :p.   Luckily he ebayed his account.</div></div><hr />

I have a very good friend necro who is the sort to go absolutely all out.  She pulls agro every single mob, without fail.  Thankfully, she is also smart enough to stand close, pull agro, FD it off, get up and move back.  Mob rarely moves.  She does die on occasion from this, but with the DoTs she is stacking, the kills are so fast she gets the exp back in no time.  DPS from a good necro is absolutely insane.</div></div><hr />

Newp.  Out new spell is a situational offensive/HoT spell.  It's not practical in experience groups due to short duration/high mana cost, so you're not likely to see it as a constant cause for aggro.<br />
<br />
Our DPS from the Beastlord themself has actually been in decline is relation to the expansion since PoP, so...bot sure why aggro is getting worse.  Though I have to admit in my case, I use the chaotic strike aug on my mainhand. Gotta do something with all the casters in DoN.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I hate 'gut feeling' and I don't believe mine, *but*, without changing my weapons or aug setup, I actually feel like I'm holding aggro *less* well generally, in many situations, since a recent patch.<br />
<br />
I know it can't be true, but it feels like it.<br />
<br />
Raid targets (nothing major) that I used to have solid 100% lock on now bounce names in the HoTT window.  in XP groups aggro is less solid until later than normal.<br />

I know I'm imagining it, but it feels real dammit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been my biggest problem with holding aggro of late.  Usually if another class is taking my aggro its because they're using a weapon with an innate stun proc or they've auged it to be so.  I'm not necessarily blaming the offending class for this, though I do sometimes question their wisdom in selecting just such an aug.  I do, however, place alot of the blame on SoE for this one.  I'm not sure how many others have noticed this or agree but a very large proportion of the nicer, easily obtainable weapons for DPS classes nowadays have an innate stun proc on them.  Combine that with the fact that the best augs for DPS, Choatic Strike, also have a stun portion to them and you're asking for trouble.  My guess is that this is SoE's attempt at adding some of the excitement and uncertainty back into the game and controlling aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tanked a lot in DoN again last night and with this thread in my mind, and my 'feeling' about aggro, I played around with some stuff (all-be-it in a non-scientific way).<br />
<br />
Tanking for a group with a BL as the only other melee, I noticed that more often than normal the BL would be in the HoTT window.  If I stepped 'into' the mob when that happened, more often than not and in fact, most of the time, I would regain aggro.  If I just kept tanking at the same range (pretty close to the mob anyway, I always strive to be the closest person from habit) then it would take much longer, and often a couple of procs before I would regain aggro.<br />
<br />
I tried this quite a few times, either moving into the mob a bit closer as soon as I lost aggro, or waiting until I regained it normally, and most of the time moving into the mob got it back right away.<br />
<br />
I also tried moving the mobs by backing away (they don't summon).  I did this both with and without the BL being near the mobs, and in about 80% of the cases the mob started attacking the nearest toon without following me.  Sometimes that was a low-aggro druid or  the cleric, toons to which I would be far ahead of in aggro terms normally.  This wasn't your normal 'i'm a caster NPC so when you move I'll start casting and not follow', these mobs turned immedatiately and hit anyone in range.  They only moved to me when no one else was in melee range, or a few times when there was.  But most often, they really wanted to stay put.<br />
<br />
I watched another warrior tanking in a DoN mission (BoC / CHSD) while I played my Shaman, and he had the same issue, he couldn't move mobs, once they were in position and had a couple of toons next to them, if he moved out of range they'd stay put and switch to what appeared to be the nearest target.<br />
<br />
I tanked in some non-DoN zones (WoS for example) with exactly the same setup and some much higher DPS characters in the group than when in DoN, and aggro worked exactly how it always has.  I held it 99% of the time, I could move mobs happily even when they were next to other toons, and I could stand at almost any range as long as I could hit them and aggro would stay on me.<br />
<br />
DoN feels different - and if what I'm seeing is correct then it smells like the proximity hate bonus is massive.</div></div><hr />

Yep, this can work at lower levels as well. Last night my 57 warrior went with 4 (casual, not uber) guildmates (druid, bard, bard, necro) ranging from lvl 56 to 60 to Kael arena. Necro was the highest level in the group, I think, and he was snaring mobs, then putting the DoT smackdown on 'em &amp; FD-ing the mob off if he drew aggro. I just put the giants' back to the necro pet (and to where I could see the necro behind the pet). My aggro was not exactly what you'd  call stable (heh), but the necro didn't get hit much and never for long. Usually if the mob turned for the necro, I had him back in one step. The necro could have waited longer to DoT (and I guess would have if we were tanking stuff that couldn't be snared and could kill him in a couple of rounds) but waiting would have cost us a huge percentage of our dps, which otherwise wasn't that high. Nobody died, we pulled pretty much constantly, and the only time the druid got below 2m was when we had a pop add in camp and the necro/pet tried to off tank it for a bit. As much as I love the feeling of aggro lock, I can't say that having the necro wait would have been nearly as effective in that specific situation.<br />
At least in exp groups, there's a difference between a stupid necro ganking aggro and going splat and a smart necro going all out and never quite getting hit hard by the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true in many XP groups for many classes.  In LDoN, people often apologise the moment they draw aggro from me.  I tell them I don't care who gets hit, as long as I don't have to go running around, and that they don't do it so often they die or the healer runs low on mana.<br />
<br />
I'd rather be pushing the aggro limit in fast paced XP groups, than playing it 100% safe on every single pull.<br />
