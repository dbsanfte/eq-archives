<br />
Seems the big deal is bigger and better haste items. Bazaar prices as well as the rush to spend raid pts on the higher haste items have me posting this question.  If the haste cap is 100%, including bard song, chanter speed, and wearable haste, why would someone push so hard for increased haste?  I understand that you dont always have a bard in the group but if you have say a 31% haste from a soulscream and a vallons from a enchanter, you would be at 99% haste.  I can see the arguement if we were a soloing class that would not be around others to group much but we arent.  Any raid will have at least the Vallons.  Any ldon will have chanters in one of the camps if not in your group.  I understand that there are instances in the game that are outside of raids and ldons, but is it really worth it for the cost to be paid to increase haste?<br />
<br />
Guess my question is because I am considering dumping the soulscream for the rube belt and getting the 36% haste aug out of BB for the helm.  On my server, the belt is running 40kish and the aug is 1150 I believe.  There is also the POI dragon that drops the 41% neck haste.<br />
<br />
Guess my question is how much of a priority does todays warrior put into the bigger and badder haste items?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thraxnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've got a 36% haste item and have no real intention of upgradeing in the near future.. if I happen to get one with a better haste then I'll use it but I'm not going to spend dkp or plan a raid for it... <br />
<br />
as to haste cap my understanding was that there were 3 hastes , worn, spell, v3 hastes.<br />
V3 hastes being certain bard songs which stack with other hastes and allow the cap to be exceeded  (this was the way it was explained to me a while back... if I'm wrong then someone will correct me thats the wonder of here).<br />
<br />
Generally don't pay for haste farm for it and get the one you want for the situation your in. (if it still drops)</div></div><hr />
