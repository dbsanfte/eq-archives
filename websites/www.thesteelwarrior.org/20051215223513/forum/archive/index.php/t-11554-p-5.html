If you want to kill paladins, don't roll a warrior. Just be happy that so many of them  have no idea what they are doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is why call a nerf on another class. Why not improve what deserves to be improved. <br />
<br />
Oh, believe me, warrior ability cooldowns is another rant altogether.  Pallies get DA on a 5 minute refresh, with another secondary semi DA on a 5 minute seperate timer.  Rogues get Vanish, Sprint and Evasion (making those bastards goddamned near impossible to kill if they don't want you to kill them when combined with blind), Druid shapeshifting breaks snare effects...the list goes on.  All the while, warrior abilities SHARE a 30 minute timer.  Utter crap.  If you're a warrior and you just got jumped, kiss your ass goodbye.  I always make sure I try to bloody the nose of the offending party, but it's basically in vain.<br />
<br />
But paladins definitely need to be toned down.  One of the following...<br />
<br />
Combat mana regen slowed a tad, so that they will EVENTUALLY fucking run out of mana.  Having a paladin be in the exact same health/mana state after a 6 minute fight is garbage.<br />
<br />
DA needs to not remove effects if it's going to make you invulnerable.  If my mortal strike, Sunder, Demoralizing, Howl, etc get to stay on for their durations while you're invulnerable, then I'm fine with that.  I spent my &quot;mana&quot; to put them on there, other classes shouldn't be able to strip them off at will.<br />
<br />
Put cleanse on a 30 second timer.  Intercept is on a 30 second timer.  I'm not seeing a fucking difference.<br />
<br />
Drop their AC down thru itemization (cough mail) so that a melee class can actually fucking eventually run them out of mana.  Even with Mortal strike, you can't put a paladin down to a level where he needs to heal before his bullshit stun refreshes and he can heal up.<br />
<br />
(BTW...can we make Iron Will ACTUALLY FUCKING DO SOMETHING?  Who the hell has actually resisted a goddamned stun?  People resist my charges all the fucking time, but I'll be damned if I can resist anything anyone throws at me.)<br />
<br />
Nothing of the above is going to cripple paladins, but it's going to eliminate the utter bullshit that paladins who aren't consecration whores can spew in PvP.</div></div><hr />

Play Horde.<br />
<br />
No paladins, and shamans while tough have far less in common with a warrior than Paladins do.</div></div><hr />

Buddies assist me to bring it down as I find it a very dangerous support class on the field. Then I go back to grinding through the alliance artillery :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the real question isn't as simple as War vs Pal.   <br />
<br />
At the very least, its how does War vs Pal, compare to War vs Shm.<br />
The only true judge of balance in WOW is Alliance vs Horde.<br />
<br />
That's the war, not warriors vs priests, or warriors vs warlocks, or anything.<br />
<br />
Because if Alliance Warriors have an easy time with Horde Warlocks (other thread) and a bitch of a time with Horde Hunters, as long as the same is true for Horde Warriors the two sides are balanced.<br />
<br />
If anything, I suspect Alliance paladins are far weaker than Horde Shaman.<br />
Hell, when a Horde Shm using 1H + Shield has more mitigation then a 2H Paladin<br />
and does more Melee Dmg with Windfury/Rockbiter then Paladin does with Command/Righteousness, something is unbalanced.   And thats Melee DPS not even factoring in Shocks.<br />
<br />
Hell in 1-1 no one should be killed by a paladin really.   They have no finishing power at all.  No snare/hamstring.   If you die to a paladin, instead of escaping its sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins can get upwards of 5000 AC with 2H weapon using green armor when you factor in their AC aura.  I imagine close to 6ooo is possible with the right gear.  A properly built Paladin can lay the smack down as hard as a warrior with the right build, their only problem is getting close enough to do it and hoping for SoC to proc.  I was talking about it the other day with a guild mate.  A paladin with a Reaper, and with at least a 11Holy /25 Protection/ 11 retri build would be a melee nightmare using SoC for damage when not being attacked, and when attacked, combining it with reckoning, which is a free attack every time they are critted against.  Not sure how a shaman is going to come anywhere close to that with 1H and shield.  <br />
<br />
If a Paladin uses a shield, its even worse for killing them.  While the idea of damage dealing powerhouse paladin is nice, i think it misses the true power behind the class because its difficult for Paladins to apply the damage without and cc or abilities like charge.  My ideal Paladin build would be the Protection healer,  23 Holy/28 Prot.  With improved devotion aura giving 1149 armor on top of toughness, AC of 7500 shold be possible without even having anything special for armor.  Add in Lightforge armor or epic level, combined with an epic shield, and 8500 plus should be quite possible.  That is a ton of mitigation from physical attacks.  Then take into account every time you attack them with holy shield, they are returning 150-160 damage back to you evey time they block.  And if you crit, they get a free attack.  Normal DPs would suck, but they could theoretically drain you of HPs as fast as you can attack them.  Impale yourself FTW.  Then add blessing of wisdom with decent spirit, seal of widom, judgement of wisdom, and a good starting mana pool with the +10% from Holy, and it would be difficult to run them out of mana.  Also, the reduced cool down on blessing of protection puts it at every 3 miutes instead of five, meaning you could use both shields and stuns to heal, then have blessing of protection come back up for use again.  The impervious healer, something a shaman is not.  DPS would suck, but would bring so much to a pvp group, its not even funny.<br />
<br />
Its just that most who play the class are morons, so that is always working in the Horde's favor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The build you mentioned for a paladin using Holy Shield, is extra nasty to Warriors and Rogues.   However, it's useless for fighting casters.<br />
<br />
One of the interesting things about these types of &quot;Nerf&quot; threads, is that they are silly, because Nerfs are so damnably dangerous.<br />
<br />
For example, if you say Paladin's (especially Protection Holy Shields) should be nerfed, then shouldn't warriors be nerfed too??<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=11391<br />
High End Warriors don't lose to Warlocks, so nerf Warriors Right?<br />
<br />
See the problem?<br />
<br />
Balance is only really an issue, when comparing Paladins to Shm.<br />
<br />
And Windfury with 1H is nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakanzzar</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think in modern day terms it is very much like comparing a Light Infantry soldier to a Mobile Infanty soldier.<br />
<br />
Neither is going to win a war on their own. Its the unit working together that works, not the man himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not calling for a nerf.  While my idea for a Paly build would be nearly invulnerable, it would also not be able to kill anyone by itself.  A pure support role, so it evens itself out in terms of balance.  You can build a damage dealing Paly, but at the cost of so much, that you become nothing but a poor warrior in group PvP that survives, which does you little good if everyone arond you dies.  Duel wise, Paladins are murder, but in open PvP, I would not argue they are overpowered.</div></div><hr />

actually I had same issue this morning... I was typing a proposition for fixing the fury tree, it was an already long post as I was getting to the end when suddenly my system administrator rebooted my PC wihout warning for some maintenance purpuse. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one question Haass : do you play an undead warrior ?<br />
if yes, then you should be gratfull to have survive 6mins agaisnt a paladin since paladin are meant to be the anti-undead fighter. You should have fallen much faster, actually I would even support a paladin boost vs undead.</div></div><hr />
