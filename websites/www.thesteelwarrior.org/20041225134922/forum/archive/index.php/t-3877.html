<br />
i hope this info helps. i have tried to say stuff in serverwide.thesteelwarrior and gotten laughed at by these 1-65 in 3 or 4 months or less people LOL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know they just cast whenever they feel like it or not at all :p. Not a big deal if they get agro for me. One taunt usually gets agro back but in the mean time I do more DPS!</div></div><hr />

It is a commonly held misconception that HP&gt;AC&gt;STA&gt;STR&gt;DEX&gt;AGL.  This is actually wrong, the formulae should read WIS&gt;INT&gt;HP&gt;AC&gt;STA&gt;STR&gt;DEX&gt;AGL.<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain, whislt the HP&gt;AC Warrior and the WIS&gt;INT warrior will come out fairly equal on standard XP mobs bugs, gnolls, spiders, orcs etc.  The wise warrior has the advantage when it comes to the real bad boys out there ie Giants, Spectres, and for the really adventurous Terrorantula (VERY SCARY VERY BIG SPIDER) In these cases the WIS&gt;INT warrior has a huge advantage because they will normally have the brains to run away rather than stand there and go duh hit me.<br />

Always better to chat mobs into going to a bar and get their asses drunk, THEN you can loot em :p</div></div><hr />
