<br />
Now with LDoN Paladins have surpassed by so fucking much its insane.  What the hell were they thinking making dungeons with 85% undead in them.  So, im with this gimp geared but extreemly nice paladin in Lower Guk, he's got 150ish AAs...so he takes his character seriously.  I really respect that.  This paladin was criting for 3000+ regularly, I then suddenly realized warriors are now truly obsolete.  I knew slay undead 3 was powerful, but never gave it much thought, since I only saw it being used in SSRA for the most part.

<br />
I seem to remember a rant on the Cleric boards about slowers who do exactly that.  I do know that when my Chanter was starting in PoP she was told unequivably to wait on slows by the first few Clerics she grouped with until she got the timing down (and that was with a Knight class pulling).  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but seeing too many Shamans in LDoN slow on incoming then run OOM healing because the mob ping-pongs amongst 4 or 5 different people before the Main Tank can recover aggro annoys me.  Particulalrly since nothing in LDoN hits hard enough to need to be slowed.  (And then you wait for the Shaman to start Canibilizing for mana ... only to come to the slow realization that the Shaman probably doesn't even realize he has the spell).  <br />
<br />
There is no class in the game so useless that its lack of utility can't be exceeded by a clueless player on a stronger class.<br />
<br />
[Edit]<br />
Now with LDoN Paladins have surpassed by so fucking much its insane. What the hell were they thinking making dungeons with 85% undead in them. <br />
<br />
They were thinking that even with SU3 in an all-undead dungeon a Paladin will barely be able to keep up with the DPS of a similarly equipped Warrior.  This is true and has been parsed so many times by so many people it shouldn't be an issue any longer.  It's very impressive eye-candy, but that's pretty much all it is.  <br />
<br />
It's also interesting to note that the two high-end Plate themes are Miragul's with relatively few undead and Takis with no undead at all.</div></div><hr />

Get a good crit and the mob dies quicker letting you kill the additional one in camp (that was costing mana to mez or heal whoever it was hitting) that much sooner. The DPS may well balance over time but it's the burst damage that's important. <br />

Against low hp mobs it's actually less effective in increasing average DPS than the standard parsing would suggest.  A 3K hit when the mob has 500 hps left is 2500 points of wasted damage.  The burst damage may on rare occasions turn a losing fight around, but it's far to random to be relied upon.  In terms that are perhaps most understandable here, SU3 makes a Paladin an effective DPS class against undead in the exact same way that weapon procs make Warriors effective at holding agro (asuming the Warrior uses nothing but procs to maintain agro).  <br />
<br />
Really, in an extended dungeon crawl like LDoN, it's sustainable damage over time that matters.  Burst damage is fairly irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Thats because mob is undead, something paladins own.<br />

Its called Holyforge.  Discipline lasts 5 minutes, reuse 68minutes.  Combat Fury III allows us to crit 7% of the time, SUIII (18AA, prerequisite CFIII) allows us to slay about 2% of the time.  Add this up, 7% chance to crit + 4X chance to crit and we have a lot of crits, that 2% chance to slay while not in /Holyforge goes up 8%... /shrug... aka add some luck and that 8% slay of all total hits is a lot of eye candy in a long fight.  Dont let it fool you though cuz theres been times  I went through disc and saw no slays. Holyforge (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx?path=%2fLamini%2ffullsize%2fslaymode.jpg) <br />
<br />
As far as our the last Itraer Vius raid I had, the top 10 damagers:<br />

<br />
Paladins have always been staying near the undead, even when the game first came out there was the Ghoulbane with its high dd proc vs undead (i dont remember how much 132dd?).  We do the most dps on undead raid mobs while on holyforge (and usually die, my case anyway), if not on disc im not surprised if warriors out dps us (and some do) since theyre supposed to, even over undead.</div></div><hr />

Using a shaman as the only healer in a group of you and 4 dps classes works pretty well though. You can ae slow them and not worry about much. In hard though I agree, there isn't much use for a shaman since you need the mez's from an enchanter. Plus, an enchanter can charm a pet doing upwards of 600dps.</div></div><hr />

I agree, Its not a game breaker....  Though SU3 stacked with all of their other utility skillz/abilitiez just makes me feel more useless.  Granted, it maybe be only a 20% increase, but when people see those crits it only makes us look not so appealing to the average player.  Not everyone out there reads boards and uses a parser.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, this is a special case.  The 20% increase in DPS shown in parses assumes the Paladin uses Holy Forge every time it comes up.  Without using Holy Forge, there's only about a 10%-15% increase in DPS.  The roundabout result here is that a significant part of that 20% boost occurs during the comparitively brief time that Holy Forge is active.  So in single fights against big undead boss mobs where Holy Forge can be used for a significant portion of the fight a Paladin is getting considerably more than a 20% DPS boost.  In an extended crawl like LDoN, however, it would be 20%, probably less.  <br />
<br />
On that note, I personally feel that Warriors would benefit a lot more from an eye-candy maneuver like SU3 then they would from an actual fix to their balance issues.  Warriors are not so unablanced as to be unplayable, it's player perception that's gimping them the most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Romidar puts together an easy to understand senerio.  If you start with a Paladin who does 100 DPS without any of the AA for Slay Undead you end up with a Paladin that does 130 DPS with Slay Undead and supportive skills (140 if you trigger Holyforge).<br />
<br />
The &quot;20% more damage&quot; is just a rough estimate.  Some will only gain 10% while some will see more like 30%.<br />
<br />
There is also an interesting psychological thing that goes along with this.  The skill drives Paladins to kill undead even though none of can dish DPS as well as a Wizard.  Wow...a  little RP? ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to keep in mind about SU is that it's minimum is much higher than a normal min hit. The mobs that you see what seem to be outrageous damage from paladins are generally against very high AC luclin mobs with holy forge being used. SU is going to be a much bigger increase on mobs with very high AC if the guild involved doesn't have much in the way of atk gear. As +atk gear becomes more prevalent in the guild, the jump that paladins get from SU becomes smaller and smaller relative to the other classes.<br />
<br />
In the situation where a lower tier guild is fighting an undead boss mob in luclin (all 2 of them?) with very high AC, Slay Undead gives a much larger percentage increase than it should. <br />
<br />
For those who see the comments that &quot;SU isn't a very big increase in damage&quot; and &quot;it is a very significant increase in damage&quot; and wonder which one is true...they both are. For a paladin, that 20% increase is massive. Compared to the DPS of just about any other class, the amount of increased damage is relatively insignificant. A paladin doing 50 DPS with windblade now does 60 DPS against undead. That 10 DPS improvement has to be taken in context.</div></div><hr />

With equivalent weapons we ABSOLUTELY get outdamaged by Paladins with SU3, using the 20% number.    Just because you don't turn into a &quot;DPS Class&quot;, doesn't man it doesn't turn you into greater than warrior DPS.</div></div><hr />

nod.  While I mostly agree, I feel you guys are a great off tank class and are also a dps class.  As far as BuffS go in a raid, BSS is what we offer (assuming you had the pp to buy it, cost me 100k).  But only casters want it... or would you rather have BSS over SoT?  Unless youre talking about our buff Heroic Bond but thats not used in raids.   (/wonders If ive ever used it).  Even in a group environment ive never seen heroic bond, not since I was in KC anyway, not since virtue is anywhere for 20pp<br />
<br />
Frodlin, <br />
     I have a few parses where warriors out dps me vs undead, not over a fight or 2, but about an hours worth, raids or in a group... when not using Holyforge anyway.  Ask me for the log file if you wish to see it... like how much of your XPing is undead anyway?  Most XPers are in BoT, or PoV (one undead group here ive ever seen, my own), HoH before it was opened up was usually empty other than the top guilds.</div></div><hr />

You'll note the requisite &quot;if using equivalent weaponry&quot;, I'm sure I can find parses of me being outdamaged by Paladins on live mobs as well.   <br />
<br />
As to the question of &quot;how much of your xping is undead anyway?&quot;  How about 3/5ths of LDoN having a serious enough population of undead to lower my value to a group in relation to you.</div></div><hr />

As far as XPing in LDoN... dont know hmmm, 2AA in HoH for 1hr or 75% of an AA in LDoN for 1hr.  Guess it depends on what your XPing, AA or items or LDoN points :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um.<br />
<br />
Great DPS. Compared with a paladin we do ok yeah, but in all honesty Rangers, monks, Rogues, Enchanters with pets, wizards, mages, Beastlords, Necro's and even SK's are better at DPsing. Maybe if i had a BoW (?) I'd sing a different tune but that weapon is probably still owned by less than 1-5% of a servers warrior population.<br />
<br />
Offtanking, Warriors can for the space of 3 mins reduce number of hits and or halve damage taken (so it takes say 40 seconds as opposed to 20 seconds for a mob to reduce our hit points to zero)  we have no way however to totally mitigate damage and require the attention of another (healer) class to function in that capacity. Paladins can reduce damage output of a mob to a fraction with stuns, park mobs if neccessary and can be self sufficient in healing. Shadowknights have it less easy but in the right circumstances can 'offtank' multiple mobs at once via kiting. all in all knights are a better offtank package. <br />
<br />
Warriors have precisely no utility in any role other than direct confrontational Tanking of a mob and even there the advantages only really stand out on the miniscule fraction of mobs in game that absolutely require disciplines to tank. <br />
<br />
Despite how downbeat this all sounds I don't want to play another class. Warriors are the only class I want to play. Wish there was more to recommend em.</div></div><hr />

As far as XPing in LDoN... dont know hmmm, 2AA in HoH for 1hr or 75% of an AA in LDoN for 1hr.  Guess it depends on what your XPing, AA or items or LDoN points :P  <br />
<br />
I think most people that have LDoN would gladly give up a little xp to get points instead.  You will rarely catch me anywhere outside of LDoN doing the old xp grind.</div></div><hr />

Tanking is what we do and we should make better main tanks then off tanks. Also, calling us a dps class when paladins can do more damage and not be considered a dps class confusses me.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't consider Warriors to be a DPS class either, although at one time they were.  Melee DPS hasn't kept pace with spell DPS.</div></div><hr />

Paladins are closer to Warrior DPS in Luclin than they are now since Luclin era due to itemization and high AC negating weapon skill bonuses, but that wasn't a problem back then since Undead mobs are few.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if there's a 1000 AP charm from any camp that gives Slay Undead 3 while in Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  Yeah good versus Undead is supposed to be a class ability but when you're looking at an expansion with signficiant undead in 60% of the areas, the undead specialist actually just becomes a good DPS person, which isn't how it's supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

I think I agree with you.   I don't necessarily have a problem with Slay Undead as long as it doesn't represent a preponderance of current content.   In LDoN there's simply more undead than there should be, and because of this, in a large part of the expansion, it further erodes one of the few benefits of being a warrior, which is a DPS advantage.   <br />
<br />
I find the idea of an item which gives SU3 while in LDoN to be really amusing, simply because well, the irony of the inevitable howls of protest about itemization infringing on class roles.</div></div><hr />

(One really nasty combo to do is Paladin and Necro but that is another thread)<br />
<br />
I was under the impression at least one dungeon is mostly non-undead.  A balance must be struck in all things.  The reason to mix things up even a little is to get interclass depedancy to kick in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but things aren't all that mixed up Aeka, there is a definite leaning to undead.  If 30% of the mobs were undead, that would be somewhat reasonable.  When it's 60% or more, that just makes the Paladin's &quot;situational&quot; increased DPS ability no longer &quot;situational&quot;  merely not quite universal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">then theres the zones that have no undead at all where our damage is just above a clerics (the lowest possible) on the dps table (much lower if we are tanking)...  ie BoT, PoV, PoS (XP zones), and most of luclin, and all of velious.  Maybe the 2 (or 3?) LDoN dungeons with undead in it are there to put a little kick in for the classes with undead abililities since undead mobs have been such a rarity through the expansions.  It IS situational, remember that 2% of our hits are slays from 300 to 5k+ and since we're all wielding huge swords with long delays...  Our dps boost is ~20% as youve seen here from undead mobs, and like only ~5% of the mobs in EQ are undead :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5% of the mobs in EQ are undead?  I find that a little far fetched.  Lets see.  Lower Guk, Najina, Unrest, Mistmoore, Kaesora, Burning Woods, Dreadlands, Kanor's Castle, Maiden's eye, Akheva, Umbral Plains, all have moderate to large contingents of undead.  There are two or three zones in PoP with sizeable numbers of undead.  And in PoP your attraction has absolutely nothing to do with your DPS from slay undead.<br />
<br />
Our point is this, one of the only things currently still seperating Paladins from Warriors is the fact that Warriors have a tad (20%) more DPS on the average.  If you give Paladins large numbers of situations where their slay undead comes into play which gives them a 20% increase in their DPS, then they're doing equal to Warrior damage.  So, our DPS advantage turns into no advantage.  Which means we gave up heals, roots, stuns, and so forth for something which has now become a non-issue.  Just one more way Warriors are having their value negated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavr</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So leave slay alone and give warriors an innate dps boost... along with rogues and monks.  <br />
<br />
For once in the game there is actually undead mobs for the undead oriented people to exp on.  All the previous expansions have had undead, but in such small quantities as to make it silly to put forth an effort to track them down.<br />
<br />
Remember also that LDoN is still new.  Once the new wears off people will head back to PoP for the better loot and better exp.  LDoN will become a place to go for a change of pace, but PoP is still going to be the staple for groups.<br />
<br />
If you nerf slay then warriors will still be sitting in the same place they are now.  The answer here is a boost to warrior dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed with you on most part.  But how many of these zones have you yourself actualy had a group in killing undead mobs...<br />
<br />
The only reason why all paladins dont get SU is because &quot;theres not enough undead in game worth 30AAs to dump&quot;, etc...  LDoN is a different story I agree, yet most 60+ paladins dont have it (&quot;got SU3?... whats that?&quot;).  We stack with other tank classes in a group in LDoN for a ~20% boost to dps making us a good offtank... meaning room for you (tank) in LDoN group, and you know chanters die too fast when mezzing...  FYI last handfull or so LDoN groups I was in all had a warrior to tank, i have yet to find a group that had a problem with multiple tanks, they work great<br />
<br />
I agree with what youre saying about having an abundance of undead zones as it would attract us to be favored in groups... but most dont realize were not dps when we're tanking (mobs stun us too much, and no ogre paladins exist lol, all their looking at is eyecandy).  You see, tanking or not, your dps dont change too much where knights have to cast in order to get manage agro (unless youve seen a BoC paladin), casting = 0 dps.  In LDoN, I think paladins are better off being dps than tanking as we are better off being dps/back up healing/back up crowd control than being a tank.  <br />
<br />
Trust me im rooting for warriors to get something, whatever it is.  Its jacked up the way it is right now for warriors I agree as far as grouping goes, just about every class has had something happen to it the last couple expansions, and all youve gotten are more hps pretty much.<br />
<br />
Velious has no undead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chavr, I wasn't saying slay undead needed to be nerfed.  I was saying SoE was dumbasses to include so much undead in LDoN because it completely counter acts the one and really only one weakness Paladins have left, which is low DPS.  Paladins are now pocket Warriors with group heals, root, stun, fast cast heals, LoH, slay undead, holy forge, and holy steed.  It kind of negates one of the primary reasons to even have a Warrior around.<br />
<br />
I play a Barb Warrior.  I know a lot of people who play races other than Ogres as Warriors.  And we get stunned, as far as I know, as much as any Paladin, unless we get the AA that allows us to avoid some, but not all, combat stuns.</div></div><hr />

It's fine elsewhere because Undeads are few outside of LDoN.  Since it's too late to make most of LDoN not undead, it needs to be weakened in LDoN where you can pretty much always be in a heavy-undead area.</div></div><hr />
