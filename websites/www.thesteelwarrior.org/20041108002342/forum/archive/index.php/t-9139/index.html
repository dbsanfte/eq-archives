<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did the murkglider expedition tonight and seemed to have some trouble with my AE taunt working.  There were three seperate occasions where I hit AE taunt, got the message that I had taunted my targets, yet the mobs never moved or even looked at me.  Just curious if anyone else has had any trouble with this as well, or if this is a isolated incident and just something that I can't fathom affecting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AE taunt  has always been &quot;broken&quot; in regards to the Z-axis (the vertical axis). Mobs can be right in front of you but if they are floating (like the jellyfish) there is a chance that AE taunt will not hit them.<br />
<br />
I think the devs put that in to avoid AE taunt aggroing mobs a floor below or above in dungeons, but it still stinks to have it fail regardless of what the reason is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AE Taunt also doesn't work well with mobs whose center don't appear to be where they are.  Almost all floating mobs aren't at where you think they'd be as far as the game is concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wonder if it would help to jump and taunt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to be under their feet/tendrils really, being in hitbox doesn't always aetaunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiaro Ghostfaced</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AE taunt used to have no Zaxis problems......this was back wen you could pull half of SSra by AET at the zone in...now you cant use it on most large ( god sized ) mobs....cause there center is too far up.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With Z-axis issues he wouldn't be getting the messages then would he?  If he's getting the messages, than the game did indeed register the mobs coordinates vs. his coordinates as being within range and taunted them successfully.<br />
<br />
I've AE tuanted and had mobs not turn as well, but from what I've seen it's just a symptom of how tuant works.  You go to the top of the hate list plus one, that's it.  But, there's proximity aggro and/or sitting aggro adjustments to the hate list to consider.  I've had 5 mobs in camp before, where 3 were very close to me... one I was actively tanking and it was beating on me, two that had other targets but were up against me (closer to me than my buddies they were beating on), and 2 more mobs that were closer to other people than they were to me.  AE tuant registered all 5 successfully taunted (5 messages), the one I was on stayed on me of course, the two that were next to me flipped to me, but the 2 that were a little ways away from me kept right on beating on my group mates cause of proximity aggro.  I've done this a number of times, and even walked over to those mobs that didn't turn and had them immediately turn to me... then upon stepping back again they immediately turned right back to my friends again.  Proximity.  Some mobs seem to respond more to proximity than others, while there are other mobs that respond less to it, sometimes not responding to proximity at all.<br />
<br />
Proximity aggro is most likely like sitting aggro, in that it's an added adjustment that gets tacked on after everything else is said and done to the hate list.  If you taunt a mob off someone, tuant only, and pull aggro, if your groupmate you pulled from sits down, the mob will go for him again since his sitting aggro is greater than the &quot;one point&quot; lead you have on the hate list.  I'd imagine that proximity aggro works this same exact way.  Your AE tuant was most likely successful on all of the mobs that it said it was successful on, just that these after-the-fact hate adjustments that tuant has no effect upon were greater than your &quot;one point tuant lead&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For clarification, on 2 of the 3 occurences the mob/s was one of the rats, not the murkgliders, and I'm a dwarf, so I kinda already ruled out the Z-axis problem :)  It seemed odd that I had indeed received the succesful taunt message and nothing happened.  Alisdahre's explanation seems the most likely to me so far, and I had thought about that, but if that's the case, is this occurence regularly happening to everyone with AE Taunt?  Meaning, do other people get succesful messages yet not have the mob turn to them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nissa XXX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have noticed in the murky cave that reg taunt seems to be off also.  Get the successful taunt message 5 times ina row and the mob wont even flinch.<br />
<br />
I know I suck....but this is bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Garim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe this deserves another thread, but I have noticed Taunt itself not appearing to work lately.  My guild has been doing Cursed and other mobs in SSra lately, and I have had trouble with Taunt.  I get the succesful message, but never get aggor.  I have been putting this down to Slows, and Stuns and the way HoTT works so far, but,  its getting really annoying when you are trying to grab AL off a rogue and they die after two successfull taunts.  =p</div></div><hr />
