Sucks, but I knew that in beta so didn't buy it, waiting for WoW, actually waiting for WISH more, because the turd kiddies won't be able to get Mommy to pay the extra $$.</div></div><hr />

But lately I have been playing EQ2.  I really like the game, and enjoy the quests most of all.  I don't see myself playing EQ1 much anymore except to log on and chat with friends etc.  That beign said,  the game is not for everyone.  Obviously not everyone will like it.  But with most things in life you have to try it to really tell.  I haven't played WoW yet and have heards its amazing, i plan on buying it after xmas and giving it a shot.  As it is, i have about 3 EQ accts that I am kicking around and that money adds up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally don't see enough fluff worth going over to the EQ2. Catassing is Catassing I guess; and i'm happier catassing in EQ1 with a game I am familiar with. I do not want to spend another 5 years learning a new video game. I'm looking forward to Little League and Pop Warner football games with my son.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Start over, or keep doing the same content that I am not happy in.<br />
<br />
Thing is I have not heard nearly anything about EQ2 when compaired to the reviews and pledges of feudality (is that the right spelling?) to WoW</div></div><hr />

The gameplay is great, the quests are numerous and most are fun.  The graphics are also awesome.  More than that i cant say cause i havent logged in in 2 weeks because of schoolwork and the servers being down.  Oh, and of course i cant play anything right now till i get a new power supply lol.

<br />
Most games, no matter how atrocious they are (even Bouncer) didn't crash within two to four weeks of their release.<br />
<br />
Of course, people who actually think WoW and EQ 2 are going to cause the damage to EQ 1 they hope it will are really fooling themselves.  Honestly, it would've required much more initial damage than has been seen already.<br />

The entire quest for the Protecting the City of Stormwind and the Darkshire quest for Eliza and the murderer who's name just escaped me...<br />
<br />
These progression quests are detailed, inter twinded amongst themselves, have central plots all connected together, and wield  items and exp that makes leveling and game travel exciting. <br />
<br />
And when we killed Van Cleefs Captn but wiped on Van Cleef we didnt have to wait a week before re starting the instance and trying again (*cough* EQ2 *cough*)<br />
<br />
It is refreshing to fianlly have different online games that many people enjoy, eq1, eq2, wow, swg, etc.  I think it's refreshing to read my guild board and favorite sites like TSW and see different people commenting on different games.<br />

I don't know if McQuaid can make another 5 year run or whatever but he has the potential to make a rather good, profitable game.<br />
<br />
and by rather good I mean a lot of people who played WoW will complain about the EQness of Vanguard but will slowly grow to like it more as they get used to it. a lot but not sure about most.</div></div><hr />

Right, cuz I wanna go back to the people who invented the Hybrid XP penalty, group XP penalties, and decided that being smarter than mobs was wrong.<br />

Early EQ wasn't the Utopia some people think it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vanguard may be a great MMO. I'm not holding my breath, I like WoW a lot, but I can see Vanguard occupying a nice if not lion's share of the MMO market.<br />
<br />
(also that's where I draw the difference. EQ is a great MMO, WoW is a great game. it's kinda weird that most people feel not so bad about quitting the latter while quitting the former is generally more difficult)</div></div><hr />

Heheee...that is an evil, maniacal laugh btw...<br />
<br />
My first two toons were Troll SK and WE Ranger.  Back then you had the Troll Racial penalty and the Hybrid penalty.  I didnt know anything was wrong at the time (other than SK's sucked but it was a cool idea,...that was good enough for me, I was having fun).  My next toon to try it out, was a Hobbit Dr00d.  OMG, I was like 20 before I knew wtf happened.  Right then I knew something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Hated the penalties.  My Ranger made 50 back in the exp penalty days...blech.  Then Ugle was born.  Gotta love the Ogre Luvvin.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, the Vanguard &quot;Vision&quot; is what so many people despised about Everquest.  If I want to brag that I walked to school in three feet of snow, uphill, both ways...then I'll go ahead and do that.  It'll probably be funner.</div></div><hr />

if anyone can do that, and really break the mould, which is what they did with EQ, then i do look forward to what they are trying to do with vanguard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  I think we stuck it out DESPITE the game.  Seriously.  I think that what no one expected to happen in an online game did:  a community was born.  But for the relationships forged in groups, in guilds, and even on these forums, EQ would have been relegated to UO status long ago. <br />
<br />
The difference between now and then is that players have a plethora of choices.  The community is fractured in a way that I don't think any single MMO game will be able to fix.  Really good players are heading off to EQ2, to WoW, to Matrix, to Ryzom....Vanguard will only fracture the playerbase further.  My prediction is that it will be unable to reunite all of the bonds created in the early days of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't think there will be another game like EQ again. Seriously.<br />
What was available as a MMOG pre-EQ? Ultima Online? I honestly can't think of any other big 'world immersion' game like EQ in history. EQ blew the doors off the MMOG market and, well, each other company starting with DAoC right up to EQ2/WoW and the others coming to pass are all trying to catch lightning in a bottle.<br />
<br />
Maybe one will get it right. I admit I even jumped ship and got on the fanbois gang with a MMOG a while back. Overall, well, they all offer something different ( especially City of Heroes which was a downright blast to play ! ) but in the end it all involves time spent=rewards.....and these days time is something myself cannot afford to invest again; and many other people in my age group who could afford the systems to play these games on and the games itself no longer have time either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW and EQ2 both missed the boat for me.They seem newb friendly and easy.Some of that is due to things put in place to protect people from griefing and make stuff predictable.Don't get me wrong ,I'm not advocating griefing in MMOG's.Neither WOW or EQ2 feel as immmersive or erm &quot;Epic&quot; in quality as EQ.Besides, in both I feel  a touch of arcade style.What is it with clicking on a lil flashing button to complete HO's in a rpg?I guess the games are not really intended as strict rpg's tho.Still it's the aspect of EQ that kept my imagination interested.The new games diminish this aspect compared to EQ imo.My experience in them is limited to betas tho.I still honestly think EQ is a better game.The new ones are well...new.It's easy to be fascinated with a new world to explore and lots of stuff to learn.Also recent EQ content doesn't seem as fun as the older stuff.It's hard for me to put a finger on exactly why,but,they seem top have dropped the ball a bit.<br />
<br />
If you poured all that time into EQ despite the game i think you really missed something .I agree with Gulug, EQ was special.Do I think another game in the near future will capture us all as EQ did?It might not be possible.However,I do think a game that retains EQ's positive qualities while improving on it's weaknesses isn't far around the bend.Something is likely to come along that will draw a lot of the old crowd in a way that EQ2 and WOW fail to do.See you there hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You ever actually consider that there are so many &quot;WoW fanboys&quot; because the game is just that damn good? I dunno how anyone can bash the game or call it too easy when it's only been out about a month or so. Only about 1/4 of the posts from EQ2 players that I've read have actually liked the game, when I don't think I've ever seen a bad wow review other than people calling it &quot;cartoony&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; - but the ironic thing is the people who say it's easy haven't even played it yet.<br />
<br />
I probably die ten times more in WoW than I ever would in EQ, as a matter o' fact I bet I didn't die more than five times in a fourteen hour day playing EQ. The game is only what you make it, if you stick to single pulling mobs two levels lower than you with a group of course it's boring. I two box a war and shaman and do three-four mobs at once that are three levels higher than my highest toon and seems pretty fucking fun to me.<br />
<br />
I would just think it's common sense, usually if a lot of people like something, it's generally good. Do you think all of the people saying WoW is a great game are just a bunch of liars? Is it some big scheme to get you to waste your time and money? I mean seriously, what the hell is everyone so skeptical about? <br />
<br />
I'm just blowing smoke up your ass when I say WoW is awesome, it really sucks... that's why I bought a second comp just so I could two-box, I'm co-leading a guild and I play it every minute I'm not at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the game is pretty awesome and desirable by people from all facets of life. I think that's gonna be its downfall, which is okay because really making an mmo that lasts 2 years but leaves a lot of satisfied customers generally motivates them to keep buying your products. whereas unless there are some huge changes at SoE I do not plan to ever buy another game from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're 2 boxing in WoW, you've got some serious decision making issues. There is absolutely no reason to do so, and you're only gimping both of your toons.  I double boxed in EQ, and that's one thing, but WoW is a completely different beast that does not lend itself well to multitasking.<br />

If I see a warrior with a full rage bar, I know he's fuckin worthless.</div></div><hr />

hehe or just falling asleep cause he's been playing for 8 hours straight =O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Haas, it's pretty fuggn easy. My warrior almost never has half a rage bar, let alone a full one. Just toss the shaman on auto-follow, totem stomp out four totems and let him play heal bot while I sweeping strike/cleave the wave of mobs on me. I get two for one on every quest except collect and I can take on more than twice as many mobs at once which makes up for the grouping exp loss. Everyone says &quot;two boxing is so hard in wow&quot;, then I must be a golden god, because it seems fairly easy to play two toons effectively to me. <br />
<br />
Not to toot my own horn, but I'll say this to prove a point... after playing RTS games in my MMoRG offtime for so long, two boxing is cakewalk. I could bind four or five groups of units in WC3 and control them all just fine, I've played as many as six heroes all effectively when my allies have dropped (without even losing one I might add), and made multiple tourney finals online, so I don't think hitting three hotkeys per toon is very hard at all.<br />
<br />
Although I have nothing to prove, if the game is &quot;so easy&quot; like everyone keeps saying then it shouldn't be very hard to two box effectively right? I downloaded Fraps, maybe I'll post some videos of me AEing with my dynamic duo and completing orange elite quests, even though it generally lags the hell out of my comp.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just wanted to add, I'm not trying to start shit with you sir, since you're one of the only people on the WoW boards here that I tend to agree with 90% of the time, just defending my point of view is all. I hardly see how a heal/rez bot is useless, although if you're two boxing two melee or something I agree that is quite retarded.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, now I'm wishing you were on Hellscream so we can put you up against me and my friend playing a shammy and see who's right.<br />
<br />
After seeing that fucker's DPS with Windfury, I know what the answer to that is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Effective&quot; might be enough to kill a mob, but it's hardly the max of your capacity.  This isn't a 85% issue like it is in EQ.  Add that to the fact that you can solo damned near anything in WoW, and a second account just seems like wasted cash.  Rez/heal bot?  For what?  The 12 seconds it takes to regen to full?  The 3 minute run from a GY back for the same rez and the same durability loss?<br />
<br />
It's your 55 bucks, plus 15 a month, but man that seems like a lot for a couple percent more efficiency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can &quot;solo anything&quot; then you go pull three-four mobs that are three levels higher than your warrior and try it, while you're at it, try going and soloing those yellow/orange elite quests by yourself. You talk like I just pull singles all day with two toons - Why the hell would I two box to do something I could solo in the first place? <br />
<br />
I'm sure your argument will be &quot;but I can just solo singles back to back&quot;, so what? I can solo four mobs at once back to back, over and over with no down time and probably kill them just as fast. I even highly doubt every run you do from a GY is three minutes, maybe three minutes minimum. All of that extra time you might spend dinking around healing and CRing sure adds up. Even if both toons die, my shaman has reincarnation and that saves me a good ten minute run.<br />
<br />
Do you even know how wind fury works? Let me explain, wind fury adds a proc to your weapon that gives a whopping two attacks for an alloted amount of time. Yes, it was nerfed this patch and doesn't add seven attacks anymore. It's not like it's hard for me to take my shaman, target one of the four mobs on me and tap my 'A' key and let it auto melee in the first place.<br />
<br />
I played a warrior until 28 solo before I even made the shaman, and I can tell a big difference. You're right, it's my fifteen bucks a month, and I'll gladly work the extra hour for it.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Edit: My apologies Gerick, I think this is getting out of hand quick, I'm just a bit miffed because I've seen this brought up so many times I guess. I'm suprised you don't have some EQ friends to tag along with honestly, I would probably just follow my crew around if I had to pick a game.<br />
<br />
This little two box argument is also getting personal, so my bad, I'll drop it regardless if Haas replies. It's not as if I'm going to stop two boxing or he's going to start, so the whole thing is pointless. I just don't like being talked down to like I'm an idiot for doing it when I have my reasons.</div></div><hr />

I've been hesitant to label WoW as the next best thing but I have really enjoyed playing it.  I don't intend to give up EQ because I feel it's got a decent endgame and one that I enjoy.<br />
<br />
But I can't logon anymore and find a group in EQ without spending several hours LFG, or trying to put a group together which can take forever, for AA I really don't need, or for Guk LDoN which very few want to do.  When I have four hours at night before I need to go to bed, I have two choices.  One, to log on to EQ and spend 45 minutes to two hours setting things up and travelling, and the other choice involves me spending all 4 hours actually doing quests or tradeskills on WoW.<br />
<br />
As for EQ2 I have talked to people who are playing it and it apparently seems to force grouping more and more.  There's no way in hell I am going to pick up yet another game that requires me to have X Y and Z classes before even trying something.  In WoW I can duo with any other damn class I want, even another warrior, and be able to do 80% or so of the quests in my list.  If it's a harder quest I might have to add another person or something.<br />
<br />
I'll be staying in EQ though, I logon several times a week to raid and raiding is fun.  But if I didn't have the ability to raid I would be gone in two seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I rarely post on here but do read the boards a few times a week.  First off I would like to say why do you people always get so fired up over the smallest things?  Each and everyone of us is entitled to our own opinion on anything.  Maybe some seem very off base and retarded BUT they are still entitled to it.<br />
<br />
Ok, with that out of the way I thought I would throw in my 2 cp on EQ2.  I have been playing EQ1 for over 5 years.  I have 2 accounts that I play.  I was at a friends house and was watching him play EQ2 and decided to give it a try.  I bought it and I really enjoy it alot.  I play a warrior and enjoy pushing myself to the limit.  I normally die 5 times in a 3 or 4 hour session due to being too ballsy.<br />
<br />
There are lost of quests to do and so far I have had no problems soloing to lvl 14.  I have been playing about 4 days now.  It is different then EQ1 but I find the challenge and work you have to put foward is alot like when I started EQ1 back in the day.  I find I can jump into EQ2 and play an hour or 2 and log feeling I made some progress.  Where as EQ1 requires me to worry about finding a group and spending alot more time to make the same progress.<br />
<br />
I still enjoy EQ1 but I find I have less and less time to commit to it so I decided to try something new with less commitment.  I have yet to try WoW but I hear it is alot of fun.  I chose EQ2 mainly cause 2 RL friends play and I wanted to hang with them.<br />

<br />
The latest group of games are basically Massively Single Player Online games.   EQ wasn't, and isn't.   You need to get along and act human to flourish in EQ, and not be a conspiracy lunatic.    This is why any number of the latest trend of MSO's (I refuse to call EQ2 or WoW a MMO, since they're not really MMO, they're people playing next to each other, not with each other) will basically be &quot;ok&quot;, and enjoy no more than moderate success.<br />
<br />
There's a reason the maniacs on the Zek servers in EQ have left them as barren wastelands, because now there's a new place to be an ass.<br />
<br />
The &quot;vision&quot; is what made EQ the game it was.  The &quot;vision&quot; got and kept people playing, by forcing you to do things completely outside of your nature, like socializing and establishing networks of friends.  The same &quot;vision&quot; will turn Vanguard into a raging success as the &quot;successor&quot; to EQ Live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW encourages some of the more bizarre behaviors.  For example, it's probably more enjoyable to play with people who aren't necessarily very good at this game because that way the game actually becomes more interesting when people consistently break your sap/poly/etc.  <br />
<br />
Like Frodlin said, WoW is just a game you happen to play with 2000 other guys at the same time.  The game almost discourages interaction with others unless you want the extra challenge.<br />
<br />
The most bizarre behavior I've found, though, is how casters swear they're useful on mobs that automatically resist all their spells, and they're not even healing.  Of course, the game is easy enough that you might not notice 2 people in your party are completely incapable of doing damage, or not even there at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with nb<br />
<br />
Finding people to USE, social engineer and leave when they are not useful is not a good social skill, its a rats skill.<br />
<br />
I'd rather play a game where friend are friends, not just people I need to further my own ends... besides with people 6 boxing this is not even true in EQ anymore.... load up macroquest and showEQ and let your bots do the work (not that I use them, have never had more than 1 box and I don't cheat)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know those tricks just fine.<br />
<br />
I hope blizzard makes a more evil, gritty diablo MMO so there is a more adult game for them to offer, sort of like how sony made SWG but without all the suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only a few gripes about eq2. That is that there is very little solo encounters and even less soloable quests in EQ2. I played WoW and thats one of the things I really enjoyed was being able to solo, or grab a few random people doing the same thing to complete a quest. EQ2 gets a little spark of this with the level 20 armor quests that most people do. or those that don't know, nearly every WoW quest is that way. Only difference is that in WoW you can solo the same objectives as you do grouped, while in EQ your very hard pressed to do the same. EQ2 encounter system is the games weakest system I believe, that and group HOs. The encoutner system really limits the tactics that you can employ and the group make up that you can use.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of EQ2 players are going to try an disagree, but my guess is those that do haven't been past 20 yet. The game changes dramaticly post 20. Pre-20 EQ2 is a blast, you can pretty much duo or group with any cass you want and complete quests and have fun. However, post 20, you need a healer and you need lots of DPS to be effective, and I'm not talking in a min/max effective sense. I'm talking about being able to kill even cons with any degree of reliability without dying. Heck, I was with a 26 hunting greys in the crypt of betrayal last night and we died quite a few times to greys. Thats right, greys. An almost fully orange gears 23 guardian and 26 bard? couldn't even kill greys reliably for no xp for the armor quets objectives. And get this, the bard had to tank because I'd be creamed in 2-3 hits most of the time.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I'm going off on a tangent. As you can tell, I'm a little frustrated at the game right now. So here's the deal, you can't solo most 20+ quests. You can only solo, &quot;solo tagged mobs for xp, xp which is so pitiful is really isn't worth the effort. That is, if you can find solo tagged mobs. groups are hard to come by, because of the massive differences in xp gain that you get from leveling up in one place. After you ding, you can't stay in the same place and get decent xp, xp drops dramaticly when you level on the same mobs. Whereas in EQ you could effectively grind in the same area for a decent range of levels before you had to move on, in EQ2 you can level once, maybe twice and really you had better be moving on. This makes getting good xp groups together difficult with the high turn over.<br />
<br />
OK, so you've been lfg for an hour or 2 now and still can't find anything to do, and solo mobs aren't worth the effort, and you can't solo any of the quests you have. Ok, lets go tradeskill, great, that'll pass the time until I get an invite. Thing is that after you ding 10 in yout tradeskill, you then become dependant on other crafters to craft even basic recipes, nevermind any finished products. The only way to sell stuff is to stand in your room staring at the walls while you are in trader mode because you can't sell offline or while playing. this also means that the components you need to craft in your tradeskill professions are also dependant on others to stand in their room being equally bored. Component that you need to complete your recipes. So, you can't even solo without a lot of preparation or support from other players. I think that's soloing at all.<br />
<br />
HOs are almost completely worthless. Soloing it sorta useful to do HOs, but in groups they just aren't worth the effort. not only does the damage not scale properly with the number of people involved in the HO, nor does it scale very well with level. At 10 or so I was doing about 50 damage with an HO solo. At 23 I'm doing like 60-70. My standard attacks hit harder than the HO does with nearly the same refresh. Grouped? I don't care what people say, i've done them everyone which way from sunday and no matter what, HOs are not worth the combined effort it takes to get one off. Everyone else is better of just spamming specials. I only bother with HOs solo because its mostly free damage, and well, solo encounters are designed for someone chaining HOs. I don't care what other say, HOs are broken, they are all but completely worthless except for a few situational HOs that make certain boss/raid encounters much easiler. That's all I'll say about HOs.<br />
<br />
The last bit that I have a problm is the quests themselves. I've done over 175 quests last time I checked, so I know a little bit about what I'm talking about here. I'm a questaholic, I spend the majority of my time doing quests in EQ2. The quests are completely uninspired. It seems like the quests were developed by copy and pasting from a questing for dummies book or something. Like they are example quests, not something you actual implement. They are boring. I'm not talking about the objectives. I've done enough quests in many game to understand that their are only so many things that you can have as obectives for a quests. KIll shit, collect shit, find shit...etc. thats not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the quests, not the objectives. I'm searching right now for lost gambling tokens for an armor quests as one of the objectives. Do I know why this guy lost his tokens? No. Do I care anything for this guys lost tokens? No. there is absolutely no reason mentioned why I'm looking for these things. Nealy every quest has been like this.<br />
<br />
Now I say that to mention that there is better to be had. Case in point was a low level quest in castleview, I think, called Tillhill's woes or something like that. Alchemist apprentice there is having a problem with his master's pet drake. It seems the drake is a little menace is keeps eating the reagents, from the caves, that Tillhill is responsible to keep in stock for his master. His master thinks thathis pet drake can do no wrong so he keeps scolding Tillhill for not having supplies, making messes, harrassing the drake, etc, when its really all that lazy drakes fault (draking is snoring at your feet while this is being told). Tillhill needs the reagents before his master sees that they are missing, but he needs to stay and clean up a mess made by the drake beofore his master notices, or something like that. Well, thats one example, one of the few that I can recall actually giving a damn about. its a totally trival thing, I know, but its stuff like that that keeps me coming back for more. the voice acting was great, the story got a chuckle outta me and I can't wait to see if later I can come back and exact revenge on that drake in a later quests. Stuff like that gives life to the game to me.<br />
<br />
I had many, many similar experiences with quests in WoW. One in particular is one where you fetch components to fix various &quot;walky talkies&quot; in the zone, whilest the quest giver gives you orders, and at the same time getting blitzed. be the end of the quest the real story comes to light why you have been &quot;fixing&quot; these machines and I must say that I was nearly on the floor laughing it was so hilarious. The quest quality was much higher than what iv'e seen so far in EQ2.<br />
<br />
I'm still playing EQ2 because despite the problems, the game is a heck of a lot more fun than EQLive is for me, neverminding the fact that my guild has all but complete diminished from members moving on to EQ2 or WoW. I've logged on several days and spent time dabling around in old zones or soloing PoJ because I haev nothing better to do. During those times, I've seen 3 people different people on in my guild. None of the leaders log on, most of the members haven't logged on for a month now. I only have eqlive going because I have the all access subscription. I think EQ2 has a lot of potential, moreso that WoW, which is completely unfounded, but thats just how I feel about it. WoW is a great game, its a total blast. You can definitely tell it was made by blizzard. thats said, I haven't spent any time with WoW post release. Things could have drasticly changed. I don't know, but I do know what i've experienced in EQ2. those are my biggest gripes. The game has a lot going for it, and thats what keeps me playing. None of thsoe problems are &quot;game breaking for me&quot; but it does make it very hard to justify continuing playing after christmas, when I know someone is going to buy WoW as a present for me. I want to make EQ2 work, but its trying so hard not to. EQ regardless is not an otion any more, unless MAJOR changes occur. Hell will freeze over before EQ turns a 180 for me.<br />
<br />
EQ2 and WoW hasn't killed EQ yet. EQ did it to itself. Only now are there very good alternatives that can really compete. Vangard will pull the rest of the hold outs that didn't like WoW or EQ2. EQ won't die, much like Ultima won't die. I don't not think we will ever see another Everquest again though. I think the genre has moved past that now. Ofcourse, I'm no expert on such things, just my personal speculation.<br />
<br />
EQ2 if you want more sadistic barriers to the way you really want to play.<br />
WoW if you can handle the guilty pleasure of finaly getting what you want out of an MMO.<br />
Vangard for &quot;The Vision&quot; fanbois. (I'm actually looking forward to seeing what those guys can churn out this time around.<br />
<br />
I really do hope the game pushes past the &quot;encouraged&quot; (read:forced) grouping thing EQ/EQ2 seems to love. i guy can always dream I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fuck are you talking about Frodlin? <br />
<br />
EQ is the game where SAM DA MAN DEATHWALKER flourished.  Don't fucking tell me that you need any sort of social interaction to accomplish anything in that game.  You don't need shit in EQ except for the ability to withstand massive amounts of bullshit and extreme XP torture, and you'll flourish just fucking fine.  No skill, no interaction, just lots of fucking time on your hands.<br />
<br />
However, the first time you come up against a dungeon boss in WoW, you realize that you're not in SoE land anymore.  Arugal spanked my group up one side and down the other the first time we fought him.  The fucker roots you, kites you around, and blinks across to other sides of the room to make you come to him.  You're not penalized for being smarter than the AI in WoW, the AI is busy trying to outsmart you.  Mobs in stealth mode hesistate to break their stealth, and want to sneak up on you.  Archers with a stun kick will knock your ass down and then back off to shoot you.  These are just behaviors I've seen in 35 levels for christ's sakes.  What did I do the entire time I did anything in EQ?  Autoattack, and hit the fucking fridge or watched TV.<br />
<br />
The VAST majority of people who play WoW will probably not appreciate the masterpiece that it is.  They're not capable of understanding what games in this genre haven't been providing.  I'm not going to dispute that.  But I honestly can't believe why you'd ever voluntarily play a game where downtime is forced down your fucking throat in every way, shape, and form possible after you've played WoW.  Don't try to tell me it's about intellect or social interaction when we both know it's bullshit, and the only thing keeping people in EQ at the moment is masichism.  Fine.  If you're tougher than me for playing EQ, then I'm a fucking pussy.</div></div><hr />

WoW would appeal to you just because you can thrive without a big time investment or without having to team up with people who you connect with on the same level as say... a bottle of glue.   Gerik, it's no secret that you have more conspiracy theories than Oliver Stone, so WoW would appeal to you.   <br />
<br />
There's some incredibly creative events in EQ, and WoW just doesn't match it in any way shape or form for the infrastructure, the intangibles, the social structure, or anything else.<br />
<br />
Furthermore &quot;Sam the Man&quot; is a pathetic 6-boxer who is not successful at all.  He has the best gear money can buy, great, had he been a little more social, he'd have been a lot more successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you obviously do not understand what 'outsmart' means if you think mobs in WoW have any intelligence at all.  If you ever get 'outsmarted' by a mob that didn't do something you didn't know about, you simply do not make very good decisions.<br />
<br />
They're just running scripts that amount to exactly the same as autoattack.  I know exactly what every kind of mob is going to do.  That 'clever' wizard that tried to root you and then run back and nuke will do that EVERY TIME.  After a while you realize that there is no way to stop them from doing it unless they started a Frost Bolt before Frost Nova (so you can interrupt, since Frost Nova is instant).  Now if you want to be really cute you can try to time a Gouge if you happen to be a rogue to negate the Frost Nova, but after a while you figure that it is exactly the same as that clever melee mob that uses its clever unresistable stun on you once per combat.  The end result is you end up taking an extra round of damage with absolutely nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
Oh and rogues don't hestitate to break stealth.  Mobs need about 1 second to go from unaggroed to attack mode, unlike EQ where it is instantaneous.  As a rogue I can walk straight up to something in the front while stealthed (so it sees me), and hit it with Cheap Shot before it can hit me to break my stealth because of this delay (not the smartest thing to do, of course, because I can mess up).  You can observe this very easily as a spellcaster.  Spam your fireball (or whatever nuke) hotkey and you'll see that the mob does not immediately turn toward you the moment your first nuke hits.  <br />
<br />
All WoW do is force you to push more buttons to replicate what you could've done in EQ while AFK.  Given that everyone's resist is essentially 0 since WoW is  obviously designed as a game where getting resist = significant tradeoffs, this means you will never be able to resist any special abilities unless you're higher level than the mob, and when you cannot resist their special abilities, that also means there is nothing you can do about them and just shrug them off as extra ways to take damage.  Every random melee mob in this game has some random special abilities and I can see it coming but it's not even worth the effort to try to stop it (and indeed most of them you can't even stop) because you'll just get it 5 seconds later.<br />
<br />
In the Argual example you mentioned, he will ALWAYS charm someone at a certain time (when his ability refreshes/is triggered).  He will ALWAYS blink when certain criterias are met.  There is no strategy here because you cannot stop him from doing any of that.  Now it might help if you don't position everyone in a position that blinking would cause you to chase him for a long path, but other than that there is no point to his abilities.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Uhhh huh... tell me for someone who has not made it to the end game how the heck do you know about the time investment for the game? shit ramps up you are quite aware I am sure, its the frog in the pot method with which the heat can keep going up but the person will not take notice.<br />
<br />
Connect with people? you mean where you start off as a newbie and get as far as you can in a family guild, pulling just enough off them to meet the requirements for a big guild and toss them off like scum? yeah I am sure all that armor they invested in their main tank, and those aggro weapons are doing them alot of good with you switching to the only large guild that would pick you up... connect with 72 people? bullshit no way you could be the friend of that many, the only reason you even hang out togeather is out of mutual need... I would MUCH rather get friends because they are people I like, rather than just powerful... maybe me and haass are not emotional gimps, maybe we put value in people and say fuck the rest?<br />
<br />
&quot;Incredibly creative events&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmm you mean the same 4 tricks re-hashed over and over again?<br />
<br />
Waves of monsters<br />
spawn cycle/kill order<br />
follow an NPC that pisses stuff off<br />
impossible stuff to kill, that finally dies due to an exploit and gets removed from the game, or gimped down into a real fight.<br />
<br />
The AI in eq is very limited, they can not manage to make a ranger monster fight like a ranger, or a druid fight like a druid, they just arange a simple script that makes them follow, so lazy infact that they teleport when they get themselves stuck, so lazy infact that they don't even pick priority cases, such as curing a root instead of CHing the monster with the fuckton of HP's that about to die...<br />
<br />
If what haass says is true about the monsters trying to find your weaknesses and exploit them (such as casters making you a sitting target, or hunters, so they can kite you)<br />
<br />
Frod, what I think of the government has little mater here... it does not take a PH D in bullshit to see it, frankly I think you are highly defensive and VERY wrong to say everyone who goes to the other games are lacking social skills or don't want to invest time.<br />
<br />
I mean holy hell, my old DM had more creativity in his little finger than some of these new &quot;events&quot; all that changes is where they take place... frankly I miss stuff like the ring wars as that was the last thing that made me go &quot;holy hell&quot;<br />
<br />
Phant to be fair about AI being all scripts, thats what they are... there is no real way to make real intelligance for them in that they will be aggressive instead of reacting to player movements... I know a bit about this because I tried to set up archer, magic and melee scripts in morrowind to make rival bands of adventures that would try to do you in, its alot harder than you think and if they even come close to creating a weakness and then taking advantage of it then it is a mark above everquest, which always falls back on some stupid AoE debuff to make a weakness and kill players, who normally avoid it with a wall and then kick its ass.<br />
<br />
Anyway once I can buy WoW I will let you know if it was a stupid choice, and if it was I will then try EQ2, I am willing to try the blizzard product first having just come from a sony sized rape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If any humanoid beings are meant to have intelligence no one would ever be able to win anything in any MMORPG.  All the enemies will swarm over people who can heal first, every time.  This is common sense.<br />
<br />
The behavior that you confuse for intelligence is just another way of adding some extra damage to a mob, and even more damage if you as a player somehow fail to see through it.  That incredible intelligence you talk about that casters use in WoW is what allows me to kill a caster 2 levels higher than me while not losing any health because it always tries to cast the same nuke that I interrupt every single time.  <br />
<br />
EQ developers are aware of the fact that they're not going to outsmart players by putting in some dumb gimmicks.  Every event in EQ ultimately boils down to raw power in terms of what a mob can do.  That's why they're challenging, because you can't avoid raw DPS the same way you can avoid stupid gimmicks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, again I agree with Haas. I don't like grouping with dipshits all day, I would solo every chance I got on EQ. I could honest-to-god two box a cleric better than 90% of the ones I had ever grouped with in my five years playing. The funniest part about it was that it wasn't even my cleric, I just borrowed one and used EQW.<br />
<br />
When I want to interact with people I sit down and raid for six hours, not log in, LFG for an hour then get in some group full of random retards. Every so often I would go get together with friends and go one group some old content, but if you actually step back and look at EQ1, the whole fucking game is one big time sink where you grind out endless levels for trivial upgrades. <br />
<br />
This whole &quot;WoW leveling sucks&quot; business is getting old, you know what? Blizzard figured out that people do not want to sit at their comps and level for a year before they actually get the play the game. They've even said the leveling process is fast just so people can get to 60 and explore the game - yes, that implies that the game does have level 60 content whether you realize it or not. <br />
<br />
No game should every force you to group. If I want to group I'll go fucking shout &quot;LFG&quot; for an hour, if I don't want to deal with endless corpse runs because morons can't play their classes, I'll go solo. It's not a hard concept.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to touch on the WoW UI because Haas hit the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
Just keep on bashing the game without even playing it if it makes you feel better about paying to get force fed shitty content. I'm glad everyone can form an air tight opinion just by stess testing for two weeks.<br />

I think the word exploit answer your own question there.<br />
<br />
Whereas in WoW it'd be exploting if you don't know how to avoid the stuff they throw at you.  Then again, since your ability to resist any ability from a mob at least as high as you is 0, it's not like you can ever do anything about a special ability unless it's one of the few rare ones that isn't instantly cast.</div></div><hr />

How about this then, the point is Blizzard is atleast making a pretty damn good effort to deliver something different for it's players, where as Sony just rehashes the same old shit. &quot;Dewd, omfgz a 400hp breastplate?!?!&quot;, apparently all you have to do is add 100hp to every armor piece every expansion, make the players jump through more retarded hoops to sell some shitty half finished content now-a-day. Heaven forbid you should actually make it feel like people are actually part of a RPG game.<br />
<br />
Maybe if Sony would get off the ph4t l3wtz train and realize that all people actually want a good storyline, some different looking graphics (not the same shit armor for four expansions) and some clickies, they wouldn't be losing half of their playerbase right now. <br />
<br />
I like how they used to run the whole &quot;we need ten bucks a month to pay the GMs&quot; gimmick, what fucking GMs? Their automated piece of shit transfer service took two months to move one character that I paid them seventy-five dollars to do. <br />
<br />
When I give blizzard my money I feel like I'm getting something in return, maybe I should just have people get in a line and charge them ten dollars each to get kicked in the balls. Atleast I would be rich right now by Sony's standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Storyline?  Take the four types of LDoN missions and replace say 'grand vampire blah' with 'evil human guy (if you're horde) or evil horde guy (for alliance)' and you have WoW's vaunted quest system.  Or maybe people never read LDoN's adventure dialogs, which is roughly as deep as WoW's quest dialogues, but minus the phat lewt.  <br />
<br />
The fact that you're obviously getting some really nice phat lewt from quests doesn't change the fact that 95% of all WoW quests are basically the same as LDoN adventures with names substituted and maybe a few lines of extra text.  BTW, WoW's item also follows the exact 'previous uber loot + 1' thing.  Just look at what item drop in the game sometimes.  The difference is that you get your uber loot much earlier compare to EQ because the game is very item oriented.  While in EQ it is possible to get away with medicore loot (due to the heavy emphasis on grouping) it'd not be possible to play this game with no gear (equivalent of poor gear in EQ since gear is way more common) unless you're content being afk in a group setting permanently, assuming people actually group.  Given the game's heavy emphasis on soloing, lack of items is simply not tolerable because you would not be able to solo anything, so the game rewards you with far more items than EQ.  There isn't anything particularly wrong with this model.  We all love getting our next uber + 1 toy, and WoW arguably uses this more than EQ.<br />
<br />
Once in a while you get some interesting quests, but those aren't really the norm.  I guess the first 'make some evil potion and poison some guys' quest was fun, but after the third time it's like a rerun... get some more potions... it'll kill some more people and lead Lady Sylvannas to victory, the same way all 5000 other guys did.  It's especially funny to find who you're supposed to poison is still dead from the last poison even though such mobs usually respawn in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
And frankly EQ's DBZ style story (newer more uber guys than the last expansion are here) makes more sense than how treehugging Taurens are asking Forsaken to er, spread a plague on the land to get rid of their opposition (oh I'm sorry, the Tauren didn't know that's what Forsaken were doing in their Apothecary.  No doubt Forsaken was making stuff that makes trees grow faster), or the fact that the entire world of Azeroth just fought from the brink of extinction with an all powerful Lich King commanding a swarm of undead threatening to kill everyone who survived, and despite all this they're happily back to killing each other again.  Last time I checked, even real human beings who are usually known to be stupid warmongers who can't learn from their previous mistakes aren't as bad as these guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN compaired to WoW? with out even playing it I can tell you one fucking thing, at least it isn't 4 damn rooms repeated over and over again for each theme, plus a book case here and there.<br />
<br />
Fuck sake, I can make better looking &quot;zones&quot; with the sims build mode.<br />
<br />
On the outside looking in I see that in WoW you solo with quests to get as far as you can and get the gear for a good group, level and then finish more quests, rinse repeat until they implement raiding in a way they see fit.<br />
<br />
In everquest its group, fight over loot, get as far as you can and join a guild, raid with that guild to get strong enough for new experiance zones, get more AA's and fight over more loot as far as you can, move to a bigger guild.<br />
<br />
I don't like guild jumping, maybe thats why I have not liked EQ these days, but I can say it was smart of them to put most of the gear you get into quests that you do alone, or with someone else so you both score rewards... I think loot and the fights over it cause most of the problems and drama in any social game.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I may be wrong as I have really had not heard anything on raiding in Wow, but I hear EQ2 has alot of 1 week waiting periods between attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron I'm not talking about quest storyline sir, I'm talking about game storyline. So fucking what, you used an example of one quest, maybe we should compare WoW quests to EQ quests, since I would say only about 1/10 EQ quests in the game are worth actually doing, let alone god knows if they have any actual storyline past kunark.<br />
<br />
I don't expect them to fill the game with completely unique quests, but atleast I'm slaying dragons, demons, and mythological creatures, which you stopped doing in EQ past the second expansion. I want to play a fantasy game for fantasy content, not to fight gorillas, little green aliens and other various farm animals on the moon or from dimention-X. <br />
<br />
Obviously any games loot system is going to be the same, you have to have the items progressively get better or how else will you improve your character, but does does EQ offer anything else other than loot? <br />
<br />
And since when does simpler automaticly mean worse? I would rather play most super nintendo games over the hyped up bullshit they make these days. Which would you rather play? Super castlevania or the 3d piece of shit one the 64?<br />
<br />
All Sony had to two to keep EQ1 going was make a fucking effort, that's all anyone asked. Instead they decided to piss on our better judgement by not even trying, maybe if people would stop buying their shitty products they couldn't get away with producing them. I wonder if it's a coincidence that OoW was their best expansion in years considering WoW was in beta testing around the time it came out. About time someone lit a fire under their asses... too bad it's going to burn the whole fucking building down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All types of folks in EQ and the new games.The company you keep and how you keep it will probably go a long way in determining what you get out of them.EQ can be a bit tough.I think running 50-72 man raids in large guilds is a lot to ask of gamers playing for fun.Long term it's pretty challenging.Smaller guilds in the games to come is the way to go imo.How they will put this into practice I'm not sure,but, I hope they do so without too much artificial intrusion.EQ's biggest challenge in all aspects of the game is the social one.It's also EQ's biggest payback.</div></div><hr />

I could give 2 shits about &quot;watching everyone progress as a team&quot;. Maybe I'm this wierd sociopath, but I play because I want to have fun, not watch someone else have fun. Hey, everyone has their cup o' tea, lets just not assume that everyone feels the same way you do.<br />
<br />
Think EQ is great, go right ahead. Some of us are just trying to open some eyes to others that there are great alternative MMOs to play now.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but about the quests. I gotta give the ribbon to WoW on this one.<br />
<br />
WoW seems like it will become more PvP oriented, something that I've failed to mention that does appeal to me at all. WoW levels so quickly because they know that to PvP you gotta be max level. They made loot easier to come by becuase I imagine you're going to need a lot of it to compete in different situations. it was that was in SWG, I expect it to be the same in WoW. Gear for each type of encounter that you can expect to face. A lot of player don't have a lot of time to invest in grinding a character to max level just so they can play the game that they want to play, PvP. I imagine a lot of the decisions that were made had this in mind.<br />
<br />
EQ2 seems like a baby EQ luclin/pop era. Soloing was dying, while grouping kept getting *encouraged*. every minor quest was an epic endevour, and long time LFG are the norm. The difference in encounter types in EQ2 reminds me of playing in EQ clasic, which represents the solo encounters in EQ2, and group encounters are like Luclin/PoP, they have stupid ammounts of hitpoints, and players have no way possible of keepping up with group encounters.<br />
<br />
They tried to do something different with EQ2 by using the encounter system, they could tune an encounter to be solo or group. They could then specify how hard they want the encounter to spawn, and then the number of mobs in the encounter. Most of the time you see 1 ^^ mob wandering around, other times you see 2 ^ mobs, or 4 -- and 1 ^. the number of mobs change, but the over all DPS and hitpoints remains the same for the encounter. They are equivalent. on the surface it seems like they really tried to vary things to spice it up, but really all you get is the same ol' vanilla. its a nifty idea onthe surface, but really it just adds more overhead with all the pathing data that has to be rendered and transfered. Tanks have an encounter taunt that they can use that totally trivializes this otherwise healer agro nightmare, which in turn makes CC almost completely unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Ok, enough EQ2 details. EQ2 is different that EQ, but its more like a streamlined EQ classic than brand new. WoW had dropped a lot of the things that make people unhappy playing MMOs, mainly downtime and forces grouping, and said we can do better. IMO WoW has the edge right now in pure gameplay, but for PvE fans, I've still got cards on EQ2. So far the Devs have been very responsive to issues, and really take play suggestions as make them work. For instance, tradeksillers wanted to at least be able to sell and craft at the same time, since there's no offline trading. Next patch is supposed to bring tradermode while tradeskilling to live I believe. thats feedback after 1 month. I'm hoping that this is an indication that htey are listening.<br />
<br />
Whereas, how long have the class correspondent issues been unresolved?... yeah, I know, you guys got your halfass backflaging solution finally, on a 2 year old expansion. You still have people asking for VT access with no solutions. You got a new VP that adds more timesink keying. And finally, dum da dum, they decided that when the players asked to add new content off of old zones, like Solc, means totally revamping pefectly good zones like MM and Paw. Yeah, I'm so glad I stayed...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody wants to group with an idiot who never communicates, runs ahead and aggros mobs early, goes afk for extended periods of time, doesn't heal.... oh wait, I've grouped with a lot of those types of people in EQ because the game requires me to have a slower and healer if I want to tank anything WoS+.  <br />
<br />
It's true you can solo a good portion of WoW (I prefer to group with my friends), but good items will require raids and PvP battlegrounds will require social networking with your faction.<br />
<br />
You say that WoW doesn't match EQ's social structure and inticracy, but WoW has been out for a month and EQ has been out for 5+ years.<br />
<br />
And yes, WoW's instanced quests remind me a little bit of LDoN, but unlike SoE, Blizzard actually gives the impression that they'll continue to evolve these instances.  Where's LDoN?  Dead, with absolutely no mention of IF it's going to be revived.<br />
<br />
I sent many feedbacks to SoE about spicing up the overall game but that was months ago and they never listen.  I'm down to one account and I'm enjoying the raid scene, but I'm not logging in every day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Intangibles?  You mean like when my character Parries, HIS FUCKING SWORD ACTUALLY COMES UP AND MEETS THE MOB'S WEAPON?<br />
<br />
When you say things like this, it makes me believe that you're pretty much grasping for straws at reasons not to like the game.  That's fine and all, but at least come out and fuckin say it.  You enjoy being part of a 70 man raid more than you like actually being a productive member of an encounter.   There may have been some creative events in EQ, but I played EQ for 5 fucking years and I can count on a redneck's hand how many events I actually saw where I had to pay attention.  I've been playing WoW for a month and I've had to put more thought into the 35% of the game that I've seen than I ever did with EQ.  If I need to find 55 of my closest friends to find creativity in EQ, then I don't believe it's there.<br />
<br />
You don't like the community in WoW?  Turn off fucking chat.  That's what I did.  I've got World + Local Defense on, and I go and beat down the goddamned alliance when it's convenient.  Other than that, everyone else can lick my sack just like everyone else in EQ could.  There's zero goddamned difference.  Just because your social organization was forced to have 100+ people in EQ doesn't mean that there is a lack of said structure in any other game who realizes that system is fucking retarded.</div></div><hr />

It's another way of saying playing nice with others .It's fun to work with folks and see their characters grow.It's also a way to have fun sharing the game with other players.Why play with other people at all if you don't want to interact with them?You could play a solo game and not have to put up with any crowding.Either you want to play with them to some extent  for mutual benefit and enjoyment or you want to beat them at something.Either pvp or er magelo comparison?<br />
<br />
Everyones' cup of tea is certainly different.Raiding 7 nights a week would pop my head like a zit.Just like I've grown to enjoy some moderate raiding.you may only enjoy grouping.Though,one day you may find good people and see that big dragon around the corner...<br />
<br />
Course you could 6 box and see some stuff alone.I guess if thats your thing.I don't see a lot of reward in it tho.Gets tiring playing a game like these by yourself.The whole point is to play with other folks hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. I'll rip through a single player game in a week, tops, always have always will. Game developer don't put near as much content in single player game compared to even the shittiest MMO.<br />
<br />
2. I like to develop a character in a world that exists outside my computer. When my hard drive trashes, after I reinstall, i come back to the same game that I was when I left.<br />
<br />
3. Shit happens in MMOs wihtout my input. I like that, it gives off this whole persistant world vibe, wonder where I heard those words before...<br />
<br />
4. I do like to play with others, and do so quite well. I don't like having to depend on other player every time my character needs to take a piss.<br />
<br />
5. MMOs are generally more challenging than the single player counter parts, and not always in a masocistic sense. The games are tough, and which makes the rewards much more sweet.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to do a point by point arguement thats been rehashed a million times over before on hundreds of threads. No, the whole point to MMOs is not play with others. The point is to complete the game's objectives of exploration in a fantasy setting based on familair themes. That means progression from area to area, uber loot to uber loot, boss to boss. you never reach the end because there's constantly stuff being added at the end to push you further away to have &quot;beaten&quot; the game. You should know this.<br />
<br />
Its a treadmill that I usually find fun and challenging pushing my character to new heights ever time I log in. It has nothing to do with helping you or random_idiot_01 get his next level/aa/phat l33ts.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I did the pirate themed instance off of deadmines? That was some of the most fun I've ever had playing an MMO ever. I'm not too sure baout replayability, but it was sure was a thrill working through that instance up to the captain dude, who had plenty of tricks up his sleeves. Sure after the first time or 2 going through you'd probably have everything down, but before you've had time to learn the scripts it sure is a blast. So, I have to agree with Haass, WoW did instances the way they should have been done. Sparce, epic, and action packed. LDoN should have been done this way, but instead they wanted to make it a grinds with cut and paste zones. I don't know why they could have just added new camps to the old zones to spruce them up and add NPC objectives for points instead of making people constant search for a group, run inot a zone away from the rest of the population, and grind boring, low xp mobs for pointsa to get what you really wanted. EQ got the camp thing right, the /ooc chat made it almost bearable, and the mindless combat made it just a matter of auto-attack to ding. EQ worked because the players made a mechanic, camps, that made the game bearable by socializing and goofing off, while they converted time into xp by pressing &quot;a&quot; and seeing who could come up with the silliest /emotes while they are &quot;fighting&quot;.<br />
<br />
In some ways I kind of agree with that model, the xp camps, as it really help make the game feel more alive. If there's only one thing that I do kinda miss that seems to be a constant in the newer games is that your too busy pressing buttons to be able to really chat and goof off. I first noticed in CoH and then WoW and now EQ, they all have the same &quot;problem&quot; that socializing is hinder very much by combat. Considering that many people play to socialize, or that &quot;go team go&quot; effort, I'm surprised to see that EQ2 is this way. I guess thats why EQ2 still has an auto-attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because I hate pickup anything and I would rather solo doesn't mean I didn't have any friends on EQ. Actually most of our guild EQ friends just formed our own serverwide channel and the six to ten of us still play WoW together after multiple years of gaming, server transfers and guild splitting. <br />
<br />
You can pretty much be social in any game with a chat system, hell for most people all MMoRGs represent are glorified chat systems. People meet on MMoRGs, date in real life and get married if you can imagine, I've known a few. Last time I checked all three games, EQ, EQ2 and WoW have chat systems, so how is that a deciding factor at all?<br />

<br />
I never suggested you couldn't socialize in the other games.The biggest draw the new games have for me is some of my friends that went over and the new stuff I could see with them.You can play for any reason you like Vikken.Theres nothing wrong with exploring stuff on your own or with a buddy.I wasn't putting down EQ2 or WOW in my last few posts Daeos.The reasons I prefer EQ have nothing to do with socializing.I find EQ2 and WOW kinda crass and busy.Less immersive and and kinda dumbed down.My experience is limited tho.Only played in the betas and not a lot of that.I'm tempted at times to play them just to go see new stuff.<br />
<br />
My point was  that  some folks miss the best part.Playing with a group of other people over time can be pretty kewl.It's what elevated these type's of games over others for me.Yeah you could just chat in game.You can do that without playing with people tho.You can play forvever in your own little world but it's limiting.These games allow for more,but, you don't have to stretch yourself if you don't want to hehe.It's just a major reason why people got frustrated in EQ and probably will again in new games of this type.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because grouping makes the game even more trivial to the point half of the group could be afk.  If you have at least 2 people in a group, you can pretty much do any quest, even elite ones.  We know from EQ people are wimps and will take the easiest way out, even if that means being counterproductive.<br />
<br />
Of course you are welcome to have illusions that people like to group because it is useful.  The truth is that you group because then your chance of failure is 0 outside of actively trying to commit suicide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you find WoW to be challenging you either actively seek out incompetent players to group with, have no clue how to play MMORPG in general, or you enjoy being slapped by the game's artificial 4+ barrier.  I can't even remember the last time I did an elite quest or an instance where someone actually healed me, and half of the time we don't even have a healer in the group because the game is that easy, not that it matters since people don't heal you anyway.</div></div><hr />

I suppose leveling to 60 in EQ is so much harder than leveling in WoW, other than the game forced you into grouping. The only hard part about EQ leveling was actually having the patience to sit there and grind out (at the same spot I remind you) for hours on end with almost no chance of dying what-so-ever unless someone fucked the pull up so bad you couldn't CC all the adds. <br />
<br />
I haven't even touched on the EQ raid size. Do you even realize that 75% of the people are most likely watching TV the entire time or afk? I played EQ for five years, made it to time, made it to Uqua (way before OoW was due out) and all I had to do to get loot was show up, raid six to nine hours a day and hit my assist key. That's sure tough work in comparasin to actually having to pay attention where you might actually die if you don't. <br />
<br />
It's honestly mind boggling why you people even care. If you don't want play WoW, then don't play WoW, but I don't see how you have any business debating how good a game is based on one or two weeks of play. How the hell can you bash a game when a majority of the population isn't even max level yet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're starting the zerg tactics already, eh Phantron?<br />
<br />
Didn't do RFK at level 32 then, I'm assuming?<br />
<br />
Charla Razormane was a solid 5 minute fight with 3 people.  Sorry that you didn't make it past level 5 when heals weren't necessary.  Too bad you're judging the game based upon Goldshire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The average elite mob lasts about 20 seconds if you bring at all reasonable DPS to it (i.e. 5 guys and at least half of the group isn't afk).  With cheap shot and kidney shot, that's roughly half of the time you don't have to take any damage.  Add 1 second from a charge, that's how you can kill anything elite without heals.  A rogue can solo an elite mob of the same level if you use all the tools available.  Put 4 other people together and call this a total of 3X DPS of an average rogue, and you get you can kill 3 elite mobs before a rogue would need to be healed (that's not even counting the fact that there are other classes that can take damage too)... which is roughly the size of a pull assuming you're not actively seeking death.  Since if you're not roughly the same level as the average elite trash of an instance you'd be utterly incapable of hurt the boss due to the way levels work in instances, I do not think it is unreasonable to assume all 5 people in your party are at least the same level as the trash.  Now, I'm aware people like to pretend their skill has anything to do with killing a 4+ elite boss that they can't touch (unless you're a rogue since rogue abilities do straight damage so is only subject to AC).  The game is easy enough that you can still somehow stare down a boss even if you're utterly incapable of hurting it in a meaningful way.<br />
<br />
WoW is not a hard game.  There is nothing to be proud of to be good at this game.  Being able to succeed at difficult things might not be your cup of tea, and it certainly isn't the kind of player WoW tries to cater to begin with, but stop acting like you're somehow liberated from your previous MMORPG shackles and now able to show the world your skills.  I'm still baffled at how people can be NOT good at WoW given how easy it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
fundamentally WoW is not a hard game but it can be if you make it. really, I think the lower challenge and similar progression at most levels is compensated by the fact that you can rock ass in a lot of areas with 5 warriors, bandages, and food.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, actually I assume you don't play the game since you haven't actually mentioned that you have played the game in any of your posts in this thread. Quit feeding me bullshit and just tell me what you've done, I'm sure if you had a level 60 in Beta you would've said so by now, therefore I assume you're full of it.<br />
<br />
Phantron, I know how long it takes to kill a mob in WoW sir, I understand the game mechanics perfectly fine, the fact of the matter is you basicly addressed none of my post and went off on your own little tangent about your little experience with very little detail, if any at all.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll quit with all the fancy talk since you can't read between the lines and just strait up ask you these questions:<br />
<br />
- How much did you actually play the WoW and what instances did you attempt at what level? <br />
<br />
- Do you actually think leveling in EQ is that much harder than leveling in WoW?<br />
<br />
- Do you even consider EQ hard work at all? You sure like to talk about how hard EQ is, but honestly how much time have you just spent sitting in a spot grinding out exp, AA and flags?<br />
<br />
These were all arguments clearly stated in my last post, yet somehow you totally missed the mark and addressed none of them. You told me about an instance you did most likely that was pre level thirty even, using almost little or no facts other than &quot;assume the mobs are this level&quot; and &quot;assume the players in your group are that level&quot;. What the hell are you actually talking about? Why don't you just come out and say, &quot;I did the ragefire instance at level 15 and it was easy, therefore...&quot; and finish with your point?<br />
<br />
You can't just counter my argument by ignoring every single point I've made and telling me a bunch of random shit stats, then expect me to bow down before your intense knowledge of the game.</div></div><hr />

I quit EQ when there was no longer enough people to raid with my &quot;raiding&quot; guild more than twice a week and went from doing Uqua to VT. Shit, I was doing VT years ago, why would I want to go back? This was even after already movelogging once because there was no more US raiding guilds on my first server. My only options were to learn French or Japanese if I wanted to continue doing PoTime + content.<br />
<br />
Don't act like such a big man because you're still playing EQ (I assume). I stayed with every single guild I was in until it was no longer possible to accomplish anything with them before switching. If you want to keep playing, then by all means do so if it brings you enjoyment, but if you're going to add your two-cents acting all high and mighty for it in a thread that's already full of raging arguments, then expect some reprecussions.<br />

I have played just about every other mmorpg out there for a few months to a year or so.  EQ1 was always my main game.<br />
<br />
I'm not anti-SOE and I'm not Pro-Blizzard.  They are both companies out for the bottom line, money.  We all know that.  You either play their game or you don't.  Bitching about one company over another is just stupid.  Don't like it? Don't play.<br />
<br />
That being said, I bought both WoW and EQ2.  Had to check them both out, I'd heard so many good and bad things about them.<br />
<br />
I had a little fun playing WoW, but I doubt I'll continue my subscription after the free month.  I took 1 of every class to 10 or 15ish.  I think I gave it a fair shot.  It just seems childish, the cartoon graphics, the mega-regen, the exclamation points to tell you who to go talk to and who to ignore... it just felt like I was going through the motions.. clear the quests out of town a, move to town b, rinse repeat.. *yawn*  I felt like I was playing some kid's nintendo game.  It is some fun however, I'm not totally trying to trash it.  It ran flawlessly on my average system, not a hiccup of stutter or lag at all.  It's nice when I need an arcade style fix, but as a serious hobby to sink time into like I did in EQ1?  Not even close.  It just doesn't seem intelligent or &quot;real&quot; enough for me to take it seriously long-term.<br />
<br />
EQ2 I can't say enough about.  I love every bit of it.  It's fun, absolutley amazing graphics, blah blah you heard that before.  Is it perfect?  Of course it isn't, nothing will ever please everyone.  I admit EQ2 is not for everyone.  In the city zones, or after I have zoned a couple times, it lags like a #&amp;$^ and I have to close the game and restart if I even want to move.  That's about my only gripe, and I'm playing at minimum ram, once I max my ram out it should improve this.  Yet, I still continue to play it.  I have fun everytime I log on.<br />
<br />
Anyways after many years in EQ1 and a sampling of pretty much all other mmorpg's, EQ2 is the clear winner for me.  It's not even a competition.  I haven't logged on to EQ1 since I bought EQ2 (little over a month) and I was a daily player of EQ1.  I may or may not keep my WoW account.  It is fun.. sorta..  I'm kinda shocked at all the hype over it, I was expecting it to be much better.<br />
<br />
I think this is the beginning of the end for EQ1, however.  I don't think any 1 game is gonna kill it, just the combination of all of them.  It's got a few years left in it, I think.  They'll milk it till it runs dry.. why not?  It's good money.<br />
<br />
There's probably about 1.5 billion messages across the web just like this one.. so ignore it if you want.. I don't care, I'm just killing time at work, thought I'd give the trolls another little tidbit to chew on and spit back out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ is a hard game is supported by all the post that says 'well I could've done blah blah but I didn't because of blah blah', which is a different way to say 'this was too hard and I can't do it.'  If EQ is so easy as people say, then the only conclusion is that most people (and certainly the posters) somehow suck at playing MMORPG because it is well known that the uber population on every server represents a small portion of the actual players.  <br />
<br />
Is any aspect of EQ particularly hard?  Probably not, but EQ is not about individual heroics.  Encounters are hard for relative to a group of people, not the individuals.  Presumably my guild can still win anything they have won before if I never play again, but this doesn't mean I somehow do not matter.  While you do not need a raid of super players to win any encounter, good luck trying to win a cutting-edge encounter with even 1/5th of your raid making mistakes that they shouldn't be.  The death count in LDoN raids is a good example of the kind of difficulty that exists in EQ.  You're allotted X total mistakes and you can't exceed that quota, and back when LDoN raids are hard, at some point you have to stop say and okay how can everyone play better to eliminate 3 deaths so we can get to the end.  When you win, while it may not be because Joe Warrior single handedly saved the raid, you know it is everyone's effort that shaved off an extra 3 deaths so you can get to the end.  Now LDoN raids aren't remotely worth the RvR but from a challenge point of view, they're probably the most challenging events relative to their time.<br />
<br />
This kind of challenge is currently nonexistent in WoW, which is not surprising seeing it is designed to cater to the average gamer.  What happens if your group wipe in an instance?  You can run back.  I was talking to a friend and he was saying how it was surprising how they wiped in Uldaman.  People play WoW and expect to win, and indeed they are correct to assume this.  Outside of getting slapped by the 4+ barrier, the average group can be pretty confident they will prevail.  This is because everything is easy in WoW.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I am really tired of the false tales of heroics and redemption, how all these great guys must have been snubbed by EQ all these years finally are given a chance.  The fact is that anything you can eventually beat is also beatable by the average 'BNet kiddie' (which is a better player than most people give them credit for).  You may think you are uber, or skilled, or something in WoW, but so is everyone else, so really you are not.  You're doing the equivalent of congratulating yourself for a well job done for killing Diablo in Diablo 2, something that was done by at least another million players in the world.  Now, maybe winning is a cause for celebration, but it certainly isn't as heroic as people make it sound to be.<br />
<br />
Like it or not EQ is challenging.  That's why raiders and ubers exist.  WoW is not, and I don't know why people want to believe it is.</div></div><hr />

Many of us were only stopped by our feelings for our true friends and not wanting to leave them behind or gut our former guild in order to keep progressing, it was not that we did not or could not, it was that we had loyalty, respect and compassion for those that helped us along in the first place, we had the true connections that you all speak so much BULLSHIT about, because honestly I can say most of you use people, I am glad you like being a leech but don't throw stones bud, at least I have made some real friends that are more important to me than hitting the endgame, every part of a good game should be fun, not just the last level.<br />

Being a raider is not hard, all you need to do is be willing to act cut throat and march in line, the only people that can say it is hard work is the raid leaders and the people that play clerk and watch your DKP system, don't tell me being a raider makes you some sort of hyper intelligent being.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You weren't cut out to be an uber.  Most people are not, because otherwise that word wouldn't even make sense.  The end.  Now you'll probably tell me me being an uber (I obviously fall under the uber camp) doesn't mean anything, that it's just a game and a whole host of other things.  You'd be correct to say this, and I would have to ask why do you cry over not being a member of this meaningless 'uber' status?<br />

Anyone can read a screenplay and tell if it is shit, just like I can load up any spoiler site and say to myself &quot;they have got to be fucking kidding me&quot;<br />

<br />
So as we are clear, I have seen just about everything expect for the few zones that require an army, and even a few of those with pickup raiding...

I am glad they finally got around to putting some fun stuff to do in EQ.  Pity they put it behind their &quot;end game&quot; where only the social butterfly's, such as yourself, or those tolerant of such an environment we're able to enjoy it.  If you call sitting your duff waiting for a spawn to pop so you can get your carrot or mindless grinding exp skill, you are in the right game playing EQ. <br />

<br />
Actually, I have to say EQ wasn't always a cake walk, I admit I was there from the first grummus, the first of all the elemental gods, the first quarm experience until the last of all of those, but it usually just came down to not fucking up. Pray Xegony doesn't one round your MT, don't fuck up the CH rotation, don't fuck up the CC (for the what, 20 min fight?) and you win. <br />
<br />
All I'm saying, I felt like a robot every EQ raid, there's a extra mob in camp, tank it, otherwise hit my assist key for six hours strait. We were talking about pre-raid content if I remember right, seeing as no one has raided anything in WoW yet unless someone actually did Onyxia. <br />
<br />
- Why are you tryng to compare EQ raids to WoW single group exping? <br />
<br />
- Phantron do you realize that no one has actually been able to do a WoW raid yet?<br />
<br />
Besides that, WoW offers more than game xx hours for xx loot, the zones are interesting enough to explore. War torn zones, look desolate, grey and barren, dungeons look like dungeons, plains look like plains, undead cities look corrupt and my personal avatars (which is usually the basis of any RPG) don't look like clones of level 10s when I'm level 60.<br />
<br />
Again it seems you dodged a majority of my last post Phantron, I don't have any &quot;my friends was uber, but I wasn't&quot; or &quot;I was too lazy to be uber&quot; bullshit, I was in the top US/Euro guild on my server, only a close second to a all French guild, I had 90% attendance until I started College and I was there for every PoP learning experience. <br />
<br />
You talk as if you're the only person who's even past PoTime here, but that's nothing special. Yes I did look at your Magelo, and I can tell you raid a lot, but you only have 2k more hp than I did (I was a SK) two expansions after I quit, I can imagine I woul be par with you if I still played. Unfortunately I can't relate to completeing GoD because I was sick of Sony's bullshit by then so I wasn't around to even try. It wasn't laziness or lack of skill, I just was sick of the game and quit when my guild couldn't get the attendance to raid.</div></div><hr />

From what I've seen of the non-raid content in WoW I cant wait to see their raiding.  I'm sure it wont be that much different than EQ's &quot;content&quot; but I bet I'll enjoy the hell out of it way more than I ever did in EQ (and I had some great times on EQ raids).  At the very least, WoW doesnt force you to play with a raid group inorder to do anything beyond leveling.  Thats a big fucking improvment in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once I get my copy of WoW, you can damn well bet I will try to get in... the concept of a monster flying around and air raiding sounds just to good to me.<br />
<br />
It kinda reminds me of the sleeper going nuts and supposidly raiding all of velious before depoping.</div></div><hr />

You have got to be kidding me... <br />
<br />
1. Hey &quot;Allakhazam expert&quot;... you have no damn notion of what these encounters are like by reading your comrade newbies commenting on them via Allakhazam forums where the topics revolve around &quot;Clearly monk loot&quot;, and &quot;I wonder if Kerafyrm is involved&quot; on every single post.  <br />
<br />
2. Son, you have not earned the right to say 'you've got to be fucking kidding me' about any raid encounter in EQ.   Acting as though you know what any of them involves or are created is, while clearly humorous, about the same as getting sex advice from Stifler's little brother.<br />
<br />
3.  You know less about OOW/GoD lore than you do about raid encounters, so you really should quit while you're ahead.  Mob models do not equal Lore, but even if they do... YOU PLAY A FUCKING CAT WHO IS HOLDING SWORDS... therefore your advice on 'purist fantasy settings' is let's just say 'missing a bit'.<br />
<br />
4. You claim you tried to 'write an encounter' with the Morrowind Constuction set... ROFL how's that going anyhow?   Is it a loot trail leading to the mudcrab?  That's how every post you've written on these forums describes your 'perfect game'.  I would love to see your idea of &quot;creative encounter design&quot; and compare it against a master like Prathun.</div></div><hr />

Giant fucking cats with fucking swords, come from AD&amp;D FR's so kiss my ass on race choice ok bud? monster races, including gnolls for fuck sake, have been around since the first baby steps of fantasy, some of us have bigger imaginations than pointy fucking ears or midgets.<br />

Oh I know, your experiance with fantasy is limited to your 9th grade reading list! far be it for me to speak down on such a fucking lore master! your right up there with tolken let me tell ya!<br />

OOW/GoD lore.... oooh lets see... bad vibes, aliens from demention X and some old grudges, mixed with the wayfarer bullshit and the secrets of the gods passed down thru telepathy to a ailing profit who keeps going into comas, mixed with a bunch of tinsle and gloss... I see it as a 5 dollar whore being decked out in diamonds... there is alot of filler bullcrap about matamura and others, but it boiled down to pond scum and hardly ties into the original EQ at all... the lore is tenuous at best, hardly connected to anything but the last 2 or 3 loads of shit.<br />
<br />
as for the last bit, first of all I made my own fucking models and yeah they were shit, but at least I was not just upping the scale up in the datebase and inflating stats, also textured them as well, again it was shit but at least it was not the same old crap, third I did not make 4 rooms of cavern and then stretch them into miles of underground networks that all looked alike aside from a pile of animal waste here and a bone there, the only thing I could not manage was scripting them to attack a magic user as I wanted them to, and archer or a melee another way (going invisible) but that was because the engine was limited and cracking the game core was not legal.<br />
<br />
The stuff that is a no brainer the art team doesn't do, the stuff that would do earth shaking things for the combat, the coders do not do, and the basic stuff they do promise to do, takes them a fucking year to implement... come on frod this isn't the baby you fell in love with anymore.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to point out, I actually had the whole - EQ hasn't had a real fantasy plot since Velious discussion - two pages ago.

Coming from a guy who's spent the better part of his EQ career explaining how incredibly difficult for the &quot;casual player&quot; everything is, and how the content is just too much.  At least remain consistent or something Gerick.<br />
<br />
But still, looking up lore on Allakhazam is just as useful as looking up raid information, all you're going to get are Gerick-like Roger Eberts, all of which come out and say &quot;my guild on firiona vie, champios of kung fu, wiped to lord shin ree, but wed never us an aranini's rage, it sux too much&quot; or &quot;merko quetalis has sumthing to hide, he must be kerafyrm!&quot;<br />

<br />
Wee, congratulations on knowing shit about GoD lore.<br />
<br />
I mean how you can ardently defend that Mayong Mistmoore is a &quot;Great piece of lore&quot; and then on the other hand condemn Gates of Discord is beyond me.  <br />
<br />
But again, you don't know about the lore, you know about what was told to you and that's about the extent of it.<br />
<br />
The whole thing revolves around, essentially, a demonic force from the Plane of Discord, which is in essence Hell, (and of course, complaining about alternate planes would really help your arguement) taking advantage of a religious zealot to force its way onto a foothold on Norrath.  The Wayfarers' brotherhood, being the Newbie RP guild they are, decide to go check it out and do a bunch of RP events there.<br />
<br />
It turns out that the events are too hard for the casual player, so they contact the raiders to come figure it out.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile when you get there you find all of Taelosia in shackles or destroyed, most of the natives (who are rather Babylonian like in their architecture) being killed for entertainment or enslaved, and their creations being forced to be used as soldiers rather than laborers.  Essentially, all that anyone can figure out, is that the Muramites are invading, no one knows why, and it has to be stopped.<br />
<br />
The rantings of Calliav aren't really paid attention to any more, and really lost their luster after LDoN, in essence, the Wayfarers' Brotherhood grew too big for his little visions to mean anything toward.  The Wayfarers hire help to force back the Muramites, and lead a secret guerilla war against them for a very long time in the form of the Breakdown in Communications quest, where you have to launch small, but annoying and often times affective, raids against the Muramites, doing such things as assassinating their leaders for their slaves to escape, challening their champions in an arena and sending them into chaos, interrupting rituals, and finding each of the captured or missing agents who usually end up dead or insane.<br />
<br />
Then, as you push deep into Taelosia, you find the horror of the Trusik, worshipping Trushar, in many ways a Cthulu figure, promising to wipe out Taelosia in a flash flood.  Vrex Barxt Qurat is one of his most ardent priests/followers, and you learn that he and his Trusik were banished to the mountains  because of their violence.  The Nihili (the main faction) were none-too pleased with the idea of ritual sacrifice, necromancy, and the whole &quot;everyone will die in a flood&quot; bit.<br />
<br />
So Barxt, establishing the shrine of Uqua, tries to call upon other forces to help him subjugate the Nihili and force them to worship Trushar.  In his searches, he finds one willing candidate in Mata Muram, who states that all that has to be done is a portal be opened and his forces will force the Nihili to worship Trushar.  Barxt opens the portal with the help Tqiv Araxt and Tqiv Qukret, and Mata Muram, nearly finishing his conquest of Kuuan, unleashes his armies at thead of the Tunat`Muram to conquer Taelosia, and hopefully later all of Norrath.<br />
<br />
The Prayer grounds at Qvic are destroyed, the temples of Txevu and Tacvi are completely occupied, Yxtta and Kod`Taz are dismantled and turned into nesting grounds and bases for the Muramites, and the Trusik are left broken into a few splinter factions.<br />
<br />
The Nihili fall even faster, but because they are physically and magically weaker than the Trusik are forced more into doing demeaning, back breaking work next to the stone golems, and are often times simply thrown into the arena to be butchered by Hynids, Cragbeasts, or Kyvs who simply want to have some fun.<br />
<br />
Getting into Uqua you learn that Vrex Barxt Qurat is doing the same thing he did before, only NOW trying to find a DIFFERENT force to destroy Mata Muram and free the Trusik.  A spirit slain in the invasion warns you of this, and opens a gateway to Uqua so you can stop Barxt before he has the ability to do this.<br />
<br />
Fighting your way through Uqua, slaughtering the Tqivs, and finally defeating Barxt destroys him, and prevents some other force, possibly worse than Mata Muram, from entering through to the gates that he is so keen to open.  You access Qvic, find the M`shas keeping the place under tight security, similar to Taskmistress Krisz, administering orders to the lesser Muramites there who you find out are actually laying siege to Inktu`ta (which is now nearly caved in).<br />
<br />
Going deep under the tunnels of Qvic, you fight through the lone guards in front of the entrance, to find the lone entrance into Inktu`ta, the Unmasked Chapel.  Inside you fight through hordes of undead Trusik, completely unsure of exactly what is happening, killing Kelekdrix, the Herald of Trushar and walking your way through Trusik cells that are now completely infested with stonemites.  You have to awaken a handful of sleeping Trusik by demanding that they awaken from their nightmare all at the same time.<br />
<br />
From there you press further into the Chapel to find Noqufiel, standing year several Cursecallers.<br />
<br />
In a rather interesting monologue, he explains how Inktu`ta is the site of an Everquest Mesada, where he realized there was no way to escape the Muramite siege, and they were all going to die.  Therefore, he killed all the inhabitants of Inktu`ta before killing himself.  As it turns out, none of them realize they are in fact dead, and simply roam the halls, Noqufiel being the only one aware of the plight.<br />
<br />
Killing him and his Cursecallers (once again) allows you to dictate the Golem guarding Txevu, and you can order it to stand down its guard and let you pass into Txevu, another former Trusik temple now under the direct control of the Muramites, and acting as their lone shield between you and Tacvi, where their commander, the Tunat`Muram, resides.<br />
<br />
By fighting through and killing the governor of the Temple and Mountain area (the Zun`Muram), you enter Tacvi, the Seat of the Slayer to finally destroy the Muramite heiarchy once and for all.<br />
<br />
But hey that's only shaving the surface of the &quot;shitty&quot; lore.<br />
<br />
as for the last bit, first of all I made my own fucking models and yeah they were shit, but at least I was not just upping the scale up in the datebase and inflating stats, also textured them as well, again it was shit but at least it was not the same old crap, third I did not make 4 rooms of cavern and then stretch them into miles of underground networks that all looked alike aside from a pile of animal waste here and a bone there, the only thing I could not manage was scripting them to attack a magic user as I wanted them to, and archer or a melee another way (going invisible) but that was because the engine was limited and cracking the game core was not legal.<br />
<br />
Coding and developing content isn't as easy as you thought is it?  Imagine that times 2000000000 and then you begin to understand what the devs have to do every day.<br />
<br />
The stuff that is a no brainer the art team doesn't do, the stuff that would do earth shaking things for the combat, the coders do not do, and the basic stuff they do promise to do, takes them a fucking year to implement... come on frod this isn't the baby you fell in love with anymore.<br />
<br />
You're probably right, because the &quot;baby&quot; he fell in love with uh...never actually talked to the customers.<br />
<br />
Now, they frequently post on not just EQ message boards, but generally every player made class board, and what do they get?  Gerick'd.<br />
<br />
Yeah, like the serpant spine mountains and all that but I ment more of my venom at this sudden shift to follow the wayfarers brotherhood that has come togeather so fast, without much of a rival faction... used to be each side of the game had an opposing side, another side of the coin to murder and poison you know? not much chance to play the evil character these days.<br />
<br />
Again...absolute ignorance cookie-cutter arguement that you grabbed from other people because you won't experience the stuff for yourself.<br />
<br />
The Wayfarers' brotherhood has no &quot;side against it&quot;? <br />
<br />
I mean for Christ's sake, we find out the following:<br />
<br />
-LDoN they're trying to make names for themselves.<br />
-GoD they want to try to stop the Muramite invasion<br />
-OoW they're nearly crippled, all their allies turned against them, their leadership in tatters, and them abandoning several of the NPCs and famous players.  <br />
<br />
Hell, OoW DOES bring back &quot;old lore&quot;, unless you don't consider Hsagra to old world lore, or Stanos, or Lanys T`Vyll.<br />
<br />
By this time, an assassin named Wren has led the Wayfarers Brotherhood to war with the Dragorn, no matter how they tried to avoid it, by murdering several key leaders, the Muramites are currently infiltrating the Brotherhood and trying to destroy them from within or gain valuable information, and it turns out they're working with Ragefire. <br />
<br />
Omens of War is essentially Norrath pushing back into Kuuan/Plane of Discord to try to stop the Muramites where they come from (and in the process, finding out their battle tactics in the Muramite Proving Grounds, a GREAT bastion of lore there) all the while the Wayfarers Brotherhood are in complete chaos, being attacked from essentially every side and becoming isolated.<br />
<br />
It's not a good time for the Brotherhood, but you really don't know any of this, because no one comments about it on Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
Of course, most importantly, you being &quot;loyal to your friends&quot; (i.e. incapable of being guilded with anyone of quality because they can't stand your conspiracy theories or your plots that everyone is against you) doesn't grant you instant knowledge of this entire game, its content, or its A.I.  You aren't just given this knowledge as compensation for your unwillingess to try things.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only correction to that GoD lore would be that the Wayfarer Brotherhood isn't some newbie guild.  They exmplify the uberguild.  All their guys are level 70 before OoW even came out.  They have every mix of every race bound together for a common goal: phat lewt.  Now, obviously the game calls it something else, but that's what they are.  I remember one of the rogue who went with Morden Rasp was saying something to the lines of: &quot;Even the gods tremble before our might.  What is there left to do?&quot; before they got humbled in GoD.  But remember that Morden Rasp and another guy FOUGHT his way to Tacvi all the way to Tunat Muram before bailing out.  Unfortunately EQ's system doesn't really support having NPC attackers on your side, because it can make some really interesting encounters if you get the Wayfarer guys to come out and give you a hand.  They got to be the uberest characters known to EQ, like corruption trial but stronger.<br />
<br />
And I saw a comment about Onyxia flying and raining AE death from above being unique.  I guess you never saw Kelekdrix 1.0 or Warden Hanvar does or like 90% of the dragon encounters (heavy AE relatively low melee).  Now Kelekdrix turning invinicible while raining down AE death might not look as cool as a dragon taking off and rain AE death from above but conceptually these are exactly the same.  I distinctly recall people label Warden Hanvar and Kelekdrix 1.0 because even though you got stuff that hits for insignificant damage they really do rain down AE death and while it sounds cool to have innovative non-MT encounters where all healers really get to do something, when you're on the receivng end of AE death that idea no longer sounds so hot.<br />
<br />
When people say 'innovative challenging encounters won by skill not by numbers' what they really mean is an encounter only I can win, because if everyone can beat something it isn't exactly challenging and won't remain innovative for long since it becomes a farm.  However, it would be logical to assume a cutting edge raid, the 'skilled' here would be pretty close to 'best'.  After all it's a cutting edge encounter so it'd make sense only the most skilled can beat it.  However statistically it is very unlikely anyone is the best anything or you're in the best guild so if such encounters do exist, most people will just get repeatedly spanked and complain it's broken, which is what we observe on every challenging EQ encounter.<br />
<br />
Not to mention WoW is even more deterministic than something like EQ because they pretty much removed all the random variables from the game (don't confuse aggro management being potentially difficult with randomness) which means anything you can beat that someone saw you beating (spies, friends, whatever) can pretty much be duplicated with 100% certainty assuming no gear disparity.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing but it also ensures secrets don't stay secret for very long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, when people say innovative encounters won by skill, not by numbers, they mean that they'd like a little more fucking variety than EQ encounters, which are &quot;Increase melee DPS by 10%&quot; and then adding more people to compensate for the fact that they need to heal more damage.<br />
<br />
But, once again, I am clearly in awe of your vast knowledge of every mob in World of Warcraft and their deficincies.  It must be rough being 60 and in an uber guild with Onyxia and Molten core on farm status after a month.  You have my condolences sir.<br />
<br />
I love how you guys claim that we never saw anything in EQ, and we clearly never played the game, then come back with broad statements describing the 2 or 3 instances that you've seen or heard about, and do make exactly the same statements.  Only they're less retarded coming from you, somehow.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Haass, but if that's your idea of an eq encounter, you truly haven't seen anything. There's intricate scripting in a ton of places in the game. If you haven't seen them I obviously can't expect you to know about them, but they most certainly exist.</div></div><hr />

To say those of us who chose not to go the mega raid guild route in favor of enjoyment with our friends cant understand these encounters is pure arrogance.  I'll give you that you truely dont know till you been there.  But if you think Alla's is the only source of information about enounters in EQ, well, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
Now if yall'd just describe what these awe inspiring encounters are doing thats so damn creative that it was actually worth the return on the time investment to experience what you guys claim to be so unique maybe yall bashing a game you've not really played you might actually have a point.

No loot, no cool script, no zone was worth fucking my friends over by guild hopping into a raid guild.  Maybe thats a hard concept for a greedy person to understand. /shrug  It'll come back around to ya.  And no I'm not saying that everyone in a raid guild fucked their friends over to get there.  But it happend more often than not, at least on my server.<br />
<br />
I am going to say it is not worth the time investment just to &quot;experience&quot; this awesome intricate &quot;scripting&quot; with people who actually think they are better because they ran through the maze before everyone else did and got their peice of cheese first.  There is only one way to describe that: fucking sad.   The people who got their first were a) able to invest large block of time on a daily basis and b) lucky.<br />
<br />
Sadly, EQ could have continued to be the baddest game for just about everyone who enjoys this genre had they applied some of thier &quot;creativness&quot; to something other than the hardcore game.  But the designers chose not to do that and thats a damn shame and all but oh well, I can get the same thing elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Haass, but if that's your idea of an eq encounter, you truly haven't seen anything. There's intricate scripting in a ton of places in the game. If you haven't seen them I obviously can't expect you to know about them, but they most certainly exist. <br />
<br />
Here is my point Raaj.<br />
<br />
I played EQ for 5 years, with 1 solid group.  If I haven't seen them...is it my fault for not kicking enough ass?  Is it my fault for not putting in the time?  Not being good enough at the game?  Not caring enough?<br />
<br />
Or is it because I couldn't raid with my schedule, and therefore couldn't raid with 80 people every nite?  Is that the sole reason why I didn't see any of this &quot;Fantastic content&quot; everyone speaks of?  Why does Arugal and Shadowfang keep surpass EVERY single EQ dungeon I've ever done?  Arugal is only 26 after the last push, and I just did him last nite again at 35 for a friend...it's not fuckin old, I still love the place.  How come I need 71 of my closest friends in order to see how creative EQ is, but I can do it with 2 of my friends in WoW?  You don't see the massive flaw in the thinking, and why everyone who wasn't in a raid guild thinks that WoW is the best thing since sliced bread?  It's because WE get to do the fun shit now, and we don't have to sellout, or raid on someone else's schedule, and we can do it with the people we've been playing games with for years now, but never did anything more than a fucking XP grind in EQ because that's all we could do.<br />
<br />
Look at it from our point of veiw.  If you had never beaten Rallos Zek, and were locked down in Tier 2 of PoP...would you still feel the same way about EQ?  I hear it time and time again : &quot;No Haass, I guess you're right.&quot;  Well, then start applying that logic to shit like this.  That's why we were unhappy with EQ and why we left.<br />
<br />
Now, am I getting so much opposition to WoW in this thread because it's a shitty game, or are you guys just jealous that our encounters require the same amount of &quot;Hard work&quot; that your fucking raids do, and we don't have to do it with more than we want to?  Say what you will, but I feel more a part of the game in EVERY encounter in a 5 man group in WoW than I ever did, at any point in EQ's life.  You can't argue that point either, because it's an opinion based upon what was available to me in the game and what was locked out because I couldn't raid from 5-9 EST.<br />
<br />
Sadly, EQ could have continued to be the baddest game for just about everyone who enjoys this genre had they applied some of thier &quot;creativness&quot; to something other than the hardcore game. But the designers chose not to do that and thats a damn shame and all but oh well, I can get the same thing elsewhere. <br />
<br />
And I've been saying this for years too.  EQ COULD have been the best.  There could have been ZERO competition.  But they don't care enough on any level other than shoveling fucking expansions out the door.  So now that there's an alternative, they won't be getting my money..nor anyone's that I know.</div></div><hr />

Eze, I just want to point out that the wayfarers STILL do not have an opposing faction that a PLAYER can help and join, I am talking evil city zones and quests to kill off important wayfarer members, or switching maps to lead them astray, I was not saying that they did not have a rival but meaning a rival that the player can help along.<br />
<br />
Part of what made the old game great is the way you could choose which side of the line you pulled, but these days everyone is on the good side, even if they are Grand pedophile deathmaster carronfeaster, they get lead around by the nose rings by the game.<br />
<br />
As for how I play in game, you probibly wouldn't know it but I am not a loudmouth there, I had led several PoP low end raids and I know how to play my toon, I just come here at let you all smell the dumps I take when I am feeling crotchity, but knowing your ego it matters little how much skill, or knowledge of the game I have, but really how big my E-penis is, and frankly I am not going to play keeping up with your ego for the rest of my gaming days.</div></div><hr />

It was however your choice. As has been said over and over again, for anyone with some basic understanding of game mechanics and above room-temperature IQ, being a 'grunt' in an EQ raid isn't overly difficult. It does however take a committment, which is why even now, when I'm what would be considered a &quot;casual player&quot; I can understand and respect the people who do put that amount of time and energy into the game.<br />
<br />
How come I need 71 of my closest friends in order to see how creative EQ is, but I can do it with 2 of my friends in WoW?<br />
<br />
The same reason you can see all that solitaire has to offer with 1 person - your'e comparing apples to oranges. <br />
<br />
I play WoW, so I have no opposition towards you enjoying the game. My point was simply that these creative events you're seeking *do* exist in EQ. Your ability to partake in them doesn't change the fact that they are there. I have to ask though as you seem to have a lot of contempt for people who are in these uberguilds, is your opposition to them enjoying EQ due to you not progressing to the point where you could enjoy those same things? <br />
<br />
Anyway, I do see it from your point of view. I haven't had a block of time to dedicate to raiding in quite awhile now. I log in and see the gripes you guys have and understand why you decided to leave, you just should try and understand why people decide to stay as well. EQ is not some horrible game, you played it for 5 years. It's just that you've found something that suits you better -- and contrary to popular belief multiple games can indeed coexist.</div></div><hr />

Oh, yeah, I was still grinding xp in PoV last I checked.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about the level thing, or even the gear thing. its just that most of the players, by a vast majority, never got to see this great content because it is locked behind loads of progression, timesinks, and large raids. I'm not going to say that everything in GoD and OoW was locked away, but I will say that when I was playing, I was still stuck on PoV LFG or a healer, because no one wants to do anything below 65.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna whine and bitch about it, but thats the way I left EQ. You know, I'm gald you guys are in agreat guild, but here on Vazaelle, things aren't so pretty. I still have an EQ subcription, I still log on. my current guild is completely void of leadership now, all the officers have left, as have a large portion of the members. So really, how does someone such as myself experience this great content? I'm really asking, what can a 58 warrior do that is actually fun in EQ and not a grind?</div></div><hr />

There's a mighty big differnce between commitment and large amounts of free time to burn.  Big difference.  The implemetation of EverQuest turned that &quot;commitment&quot; into a test of who could sit on their butt the longest, nothing more.<br />
ability to partake in them doesn't change the fact that they are there.<br />
I think its that ability to partake in them point that rubs a lot of folks the wrong way.  So fucking what that they do exist.  When it becomes something that only the people with large chunks of free time (a rarity in the real world we all actually have to live in) then there is a problem.  <br />
<br />
So some folks actually get to put the time in and experience the programming/scripts that are so much fun while other do not get to experience them.  Talk about an artifical limit.  When time is the only factor that seperates those who can play well from those who actually get to play you end up with EQ. It has enjoyed the top spot for a long time because no one has come along and implemented the same style of game any better than EQ did.  <br />
<br />
Well, WoW did it.  While the comparison between the 2 games themselves may be apples and oranges, the thrill one experiences is the same despite what some of the more uber arrogant types might have you believe.  And thats why we play (usually), for the thrill.  I doubt very seriously that WoW will become EQ for psycho's when you pretty much had to be psycho to floursih in EQ.  Of course my definition of psycho probably varies from that of Frodlin's.  I call sitting on your ass not having fun while you farm farm farm to get gear and flags for peeps that, if they are forced to choose, will leave your ass behind in a heartbeat in order to &quot;progress&quot; themselves pretty damn psycho.<br />
<br />
Good luck catching up to them if you have any break in your playtime schedule due to circumstances outside the game.  Yes, those factors count too.  If you dont believe that, you are burying your own head up your own ass.  To me thats the fatal flaw in EQ's &quot;vision&quot;  Its counter productive to actually help your friends catch up to where you are when they fall behind.  Helping your fellow playmates keep up to the point where they can play with you even semi-productively is is a MAJOR part of teamwork.  Never forget that.<br />
<br />
It amuses me to no end that the hardiest of the &quot;hardcore&quot; dismiss WoW as too easy when infact leveling in WoW is very much on par with modern day EQ.<br />
<br />
EDIT: it also amuses me that SoE appears to be catching on to this beef with content being cockblocked and are dumbing the game down stay in business.  That to me spells it out loud and clear how well the original &quot;vision&quot; really turned out to be just another cool idea that in the end is unable to last.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain the &quot;big difference&quot; between putting your free-time into EQ, and committing your free-time to eq, please.<br />
<br />
I fully understand that many events are not simply &quot;available&quot; to everyone. That's the game of EverQuest, it's how the game is. If it doesn't suit you, by all means move on -- but don't sit here and claim that there are no creative events in Everquest, because that's completely false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Explain the &quot;big difference&quot; between putting your free-time into EQ, and committing your free-time to eq, please.<br />
I can remain committed to a game, my friends, and my own personal progress while not logged into the game.  I can study it, encounters, classes, quests, etc.  My lack of free game time does not lessen my commitment.  It just means I must work harder outside of the game so that I may enjoy it when I do actually have time to log in and play.  Outside research is a part of the EQ experience.  Otherwise, would this board even be here?  I think not.  Its not like the Warrior class was ever that hard to play in and of itself.<br />
<br />
Having time to be logged in does NOT make you a committed player by itself.  However, in EQ, having time to be logged in has become the primary requirment needed to flourish.  For the most part thats fine with me, thats the &quot;vision&quot;  What isnt fine is that only those who meet the large in game playtime commitment are allowed to benifit from new developments in encounter technology.  That's not a vision, thats a carrot.  A gimmick as Haass likes to call it.<br />
That's the game of EverQuest, it's how the game is. If it doesn't suit you, by all means move on<br />
I have.<br />
but don't sit here and claim that there are no creative events in EverQuest, because that's completely false.<br />
I'm not, nor have I.<br />
<br />
I am saying that the majorty of this creativity is available only to the minorty with the most free time to commit.<br />
<br />
Unless they've added something since the finall stress test of WoW that put some of this creativity in an area that you didnt have to be max level, 100+ aa, and best baz/ldon gear you can obtain inorder to get past the first 5 mobs in the zone then things are the same as they were when I stopped playing.  What stopped them from making a level 20 encounters that contains all this nifty scripting, questing, lore, and creativity that everyone enjoys so much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Commitment is commitment. Playing at the endgame takes it, anyone who's done it for any length of time would agree. I can't count the number of sleepless nights, turned down dates, or skipped classes I've had since EQ was released, but I'd call it commitment :p Regardless, it's arguing semantics and I'm certain you understand what I originally meant by it.<br />
<br />
I'm in agreement that there should be some creative things to do for all level ranges, and I was under the impression there were at least a few added with the recent expansion(s). I'm not of that level range though, so I'll defer that to someone who knows what they're talking about. They may not be of the same calibre or number unfortunately, however  it does make sense for there to be more of these types of encounters as you progress farther into the game. I would be very surprised if the design of WoW at the high end doesn't turn out similar. Once your players have achieved the maximum level, the only thing left for them is content. There's plenty of lower level content in EverQuest which in todays game (perhaps not the original pre-SoE EQ) is viewed as a means to an end  (the later stages of the game). I'm not simply referring to raid content here, as the MPG trials are one group scripted encounters, just as an example.<br />
<br />
Whether or not it's good game design is a totally different story. I tend to think they've taken it to the extreme in that instead of expanding on things to do, they expanded on things to obtain which puts the newer player farther and farther behind.  It's what will eventually do the most harm to the game. <br />
<br />
And unclebong: You specifically didn't state that there wasn't any creativity, but it's been alluded to throughout the thread. If what was meant is that there's very little &quot;open&quot; creative scripting, again that's a seperate issue.  The lore is there, but again since players go through those levels toward the goal of 70 instead of enjoying the game, much of it isn't ever seen anymore.</div></div><hr />

If there was an event that was the most fabulous design ever, but required you to be level 75 to participate in it, would it be a good event?  Basically if I can't get there, then what exists in that &quot;unknown&quot; area doesn't mean shit to me..because I'll never see it no matter how good it is.<br />
<br />

<br />
I really don't have that much contempt for people playing the game.  I have contempt for people with a fucking attitude about how much time they put into EQ and them touting how superior they are because of it.  They're not superior, they're fucking slugs.  Slugs with mountains of prime time to burn on EQ.  That doesn't make you smart, it doesn't make your game good, and it doesn't make you any better than anyone else.  That's what I have a problem with, and that's why I get into these discussions.  Honestly, if you wanna play EQ 167 hours a week, that's fucking great.  Way to get your money's worth.  But don't come here and tell me that I wasn't putting enough fucking effort into EQ because all I ever saw was a carrot and never got anything for it.<br />

<br />
Like I said before..if you wanna stick around, that's fuckin great.  I honestly think you're missing out if you're not playing WoW tho.  It is indeed worth the 50 bucks, unlike some recent games (cough doom 3 cough).  I just really have a hard time with some posters here (who have stayed out of this thread thankfully) who think they're just king of the mountain because everyone else had enough of Sony's bullshit and decided to take their money elsewhere.  I've said it  numerous times...if you didn't have the time to put into EQ that you do, and didn't have the guild that you do, you'd look at it in a different light...one of the neverending XP grind.  That's not what I play games for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) There's more hehe.Stuff does get more challenging as you progress,at least for raiders,at least for us.There is a big difference being even dps #05 beastie in NTOV compared to Uqua.Never mind the tanks.I know that  given the same gear we have now with our playing experience at the NTOV level we wouldn't have a chance in the god stuff.As we progressed from pog/kael on Stromm thru Time into GOD I've watched people(mostly myself hehe) learn to play and raid better.We're just a casual bunch of part time folks too.The tanks are night and day different tho.The biggest challenge tho is a socail one.Not surprising in this type of game.If we all(or a majority) just sat on our butts,never worked hard or tried to play hard we never would have gotten where we have.The commitment is more than just time,much more.<br />
<br />
2)Yeah,I agree there are lots of flaws in content progression and itemization balance.We worked through stuff of on very minimal playtime tho.I averaged less than 20(many regular members average half that) hours a week.A very large portion was raiding.I work all night and kinda slept around raids.The fun part was watching/helping the guild progress.Feeling a part of something kewl.Since I've been gl/rl It's been a little less fun and more stressful.I'm not the best suited to leading an online video game team imo,but,stuff happens and its a great bunch of folks.<br />
<br />
3)We have members who get sidetracked by real life all the time....or erk other games.They come back and gear up np.The fun part after all is the people.<br />
<br />
New stuff is easy and fun to like.I don't know that the new games won't eventually see similar problems as players look to advance thru raid encounters.We'll see tho.Gawd,I hope the next games keep guilds smaller but immersive.I'd like free open worlds without lots of artificial lockouts.A game that doesn't involve more button mashing than EQ as well hehe.No lil gimicky flashing lights or other crass arcadish add ons.One with slow, solid progression and nicely scaled rewards.One that feels like a high fantasy  RPG built to last.I loved EQ thru velious.I enjoyed POP even.GOD is very challenging raiding and OOW seems too easy rvr.To be honest our more hardcore folks enjoy raiding GOD quite a bit.For me it's almost too hard.Long raids without much room for error and little reward much of the time.Hats off to the folks who did it at 65 hehe. :)<br />
<br />
PS.None of this makes raiders better than anybody else.It does mean they worked hard to stay together and help each other achieve kewl stuff tho.Thats a big part of what people can find special in EQ.If you missed out on that for whatever reason it's too bad.Don't knock it tho without having done it the full route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-25-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) I do know it takes a lot more than just time to continute to progress.  Please dont take my comments as an attempt to lessen your accomplisments or your guildmates, thats not really what I ment.  I really am refering more to the need for time inorder to do anything more than the boring ass exp grind we've been doing for years.  <br />
<br />
That things become harder and more rewarding as you get higher in the game is exactly how I want it to be too.<br />
<br />
2) having gone from the dying lowbie tank to MT to raid leader in the guilds I was in, I know what you mean.  Hehe the game at that point becomes more an annoying logistical matter than a game, but hey thats the nature of the beast and I'm cool with that.  And omfg did it feel great when everyone got it together and we got the beastie dead.  After all, it only took one dumbass to ruin everyones night.<br />
<br />
3) I cant count the number of folks I met on Karana who had stopped playing for a year and come back to find their guilds were gone or so far ahead they couldnt even zone into the same zones who did get left behind.  Showing up decked out in Myrmidon's after a long break to find your guild is done farming Quarm pretty much meant you we're unable to catch up unless they put 60+ people to the task of catching you up.  While I'm glad they finally are fixing that, its a day late and a dollar short.  The friends they did have left in game usually were unable to stop raiding to help them out cause they'd get kicked from their guild for not showing up to raids.  Thus it being counter productive.<br />
I don't know that the new games won't eventually see similar problems as players look to advance thru raid encounters.<br />
WoW will suffer from the same problems no doubt about it.  Its the nature of this style of game and believe or not thats one of the things I do like about this kind of game.  Only the groups that tough it out get the gold.  As it should be.<br />

Hehe its apparent folks think I never raided. Incorrect.  I and my guildmates worked our asses off on the content we were doing just as hard as the top end raiders.  No, I didnt miss out on that special EQ experience, even if I didnt see the EP's.  I may not have experienced it to the extent you have, but that doesnt change the fact that I got it too.<br />
<br />
I aint bashin the uber raider types.  Mad props to all yall who were lucky enough and committed enough to do it.<br />
<br />
I am bashing anyone who thinks they're xtra special because they've seen this creativty locked away behind content that requires the 60+ man force like they're the only ones entitled to a well done game.  I'm bashing SoE for only putting their efforts into the mega raid force game and not doing anything for the folks who would rather not go that route.<br />
<br />
And I'll save a lil bash for those folks who think you gotta do the 60 man raids to experience what EQ was all about.  No, you did not have to believe it or not.  All you really get with the bigger raids is a scaled up version of the same experience I think every last EQ player felt.  But since the designers put the fun gaming (fuck loot, im talking gaming, the actual fights themselves) where only the big guilds could get to em, I wont bash too hard because in EQ you did have to do that.</div></div><hr />

Look son, I was probably killing Quarm before you were even taking screen shots of what's up Xegony's dress, you're not special... at all. I wouldn't even bring it up if you would quit talking down to everyone like you're the only one here who as experienced the high end game. How about you drop the bullshit 'holier than thou' attitude, no one cares how far into GoD or OoW you are, especially since half of the community already wised up and quit that shitty game. <br />
<br />
Since you're so uber and conquered so much of the game, how about debating PoP scripting since EQ is so amazing and fun, or weren't you around for that? <br />
<br />
I can tell you that I don't think anyone liked the flagging system or the fight scripting. It wasn't fun one fucking bit, the only thing driving anyone to play at all was the loot. You think I liked playing six hours (or even longer) strait to do all the earth rings just to spawn that asshole Arbiter everytime we had to flag some new recruits? You think Xegony was actually &quot;fun&quot; and the other three God's were fun? Was doing P1-3 (in PoTime, for the dullards who don't know what I'm refering to) every week for drops that no one in the guild needed every single week fun?<br />
<br />
You &quot;uber, omfg I'm raping GoD and OoW&quot; people probably don't even have a fucking clue because by the time you were actually that far into the expansion your guild was spoon feeding you flags. Try learning that shit, and doing it repeatedly. It's not fun, it's not entertaining, it's not even hard. It's hours of sitting on your ass doing the same shit over and over again.<br />
<br />
You know why no one has responses to your OoW/GoD questions? No one played that shit. For Sony to have items drop in GoD instances that were PoTime + quality within the first couple Tiers of the expansion made me feel like I wasted way too much time in PoP, and it wouldn't be so bad if I actually enjoyed some of it. Not only that, but for them to release yet another flagged expansion after the PoP shit-storm made me want to cry.<br />
<br />
Atleast when I'm playing WoW I'm still amazed daily by the models, scripting and environments, I feel like I'm doing something, everytime I play. I can't remember anything about leveling in EQ, it was always just pull some shit, kill it, repeat, hell it was even worse everytime I made an alt. Most people can level atleast four chars to level 20 or so (which you would think is boring as hell right?) in WoW and still say &quot;this is the funnest shit I've ever played&quot; even though they just did the same thing four times.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly suprised this thread is still going, but eh, whatever.</div></div><hr />

Yeah right.<br />
<br />
Just because you were once sort of uber in EQ doesn't mean you are now nor does it mean you are qualified to talk about what EQ currently IS.<br />
<br />
Then again I guess you're one of those good old day guys who either think original EQ or Velious was the best EQ ever has to offer.  Those are the guys who I think must be totally stupid to knowingly buy more expansions even if they 'knew it all along' that the original was the best.  I mean, the rest of us presumably believe the new stuff will be, um, better than the old stuff.  Apparently there are those who knew the new stuff sucks but is willing to waste time and money doing them citing some obscure excuses like friendship and loyalty.<br />
<br />
You didn't make it to the current EQ endgame.  Stop crying over it.  It's not supposed to be a big deal, but you sure make it sound like it is having to remind people who it used to be.  I believe in progress, and I have no interest in what it used to be like for you.  And if you don't believe in progress, then I guess you must be stupid to buy new things while believing nothing can be better than what it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we played from the beginning on Stromm through to where we are now.Not far, just in Uqua and we clear Time routinely.We're casual players and not in any hurry.I was on almost every raid we ever did from pog/velious at level 55-60 on up.I did like the velious expansion a lot.it had the best gaming feel to me.For raiding tho the game got progressively harder with content flag mobs tending to stand out.Backflagging past the second go or so was seldom super fun,but,wth your guildies got flags and saw the new stuff weee.Fennin,Coirnav,Xegony and TRC were all great fights for us the first few times.Fennin went down almost too easy ,but,was still fun.Coirnav in our dps challenged state was very hard hehe.When we finally beat him the whole guild was euphoric.Rathe died first go(we were normally tank/cleric heavy),but, it was still challenging in its way.Xegony was a neat fight too,tho I never wanted to see rape spiders again.The first time we beat Quarm I felt better than any game ever made me feel before I think.At least in the last 25 years or so.Half the guild didnt't want to leave hehe.We all stood around POK after the script semi high...from just a game.Yeah,since then Quarm has become gimp for us.Level 70 and gear has made it a totally differant fight.It was very special at the time though.<br />
<br />
Many of those raids required a strong input by a large part of the raid force when they were tough.GOD stuff is much more complex and less forgiving.I don't like the &quot;feel&quot; of GOD and OOW as much as the older expansions,but, they certainly are challenging to raid and interesting.People seem to want to hate EQ hehe.I didn't play it because there was nothing else.I played it because imo it was and is a great game.Not perfect by any means ,but, great all the same.We've had great times in EQ.Lots of folks have had untold hours of fun playing the game.Raiding(I've lead our raids since hitting Time and MT'd previously)certainly gets tougher as you progress.Too many are a little too long for my liking now,but, they are fun and challenging.I guess thats the price you pay for getting to that point in EQ hehe.High end POP and then GOD and OOW were designed with very efficient,hardworking guilds in mind.Kinda tough on casuals like us.Still some of the GOD stuff that we've done is very unforgiving of weak play by any raid member and require a lot of effort and focus.Even some Time encounters and Coirnav were pretty tough when we had low gear for the content.<br />
<br />
So I'm not sure where some folks are coming from.Almost sounds like you played a different game.My wife and I have played through most of it into GOD in a linear fashion since Stromm opened.It's been a blast and it's easy to see how stuff gets tougher as you progress.Sure some flag mobs tend to be harder than easier encounters in the content they open/shrug only makes sense to me.It catches up fast hehe.There are social/logistical challenges that can make EQ seem like work at times.The players made this happen tho.It was an open world and folks found they did better in larger groups.That by routinely wacking mobs too hard to group they could progress a raid force to see and do tougher stuff.That led to harder encounters with better loot and so on.They do get harder to beat.They end up taking better tactics,better coordination and better average play throughout the raid.Of course doing anything trivial is easy for groups or raids.Thats why they call it trivial.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the answers are to this in a new game.I certainly hope somone gets this stuff better than WOW or EQ2.I can see why folks like both games and you can certainly have fun with friends anywhere.They are not better games than EQ imo,just different.Hopefully, devs are sifting thru this stuff and someone builds a game that keeps the best parts of EQ while finding a way to better balance stuff like raiding size &amp; impact,itemization,competition for spawns etc.I know lots of folks who are crossing their fingers hehe. :)</div></div><hr />

I got to level 5 in WoW earlier than you, and back in my days things weren't so easy as you have it now.<br />
<br />
Maybe if by level 5 you mean two level 35s, compared to someone who can not even tell me what his WoW experience is, that's a hell of a lot.<br />
<br />
Just because you were once sort of uber in EQ doesn't mean you are now nor does it mean you are qualified to talk about what EQ currently IS.<br />
<br />
Actually I don't think I was in a &quot;casual guild&quot; in four of my five years playing EQ. Since when is being in one of the only two guilds on the server to complete the current expansion &quot;sort of uber&quot;. You don't know shit about how much time I invested into grinding out levels, doing AA, learning content and raiding, so don't act like you do.<br />
<br />
Then again I guess you're one of those good old day guys who either think original EQ or Velious was the best EQ ever has to offer.

Apparently there are those who knew the new stuff sucks but is willing to waste time and money doing them citing some obscure excuses like friendship and loyalty.<br />
<br />
I'm a power gamer, I care a lot about char improvement. Apparently you missed when I said &quot;It wasn't fun one fucking bit, the only thing driving anyone to play at all was the loot&quot;. PoP was a revolutionary expansion, fuck everyone was drooling over 200+ hp items, but was it actually fun? <br />
<br />
You didn't make it to the current EQ endgame. Stop crying over it. It's not supposed to be a big deal, but you sure make it sound like it is having to remind people who it used to be.

<br />
Haha, that's hillarious, I guess it's hard to make it to the high end game when I don't play the game. What's your point? I guess by your logic I could just say &quot;Oh shit Phantron, I'm better than you at (insert game) because I beat it and you don't play it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm crying over not having to hit my assist key for eight hours a day to get a piece of loot every couple weeks. Your right, I don't know shit about the current EQ except the constant bitching about finding groups, guilds collapsing and shitty expansions. If the game is so great how come so many people are leaving it?<br />
<br />
Phantron, you can't debate your way out of a fucking paper bag, maybe if you actually used some facts, it wouldn't be so obvious that you have very little experience in anything. So far your only argument in about six posts is &quot;I'm uber now, you don't play EQ so you obviously failed, therefore WoW sucks&quot; - That shit doesn't even make sense. I'm sure Uqua sure is a lot harder for you at level 70 than it was for me at level 65. <br />
<br />
Funny, just keep dodging my arguments. You can't even tell me about your PoP experiences because you don't have any, even though the expansion was big for a good year or two - real hardcore, oldschool. It must be hard to get into &quot;uber guilds&quot; now that the population is so low that people were actually discussing server mergers.<br />

<br />
Look son, I was probably killing Quarm before you were even taking screen shots of what's up Xegony's dress, you're not special... at all. <br />
<br />
Alright dude, it's pretty clear after this quote that 1) you're a dumbass, and 2) you really don't know what you're talking about, in any game, and have no idea who has done what, so you're basically not qualified to speak on it.<br />
<br />
This is the point where you step back and figure out if you have a point, or if you're arguing just to argue.   I have a point, and I've explained it concisely in this thread.  Your posts follow along the lines of &quot;OMG I'M UBER&quot; and pretty much don't have anything else to go along with it.<br />
<br />
Frodlin deserves a lot of respect for who he is and what he's done in this community.  That doesn't change the fact that he's wrong (hehe), but it's certainly not your place to say that you were farming Quarm while he was still in Air, when I'm fairly sure the opposite is true.<br />
<br />
If you don't know what you're talking about, don't talk about it..it's plenty simple.  No one is going to wonder where you are or what your opinion is on any particular matter if you don't have anything to contribute.  Do I know what kind of crap goes on in GoD and OoW?  Nope..and quite frankly I don't care.  I know what I saw in EQ...5 years of the same boring crap. The only &quot;events&quot; that were ever different from any other auto attack AFK scramble were ones that were itemized with absolute garbage, and senseless to do.  I play a game now where I don't have to spend 30+ hours a week with my 70 favorite people in order to do interesting things.  And that's why SoE no longer gets my money.  They dropped the ball on building their game around what someone with a life can accomplish.  Everyone who had to drop EQ for their life will tell you the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Haas, your point is exactly the same as mine. Exactly. I dunno if you're like skimming my posts for shit to call me on, it just sounds like you're looking with a fight but we've basicly been saying the same shit in the EQ/WoW comparasin. I guess it's ironic how I agree with you and then you bag on me for it, doesn't that just mean you're contradicting yourself?<br />
<br />
I don't have any beef with Frod, A) it was an example of going on with this thread, and B) was exagerating to prove a point. That point being that lots of people have done what these &quot;uber&quot; EQ players have done. I don't think I'm better than them, or anyone here, but I was proving a point.<br />
<br />
I only know what people have done by what they have posted, and quite frankly all that has been is how uber they are now. I don't play the game, I'm not going to go looking up Magelos to prove shit, I don't care enough. I don't actually know where people were back in the day, but I can only assume if they're all like Phantron and won't just prove me wrong. What am I supposed to do when the guy won't even give facts but changes the subject everytime I reply to him, why do I even bother?<br />
<br />
People can say whatever they want, you don't know shit about what I've gone through the past month as far as RL is concerned vs my WoW time, so don't act like you do and I'll stop making assumptions about EQ players pasts.<br />
<br />
Actually I have a lot of points in my posts, I guess next time I'll just have to break it down for you.<br />

<br />
Well,posts that get personal are dumb imo.These are games after all.Painting Frod the way you did seems like a meaningless flame.Well maybe it was eqo talking.Anyways, suggesting that raiding GOD is easy and mindless implys a lack of experience with the content.Thats seems to be what Frod and Phant are driving at.Most of our folks crank it up when we go just to Uqua and weaker players wipe raids easy there hehe.Never mind the stuff they did at 65.<br />
<br />
All the games are good in their own way.I can well understand why Haass has a thing about EQ tho I feel he go's overboard at times.The game was player driven and became socially and logistically demanding.Maybe too demanding for a game where you want to worry about dragons and tanking stuff for your friends.Still with good people it was and is a great game.A little too costly in time and out of game work,but, great still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this. It's an important baseline: Frodlin knows how to play, and knows why he likes the game. It's pointless to argue otherwise.<br />
<br />
You might be able to argue other things about what he says (such as: in what way exactly would it hurt the game if non-endgame encounters were as interesting as he says the end game is?) but pissing contests...almost always pointless.<br />
<br />
I would say they were always pointless, except when I was about five and my brother was four we got into an argument about who could actually piss the highest. Our argument took place on a summer evening during a family get-together at my great uncle's ranch. He overheard us and suggested we just by god settle the matter right now.<br />
So we trouped on out to the rail fence in the front yard and did, somewhat to the amusement of a couple of folks passing on the county (dirt) road. Mom was mortified when she found out and of course mad at my uncle, but since I won, I was happy enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hahahhahahahaha! but who pissed further?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point being that I have done high end content therefore I believe I know what he is referring to even though I haven't done GoD/OoW. I was not trying to compare penis sizes at all, I know people don't give a shit about how uber anyone is, let alone someone who quit EQ over a year ago. I'm not bagging on the guy or questioning his playskill.<br />
<br />
I have also stated atleast twice before in this thread, it's kinda retarded to compare EQ content (which has been out for what? Seven years now?) to a game's content which has only been out a month.</div></div><hr />

Your right, I don't know shit about the current EQ except the constant bitching about finding groups, guilds collapsing and shitty expansions. If the game is so great how come so many people are leaving it?<br />
<br />
You hear about those things because when people leave this game, they have a way of complaining even more than they did when they played. When people get pissed, they get loud. The players who are content with the game don't post about everything that's good near as much as people post about what's bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you're not getting the point that you saying you've been doing whatever PoP stuff is like me saying I got to level 5 in WoW before you did (and I probably did, not that it means anything).  It's all in the past.  No one cares if you once were in the cutting edge old stuff that is totally trivial now.  Things get better over time.  If you don't believe that I can only attribute stupidity for buying anything newer than whenever you believed was the good old days of EQ.  <br />
<br />
At any rate I have a level 27 war and a level 38 rogue in RETAIL but then again I guess you can't comprehend the fact that people can play and enjoy multiple games at once.  Seeing we're playing the level game, I'm sure I can dig up someone somewhere who is level 60 and dislike the game (imagine that, people have opinions).  Does that mean you lose?<br />
<br />
Speaking of bad news, my WoW guild of 10 people recently went down to 3 guys because 2 guys left for some random more uberer guild (whatever that even means in WoW) and 5 guys happen to be playing less just because, well, things like that happen.  This obviously represents a 70% decline in the population playing WoW because I am the center of the universe and therefore the end of WoW is near.  Uh-huh.<br />
<br />
People who quit EQ have a hyper-inflated sense of their self importance.  Just because you and your five friends left doesn't mean it's the end, just like the 5 guys we pulled from somewhere to meet the 10 requirement leaving doesn't mean there's something horrible with the way guilds work in WoW.<br />
<br />
My EQ guild probably sees a 20% decline in population due to the recent flux of games.  Depending on how your guild is setup, this may or may not cripple your ability to raid.  In my guild's case, it does, since going from just enough to just enough -20% is no longer enough.  Some guilds have more than they need, and they get along just fine.  Some guilds are running barely enough, and obviously those collapse if they refuse to get more people.  <br />
<br />
People have a really hard time grasping the idea that any established MMORPG's population is constantly DECREASING.  It makes absolutely no sense why a game that's been out for say 2 years would ever get more people to play it in today's market.  Do you see the number of players playing say, Diablo 2, constantly going up?  No, it goes down over time because it's an old game.  EQ's sustained growth is an anomaly.  You're not supposed to get more people playing on older games.  If your guild can't deal with the natural decline in population base then it deserves to collapse.  Only MMORPG PR guys can be so naive to believe that we're in some untapped market with infinite growth potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, alright. I wasn't going to post again, and I actually regret posting at all since this thread de-railed a long time ago. The guy who started the thread already made his game choice and this isn't even like a WoW vs EQ debate at all. <br />
<br />
All I ever wanted Phant was some facts man, I wasn't doing a strait out level comparasin. Hell, I know level 35 is shit for WoW, I don't think I'm great for getting it at all, but you complained about WoW instancing while refusing to say when you actually did any instances levelwise before. I already went over this, too lazy to explain again.<br />
<br />
Although I misunderstood your analogy, I didn't miss your point about &quot;EQs good old days&quot;. I played for char improvement and kept buying expansions to play because there was like no alternative. I almost quit EQ numerous times, but no games had the same entertainment value. When when I started lifting, playing the drums, drawing, whatever.. I still had a lot of extra time, so I always wound up getting sucked back into it. <br />
<br />
I know no one gives a shit about what I did in EQ, but it seemed like everyone kept spouting &quot;you don't know what it's like to be uber&quot;. I honestly can't imagine the game has changed that much, how could it be the same after six expansions or so, then magicly totally change directions after OoW release? Yes I was there when GoD was released, and I wasn't impressed. Boring flags, trials, killing trash for hours to fight a boss mob which drops two pieces of loot. Awesome.<br />
<br />
I never said the game's population wasn't slowly decreasing either, actually it's pretty amazing how long it's lasted. I do believe you both make a good point in saying that the people who quit will make a bigger scene, but I was under the impression that it was &quot;mass EQ exodus&quot; at this point. I guess I don't play anymore, so it's only hearsay, but you know that thread about server merging on the boards here is by current EQ players right? If people are talking about merging servers because they can't even get groups going, it doesn't exactly sound like the game is flourishing.<br />
<br />
The only reason I'm replying is since the last couple posts were directed at me. I stepped back like Haas suggested (even though he probably wasn't serious) and came to the conclusion that I don't think anyone here gives a shit about anything being said anymore, myself included. I don't think I ever cared in the first place, hell if I still played EQ, I'm sure I would've been defending it instead, good for you guys if you still enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all the animosity about these other games, its almost as if people are being so defensive, because the alternative means that all there time in a virtual game meant nothing more than the good memories that were made. Perhaps thats the biggest draw of a loot based game design: People value the loot which they can't take away from the game, over the memories and experiences along the way which they can take away when they leave. A person that values objects (very prevalent in western culture), even virtual objects, over experiences will have a hard time leaving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean is it has immersiveness just lacking elsewhere... even the fast travel is interesting... it something you have to experiance first hand... fishing works in a way you wouldn't expect, requires timing instead of just one button click... finding plants isn't clicking a key, but going to the area they are known to grow in and picking them... silverleaf in fields, earthroot by mountains, mageweed by rivers, it makes you imbid knowledge about the games plant life, cooking requires that you build a fire (that also effect those around it with a higher resting rate) mining requires you to locate veins of ore...<br />
<br />
The combat is interesting... getting reckless is what the game tries to get you to do with its fast pace and small death penalty, its a damn thrill which is something I have not had in a long time... probibly since my honeymoon period with EQ ended...<br />
<br />
Hell dying is even cool... every corpse run you pick up something else about the spirit world that escaped your notice last time, everything looks differnt even the skies.<br />
<br />
casters use wands and staffs, and sometimes daggers while warriors get the bad ass swords, no crappy graphics for the melee and awsome weapons for the casters here... but the caster gear has its own charm in the light they cast and the way it effects the shading around them.. and if a weapon glows it casts a flickering light that is in sync...<br />
<br />
You don't have one plate graphic per race and there isn't much re-tinting bullshit to be seen either, every toon looks differnt because their gears physical form AND color is differnt, not just the color and type like we see in everquest.<br />
<br />
I was putting it simply because thats how the game is, every little bit of polish you notice makes you even gladder you picked up a copy, its the sweet sweet frosting.<br />
<br />
As for the cartoon look? if you really try to play the game it becomes visible... it HAS to be there because its parts of the immersiveness... the distortion is an artistic way to get your attention on something, each of the big city areas are made in a way that they guide you with a flow, not just your toon but also your eyes as they hop from log to rope to mail box, in everquest they repeated textures where ever they could get away with it but we all know that citys grow and this is shown in warcraft, you can see that it wasn't all built at once out of one big lego set, you can see that they really did go over it twice just to make sure there was not something more to do.</div></div><hr />

The way it works is if someone attacks an NPC that has a PvP Enable flag.  When they attack the NPC they become PvP enabled.  If someone assists them, bandages, heals, or attacks them they become PvP enabled also.. it can become a dominos effect.<br />
<br />
So anyways, my group (Alliance) needs to run to a dungeon in horde area that is located in a &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; type area.  We must pass two horde guards (level 35 with pvp enable flag) in order to get on the elevator to go down to the bottom.<br />
<br />
As we decide the best way to attack the guards so we can kill them and move to the elevator (were level 28-32) we see off in the distance about 60 yards away two very high level horde players (they are listed as level ??).  We talked in group a moment about pvp flag and we realized that these horde members were waiting for us to get pvp flagged by killing there guards so they could jump us and kill us.<br />
<br />
So our delima begins, we stand there eyeing the slow moving elevator behind the horde guards, just out of reach.  The two high level horde players eyeing us in the distance.  We know we have come to far to turn back, but how do we get down to the canyon floor blocked by two horde guards and being stalked by two horde players.<br />
<br />
*winks*<br />
<br />
Well you decide and finish the story yourself, if you choose.<br />

<br />
Can the PvP system be troublesome at times? Sure, but it's part of the game. I would rather have it as it is than no PvP at all. It's not like the death penalty in WoW is horribly bad. Worse comes to worse, just death run it off the cliff there then rez out of the guard's range, problem solved. The GY for 1kn isn't very far at all and there's even a gryph/hippo camp at the edge of the zone you could easily walk to so you'll never have to deal with that crap again.<br />
<br />
Haha, I guess that explains why the great lift was always being attacked when I was in the zone though.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, that is not the case. Blizzard has scrapped the whole dishonor thing for killing low level players. They apparenly thought that it would be to easy to abuse. Ganking is alive and well in WoW.<br />
<br />
Sounds like perhaps the best thing to do in that situation is either go somewhere else, or engage the guards on the lift. If you got on before the Horde people, they might have to wait for it to come back up, and you would have a head start on them. Or you could at least try to die at the bottom, run back and rez at the bottom and go on your way. Tough situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yar, there was problems with accidently AEing low levels and what happens if lowbies attack you from what I understand. I mean, honestly I don't think it's some big deal if you die, but I'm also not on a PvP server since I figured the scum of the game would be flocking to them. Last thing I need is people jacking me while I'm trying to level up, like it's not time consuming enough when I work all day.<br />
<br />
If battlegrounds are half as good as they look I'm sure they will cure the PvP itch on PvE though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play on a carebare server and for the most part I can avoid PvP when I want to.  Thing is, I want to avoid it less and less as I get into the game.  PvP is much more blanced imo than it was in EQ, DAoC, or AO.  I actually stand a chance as a warrior.<br />
<br />
I REALLY like the way the notion of competition for resources (a must in a mmorpg) is implemented in WoW.  It pits opposing factions against eachother more than pitting folks on the same faction against eachother (i hated the goddamn fights over the necro camp in Seb!).  The way the quest sharing system works, its in your best interest to share and help your fellow horde (or alliance) players complete their quest.  The angst generated by spawn competiton is almost non-existant in WoW.  It does exists but on a much much much smaller scale.  But since Horde and Alliance both need the same mobs for their quests, you bump into eachother that way.  <br />
<br />
You have a few choices then:<br />
- share the spawns<br />
- leave and come back when its not camped<br />
- fight eachother for control of the spawns<br />
<br />
All 3 are equally effective in my eyes.  No matter what you like, you have an option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for why you need a reason to kill the other side, having another side along is enough reason.  It's like asking why to terrorists kill counter-terrorists in CS or vice versa.  They just do.  Most 'camps' in WoW can be cleared out by one person anyway.  It makes no difference whether that person is on your side or the other side, you're still denied the same resource and it happens all the time.  <br />
<br />
If you think there is some realistic reason why the graphics have to be like that you're probably one of those guys that believes a company coming up with an obviously inferior graphics game that this was because they worked on the gameplay (because normal companies obviously use developers to work on drawing polygons).  The graphics are like that so WoW will run on a computer that has trouble running OoW.  The fact that they actually look pretty nice is quite impressive but it doesn't change the fact that the graphics are low quality to begin with.</div></div><hr />

that is only the case in collect quests from common mobs.  slaughter and assisnate quests give everyone in the group who is also doing the quest credit for the kill.  Its more effective to share.<br />
<br />
im very relieved the graphics in WoW dont require me to go buy a new machine.  I'd rather have a water fall that I can see that still looks cool as hell (Wailing Caverns for instance) than a cool looking waterfall that brings my comp to its knees.<br />

<br />
Turn on full graphics, notice the reflections on the dirt in the undead area, the warm glow of the cracked ground in the orcish deserts?<br />
<br />
How about the shading on the characters? in EQ/EQ2 (from screenshots i've seen) the shadows on characters are harsh, with jagged edges, in WoW it is gradual and smooth like a real shadow, only harsh when there is low light and only one light source<br />
<br />
Check out the way players bodies can effect the lighting of an area... perhaps gather a few friends around a camp fire and watch your shadows flicker along with the fire, blocking some of the dynamic lighting.<br />
<br />
Its only &quot;low quality&quot; because you are out to find a problem with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run the game on the default settings.<br />
<br />
I don't particularly care for the whether the water looks real or if the shadows look like what they're supposed to be.  I remember when FFX came out there was an article about how the way Yuna's hair moves is the most realistic hair movement ever done yet so we're supposed to just gape in awe because she has realistic hair movement.  I don't care about that.<br />
<br />
In general I'm only interested in the big picture.  For example, the gryphon flight from Ironforge to Stormwind when you fly over the statues is impressive, even if the number of polygons on them might not be very high.<br />
<br />
Things like character models, obviously WoW is on the lower end.  If it had higher specs, things would obviously look better, but it doesn't.  Don't confuse the fact that there's a ton of stuff with lots of polygons that don't look good with the fact that people are feeding you low polygons and try to pass it off as art.  If the graphics of WoW are good (and they are actually quite good) they could have been better if they're willing to put more specs into the models.  Since they chose not to they are inferior compare to what it could've been.  Now Blizzard's policy is to sell their game to the lowest denominator so far as computing power is concerned and I understand that.  But have you looked at say the WoW introduction?  All CG, high polygons FMV (I much prefer the game's style to their cheesy CGs, BTW).  You're telling me they're not trying to impress you with that?  Where's the cartoon-ness immersiveness with the obviously realistic modeled guys fighting it out with flash and fanfare in the introduction?  Clearly if Blizzard had infinite resources and everyone in the planet has a super computer, it'd stand to reason they'd want a game looking more like the introduction.  It's the CG realistic models that are being show off in the intro, not the cartoony graphics of the actual game.  <br />
<br />
Also in general most environments in WoW are pretty bland, though this isn't a problem unique to WoW.  In a MMORPG and actually most games how cool some place looks like is usually adversely tied to how uber the area is.  I've never been to Darnasscus but out of all the starting areas only Stormwind and the flight from IF to SW looks impressive.  The environment could use some variation from either forested happy land (Eastern Kingdom) or a chunk of barren rock (Kalimdor horde areas).  When I first went to Stormwind on my alliance character I really enjoyed the place, but as soon as you step out it's like 'hi welcome back to reality, no cool stuff for you until you level some more.'  I guess it's asking too much for a game like say Skies of Arcadia, where the entire world just looks amazing from the beginning to the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it interesting that you would think WoW's environments are bland.  For the most part, whether I agree with your opinion or not, I find your opinion to have great merit.  In this instance, I completely disagree.  I think the developers in WoW have managed to create a vibrant and engaging world in almost every section of the map.  The shadows glint through the trees in Elwyn, Stonetalon, Darkshore; the grass feels like it ought to actually sway in the wind (and I can hear the wind) in Westfall, the wind eerily whistles through the canyons in the Barrens and Desolace, the way the sun glints off the snow is downright breathtaking in Dun Morogh.   I'm only 37 but so far I haven't found that the higher level areas are any cooler looking simply because they are higher areas.  But then again the low level areas look awesome to me.  I think the bright colors, combined with music and envorinmental effects, makes me feel like I'm really PART of the world.  <br />
<br />
What I find most strange about this is that when someone posts a screenshot of their character in the world I do often find myself thinking &quot;that looks kinda cartoony and unreal, plus the lines look jagged and poor.&quot;  All of which may very well be true.  But somehow when I'm actually IN the game, it feels very real to me for a variety of reasons, mostly related I think to the fact that for me (at least) the environments are the farthest thing from bland.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what they were going for was having the shaders provide the depth to the skin and the faces, but the lack of any shiny, oiled or highlighted areas make them look like gumbie... I just had a look at it on my brothers trial account.<br />
<br />

Like I said, there's far too many examples of things with lots of specs/polygons on them that do turn out to look ugly.  This doesn't change the fact that something that looks good with low specs really should look better because of the tools we have available today.  If WoW graphics are good to you with their low specs it'd stand to reason it'd look even better if it runs on say a level compare to EQ2's specs.  Now there are technological limitations to doing things like that but I've found Blizzard always aim too low and is content being just good enough.  Yet if you look at their cinematics you can obviously see that's what they're shooting for.  Starcraft, Diablo 2, and now WoW pretty much all try to put FMVs as a graphical highlight.  If this is the direction they want to go then they should make every effort to pump out high spec graphics because it takes a lot of practice to get this right.  I mean, Square's been doing FMVs forever and it's not until FFX2 until they actually managed to integrate CGs into a RPG in a meaningful way.  I hate FFX2 but whenever I look at Yuna's concert, I'm forced to admire that this scene can't possibly have the same impact without the beautiful graphics.  War3 appears to be trying to go along the line of real time CGs ala MGS series, and again, you can't compare War3's rudimentary real time cut scenes to Metal Gear Solid.  It's not necessarily Konami is a better company but they've been trying this for a lot longer, so they're beter at simply due to experience.<br />
<br />
As for the terrain, I think the first forest or the great plains or the barrens 'zone' you go to is interesting.  But take Kalimdor, you go from Durotar (mostly barren place) to Barrens (really barren) then Stonetalon (barren land in the mountains) and Thousand Needle (more barren land by the mountains) and some variety couldn't hurt.  I understand there's supposed to be a theme to the continents but a theme of forest or grassland or barrens can only be interesting so long.</div></div><hr />

That's true.  But seeing Blizzard is pretty much the #1 computer company (they're certainly one of the most successful one) they owe the fans something better.  You should not look at something from the #1 company and say 'well it's really better than it looks'.  This is the excuse second rate companies use to explain why their products looks inferior.  You don't look at a game from one of the top console companies and have to explain that despite the outdated graphics it's quite an amazing game when you actually play it.</div></div><hr />

I do agree that the horde areas, for the most part, look pretty barren.  I kinda feel sorry for the horde because they tend to play in &quot;ugly&quot; zones.  On the other hand, there is variety in the larger scheme of things.  Sure half of a continent has the same theme and may look barren (although the variety of barren changes), but you look elsewhere and there are drastically different looks.   <br />
<br />
I never felt that wealth of difference with EQ.  I could go from Qeynos, through the Karanas, through the commonlands, into Kunark...and feel that I was mostly in the same area.   I never get that feel in WoW.  You get forests, scary grey forests, jungle forests,  redwood forests, colorful elfy forests...and then you get the desert, utah, the mud-caked desert, the plains, the oasis, the lush plains, the swamps, the mountains, the snowy mountains, nebraska corn fields, south dakota badlands - and they are all so different in the vibrant colors and environmental sounds that I really do feel like I've moved on to somewhere else.   Still, though, they did a little too well at making the barren horde areas depressing  :p <br />
<br />
I also agree that the graphics could have been more stunning and utilized more fully the design technology available today.  But I don't think you understood what I meant when I said the graphics are better than they look.  I didn't mean that defensively.  I meant that you cannot get the full beauty and immersion of the graphics by looking at a screenshot.  Because a screenshot cannot capture everything the developer designed into that moment, including the brightness of the sun, the wind russeling the leaves in the nearby trees, the shadow on the ground from a bird flying overhead, the eerie native american music ... With the addition of all these elements, the experience is far more superior and compelling than it would appear from a simple screenshot and it in effect renders the entire experience stunning - which is why, I think, so many people blindly defend the WoW graphics in play.  In other words, focusing on the graphics alone is, I think, an error.    But even if you do focus simply on the graphics, I prefer how they look over EQs or EQ2s.  The only graphics I've liked more were FFXI, but the graphics caused the game not to run as smoothly on my system - and taken as a whole with the other musical and environmental effects, the entire experience in FFXI was not as good (for me, at least).</div></div><hr />

In large scale PvP I haven't noticed that WoW's lower polygon graphics helped the lag.  Yesterday I participated in a maybe-60-people PvP battle over Southshore.  It was sooooo laggy that I would cast my insta-cast heal (Talent) and the shit wouldn't land for a good 7 seconds, within which whomever I was trying to heal would be dead because he ACTUALLY started taking damage 12 seconds ago but it didn't register.  I couldn't look at the battle without my screen halting altogether.<br />
<br />
I was incredibly disappointed with the system's inability to keep up in battles.  I'm curious how they'll remedy the problem in the Battlegrounds.  Has anyone else noticed the lag in large-scale PvP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitly their side but I am guessing thats why they wish to make battleground zones that have a very low number of NPCs (don't forget the server has to track and move all those critters, monsters and guards roaming around) also keep in mind the size of the zones (some of which take 15 minutes to cross)<br />
<br />
My line of thought is that if a zone (and I am guessing there is one server per zone working under a master server) is made without XP monsters then it has 200+ less moving monsters to track, so more of the system can be put to combat tracking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PC lagging can't just be a server issue.  There really isn't that much stuff to keep track of in any particular zone, no more than any other MMORPG out there.  Also the server tells you a lot less about a zone compare to say, EQ.  In EQ you have to know where everything in the zone is, otherwise stuff like tracking or ShowEQ can't possibly work (how can you know if a spawn is up unless the server tells you it's there?)  In WoW this is definitely not true.  When you're halfway across the zone, you do not know if anything exists in the inn, or the town for that matter.<br />
<br />
I suspect the reason is that WoW actually doesn't run all that efficiently.  WoW uses the same trick with D2 as you, the player, does not know about anything beyond about 100 yards from you.  Further the leashing code ensures that it is literally impossible to see an NPC that's about 500 yards from you.  So when you combine all that, WoW assumes that you only need to load very few NPCs at once, and that assumption allows WoW to run on very low-end machines.<br />
<br />
But just like in D2 this performance gain catches up to you in the ways of Duriel killing you while loading, in WoW the performance gain catches up to you in the form of PC because there is absolutely no restriction on the number of PCs you can see at where you are at any given time.  I ran WoW on a low spec laptop and I find that running into any PCs adversely affects my ability to play this game, but I can kill NPCs in deserted areas forever without any issues.</div></div><hr />

You can cram 72 people in TimeB and the biggest slowdown I see is when the adds come out on Saryrn/TT (probably because whoever optimizies these things forgot to load them, just like whoever optimized D2's graphics engine forgot to load Duriel before you enter his room).  EQ's philosphy is that in every zone, some psycho will train every possible model of NPC in front of you while you're in a party with every PC race and illusion available, which is why you still have a decent loading time even for a tiny zone like The Nexus.<br />
<br />
WoW, on the other hand, assumes you're in your own little corner of the universe that will never see more than about 5 NPC models at the same time.  It's blazing fast when these conditions are true, which is just about everything that doesn't have anything to do with large PvP.  This issue doesn't even affect me because I prefer to be in my own little corner of the universe.  I figure it'd help if people understand why they're getting low performance in PvP which has nothing to do with WoW servers themselves, unless their servers are really bad (espcially considering WoW servers give much less info to each client compare to any MMORPG with a zoning setup).</div></div><hr />

But while they are loading chug chug chug chug.  It gets worse in the mass PvP.  I've noticed it on my so-so system, my friends with their latest and greatest notice it, people with crappy systems notice it.  Hehe, its just laggy as hell when you cram hundreds of players in the same spot in the game world.  I dunno that Blizz is gonna have better luck than anyother joe thats stepped up to that plate.</div></div><hr />

Complaining is one thing, complaining because of something that's you're own fault is another. Will I complain when someone trains me? Sure. Will I complain when I train myself? No. I don't kick myself in the nuts then wonder why it hurts.<br />
<br />
-Edit- I re-read your posts, and I do realize that you were just stating graphic facts, I was under the impression you didn't like them. But you can't say you haven't complained about the game difficulty or mechanics, that's what our whole debate was about before.</div></div><hr />

Would you really like it if WoW is some 1.5D (or was it 2.5D?) overhead game like Diablo 2 (e.g. like Ragnarok Online)?  It'd probably still be a fun game, and certainly there is no reason why anything in WoW couldn't be translated to such a mode.

No trick there.  If anything I'd like a way to turn down the grapics to make em look even less cool so that I may get increased game performance.  But even with stick figure graphics my gut tells me it'll still be laggy in mass PvP.  But even in the suck ass lag I still find I enjoy myself immensly.</div></div><hr />

Ah the irony!).  It's just a game, people, much like any other MMO.  And people will have opinions with which you don't agree, and they'll state them, while still enjoying the overall game.  It's not as if we are personally pissing in your cornflakes.  We are just having a discussion about the game ... in an outhouse thread ... entitled So, how is EQ2? .... on TSW EQ forums. <br />
<br />
Me?  I love WoW and love almost everything about it.  But I hate what it is doing to my system.  I have a pretty darn good system and it ran EQ raids on almost full effects without problem.  AMD Athlon 1gz processor, 1g RAM, ATI Radeon 9700 video card.  My boyfriend has a brand new Alienware with a 64bit AMD Athlon and GeForce 5200 Ultra.  Neither of us could do a single THING in the WoW PvP raid.</div></div><hr />

People complained about Diablo 2/Starcraft's primitive graphics even though you can find a zillion guys claiming they were 'good enough' or 'looks better in the game' or 'it's gameplay that matters' which is why there's some semblance of modern technology in the current Blizzard games. Would you really like it if WoW is some 1.5D (or was it 2.5D?) overhead game like Diablo 2 (e.g. like Ragnarok Online)?

What's the point behind this?<br />
<br />
I just said that I'll ignore the fact that you actually didn't have a problem with the graphics even though I thought you did. Before you're bashing WoW's gameplay constantly and shooting down everything about the game, now all of the sudden you're saying WoW would &quot;probably still be a fun game&quot;, implying you think it's fun in the first place. <br />
<br />
Arguing, debating, complaining is good and all, but it seems to me all Phant is trying to do is stir shit up. One minute he's bashing the hell out of the game, the next he's telling us how it's fine. If you have a point, then make your point because all you're doing is contradicting yourself.<br />
<br />
I don't know why WoW players are so defensive of their game<br />
I could care less if people actually like WoW, I'm just debating because I disagree with some opinions, there's nothing wrong with that. My only problem is that everytime I try people just take back what they say. They post something like &quot;WoW is such a horrible game&quot;, then I say well &quot;this is why I think WoW isn't a horrible game&quot;, then they reply and say &quot;I never said I thought WoW was a horrible game&quot; -  Just pick a side and stick with it.<br />
<br />
I mean if you honestly want me to I can garantee I can just quote some posts and show how people are just contradicting themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also, Phantron: is that with Luclin PC models on or off? how many?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to run with only human male models on (since I'm a human male).  After I upgraded my computer I had all the models on, but haven't seen 72 people on raid since then.<br />
<br />
Though I suppose it has to do with the fact that you rarely have to be looking at the 71 other guys in a raid too, since EQ obviously only renders what you can see.  But I'm pretty sure EQ already loads every possible permutation of face/hair/whatever of everyone, and any slowdown associated with having lots of people is just the inherent time needed to draw and keep track of that many people and I'm not aware of any clever breakthrough in algorithms that can reduce that time.  I strongly suspect WoW doesn't load every possible permutation of player model which would lead to bigger loading spikes during large PvP since the game looks like it's modeled after D2 in terms of the 'seamless world' aspect, which would explain why people's performance takes a nose dive in PvP when you can't get away with loading a large number of models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why I think they are making a battlefield zone for the soul reason of PvP lag.<br />
<br />
They may use a modified code that renders all PC's with a slow load time like EQ, since it does not need to mess with NPC's<br />
<br />
If you were not aware these will be &quot;instance&quot; zone ins without the instance privacy, as such there will be a zone in regardless of what you do.</div></div><hr />
