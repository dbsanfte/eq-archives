<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I've seen them linked, and I'm just wondering --<br />
<br />
Where can I find a little ditty on how to get the Vadd's armor drops?  I have heard a bunch of rumors regarding which zone they come from, what targets need to be raided, and how much the components cost...<br />
<br />
is anyone talkin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Everything I've seen on other boards (like cleric and beastlord) is the Muramite armor (Vadd for Warriors) has major drops in Qvic or whatever the name of the zone is after Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vadd's is the warrior armor set that is made from the drops in qvic.  It's similair to Elemental armor in that it has to be &quot;quested&quot; to be combined.  The armor is slightly better than the high quality potime gear, and the gloves have the effect &quot;Echo of Anger&quot; on them...mmmmmm so nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Helmet = very tasty too, 5% shielding.. mmm :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very very nice!  /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">30% to hate with Vadd's gloves (assuming you have Raex BP) would be pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I suspect Echo of Anger won't stack with itself.  Now given the history of worn stacking, it really should (e.g. FT1 stacks with FT1) but it'd be pretty overpowered if it did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt it will.  They will just put a cap on the %'age for EoA.  For instance already having FT15, adding a FT3 item still nets you FT15.  Same with ATK cap and Regen cap etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay...I was of the impression that &quot;nobody has gotten past Uqua&quot;...<br />
<br />
then again, though, I havent been reading other guild boards and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Who got to Qvic?  and When?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urgot_the_ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Arch Overseers have beaten Uqua as a server wide first. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, Township Rebellion killed it, then Arch Overseers the night after them, and Talisman about 3 hours after AO.<br />
<br />
Edit: To the best of my knowledge, TR has not been to Qvic yet. AO and Talisman have had a few groups farming it almost nonstop since they killed Barxt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bracer : 50ac 220hp 4% Striketrough (sucks Quarm is a lot better)<br />
Boots : 60ac 225hp +8 Accuraty (I still prefer the 52/190 2% shielding boots)<br />
Helm : 65ac 230hp 5% Shielding (HOLY SHIT ! bye bye Raex/Faerune)<br />
Gloves : 60ac 225hp +5 Avoidance EoAnger (Really Really nice even if they dont stack)<br />
Arms : 65ac 230hp 5% Spellshield (Nice arms)<br />
BP : 110ac 300hp 4% Shielding 4% Spellshield (Owns despite the useless effect)<br />
<br />
Overall a reasonably better than Raex set. <br />
Some pieces cant compete with Time/Inkkiz Loot which is sad.<br />
I doubt legs will be better than Jointed Scale Greaves.<br />
Nice charisma (1 buff slot opened). <br />
<br />
Something tells me Shielding &amp; Spellshield are gonna be vital later in GoD.<br />
Since 20% of each isnt so impossible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Damnit Throag, why do you have to make this such a cause? Its nice shit, paladins get nice shit too, we get defensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Regarding the bp --<br />
<br />
Vadd's bp, from what I've heard, is only mined, and is most likely a fake mine (or not an updated link).<br />
<br />
Compare the other pieces (bracer, say) with Raex, and you'll notice a significant increase (75hp increase from a 145hp bracer = 50%'ish)<br />
<br />
Now look at raex bp vs vadd bp: 50hp increase over 250hp = 20%?  I doubt it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Now look at effects. Raex Gaunts = AoB, datamined Raex bp = clicky Avatar<br />
<br />
Vadd Gauntlets = EoA, datamined Vadd BP = crappy crit bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">BP/Legs are probably gunna come from Tacvi or whatever endzone of god is, so i'm sure its going to going to be better then the mined shit.<br />
<br />
Re: HP/AC on god armor, its sorta fucked up, clerics get as much hp and ac as paladins and shm get as much HP, but i doub i'll get much sympathy here p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think increasingly in EQ at the highest level of the game, the inherent skill/stats of a player outweigh the comparative ac/hp.<br />
<br />
I mean, if a cleric has the same AC/HP as a Paladin, you still won't have the cleric tanking... the paladin's defense and avoidance skills like parry etc are WAY higher.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately to last through some of these fights its not just the tanks that need superb ac/hp to live -- everybody does. It's time for people to put their envy behind and come to grips with the fact that to survive some of this Gates content everybody needs to be extremely well equipped.<br />
<br />
For what its worth, the amount of spell shielding and shielding on Vadd's armor is scaring the snot out of me re: what's to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">FYI - If you want to keep up with who is killing what:<br />
<br />
Coincidentally we got into Qvic this evening.  I hope we never have to go back to Uqua ever again heh ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Qvic is amazing, my new favourite zone. Went with 3 groups exploring, a ton of named and most pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Awesome place, and gratz me on Vadd Helm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Okay, so assume I'm in Qvic.<br />
<br />
How do you define the zone?<br />
<br />
Is it like pre-nerfed fire (where 3 groups could take most minis that dropped EP, single group could still get what equal'ed tier2-3 loot)?  So 3 groups can get 2xQvic loot, and one group can get KT/Ikkinz raid style loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">it's probably ganna drop a shit load of rediculasly good gear from easy encounters for the first month people are farming it to build up the hype and then they will totally blow up the mobs to something like EP god difficulty.<br />
<br />
also, i doubt the vadd gloves and raex BP will stack, since precentage based focus effects dont stack, like nuke focus that increases damage%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">God quest armor is a clusterfuck.  Aside from the hp upgrade, the rest of the upgrade is marginal at best when comparing elemental, now compare the items to equivalent time items, and the upgrade isnt even worth taking for the most part.  I miss the days when an upgrade was for real, like going from vt to elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bitch bitch, moan moan, its still the best gear available in the game, aquirable with 1 group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about the days when going from NToV to Ssra named loot...  I don't think that VT to Elemental should be the rule to this game but rather an exception.  You can't keep giving players 40+ hp upgrades in every slot every tier of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

But yes, 'tis true. We'd won first prior to Arch Overseers, but recieved no flags for our efforts =\<br />

<br />
Yes, gotta pony up the cash for the solvent for the combine.  I think its 10,499 exactly, not sure as i didnt get any pieces yet =)<br />
<br />
On the flip side, the zone was taken down for like 5 minutes earlier today, and the named spawns havent popped since, this happen for anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">So just to recap on the BP; so far, only 5(?) guilds are in Qvic, where pieces necessary to the armor quests drop.  So far, none of these guilds are confirming they have a BP yet?  To this point in time, nobody can confirm a Vadd's BP being in game yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yes you need 10,499pp for a vendor item as part of the armour recipe.<br />
<br />
As far as i know the vadd bp was only a mined link, which has been around for weeks/months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">On the flip side, the zone was taken down for like 5 minutes earlier today, and the named spawns havent popped since, this happen for anyone else?<br />
<br />
Yup apprently the repop time is like 5 hours now per mini (im not sure exactly) but when the zone went down on Tunare (I Assume across all servers) the first named did not pop until 12pm EST.  I was not online when the zone went down so if you can give a time it was taken down than there is your repop time give or take a little.<br />
<br />
I guess SoE figured 60 armor pieces + in 1 weekend drop for our guild was to much :) hehehe.  Thankfully I have most of the pieces I was interested in now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm sure they know about the drop rate, just keeping it high up to reward the people who have been grinding on Uqua.  It can't be that hard to take every loot dropper in the named and just have their respawn time increase by 8 times or whatever.</div></div><hr />

I dunno cant log on to check yet, hope not, wouldnt make sense though unless they replaced it with a totally different effect since each item has a % effect of something, either accuracy, avoidance, spell shield, shield etc.</div></div><hr />
