<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So whats everyone's take on the fighter archtypes now that monks get to be official tanks and has anyone found any info on what makes the guardian special? is it more HP or just higher AC maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My understanding is that an encounter that would require/prefer a warrior in EQ, would just require a fighter. if thats the case then I imagine they just have special moves and abilites that are different than monks. The devs have stated many times that things do not work the same as they do in EQ. The classes are totally change, only some of the names remain the same.<br />
<br />
Groups prefer one of each archtype, beyond that their doesn't seem to be any class preferences. Unlike EQ where clerics are preferred healers to the exclusion of druids and shamen in most non-trival content. Whereas, EQ any of the healer archtypes will do just as good at healing as any other.<br />
<br />
Their's no &quot;pure class&quot; preference like there is in EQ. Beyond that, which has been said already, I think we'll just have to wait till EQ2 comes out to see.<br />
<br />
I can't wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here. In EQ 1 over 5 1/2 years i had 3 mains a Druid a Monk and last was a Cleric.  As a raid leader cleric was the best class to direct the masses. <br />
<br />
But in EQ 2 I want to be in the mix more and looking toward probably the guardian/bezerker class with either iksar or ogre as race.  (our guild has chosen evil to be our starting point hehe)  Just wish they would release a small amount of info as to the general differences to the classes. I know its still in beta and most things will change but at least give us thier idea of how they want one to stand out slightly among the others.<br />
<br />
I'm actually glad they pushed back the release date for more testing. I'd hate to run into what alot of other mmorpg's ran into with just throwing it out there and being gone the next month or two.  But then again cant help thinking how long did we wait for horizon to have it turn into something i flushed last week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rather like how the 4 archetypes each have a different role in their abilities, and each class/subclass in that archetype can handle that core role as easily as any other.  The differences being how they go about doing it, and what other abilities they come with.<br />
<br />
Honestly it's the only way I can think of to balance about 40+ classes.  Now if they only followed that train of thought in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SOE's EQ train of thought derailed a loooong time ago from what i hear lol</div></div><hr />
