<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ClaytonWHunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 41 froggie warrior, I have never really had much plat, but now I have ways to make it. I need to know what gear I should get now though. I know I need AC and STA buffing gear. but what would be good. and what are the average costs. here is my magleo any suggestions would be appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are some sets of armor that have been in the game a while:<br />

<br />
n many slots, crusty or crafted would be an upgrade for you, and should be fairly cheap. <br />
At about this level of gear are also some player-made armor pieces that require components from LDoN--gothic, sandblasted, frosted, etc. They come in various sizes, so be sure you can wear what you are buying. Check the merchants near forges in PoK or bazaar.<br />
<br />
Don't know what your budget is, but the above suggestions are short-term only: as soon as you got them, you'd need to look for better. If you can afford to spend 2K per piece of armor rather than 100pp, then look around for barbed ringmail stuff or steel-wrapped (bah, whatever it's called).<br />
<br />
But, basically, search the bazaar by your budget, race/religion, class and order by AC. Look at the best AC stuff, then STA/hitpoints among those choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, just search bazaar and make sure you fill in all the info.. ive bought quite a few things i couldnt use heh. also, watch out for required lvl items and such... ur armor is pretty decent, but again, have no idea what ur budget is... If you were to spend approx. 200pp on each piece, you could easily get more crustacean armor for that needed sta, and/or the calcified set of armor for the agility.. and i believe deep cavern? for dex.... Enchanted dwarven plate for a frog war would work well, with the + to str and sta... all depends on ur budget hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It looks that completing a full set of crustacean shell armor would be a solid idea for you at this point.  It's cheap, and easy to obtain. <br />
<br />
Also might want to look into getting a helmet, or update your magelo =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how much you got to spend, that would help us out alot in suggesting gear. At 41 I see you making about 200-400pp a day. so if you can give us a lil bit more info on how much you got to spend it would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">also you got ~6 more levels left in that wurmy; so you might want to look for a new mainhander with a proc.<br />
sadly; anyhting decent is goign to come with a hefty pricetag to a casual player, so try to sock away the $$$'s for a droga weapon ( copper hammer of striking or sword of the bloodsworn )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ClaytonWHunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sorry I forgot to put how much I make, normal day I can make about 1000pp, yesterday was a good day I made 3000pp, I have about 5000pp right now. so I can make enough money to get something fairly decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Odd, nobody has mention getting 2 6ac 65hp rings, 300-400pp each. Tattered Mantle, 100pp or so. Glimmering Mithril Torque, 15 ac in neck slot for a few plat off a trader or a couple gold off a merchant is nice.<br />
<br />
You could also try going over to Maiden's Eye and asking to loot a Goranga Spiked Club to practice 1hb. Perhaps the 20ac 15 str/wis belt may drop (Axgoreth's Belt of Defense). There's tons of upgrades in ME for you, just watch out for trains and don't wander too far from DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">should be able to get a sword of the bloodsworn for about 3-4k then =)</div></div><hr />
