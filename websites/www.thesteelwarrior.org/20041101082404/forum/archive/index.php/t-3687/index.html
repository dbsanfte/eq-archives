<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">AS you know I have 3 wizards, 1 chanter, 1 cleric one warrior (check magelo he breaks 1400 AC with Virtue and self buff from BP and SoV).... <br />
<br />
It seems that against &quot;run of the mill&quot; mobs, i.e. Diaku in PoTactics under level 65....  this &quot;hold agro&quot; bussiness has not been paying off for me at all. Here are the bad things about holding agro.<br />
<br />
1) Warrior has to pull ... warrior does not have pacification. Nor sow unless I burn through potions.... Nor Bliss is case of double pull (has to return to group and endanger them whereas chanter can just try and bliss out in the field if he does cool if not he die and not endage rest of group)<br />
<br />
2) Chanter must wait before Tashing and then wait even longer before slowing... All this time Mob doing Max damage.<br />
<br />
3) Wizards have to sit and wait before they can caste, mob is again doing lots of damage (even with my warrior 1400AC) during this period of time... Using Tears of Aycal (or whatever its called a minues 300 fire rian) lets tem caste fairly early because its a very low agro spell.<br />
<br />
4) Cleric is diong a lot of healing, waiting until 60 or 50 perceont to start a CH is dicy, starting a CH at 90 is just a waste of the CH. Doing lots of little fast heals is takiing lots of mana. <br />
<br />
The whole problem boils down to the mob staying alive for so much longer and doing damage to only one toon, the cleric just has to do to much healing 20 extra seconds of damage from a Daiku Warrior, even slowed, is no joke and requires mana to heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I do now is just pull with Tash, attack with warrior in DPS set up, and Blast with the 3 wizards even while the mob is on incoming (can do 3K damage to mob beofre mob is in mellee range). The mob is slowed way faster (usually the chanter will get interupted on his first cast of slow but then the wizards take agro and his second cast lands)  and lives a good 33percent less time. i mean killing the mob in 40 seconds is WAY better then killing the mob in 60 seconds with the hold agro method. Cleric just does a group elexer (300 HP per tick to everyone in the whole group - lasts 6 ticks with my AA's) and spots heals with SR whoever gets 40percnet or less. Also sometimes the warrior will get agro with a sucess taun (I spam taunt) and if the mob interupts a wizards casting ususaly one of the other wizards will get the agro. Sure wizards are week with lousy 800AC but they are at like LR2 or so and have 500HP rune, and are getting 300HP a tick from group exlar and the mob is only going to last 7 ticks anyway.. , and the damage is spread umousnt mulitiple toons  ... The bottom line is the battle is over way faster which save a lot of cleric mana (although wizard mana does go down a lot faster).....<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course the warrior is only level 62 now with no AA (run3 and met1 heh) so maybe things will change, I know that I cannot do this with mobs quading for 800 or so but, for yard trash mobs this seems a bit more effective for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">huh? Maybe try learning how to play a warrior first, and then the &quot;hold agro method&quot; you speak of will work. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here are the bad things about holding agro. <br />
<br />
Lol Im sorry, but I laughed :p<br />
<br />
1) Yes, warriors dont have pacify, it has been like that for 65lvls, and how come I was puller and I am puller for groups? Well, just use your brains and think how the pathing will be, if you cant pull at all cause adds will come, I ask the group cleric to come with me and pacify. Sure, you can send the chanter to pull, but which chanter with the head on his shoulders will go and pull and die?<br />
<br />
2) Well yes, with chanters I have a harder time getting agro after slow cause with shammies their debuff is almost no agro, so I just taunt on slow. You can Tash, taunt, wait a few secs (around 6), slow, taunt? Thats the worse scenario, meaning you didnt proc anything or your chanter can cast any Visage line of spells to boost your agro on inc.<br />
<br />
3) Of course that if a wizzy casts along with the chanter slowing, your warrior is gonna go crazy getting the agro, thats why, the wizzies hold until you get at least the agro off the slow.<br />
<br />
But of course, all this applies to a group consisting of real persons coordinating and playing together. If Im in a group and someone comes with the crazy idea of letting the mob ping pong on the wizards while the cleric spot heals them and I do dmg, first, I would disband and second, advice the group to get a DPS meele class, cause if the tank is not tanking, what is the tank for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">might want to try the kite room in tactics, since you seem to have a bad grasp of how to control agro. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Warrior is not the class to pick for your insta kill agro needs<br />
<br />
No personal attacks. - Raaj</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The kiting rooms are good, a wizzy, druid, ranger, shammy and cleric friend used to kite ogres in there, of course, when I logged on and tag along with em, it changed to me tanking, and we noticed its much faster cause the mob is still, and that also means rangers get bonus dmg (on mobs not rooted) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya I have not been using visages or concussion to control agro, just waiting... Well I am just comparing the two systems, given that the ping pong method works why not use it, I get the warrior exp faster so that I can start to tank named mobs where I am sure the hold agro methed will be required. <br />
<br />
Im not saying I cannot hold agro I ahve done so, it just takes 20 extra seconds to kill the mob compared to the ping pong method... And in comparing the two different styles it seems the ping pong method is more effective on lower level type mobs, of course my group is 5 casters and 1 mellee, so its not really a surprise that a caster type of approach would be a bit more effective then a mellee centered approach. <br />
<br />
I been pulling with my chanter even AOE pulls, I dont understand why people resist chanters as being a good puller. <br />
<br />
1) Permant SoW, anywhere with scaled wolf illusion and AA that lets you zone with illions.<br />
<br />
2) Pacify and Mezz and Tash<br />
<br />
3) 2000HP in Runes - i.e. you dont take one point of damage until the mob does you 2000HP in damage.... So 3300HP or so with virtue plus 2000HP in runes is not so shabby<br />
<br />
4) Gate Heh...<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way although the mob is aquiring differnet targets I don't ping pong in that all my guys are together tight, so that the warrior never has to move during the battle. The mob hits differnt targets but the mob does not move.....<br />
<br />
I dont kite, anther waste of time. I tash, slow, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke heal nuke, heal mob dead. Like I say a Daiku Warrior (more hitpoisnt then guardian or scout) lasts about 50 seconds. Whereas with the hold agro method where only the warrior takes damage fight goes about 70 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I am looking forward to getting my warrior a lot stronger adn start farming some PHAT LOOTZ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sam, maybe you should be looking for eq.multiboxer.com or something.<br />
<br />
For what you are trying to accomplish, I would advise making a shadowknight.  You need a puller who can hold agro from the start and fast.  From your description of how you do thinks, you seem to want to not tank a lot, but burn the mobs down fast.  Well, a SK can do that.  Actually, i know a SK on xegony who 4 boxes who does exactly that, he holds agro on 4 mobs at a time and his enchanter is mearly there for KEI, Haste, and Tash, in that order.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you cant even concieve of asking your cleric to assist you to pacify, why are you asking on the warrior board what to do?  If i was the warrior pulling, in that group, and the cleric wouldnt help with pacification, i would leave.  The cleric isnt pulling thier weight, or the enchanter isnt (you cant mez an add?!)<br />
So, if you cant box them as good as a group could play them, then why play a warrior?<br />
<br />
My guess, you like dual wielding, and think a warrior does more damage than a SK, so wanted to go with warrior, never thinking about how badly you are perverting what a real tank can do.<br />
<br />
Second, drop the SBoD and get a real agro procing weapon, as everyone has told you to do.  If you get an early agro proc, bam, your problem is solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">huh? Maybe try learning how to play a warrior first, and then the &quot;hold agro method&quot; you speak of will work <br />
<br />
Keeping aggro as a warrior isn't much work, it's luck and OTHER people doing the work.  Note also that his point isn't that he can't keep aggro, it's that having everyone walking on eggshells so the warrior keeps taunt is not efficient.<br />
<br />
I know all the tricks, been using them a long time, but that doesn't give us near the aggro required to make us comparably efficient tanks.  We either take some unslowed rounds or the slower is gonna get pounded on in most cases, and to me neither is efficient given the state of other classes.<br />
<br />
And Sam, many told you that knights would be a better choice.  SK can fd pull, DA, and grab and hold aggro before the mob is in camp, much more efficient for your situation especially.  I agree with dropping the SBoD also, it's crap aggro and the dps from it isn't worth bothering over procers with somewhat worse ratios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hussar, im talking about droping that sbod for a real agro procing weapon, like a boc, gsot, chos, etc. That would help, yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So, you ready to put down the preconcieved notions of what you think are best and listen to reason now?<br />
<br />
People told you your Splitblade was shit.  You didn't listen.<br />
<br />
People told you warriors weren't going to be any good for what you planned on doing.  You didn't listen.<br />
<br />
Now you come back and tell us that you can't do exactly what we told you that you couldn't do, and then you argue with that.  Lemme break this down for you.  If it's not efficient to hold aggro with your warrior right now, then it will NEVER be efficient.  Not when he's 65, not when you're tanking mobs that drop &quot;phat loot,&quot; never.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry man, but coming here for advice, ignoring it, and then bitching about how your way doesn't work is just hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Umm... When you go for PHAT LOOTZ on a boss mob you are not out to kill 100 of them in a row as fast as possilbe, your object is to kill one mob and get out alive. Killing yard trash for exp and killing boss mobs for lootz are two different things entirely.<br />
<br />
I can ALWAYS hold agro 100 percent of the time if I dont cast with the wizards until the mob is 70 percent health. Its no matter what weapon is used what matters is how long does the wizards wait before casting. If they cast when mob is 99 percent health it does not matter what the warrior does, they will get agro, if they cast when mob is 70 percent health they will never get agro no matter what the warrior does, no matter what weapones he uses. <br />
<br />
Im just pointing out that it more effiecite, i.e. against yard trash where your objuct is it kill as many mobs as FAST as possible to let the wizards take agro.<br />
<br />
Although the cleric has pacify its the CHANTER that has the pacify as the puller, a little bit more convient when the main puller has pacify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not complaining, I am just a bit disapointed that its more efficient to ping pong then to hold agro against yard trash mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its called aggro management.<br />

Learn how a warrior does it and learn what you cant do with your other classes that cause early aggro for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arthorius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yea, First thing i'd say to do is lose the SBoD and get a procing weapon like the CHoS or save up for a BoC or something.</div></div><hr />

You could tash np right after a proc (search the xxx is stunned by planar energy) or after a good string of hits.<br />
<br />
Also don't hesitate to macro &quot;/shield samchanter&quot; (or whatever his name is). /shield also help to regain aggro fast.<br />
<br />
edit : oh, and SBoD is crap. aggro is all for warriors, DPS and hp/ac on your usual weapons are secondary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this is what everyone has been telling you since day one.  When warriors have time to generate aggro, we're fine.  When we don't, we're crap.  Seriously, people have told you this multiple times, and now you come back like it's some fuckin revelation or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sam, your warrior needs aggro proccing weapons, NOT DPS.  Get a Willsapper and Anklesmasher and I think you'll have better luck with the &quot;hold aggro&quot; technique.<br />
<br />
Pull with warrior, run back to Enchanter and hit your /shield enchanter hotkey while he tash's and slows.  You'll get aggro back and once you do you'll have surpassed the tash+slow aggro level, allowing the wizards to begin revving up their dps engines.  Aggro procs will put you that much further ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;I am just a bit disapointed that its more efficient to ping pong then to hold agro against yard trash mobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Efficient on time maybe, not efficient on mana. Your cleric has to heal the whole group. On the other hand, with the mob always centered on 1 person, it has to CH 1 time and drop a HoT.<br />
1CH+1HoT vs 6Elixirs (I think thats the quick heal)+1CH on your warrior<br />
<br />
So, with the 'ping pong technique' you save time on each mob, but you lose mana, you will have to stop pulling to regain some mana at some point on your cleric, that time you stopped to med is the time you 'saved' by ping ponging. Also, by making casters tank, they will have a bigger chance of dying, which also adds time to rez em, med em back to full and rebuff em.<br />
With the 'hold agro technique' (the only one on my book), maybe you lose a few secs on each mob, but you dont have to med at any point cause your cleric is only dropping 2 heals and guess what, he can even nuke a bit to add DPS, meaning that those 'few seconds' difference might turn to null, plus, you dont have any cleric med 'delay'. In this case, your warrior tanks, IF he dies (only if your cleric went OOM or you forgot to heal him), you only have to rez him, he doesnt require to med (no mana) and only have to rebuff him.<br />
So, Ping Pong = 40sec/mob + med time of your cleric (at some point)+ time used to rez/rebuff casters (and you have 5 casters)<br />
Hold Agro=60sec/mob - Xamount of secs that are gained if the cleric decides to use his spare mana to nuke + time used to rez/rebuff the warrior (which is less than 1 caster and IF he dies)<br />
<br />
What is more efficient?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, I think I am doing mobs of 2 low a level. I did some killings on the level 65 Forboding Guards in PoN and things went very well indeed, as if there is no rush to kill the mobs the extra time does not really matter. I get more exp for the higher level mobs so naturally I dont have to kill as many.<br />
<br />
I still pull with chanter but with only tash the warrior takes the agro easy fairly fast and then I wait 2 percent or so and do a slow and the mob stays on the warrior... Then just hammer it down to 70 percnet (I am PLing the warrior) and open with the wizards and gets all the exp on the warrior - at least 2percent a level per kill (actally a bit more)..... Takes time to kill the mobs but they have to repop anyway.<br />
<br />
Ya red cons is more like it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya I gots a GSoT I am working up my 2HB now so as to max in all 4 main weapon skillz. <br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly warriors are just more effective overall against a few red cons instead of a lot of blue cons. If I want to kill blue cons Ill log the warrior and get back the 4th wizard (I can alternate chain stun with telkin and the mob dies without hitting anyone lol.... i.e. wiz 1 casts stun, other 3 casts nuke, then wizard 2 casts stun, other 3 casts nukes etc.) ....<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to clear up healing its 400mana for a 6 tick 500HP per tick on one target or 975 maan for a 6 tick 300HP per tick on everyone in the group. On the group heal there is another AA that lets me average the HP over all group memeber (with 3 mintue refresh nice) so like if 5 are 100percent and 1 is 10 percent all will go to liek 85 percent and then the group heal will heal them all up... a nice combo. <br />
<br />
The hodl agro was just taking all my cleric mana (but good for wizard mana) - I really need to be in an outdoor zone I think where i can use my reptiles for medding, thats like FT27 added, which would make a lot of difference.</div></div><hr />

Do you see WHY we told you to make a hybrid tank?<br />
<br />
IS IT SINKING IN?<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to the warrior class, if you want fast kills, go make a SK since you have a soft spot for inkies.<br />
<br />
No personal attacks. - Raaj</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">if you want fast kills, go make a SK <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I was one of the first folks who recommended Sam make an SK (and was dissed), but I don't necessarily agree with the general tone of the thread.<br />
<br />
The reason I recommended an SK (and still do) in this particular situation is because a five-boxer cannot focus on the warrior as necessary to generate and maintain that aggro when he is also firing off nukes on several other characters.  Its that simple.  I don't care HOW good you are at boxing, a warrior may not be a particularly complicated class to play but there are SOME pretty fundamental timing issues involved with agro. <br />
<br />
A warrior can add to DPS and make for faster kills. <br />
<br />
A warrior can also get solid aggro with a successful taunt...when the fucking key works.<br />
<br />
A warrior CAN and we often DO keep agro in a fast-paced environment that requires fast kills (like LDoN ffs).  No, we cannot lock aggro immediately unless our taunt succeeds after a tash.  And even then we might have trouble if a wizard is overnuking.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I see no flippin' reason at ALL for the casters to be overnuking from the beginning of the fight if they actually want to preserve mana for continuous killing.  It does not help them maintain fast kills - it slows everyone down when they have to med after dumping an entire mana pool in 1 minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ballzo Steel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't see it said above, but IMHO a warrior, cleric, chanter, 3 wiz  is a dream team for a low 60s adventure.  <br />
<br />
I did a 2 wiz (lvl 60 &amp; 63), cleric (lvl 60), chanter (lvl 60), BM (lvl 62), warrior (lvl 61, me) mass kill adventure last night and had half the time left over.  I am not certainly not uber- just under 6k with their buffs and used CHoS &amp; SotBS.  However, with that setup the cleric got bored and was tanking half the time with 60% mana or thereabout the whole adventure (I should have yelled at him to med, but didn't have the heart to ruin his fun).<br />
<br />
Scratch the BM, get a couple shammy buffs beforehand, and have a blast with 3 wizzies.  Your warrior should single pull as possible.  When full rooms, have CHANTER pacify room and then warrior pulls a single (let the silly cleric med, my 52 chanter pacifies like this very successfully).  Have your warrior/cleric handle everything (except for chanter slowing the mob) until mob is down 25% (75% health left).  Then have wizzies start blasting and reducing aggro as they cast in order (my wiz is lvl 58, never has a problem with aggro when he's careful).  <br />
<br />
Most I've ever boxed is three at a time.  However, with your set up, I can actually see how you could 6 box.  Your chanter should AF the warrior and the three wizzies should AF the cleric. Gonna be exhausting, but it could be done.<br />

<br />
Ya get mobs to 70 or so (at that point the warrior has done 30percent of the damage and 70/3 is less then 30 so the wizards cannot possiblibly get agro - thats why I like DPS more then procs to get the 30percnet out of the way) and nuke away without worry of agro... my plan also. Hope it works. ALl my guys willbe 65 when I do this though so it wont be a low 60's group. Only my warrior is not 65 at this point.</div></div><hr />

Thats your real problem then friend.  Those procs do a heck of a lot more aggro than straight dps.   Get yourself a CHoS &amp; SotBW and I'll bet your wizards can start blasting when the mobs is down only 15  or 20 percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">But what he isnt saying is that its also so he can powerlevel his warrior, and give his warrior all the exp, at least from some of the things he has said.<br />
Warrior does 30 percent<br />
Each wizard does 20 percent<br />

But what he doesnt understand is, when you do funky stuff like that, you get funky consequences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can probably nuke sooner if all 6 are grouped and my only worry is wizards being summoned and die.<br />
<br />
But if I am PLing the warrior the warrior has abosolutly o do the most damage and I really get mad if I go through a long kill and he does not get the exp so at 70 its like 100percent certian (wizards sometimes crit and throw things out of balance)....</div></div><hr />

a) you arnt using the hold agro method, because your weapons arnt agro weapons, they are dps weapons.<br />

<br />
Ya you are right though I am shifting situations... Im just not giong to kill blue mobs anymore until LDoN... that avoids the problem alltoghter. Just kill reds and be done with it. Against Reds I am much happier with the hold agro method results.</div></div><hr />

But I applaud your willing to work with the warrior, just listen to us sometimes, Sammy. If you ask a questionn, get ~80% of the people who answer say one thing, and do the opposite, then complain. It's more of the &quot;we told you so&quot; type of thing.<br />

Anywho, how the hell are killing reds easier to hold aggro on than blues? It just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">There is nothing to holding agro, it all depends on how long the wizards wait to cast. I know warriors may not like to hear that what they do to hold agro means little but the simple fact is if the wizards cast when the mob is 95percnet the warrior will not hold agro no matter how many times he taunts or what weapons he has. If the wizards start casting with the mob is 70percent then the warrior will hold agro no matter how many times he taunts or what weaons he has......<br />
<br />
With Blues if you keep waiting for them to get to 70percnet you lose a lot of time... because you have to kill 2 blues or so to equal one red. It just seems dead time cause the wizards are sitting at 100percnet mana just waiting for that 70percnet mark, then you have to kill yet another mob... With reds the time does not seem so wasted cause you know you are going to get more exp out of the kill..... <br />
<br />
Anyway I am PLing the warrior on the FG in PoN. 2.5 percent of a level per kill, and I am working up my 2HB skill (went from 81 to 150 today - cant wait to get back to the 1HS though stupid knockback on GSoT and ugly looks - but now is the time to max all major weapon skills instead of against higher level mobs heh) and got 40percnet of a level in one sitting. Takes a long time to kill them but I am very happy that the warrior with 1400AC and almost 6000HP is very easy able to tank a level 65 PoP mob like that and not die with cleric not going oom either. Clearly I should have no trouble tanking named mobs when I hit 65.... <br />
<br />
Heh I look at my other screen and see in bazzar GSoT going for 2000pp lol.... what a deal for the price.</div></div><hr />

I would seriously rethink the statement about SKs doing better DPS. I've parsed with similarly equipped Paladins and SKs in my groups before and they are well below my own DPS. Case in point, a warrior will always do more DPS with the same 2hander, and the gap widens if you include maxed offensive AAs. Hybrids do not get innate triple attack nor do they get flurry or tactical mastery (or double riposte either I don't think).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is kinda what the beef is.  If the wizards are grouped with, say, a SK, they CAN start nuking when the mob is at 95% and the tank WILL hold aggro.  Warriors know that if the casters aren't trigger-happy and actually wait for the Warrior to lock down their aggro, they can cast worry-free.  Casters don't want to have to wait if they don't have to.<br />
<br />
With Blues if you keep waiting for them to get to 70percnet you lose a lot of time... because you have to kill 2 blues or so to equal one red. It just seems dead time cause the wizards are sitting at 100percnet mana just waiting for that 70percnet mark, then you have to kill yet another mob... With reds the time does not seem so wasted cause you know you are going to get more exp out of the kill..... <br />
<br />
With the Warrior taking Reds, chances are you're still waiting the same amount of time before the Wizards can cast.  But looking at the mob's Health, it seems like you're casting quicker.  You still have to wait for the Warrior to do X points of damage to lock down aggro (30% hp's on a Blue mob, which would scale down on a Red con mob).</div></div><hr />

Throw in spells and SKs are better.</div></div><hr />

You decided to gain immense tanking skills (over 3 mins).<br />
The tradeoff was shitty to decent agro to good agro (as time passes)<br />
<br />
Dont expect efficiency, or anything else.<br />
<br />
Wanna pull trash ? do like u always did, Wars are shitty for xp tanking<br />
<br />
Wanna pull a named ? pacify the adds , pull with a bow , disc at inc<br />
tash at 98% , try landing slows every 5%, and slowly start nuking.<br />
<br />
If it needs disc (fast fight) or a slow (duration not important) to be tanked.<br />
Then we out-tank Pal/SK to such an extent its not even funny.<br />
<br />
If it doesnt need disc/slow then we're a ghetto tank with crappy agro.</div></div><hr />
