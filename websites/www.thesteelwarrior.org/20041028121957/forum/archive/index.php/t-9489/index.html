<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frawdo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now I have a Runebranded Girdle (27% Haste).<br />
<br />
For a real long time I've been planning on upgrading to a Woven Shim Collar (41% haste) from Xanamech, but just haven't won one yet.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I looted a Blue Flame Necklace (120HP, 14AC, 3 Damage Shield, 3 Regen, +other stats) from Walls of Slaughter.<br />
<br />
I really don't think I can use a WSC in place of my new necklace, so I'm looking for suggestions on a new, hopefully 41%, haste item that is non-neck slot to go after. <br />
<br />
I'm in a casual raiding guild, we are one kill away from Sol Ro Tower, and one or more two more away from Elemental Planes. So hopefully something that drops from a pre-elemental mob.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lord Mith Marr has a nice 41% haste belt, and theres an easy to get (1 groupable) 41% haste back in fire if you'll be there soon anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how much stuff do you have to turn in (and keep turning in) to make the tribute haste useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarn Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are hunting in OoW, you could try to gather the materials for a 40% haste augment, and have some GM Tradeskiller friends try their luck at making it.<br />
<br />
then you can put it where you see fit and move it when you upgrade where you put it.<br />
<br />
There is a few floating around Povar already made, but grossly over priced, around 400K.<br />
<br />
Slugworms is probably the hardest part to get as a drop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you don't care terribly for an earring... Silver Earring of Haste works wonders. Stats are shit, but the 41% haste in an earring slot that's groupable is just amazing. Can be grouped pre-elem with ease. Get you (warrior) and a druid, druid, cleric, bard, necro/chanter/druid. You will just agro the mobs. That's all. Low down on the strat below.<br />
<br />
Umbral Plains mini-boss: Doomshade<br />
<br />
Enter Umbral Plains. Have puller pull trash leading to the Dark Master campsite. Kill the wimps. Kill the first Dark Master when everyone is ready. Time begins: 20 minutes. Kill the other 3 dark masters before the first one spawns again (20 minute timer) and WALA! Doomshade spawns if he hasn't been killed in three days. Have bard FM pull Doomshade to near the tunnel, then stop him. enchanter/necro (if you have one) should charm something. Bard should pull Doomshade into camp, you agro him. Use defensive (stonewall isn't necessary unless you think you can dent his massive HP or need DPS agro). Bard should either use both high-end DS songs or charm and DS. Mage DS on you, druid DS AA on you, alternate when the first wears off. He quads, flurries, hits FAST and isn't slowable. Max hit in the 300s without defensive sooo... with 103 bard DS + charmed pet + 1/2 nukers + your minimal DPS + all your DS added together times his attack speed... he'll go down pretty darned fast. 45 minute run tops. Rarely, rarely drops the earring, has other nice toys for alts though. Took 8 tries for me to get earring. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drozan_RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can do sewer trials in GoD and get The Talosian (sp?) girdle that is 36 % haste. Or patiently wait til your guild starts doin Earth rings and get the 41 % haste bracer that drops.<br />
<br />
I think too much emphasis is put on having to have 41 % haste.  Haste cap not counting bard over haste is 100 %.  Vallons is 67 % haste from a Chanter.  Swift like the Wind is 60 % from a shaman.  So with 36 % haste you will be over the cap with a Chanter and 4 % under with a Shammy.  The only time you will be hurting if there is no haste person in your group which is generally pretty rare.<br />
<br />
I personally dont see you losing that much Dps by having 5 % less haste.<br />
<br />
This is just my 2 cp.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  I wear woven shim choker and the Tal belt for haste. I plan to get the Blue flame neck or another nice neck and use Girdle for my haste.  In time as I get upgrades I may get higher haste but not focusing only on that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Magumas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I too have the Blue flame necklace, but dont wear do to my WSC.. I have seen the 40 percent haste aug for sale in bazaar for an extremely expensive price.. It appears that this aug will go in neck shoulder waist, ect.  From what I understand you need a jeweler, smither, and a alchemy to make this aug.  The hardest compenents to find are dropable items, slugworms, and Discordant Scoriae.  So far with all my hunting in OoW I have yet to see one of these drop.  However, I have seen both these items for sale for about 50k each. My hopes are that in time more peeps will be making these augs and price will go down or maybe I might get my shammys alchemy to the skill level needed.  But, that necklace with 40 percent haste would be very nice one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Belt of the destroyer is an easy to get 41% haste, stats arent wonderfull but you could get it with 1-2 groups easily, plus, blastingi through ntov with a quarter the people it used to take is fun, and theres some other stuff in there that aint all bad.</div></div><hr />
