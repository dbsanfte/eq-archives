Anyone have any info on this hussy? How hard she hit? Slowable? Hit points? Any spells, AE's, Procs? What is her spawn rate? I didn't see anything on Alla really and don't know where to look. So I figured you brainy acks could help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slowable, lots of hitpoints, proc's dictate... seems like she hits for 560 or so if I recall..  We pretty much quit killing her after 12 kills with no mask drop..the belt is pretty decent though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">***The following are rough numbers***<br />
<br />
Level 60<br />
Procs Dictate (Unresistable Charm)<br />
Doubles for 850<br />
Slowable<br />
Crippleable<br />
500,000hp<br />
High AC<br />
<br />
Very long fight.  Have the tanks keep their first buff slot open and a dedicated dispeller, using their lowest level dispell, keep an eye out for each tank.  <br />
<br />
Though I have never fought her, I would imagine the fight like Dain.  When she charms you, your agro will most likely be erased.  Pay attention, watch agro, and most importantly use high agroing pets. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my favorite fight in the game that I've found so far... she doesn't have that many hps, but she has insane high ac.<br />
<br />
her proc is an ae charm, and it is a total blast!  Nothing quite like watching 3 clerics and an enchanter trying to kill the main tank.  It is resistable though... just tough.<br />
<br />
She doesn't hit hard, fully slowable, and the fight takes place in a really tiny room, which just adds to the chaos.<br />
<br />
Excellent fight, I highly recommend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from my limited observations (i pulled her 2 or 3 times only), the dictate is not a proc but instead a bard song... as odd as it sounds.<br />
<br />
aggro'd her, she comes running towards me, and after about 3 secs i'm charmed without her even trying to hit me yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure the charm is a proc and it's a single target proc because I remember eating a riposte from her and getting charmed.  The fight is easy though, just keep first slot open for charm and dispell and just sit the long fight out.  The mask is damn nice too, never seen it drop though in the times my guild killed her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The charm is a proc.  Eriatha pretty much has all the info right she is a very fun fight and a long one also.  First time I did her with my old guild took us about 10-15 minutes or so because no one would dispell the tanks.  I believe 835 is her max I found out so many times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Her max hit is high I think but so easy to mitigate most the damage, always got low hits on me at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">She still drops the mask btw,Many people like to say she does not.I got the mask about 2 months ago,albiet in 20 or so kills that is the only one I ever saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Single target charm, and only one person is charmed at a time pretty much.  We usually just leave the person charmed, kinda fun.  You can also mez charmed players.</div></div><hr />
