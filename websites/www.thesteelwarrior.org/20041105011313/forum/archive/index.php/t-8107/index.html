uumm. . .   2-second clickie 1k heal?  that would be the single best item i've seen in years.   better than the original donal's breastplate, even.</div></div><hr />

  I've seen several posts listing it as a 10 minute recast. Definitely less than over powered.</div></div><hr />

aahh.  makes more sense that way.   recast didn't show up on lucy. . .   still better than a sharp stick in the eye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Interesting approach on how some of these weapons are designed.  Less melee damage than a lot of current weapons, but with huge procs.  Wonder if they'll be worth the trade off as DPS weapons for people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It was a 0 second recast.  They changed that on the 15th to a 15minute recast.  Kinda pathetic.  Only usefull for stats and occational emergency heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucy doesn't display a lot of fields that are new.  Recastdelay is in eqitems.13th-floor.org, so you can look these up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Items have recast delays now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It was a 0 second recast.  They changed that on the 15th to a 15minute recast.  Kinda pathetic.  Only usefull for stats and occational emergency heal.<br />
<br />
Actually, it has always had a 15 minute recast. Unfortunately, there was a display bug that went in with recast times on the 14th, which was rectified on the 15th with that patch. However, anyone who had that clickie on the 14th still had to wait 15 minutes for the recast, even if the display showed 0 seconds. Also, Lucy wasn't parsing out recast times/types, because it appeared as new data to its parser. In fact, it still doesn't have that information up there.<br />
<br />
And basically, yes, I designed the item, as well as all of the other clickies casters and priests get from VP, to be an occasional emergency use item. Clickies in general are problematic if they have a long cast time, but no recast, because it allows a wizard (for example) to sustain some DPS after being OOM. For a cleric, however, a greater heal staff became extremely underpowered as you ventured into NTOV, because the cast time on the item couldn't keep up with NPC DPS.<br />
<br />
The way I see it now, a cleric can toss an extra 1k heal on a person in between grey spell gem refreshes, for an extra boost of HPS.<br />
<br />
Vikken - We got functionality for item recast times a few weeks ago. The items from VP are the first ones that use that functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also, real quick, since I'm already here and some players have been wondering. This is how recast types work:<br />
<br />
Basically, on the item, it can have a recast type between 1 and 20. If you have 2 items that have recast timers on them, but share the same recast type, then you can only use one or the other at one time. For example, you have Nuke Staff A that has a 10 minute recast and Nuke Staff B that has a 15 minute recast. Both are on recast type2.  Let's say you click the Nuke Staff B and now you want to use Nuke Staff A. You will have to wait 15 minutes before you can use either one, because the type2 timer decriments from 15 minutes, because that was the last clickie used.<br />
<br />
Conversely, if you clicked Nuke Staff A, you would only have to wait 10 minutes to use either Nuke Staff A or B. What this does is allow us to design items under specific recast types that provide upgrades from the previous clickie. So maybe Staff A is a 2000pt nuke found in Plane of Time. Maybe staff B is a 1000pt nuke found in elemental planes. A player would upgrade from B -&gt; A because it's both a larger nuke, plus has a faster recast. And since there can be up to 20 recast types, this allows for multiple nuke staffs on different recast types, allowing a player to have multiple clickies to choose from.<br />
<br />
In the future, you'll be seeing more items with more powerful spell clickies on them, that will be balanced around the fact that they will take a while to recast.</div></div><hr />

Cool, clickies are fun. Remember to put some in for Warriors too :D</div></div><hr />

&lt;3 Clickies!  Don't you think it's time that warriors got ice comet?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Very cool :) As always thanks for the info Zaj.  I like this way of doing clickies much better.. so they can actually be useful every once in a while instead of sticking to just non-offensive DS or Regen clickies. Maybe think about putting some of these useful clickies spread throughout the game a bit; not just the EPlanes difficulty places. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

hammer too 48/35<br />

problem is prying them cold dead rogue and monk hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Laiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Unfortunately, the 15 minute recast time renders this item nearly useless except for the stats - which are not bad. If any fight lasts more than 15 minutes, and you are LOM, you are in deep doodoo anyway. Any fight less than that, you get one free heal for maybe 10-15% of the MT's HP.<br />
<br />
Personally this is not something I would go far out of my way for. I would pick it up if it dropped, but I sure would not go after any mobs specifically for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">actualy a blast heal on the chanter when the gem hasn't refreshed yet from the CH on the Warrior, might save your groups ass ,)<br />
<br />
except for the 2 heal clickys there is nothing realy interesting so far though ,(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OMFG, they finally coded in clicky delay timers!  VERY VERY COOL, finally we can get clickies with effects that aren't useless, have zero second casts (so warriors can use them in melee, zero channeling SUCKS), but aren't overpowered.  Here's hoping OoW is LOADED with clicky items!<br />
<br />
Also, I'm *guessing* these timers would work for CONSUMABLE items as well perhaps?  i.e. reasonable heal/buff potions that can't be sploited!<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, figured that out much later.  I still lean towards 15min being too long.  I think in the end it'll get bagged and forgotten for the most part.  It is good for emergencies though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My question for Zaj: Since you say the ability to timer the clickies has only recently been implemented, does this mean we can expect a whole slew of formerly useful clickies currently in the game to be toyed with and have these new timers implemented onto them? I can think of a few items having a recast on that would render them freakin useless.....  <br />
<br />
Mistikat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Zaj already said that long recast times will be attached to superior clicky effects.  If an old item had a recast added, logic says that its effect would also be vastly improved.</div></div><hr />
