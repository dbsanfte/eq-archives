Nothing wrong with that, business as usual.  So, I start at the top and start reading that forum, but by the time I'm done and mark that forum read, the board has marked almost everything read on me and I can't tell what else is new.  Is this happening to anyone else?<br />

Happens to me all the time, it always did - although the timing of it is erratic.  I right click/open a new window from the search results page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that the main page is different, you can't click the TSW logo to get back to the master board with all of the forum links, instead you have to click on the first &quot;The Steel Warrior&quot; (in this thread it looks like &quot;The Steel Warrior &gt; The Steel Warrior &gt; The Outhouse &gt; Message board oddity&quot;). Once you're back at the master board you can click &quot;Mark All Forums Read&quot; on the right side (across from &quot;View New Posts&quot;) and all the new post indicators will turn off. When you come back everything with new posts will be lit up and &quot;View New Posts&quot; will take you straight to them.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't always work that way.  Sometimes, I go back to the index page, and whatever new threads I haven't looked at are marked read, even though I haven't clicked on &quot;Mark All Forums Read&quot;  (nor have I for any).  And so, I just open the &quot;View New Posts&quot; window in a new tab, and work from there.</div></div><hr />

Very, very rarely it happens to me within 5 minutes - and its not worth concern.  Overall, I prefer that the admins leave a good thing alone.  Especially now that I have my &quot;just in case&quot; routine in place :D.</div></div><hr />
