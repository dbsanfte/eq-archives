<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tankme Yavelcome</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the selection I have or will have in near future:<br />
<br />
Weapons:  Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
               Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
               Keen Edged Cleaver<br />
Augs:       Anger2 (currently on CHoS)<br />
               100dd Ykesha (currently on SotBS)<br />
               Anger3 (dont have yet)<br />
<br />
of those pieces which would be best aggro combo for primary and secondary....<br />
<br />
<br />
And now to 2hs/2hb....Looking for best DPS combo...with SoV and bard haste most likely in raid situation...this is what I have:<br />
<br />
Fabled Axe of the Executioner...use 31% soulscream belt<br />
<br />
Rocksmasher...built in 41% haste..i use Belt off burrower in AC for this weapon...great hp/ac with this combo<br />
<br />
ok of those 2 combos...which would yield highest DPS?<br />
<br />
<br />
Eventually I would like to go to a 2hand combo...basically to lessen riposte...I hope to be tanking more Hard LDONs and eventually GoD stuff...Now I dont really have access to a BoW so I would like to ghetto a nice aggro grabbing 2hs/2hb combo...<br />
<br />
I also have a GSoT...great weapon in my opinion...just not quite enough aggro with peeps I group with... mnks and rogs tend to grab it off me with this weapon alone.  If I were to perhaps put an Anger3 aug on the GSoT or the Rocksmasher...which would hold better aggro? The rocksmasher cuz of the added dps? or the GSoT because of the additional aggro proc(stun)...this whole concept is really confusing...If someone has the actual numbers for each type of proc that would be sweet...I mean how the hell you actually get a number for &quot;AGGRO&quot;?<br />
<br />
Oh also if a monster is immune to the stun portion of a proc...ykesha example..is that stun portion effect added into the aggro grabbing capability? or not? I notice that alot of monsters are immune to the stun portion of my ykesha proc but not to the SotBS proc...or the GSoT proc...<br />
<br />
Also how do I find out the proc-rate of a weapon..is it built in to weapon..or the proc? ie aug? these things would be very important to know for a warrior that is not EP flagged yet so I can get the best combo that I have accessible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHoS primary and SotB offhand would be your best aggro from what you have.<br />
<br />
Rocksmasher would be your best DPS ( get a DD augment if you want but dont put anger on it)<br />
<br />
GSoT with anger 3 would probably be close to the aggro of your dual wield combo but 2h isnt really necessary except maybe in LDoN hard.<br />
<br />
Not many weapons have enhanced proc rates and augments are not affected by them. Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) shows if it has a procratemod under raw data.</div></div><hr />
