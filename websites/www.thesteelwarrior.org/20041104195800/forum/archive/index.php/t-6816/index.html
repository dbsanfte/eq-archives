<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends on what you want .... lifetaps are cool, especially when soloing, but i guess you would get the best bang for your buck from a ruj bile proc.  less mobs resist it etc ... but you could always burn the points on a yak augment.  that would add dps, but still allow you to hold aggro with it if you wanted.<br />
<br />
in groups where you dont need lots of aggro, and the increased dps would help you xp faster, yak gives you both the aggro needed + the dps.   <br />
<br />
and i seriously doubt a yak auged gsofw would draw aggro off a competent warrior in raiding situations.  hopefully said MT would have better aggro weapons, or else the raid should make you MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ruj Bile is going to give you the best cost effectiveness DPS, but auging with a Yak will allow you to pull aggro quickly then switch to your aggro weapons should another tank drop.</div></div><hr />
