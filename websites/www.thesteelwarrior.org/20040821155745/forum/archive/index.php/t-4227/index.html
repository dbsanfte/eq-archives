<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this is a repost I didn't see it.  Curious if this is for real or if someone (a knight no less) is pulling my leg.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Taken from a recent interview at Gaming Websites and World Weekly; <br />
<br />
We were lucky enough to visit the fine folks who run and design the online game Everquest and ask them about their latest upcoming expansion and new games, Everquest 2, Lords of Everquest, and Champions of Norrath. We sat down with three of them to discuss their new titles and the direction of their legend of a game. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Hello, can I ask that everyone please say hello and identify themselves. <br />
<br />
Absor: Howdy, my name is Absor, and I head of Public Relations for Everquest. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Greetings and salutations, my name Wendigo, the lead class designer. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: Hello, I am Rewonik, keeper of the data, heh, no really I am in charge of itemization and item database. <br />
<br />
Absor: Heh, he's the one in charge of making sure all the soulfires are flaming. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: Yes I do in fact add the sparkles with my fairy dust. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Okay how goes the new game, Everquest2? <br />
<br />
Absor: It is going very well, I have seen what they are working on it and it looks beautiful, far and beyond what the current state of EQ is, you have to remember that the EQ engine is rather old. I wish we could discuss it more, but the people working on EQ2 arent here at the moment, they are busy testing code. I can field some questions, but I am better suited to dealing with the current EQ. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: I will tell you some of the weapons in EQ2 were seen in EQ, but they have been redesigned around the story of EQ2. It is really cool what we are able to do with more powerful systems. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Any classes we wont see in EQ2? Any new classes we will see? <br />
<br />
Wendigo: We are still debating about the monk class, the new design of the beastlord for EQ2 has all the power of a monk, but they have their pets, which they now must quest for. One of the coolest aspects is the warder is player chosen from a crop of animals, each with strengths and weakness, so it becomes much more complicated. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Why remove the monk class? <br />
<br />
Wendigo: We look at this way, we can give beastlords feign death and then they have to choose between a warder and mend. So the class is less defined yes, but it gives the player more flexibility. It works out wonderfully. <br />
<br />
Absor: We want to make sure players feel like they have power and we feel that the beastlord gives them that, where as the monk really doesnt. <br />
<br />
GWWW: What about the current state of monks in EQ then? <br />
<br />
Absor: They are very powerful, but are suffering from having too many players playing them, which floods the server with alot of bored monks just soloing in the Planes. Whereas there aren't as many beastlords and they are constantly sought after for groups. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: We are working on helping balance them out now. We have seen alot of suggestions from player made communities which is nice to see, but the suggestions sometimes border on the outrageous. We wont be giving monks or any melee class a mana bar, instead we need to focus on their groupability. One thing we are looking at doing is lessing the time bind wound uses up to work. So that monk can quickly bind wound at high levels and help their group get back into combat. We are still dissapointed by the fact that monks dodge many more attacks then other classes, which we might have to scale them back a little more. <br />
<br />
Absor: Well not scale back, we would have to bring them in line with casters with Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes. We want casters to be able to dodge the most melee combat, and the rest to follow from there. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Aye nothing worse then having an interrupt while casting a spell that could change the outcome of a battle. That is a big reason we had to look into fixing bards. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Fixing bards? How do you mean? <br />
<br />
Absor: Bards have long suffered from game glitches which affect songs or abilities poorly and that is just strange holes in the code we couldnt have seen coming. Some of these glitches were their alternate advancement (aa) skills which until the recent patch really didnt do much for the bard. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: We have some more changes coming for the bard class. We are looking into allowing clarity to affect their mana regen rate with aa skill. We are also going to let focus items affect bard songs, which I know many players will like considering the complaints we have gotten about how short mana song or harmony of sound is. <br />
<br />
Absor: Aye we wanted to put bards on par with their caster counterparts, a bard uses none of their spells, but should not be punished for being a hybrid. Since a bard uses none of their spells, it is balanced. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Can you tell me any changes for their ability to lull or their aa skill fading memories? <br />
<br />
Absor: Both are working as intended. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Yes and no, we are thinking of changing fading memories so undead creatures and creatures who can normally see invis cannot see through it when active, since the ability affects the mind of the npc there is no reason for the mob to see or remember the bard. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: We are also adding more bard weapons with instrument modifiers. We feel bards often dont get a fair share at weapons and want to put them on par with shadowknights and palidans in terms of weapon choices. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Any changes for Palidans or Shadowknights? <br />
<br />
Wendigo: We are looking into adding more class quests, and two of the big ones have to do with knights. We feel playing a knight is a hard road and the rewards should show that. Lets just say I have seen the two new items that result from the quests and they are really really nice. Alot of palidans and shadowknights will be banking their weapon. <br />
<br />
Rewonki: Aye, we wanted to give them something that makes wanted in groups and gives them the ability to solo versus certain creatures, ie undead. The two items are by the two items in the game I am most proud of, they help tip the scale in favor of the knight versus most mobs. <br />
<br />
Absor: Its is a very exciting time. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Any other classes getting any upgrades? <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Well you might be able to see soon, but mages will be getting more elemental forms, and beastlords will be getting a burnout like ability to make their pets viable to use. Rangers will also get more of a bonus from archery as they are masters of the woods and the hunt, as well as improved tracking. One of the tracking changes will result in gathered information on a mob, so next time you attack a similar mob, you will see class, and faction for the mob. Necromancers will be getting more area effect dot spells to use. One of the newest ae dot gives both mana and hps to the group in quite large numbers which will make grouping with a necromancer a real bonus. We are giving knights a spell like the clerics stackable spell haste, but we are also adding other stackable focus effects for them which will make them wanted in groups. Enchanters will now be getting a siphon type spell to move mana into their group mates as well as a group spell where the enchanter gives up all their mana to fill the mana bars of their group members, and this spell will be mass group buffable. Shamans and druids will be getting new experience returning resurction spells. We have many changes planned. <br />
<br />
Absor: We have alot of exciting changes planned to make EQ much more fun and exciting. We want to give the community a sense of accomplishment with their characters. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Their is rumor of a new class, any information? <br />
<br />
Absor: We are saving that information for a later date, but we will say this new class will be able to withstand great amounts of damage while doing great burst damage. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Shhh you will give it away. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Any new races planned? <br />
<br />
Absor: That too we cannot comment about too much, but we are looking into a new &quot;animal&quot; type race which has a great amount of history in Norrath. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Dragonmen? <br />
<br />
Absor: Possibly, we will have more news for you later. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Any new race skills or upgrades? <br />
<br />
Wendigo: We are putting in an innate aoe blind for dark elves. This will be an ability they get at level 15 and gets stronger as they level. We are scaling up the bonuses for many of the races. We want to make sure when you pick a race you do it for the bonuses and spread out the different races for the classes. We see too many Erudite Wizards and Dark Elf Necromancers. <br />
<br />
Absor: Wood Elves will also get a nice bonus, but we cannot reveal it yet, but it has to deal with their woodland nature. <br />
<br />
GWWW: Any new expansions to look forward to? <br />
<br />
Absor: Yes, and we have alot of programmers working hard on it. We were very pleased with the reception LDoN got and we are working on more instanced places. This will help customize adventures to what type of player they are. <br />
<br />
GWWW: How is Champions of Norrath and Lords of Everquest coming? <br />
<br />
Absor: Fantastic, we are branching out and we think the fans of EQ will be quite pleased and busy with these games. We apologize in advance for making your guildmates late to raids because they were getting another level in CoN or LoE. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Heh <br />
<br />
GWWW: Speaking on home gaming consoles, how is EQOnline doing? <br />
<br />
Absor: Wonderfully, the graphics are getting better with this newest expansion and adding the lovable race of Ogres. <br />
<br />
GWWW: I want to thank you gentlemen for your time. <br />
<br />
Absor: Think nothing of it, it was our pleasure. <br />
<br />
Wendigo. You are welcome and I hope the player community is enjoy the game. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: I hope they like the new weapon graphics from LDoN and the ones to come from the very hard adventures will be very noticable and rare to give players something unique. <br />
<br />
Absor: Shhh we cannot give it all away. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: Sorry, I will go back to my cube now. <br />
<br />
Wendigo: LOL <br />
<br />
Absor: Bye <br />
<br />
Wendigo: Bye <br />
<br />
Rewonik: Bye <br />
<br />
That is some of the interview I conducted, I hope you guys enjoyed it. Until next time, this is Steward Robertson reporting for Gaming and Website World Weekly.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is really all true I think this could be enough to turn me away from EQ for good.  There is nothing they could do for the pure melee classes to balance out what they are talking about giving to all classes except pure melee.  I didn't go through and bold specific upgrades mentioned for all classes but I think most if not all classes except pure melee were mentioned and described in at least one way they would be improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if this is true fuck everquest<br />
<br />
absor wtf is this shit? it cant be true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sounds like they have no room in EQ for pure melee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LMAO there is no way in hell that is real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">highly doubt thats real.  <br />
<br />
Vladimoir either you are trying to rile us up or whoever showed you that has got some bad info.  <br />
<br />
I mean, is there even a mag or a website called &quot;Gaming Websites and World Weekly&quot;???<br />
<br />
Even as a hoax its not a good one.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sounds to me to be quite real.... anyone else think that everyone at SoE who actually played EQ quit when luclin came out?<br />
<br />
I've already lost all faith in eq, and cancelled my accnt, got 4 months left on it tho, so if I see some improvement in that time, who knows..<br />
<br />
I do know that if VI scales UP pure casters and knights, there will be huge losses -- permanently to SoE -- something to the tune of eh, few million in accnts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>carlelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that was posted as a joke on monkley business as a joke. the guy who posted it even said it was a joke later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">was it a joke? I didn't quite get it if it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's got to be a put on. There really isn't any way Sony would be so blatantly stupid as to shoot itself in the foot like that :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah it was a joke.<br />
<br />
Had me going for about half of it. But once it got to the part where Absor said monks were very powerful, but had a lot of bored monks soloing in the planes, well that was the final tip-off it was a joke. Heh.<br />
<br />
But for posterity's sake, here's the response from the person who crafted this funny interview:<br />
<br />
Re: Interview with Absor about Classes *NEW*<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 yes it was a joke, yes I did try to make it very obvious at the end, I hope I didnt cause too much distress, but sadly as I reread that again, much of what I said could happen, so please sacrafice a gnome to Quellious, Cazic or Agnostic the Weirdo Non God...so this doesnt happen. Also sacraficing gnomes is fun and worthwhile to help keep the gnome population down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will be damned if I am going to be sacrificed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh you will be you will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GWWW: What about the current state of monks in EQ then? <br />
<br />
Absor: They are very powerful, but are suffering from having too many players playing them, which floods the server with alot of bored monks just soloing in the Planes. <br />
<br />
Haha :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well i beleaved it because it fit the mind set of SoE, and the <br />
<br />
&quot;Absor: Shhh we cannot give it all away. <br />
<br />
Rewonik: Sorry, I will go back to my cube now.&quot; <br />
<br />
sounded alot like SoE from when they did the gamespy chat and picked on the guy from marketing<br />
<br />
&quot;Absor: Think nothing of it, it was our pleasure.&quot; also sounded true to life, cept it would be worded to be none comittal :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thought it was pretty obvious from the crappy grammar first, then what they were apparently saying second ...<br />
<br />
That, and I really couldn't give a flying frig anymore :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The AoE blind for dark elves should have been enough to see it's a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks for the heads up guys, as I said at the beginning of the post I hadn't seen it brought up anywhere else but it was posted on our boards by one of our knights.  <br />
<br />
Sad to admit but the lack of grammar and stupid points and ideas really didn't trigger any red flags to me, I guess after 4 years of seeing these kind of things go live I let my guard down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">that was some damn good fiction :D<br />
( it also got posted on my guild board for laughs :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Izudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is not totally wrong. Take a look at lucy's spell database, and you will find, for example:<br />
<br />
Earth Elemental Form V (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4559&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
Elemental Domination (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4555&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
Seems they are going to add new mage aa skills like improved elemental forms, and maybe dire charm elemental.<br />
<br />
So who knows what else from that &quot;joke&quot; list might be true...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Part of the joke was to hook people in before the punchlines started hitting.<br />
<br />
To do that, the person borrowed the Lucy info.<br />
<br />
How was that possible?<br />
<br />
Easy, the person who wrote this, wrote it after Lucy put those effects up. (By about 2 or 3 days actually).<br />
<br />
In other words, you fell for the hook.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
But don't worry, many of us fell for the hook, because the little details, like that one, were so good and authentic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Izudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I already supposed that the author of the article had the lucy data (and other) as source. Yet, I still think that some points on that list are actually going to become truth, so it is not quite totally a &quot;joke&quot; list.<br />
<br />
It was quite clear that most of this was fun (when talking about monks avoiding too many hits etc.), and a really nice write up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boracelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Maybe if it had said that they were going to remove Clerics from EQ2 and use paladins as main healers because pally's are of course the most down trodden Class in EQ I may have beleived it =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ardbeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;Palidans&quot;  that weas a dead give-away</div></div><hr />
