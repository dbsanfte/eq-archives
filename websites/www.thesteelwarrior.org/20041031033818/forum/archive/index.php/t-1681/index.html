<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone actually use/buy the higher end arrows now fletched by players?  Are they worth it for warriors or no?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of fletching off some higher end arrows, maybe using them, maybe selling them...  Is it worth it?  <br />
<br />
Would YOU buy higher end arrows?  Or for that matter, would you purchase player made bows?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I really want to know how many people actually use/buy them and if its worth the money to use and/or fletch and sell them.<br />
<br />
Your opinions and comments are greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>azon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use the nightmarewood bow, and the cheapest player made arrows.  I make the arrows because it costs me probably 1 plat to make 80 arrows, or something along those lines.  Very cheap to make a bunch of low lvl arrows instead of buying them.  As for buying any arrows, I wouldnt do it.  If your in the bazaar, the ones I can make go for like a gold each, which is a ton more than I can make them.  As for making those higher end arrows, I dont like doing that.  They cost a fair amount of money, and theyre just going to be used up.  I havent been in a situation where I need any special type of arrow besides the magic ones, to hit magical targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zilden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the Nightmare Bow as well its player made and very nice. I typically try to find a mage to summon me some arrows &lt;3 mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was in bazaar last night and found only 3 bows for sale that's under 200pp: forlorn, hunting (duh) and one other I can't think of.  I would think that there were more options for Warriors not just in this range but in all ranges of plat.  I know Rangers are the archers of Norrath but fletching is a pretty cool skill and it'd be nice to have a little archery economy in the bazaar for warriors.  Right now since I pull with the bow, I go for crappy delay and high damage output which is what I'm looking for.  Not sure if its worth it for a 36WAR to pursue archery though... That's my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With exping in PoP, I enjoy pulling and often do so.  I use an earth bow and fletch my own class 6 steel silver tip arrows (fairly expensive ones).  I guess I just like seeing my arrows do dmg to the mob and I like the dmg to be more than a few points.  All in all, its what you want to do with your character, I personally enjoy the few more dmg I can do on the pull with a bow, some think its not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My fletchign skill is only at 153 right now, and I'm a Froglok, so I don't know if there is anything I can really make bow-wise.  Part of the reason I asked the above questions was because I don't hardly ever see bows in the bazaar, and when I do, they are either the top end or a few lower end bows.<br />
<br />
Would it be worth my time to start fletchign a wide variety of bows do you think?<br />
<br />
So aside from Ranger's insane amount of bow damage, what kind of bow damage is a warrior capable of dealing?  Do we also get big crits and such with our bows?<br />
<br />
Should I give up fletching with my Froggy and get my woody druid to start fletching?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm just full of questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spinetwist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best crit I did with a bow was 285. I fletch my own acrylia arrows when I have the raw materials, but if I dont, I buy the steelshaft, silver tipped arrow parts. Bows arent for doing dmg with Warriors, they are strictly for pulling and dueling =D<br />
<br />
Keep on fletching, its easy to get to 202 fletching and you can make some solid arrows. You also wont have to fletch materials on your other char and do transfers, that would get annoying. I can burn 200 arrows in a night of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use a Twisted Longbow and usually some 3/150 arrows I fletch myself (uses hooked point, bone shaft, small nock, and parabolic fletch) but I still prefer mages/rangers to summon arrows for me because they are MAGIC and I dont have to waste mah money~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>azon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The most damage ive ever done with a bow is 119.  I use the nightmarwood bow, and the 2/150 range arrows only.  Im sure it could be higher if I used the expensive arrows, but its not worth the money to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would it be worth my time to start fletchign a wide variety of bows do you think? Nope. Too easy to get a bow with good enough stats to take up permenant residence in your range slot. If you want to make bows to sell, you have basically 2 choices - Nightmarewood or Elemental. Everything else is a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used a Stonewood Compound Bow now for its incredible stats and prefer to get rangers or mages to summon me arrows. If I don't have one around then I get my Druid (196 skill fletcher) to make an arrow run and craft Class 2 Silver Point Arrows, 150 range ones. Failing that or if I just can't be bothered I summon up Shissar Fangs with the bag that drops in Ssra Mines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I make my own Steel shaft, Silver tipped arrows.  I do this because I like the arrow to do damage, and I like the extended range for pulling in PoP.  I use the War Bow of Rallos Zek, and the highest I've hit so far for was a crit for 225.  I personally don't want to buy the really high end arrows because I go through them so fast I'd be broke in a week.  As far as player made bows go, the Nightmarewood bow and the Tunare Thunderbolt still sells for a decent price on The Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use a featherwood bow,for the stats and fast dly for if a peel screws up or somethin and i make my own acrylia arrows and if i run out of stuff for those i make some silver tip arrows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Darkwood bow of suffering is good. It drops in the pon maze iirc, was failry cheap for me too I got it for 1k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So basically, I shouldn't worry too much about bows and such.  At least not with my Froggy - he can't make wood elf cultural bows, and arent the majority of the above bows cultural?  If not, then hey, I'll get to GM Fletcher as soon as I've got 30k to toss at fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoP crafted bows are not cultural, I mean, Nightmarewood and the other plane's bows can be crafted by any fletcher, of course that the skill needed varies.<br />
<br />
Im a 202 fletcher and I use a Nightmare bow, along with Silver tipped arrows (wood shaft, small groove, parabolic fletch) and its a nice 3/150 and hits PoP mobs (if the arrow is not MAGIC, it wont).<br />
<br />
I started fletching long long ago just to make my arrows and ended up taking it to 202, I often make bows for guildie's or friend's alts now, mostly Darkwood bows and they have a nice ratio (can get to 19/41 if you want to, or 25/68 if you want more dmg). All I can say is that is nice and I enjoy it, never made much of a profit tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There are a few VERY rare cases where warriors would need to use better damage arrows (think it was berty) but not sure if thats the case anymore.<br />
<br />
There's really little reason to get high dmg arrows for a warrior, we only use for pulling and its not like 1 or 2 arrows you shoot will make any difference.<br />
<br />
As far as fletching skill, forget cultural and just get to 250, as wandor already stated, nightmares and elemental's are really the only bows to consistently make money from. Sure yer woody could make blessed faydark thunderbolts, but the market for them is mostly low level twinks, nightmares are cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OK, well, I'll start the trek to 250.  I've got a few charts at home and think 202 should be fairly easy.  It's getting to 250 that I'm worried about.  I'm only a 36 Warrior, and it's difficult to get the cash to fletch past 202.<br />
<br />
Are the Ulthorks doable at 36?  I can at least get some cash going.  :)</div></div><hr />
