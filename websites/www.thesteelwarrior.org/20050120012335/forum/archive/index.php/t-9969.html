<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there is supposed to be a huge patch coming up next Wed, I wanted to discuss what you would like to see in the next big patch.<br />
<br />
Here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
Class balance changes:<br />
<br />
- Warriors:<br />
Improved clickie on Epic 1.5 and 2.0 to mitigate twice as much damage.<br />
Revamped Aura of Runes to take less endurance and increased size of rune proc.<br />
Revamped the level 70 proc to give a sizable + hate whenever a mob hits the warrior as well as stunning it.<br />
Savage onslaught is now a straight upgrade to fellstrike, 10% linear upgrade.<br />
<br />
- Wizards:<br />
Introducing an entire new spell line designed to sustain DPS over time. Those spells have a range of 50, low damage, very low mana cost, and start at level 50 and ramp up to level 70.<br />
Mana regen on familiars has been increased across the board.<br />
<br />
- Magicians:<br />
A mod rod upgrade has been made. This has the same restriction as old mod rods as well as shared recast timer. The click is twice as much mana for twice as much HP as an old mod rod, with a recourse of a 10 second silence spell after clicking the mod rod.<br />
<br />
All summon spells are now targetted, including pet weapons that automatically go on the targetted pet.<br />
<br />
- Druids:<br />
A new hand of ro upgrade spell has been introduced. Epic clickie has been changed to be +10% damage for 1.5 and 25% for 2.0 making it less than useless.<br />
<br />
- Shamans:<br />
-The hastened rabid bear AA has been changed into an AA to decrease the amount slow is mitigated by. Each rank of the AA increases the effectiveness of slow, up to 10% extra slow at maxed rating - thus mobs that moderated slow down to 50%, now slow up to 60% for shamans only.<br />
-An AE malos is now available as an ancient spell.<br />
- Decreased aggro on dots.<br />
- Increased effectiveness of cripple line of spells, those spells should now have a noticable effect on reducing mob DPS.<br />
<br />
- Clerics:<br />
- Increased value of effective AC on clerics by a fair amount. Clerics should now take damage just below ranger and other chain wearing melees, however should not have the damage avoidance abilities those classes have.<br />
<br />
- Necromancers:<br />
- Added option for other people to filter DoT damage to make parsing DoT damage on raids easier.<br />
<br />
- Rogues:<br />
- Put Duellist and deadeye on the same timer. Having separate dps increasing discs was leading rogues to outbursting wizards which was not desired. Rogues should still sustain a much higher damage, just in very short fights wizards should be ahead.<br />
- Damage increasing augments like those found in Ikkinz4/Uqua are now usable only on offhanded weapons.<br />
<br />
- Monks:<br />
- Mitigation nerf reduced slightly.<br />
- Monks now have the ability to purchase tactical mastery.<br />
- Restored the ratio of melee damage to 100/110/140 - if a monk is doing 330 DPS, a rogue should do 420 DPS.<br />
<br />
- Beastlords:<br />
Increased beastlord heals slightly.<br />
<br />
- Rangers:<br />
Every time a ranger dies, each person in their group gets some cake in the inventory, this way they will finally have a use~<br />
Harmony upgrade available for rangers. Auspice of hunter has been upgraded quite heavily now.<br />
<br />
- Bards:<br />
The 65 + Rizlona have been upgrade.<br />
One now has a + avoidance mod and a + heal component that stacks with focus, and the other has a + CE and + accuracy. The ancient spell has everything.<br />
The new snare song is fixed.<br />
Missed notes are eliminated with mastery of the past.<br />
<br />
- Berserkers:<br />
Hell if I know<br />
<br />
- Enchanters:<br />
Their mez now has a -50 resist adjustment base. Epic 2.0 effect is fixed. Lowered aggro on Tashan to match aggro of malos.<br />
<br />
- SK:<br />
Changed epic clickie to increase amount lifetaps heal the SK by 3x and 6x for 2.0 for a minute.<br />
<br />
- Paladins:<br />
Mostly balanced.<br />
<br />
Content changes:<br />
Increased damage on some mobs in some trials, but keep mobs fully slowable. HP's increased some but resists decreased to make casters more friendly in some trials. increased number of events where good play is rewarded (ala fear trial) and decreased events where gear and amount of healing required are key (ala ingenuity trial)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wizards already have a class of spells for sustained DPS.  They were the Draught line before, now upgraded with the Spark line.  Chaining the level 66 Spark with 45 percent spell haste (normal for wizards) and a Discordant focus (not difficult to obtain for an high-end wizard) is ~420 dps without resists.  This line also has a -50 resist adjustment across the board, a decent adjustment for a resistable DD, especially with the low mana cost of the spells.<br />
<br />
Decreasing aggro on dots is unnecessary.  Fixing it would be best.<br />
<br />
Monks have very, very little use for Tactical Mastery as they would likely still be meleeing from the rear of the mob to maximize their DPS as long as it is the way to do so.<br />
<br />
Bazu Bellow is in line with the current Incite line aggro output.<br />
<br />
I dont understand the desire to nerf rogues.</div></div><hr />

It'ed be really nice to have Tacvi/Txevu upgraded slightly but we're not there yet so its not really a concern of mine.<br />
<br />
The one thing I would like is a decent aggro 1 hander from somewhere in the lower parts of OoW, maybe change the Fang of Feratha to an anger 1her with similar but slightly better stats that a DB.  Our droprate, like so many others hasn't been very good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I never mentioned fixing Bazu Bellow.  I think its fine and should stay as is.<br />
<br />
Wizards have no problem with burst DPS, their problem is sustained DPS.  In a chain pulling group their damage output is worst than a paladin, and there's plenty of parses to back it up.<br />
<br />
Tactical mastery would be so monks would truly be the masters of damage from each angle, and in cases where mob doesn't end up pinned could be melee'ing fron the front without losing too much hdamage.<br />
<br />
Rogue sustained and burst damage is franly really imbalancing right now, and when rogues can do more damage than wizards in the short term that needs to be fixed, unfortunately the problem is that the designer in charge of making items and the designer in charge of spell upgrades don't communicate well enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wizzards can do damage on all sides mele and range. You can turn you from mob and nuke. Wizzards are not only dps, they can gate, root, snare. Solo exp ? yep no problem. Enrage ? who cares. DS ? pff not my problem....</div></div><hr />

I agree with Phantron, I think you have no point, and I think your ideas are dumb to be perfectly honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id like to see rune procs extrended to 2 mins. <br />
<br />
epic 10% mitagation is Perfect the way it is.   the rune absorb size is too small.   way to small.  for 1.5 i think a 2k absorb would be decent. and 2.0 make that 3500 or 4k. absorb.   Leave the 1 min duration timer in place.<br />
<br />
savage onslaught should in no way be a upgrade to fellstrike.  these discs are on totaly differant timers.<br />
<br />
its dps is pathetic though.  what i would like to see instead of a large drain of end for little damage it should run something like.  <br />
<br />
 3 min run time.  end is ONLY used when a critical hit is turned into a crippling blow. and have the end used = to the crippling blow damage<br />
<br />
so if you crip for 600   600 end is used.  this gives us a real meaning to the 7400 EnD that doesn't do anything else.  theorectialy we can possible drain our end pool with large hits.   that would be the price to pay for this disc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If you leave a guild any items you attained while tagged for that guild you lose forever unless retagged for that guild. =p<br />
<br />
2. Make Shocking Defense do something besides waste endurance...<br />
<br />
3. Piggybacking for KT! (please, i've done so many tipts that jhiru just feign deaths when I get my group of recruits to the end.)<br />
<br />
4. Add some sort of endurance regen besides aa. I'm the only warrior in my guild, and its such a bitch being forced to fucking med for 10 kills so I can use furious/defensive/aura of runes chain on a named. ikkinz is such a bitch with only one war =p espically ikk3</div></div><hr />

We gots HP Regen. We gots mana regen. We gots regen for anything you could want! Oh, except endurance.</div></div><hr />

Harmony upgrade available for rangers. Auspice of hunter has been upgraded quite heavily now. <br />
<br />
There is no upgrade to AoH in this patch, as is MGB on AoH has been shown to only add 4k more damage to an entire raid....um which isn't worth the aa's whatsoever. Harmony should have came with OoW and we shouldn't have had to fight for it like we did. Ranger suxxors comments suck too  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phantron, I thought most upgrades were 'flavour' upgrades except in cases where a class was woefully underpowered.<br />
<br />
Allowing clerics to tank better than a druid or shaman doesn't make a raid more powerful.  A better mod rod with a 10 second silence recourse allows nukers to sustain higher damage, but not as high burst damage.<br />
<br />
Allowing Auspice to be worth MGB'ing instead of taking up a buff slot seems decent.<br />
<br />
The only 'power' upgrades as such are the wizard upgrades , which are meaningless for raids.<br />
<br />
The DPS for a few classes is increased outside of raids, but raid DPS if anything would stay constant.</div></div><hr />

I play a rogue, war, shm and pally.  And this has got to be the stupidest thing I've heard in awhile.  Is there a rule somewhere that wizzies HAVE to out burst dps a rogue?  If so please show me.  From the rogues perspective why would you want to try to bring down another class, how about fixing your own and leave others alone.  Scaling back another class because one doesn't live up to its expectations isn't a fix.  From the warriors perspective why the hell would I want this?  Less dps on the rogues means the mob lives longer which increases chances of shit hitting the fan.  Your idea makes about as much sense as a screendoor on a submarine( to use an oldie).</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Qvic Mshas, the only time wizards are in the top 5 classes is when we have over 30 people and they die extremly extremly quickly.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, the wizards you see Eriatha are not likely to improve in damage that much, they already have top of line focuses, rogues will go from 19 damage daggers to 27 in the endgame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll bring up parses from the MPG trials too, but I am sure those would be dismissed too.<br />
<br />
I happen to think wizards should do bettter burst damage than any other class while they have mana, but fade off with time.<br />
<br />
Every parsing I seen basically shows rogues keeping up with wizards on short parses, and just flat out destroying everyone in any longer parse.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I did not mean to start a flame fest, and while this pertains to endgame, it does not pertain to warriors specifically.  Sorry if anyone got slighted.</div></div><hr />

other classes issues are not ours and do not belong here.  <br />

I don't give a rats behind that rogues are top end dps and wizards are not.<br />

this forum is Supposed to be for High End Warrior issues. rogues and wizards are Banned =p<br />

again,  can we get this thread moved to general or something?</div></div><hr />
