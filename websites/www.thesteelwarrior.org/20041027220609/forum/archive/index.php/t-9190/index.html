<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering, how much do we know about the locked zone in OoW?  Do we know what is needed to enter?  Will it be a series of flags to get in like the PoP mobs, or will it be more hours of camping stuff like for the VT key?  Are there people that already have access to it?  And I'm assuming that every individual person will need keys/flags like VT, and it won't be like BoT towers where one person can get a bunch in with one key.  <br />
<br />
Sorry if these questions have been answered already, I may have skipped over it.</div></div><hr />

It's begun in RSS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The architect's ring?  Nah, nm... that dropped off trash in wos.  Probably not it...<br />
Are there quest details anywhere yet?</div></div><hr />

Probably meant the tarnished signet- had one of those drop off the champion, icon is a ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm... i might have one of those floating around too.  Not sure... I have a wide assortment of no drop, no stat items from wos that no one wants and no one seems to know what to do with.<br />

I need more bank slots!</div></div><hr />
