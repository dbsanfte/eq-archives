There's no way Fennin could deliver that kind of assbeat.  Reparm should just take over.</div></div><hr />

Looking at past precedence, I would say the odds of this happening are exactly 0% :p <br />

On the other hand, its entierly likely that mobs will start to drop 1 item instead of 2 now that more guilds are entering elemental zones :mad:</div></div><hr />

Wait till ya meet Tallon Zek in Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
Dude fires arrows like a machine gun with 3400 melee on top of that.<br />
<br />
Yea, and don't use CH rotation for Reparm. His HP don't warrant it.<br />
<br />
<br />
they made Fire mobs way too beefy if you ask me. Not all of us can make a living off playing EQ 24-7 and shouldnt be expected to have the same gear and resources as some of the more uber guilds have. <br />
<br />
Well then you shouldn't have the gear they have, and be capable of what they can... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pre-nerf these mobs were not a challenge but a solid fight  <br />
<br />
No. No they weren't. Mobs dropping molds that can be killed with 12-18 is just wrong, and causes massive griefing/cockblocking by the top guild. You just would not see content, ever -- If this was still the case.<br />
<br />
4 wipes, 3 hours of raid time for 2 pairs of leather armor that go to a twink? Sorry sony, aint gonna happen  <br />
<br />
And his attitude is why you, or your guild, does not deserve the loot to progress. Shit shouldn't be handed on a silver platter, earn it -- go die a few times like everyone else does, it'll feel better in the long run.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how many times my guild died to The Rathe Council before we got him down? Do we deserve Plane of TIme loot, without putting the effort in required to get there? No? Yea, No.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the flame, but that little whine-fest got me annoyed. Warriors boards starting to look like the Monk boards, or worse still... the safe-house.</div></div><hr />

Pre buffing of elemental planes my guild could farm everything we wanted, but it sure as heck got hard for us now, but also alot more challenging, for me atleast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont have the gear they have, and I could care less about capability. My point was that not everyone can be expected to find Elemental planes the same difficulty as another. You are viewing the mobs difficulty from an uber standpoint, did you ever stop to think that these mobs might be a challenge to other people? <br />
<br />
Mobs dropping molds that can be killed with 12-18 is just wrong, and causes massive griefing/cockblocking by the top guild. You just would not see content, ever -- If this was still the case. <br />
<br />
I agree but no matter how hard you change the mobs or try and prevent certain actions in game, it will always happen anyway. It's just a matter of time. <br />
<br />
And his attitude is why you, or your guild, does not deserve the loot to progress. Shit shouldn't be handed on a silver platter, earn it -- go die a few times like everyone else does, it'll feel better in the long run. <br />
<br />
You don't know me, you don't know my guild, you don't know how many times we too have wiped learning mobs, so who are you to say who and who doesn't deserve to progress? I find it utter hilarity that people feel the need to look down apon others because of their progression and position in a simple online game. <br />
<br />
Im not whining here. Im making a point. There are multiple levels of difficulty in EQ, and I think its rather idiotic for someone at the top of the mountain sit there and say how getting there was far too easy, when others are struggling. <br />
<br />
Ok Now you may begin the flammage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're making a point?<br />
<br />
Hey, chief - maybe you guys just aren't cut out for the big league. <br />
<br />
Go back, farm a little, gear yourself up for it, and then -IF- they are -STILL- too hard, you have a valid point. The increase in difficulty level was a needed thing. My guild could clear Water, Coirnav, Fire and Fennin Ro in a touch over 3 1/2 hours. Is that a good thing? 50% content gone, in half of an evening.<br />
<br />
I really hate to piss on your parade here, but if you are still having difficulty with Fire mobs, you really shouldn't be in the Elementals.<br />
<br />
Did your guild farm VT? Or did they just prance their way into Elementals, and expect their Ssra gear, etc, to hold them out? I'm willing to bet on the second one. If you are struggling with VT gear, well...<br />
Not to be offensive, but looking at your Magelo, I would say you skipped a whole load of content.. Ssra included. You can't expect it to be easy after skipping that much, not following the natural progression of ST -&gt; Ntov -&gt; Ssra -&gt; VT -- It will bite you in the ass eventually, and it looks like it has.<br />
<br />
You don't know me, you don't know my guild, you don't know how many times we too have wiped learning mobs, so who are you to say who and who doesn't deserve to progress? <br />
<br />
I wasn't the one bitching, you were... if you're bitching that shit's too hard, well, just MAYBE, you shouldn't be there?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suddenly Defensive isn't that big a deal when you get killed from nearly unresistable procs more than melee (although the melee is impressive, I must remember this is elemental planes).  How long does it take to kill the general on average?<br />
<br />
Too bad warriors can't be granted immunity to fire, might make those procs easier. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing thats really obvious is how blatently retarded all of your statements are. And you base your opinions on the success of you and your guild. <br />
<br />
So you got into time? Big fucking deal you want a hero cookie? Just because you got into a zone doesnt give you the right to govern who should and shouldnt have access. Just because a mob is tough doesnt mean a person or their guild shouldnt be attempting it. If that were true then what you said about your guild doing the Rathe is completely hypocritical! <br />
<br />
Yes I didnt raid Ssrza, or Vt. but the guild I run with was one of the originals on my server. And attacking me or my gear, hell even my guild holds no merit. It just proves how little ground your statements hold, and how you get off on the belittling of others. <br />

<br />
Reparm is annoying =P  Complete luck if you actually win the fight.  Higher hp tanks will raise the percentage that you can win since he does seldom hit for max.  And with the -350 resist adjust on his proc as well as his level (which is like level 70 or 73 or something), you won't resist the proc very often if at all.<br />

As for Reparm, nothing can heal a tank that gets hit by 3 procs in one round.  I surved a 2 proc round once, but hit like 5 hp and DI fired.  If you get 3 procs in one round, you die. Simple.  No amount of spam healing and DI with max cha will save your ass.</div></div><hr />

It's one thing to play the &quot;Not everyone can be uber&quot; card when discussing things like &quot;does aggro work well enough in PoV/BoT&quot;, but it simply doesn't wash to say that Elemental Planes mobs should be easier 'for the casual player'.   That's flat out retarded.  <br />
<br />
It matters not what I know about you other than how you present yourself, and you're presenting yourself as one who tagged along on a couple of those massive flagfests with 200 person RZ kills and expects it to be easy now that you're up there and are splitting into your own guilds.   <br />
<br />
No, I'm not saying that's how you ARE, I'm saying that's how present yourself.  If it's not true, then correct me.</div></div><hr />

He's a tough SOB, but by no means luck. Put the right group together and your MT lives unless people make mistakes. 500 FR is your friend.<br />

On a different topic:<br />
I'm still confused as to why someone feels they deserve to have access to the same content and kill the same mobs as me when they don't don't put in the same work/time as me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy mother fucking shit. This thread has been dead for weeks and I havent said anything since the 2nd page. Why in the fuck would you randomly pick out what I just said bloody 3 weeks ago and then try and flame me for it? <br />
<br />
Promethis you are a fucking clown shoe. Don't act like you are mr hardcore over the god damned internet and flame people just because you are in Time. You want a fucking medal? This is exactly my point - baby shits like you who have it all in game and then think they can just blast others anonymously over the web. <br />
You are the cock smoker who is sitting there beating his chest - Im in time blah blah blah. I farm the Rathe blah blah blah, and YOU are the one in your gay Overlord channel flaunting your loots like you are king shit. Fuck all your loots. Fuck what you think you know about a stupid online rpg, and most importantly fuck you.<br />
<br />
Frodin I attached this for you for jumping on the flame wagon. Gratz.</div></div><hr />
