<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 61 war, with 6 in general (run 3 regen 3), + 4 in archetype, had some AA's to get the first point of weapon affinity (which in the description says level 55, with 6 pts general as requirement), however it would not let me click the train button for the skill.<br />
<br />
Is there a hidden prerequisite which is needed for weapon affinity?  I was hoping to try and purchase the first couple levels before this is balanced to 5/5/5/5/5.</div></div><hr />

He is most likely referring to this thread GoD AA Refund (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=9695)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently 5/5/5/5/5 on test ;)<br />
<br />
Archtypes like CA, ND, CS obviously would be better spent.  However the original poster wants to get the first 2 levels at the current price before the balance patch.<br />
<br />
On test, the way they did it was that they wouldn't take away any abilities that you had if the price was raised, so anyone with the first 2 levels of WA effectively got 4 free aa's. (basically)</div></div><hr />

That's exactly my thoughts, wanted to get in on the action before they rebalance it, thus saving myself some AA's. <br />
<br />
I've been grinding out AA's dual boxing in Torment, making about an AA per hour. <br />
<br />
I found that I fit all of the listed pre-requisites for the WA, but it still won't let me buy the AA, still have the same issue.  I was under the impression that you could get most of the GoD AA's without having a lot of planar AA's, etc., perhaps it's bugged, not sure.  Will attempt to petition it tonight and see what they say.<br />
<br />
Baadan:  I intend to get those AA's you had mentioned, it is definitely within my progression path, I basically have just recently gotten into AA's at all with my war, just wanted to save myself some trouble if possible.  Currently I am grinding away at 61 until I get bare minimum CS3, CA1, and ND1 before I continue on.  I might bump up to level 62 slightly earlier, but then my source of AA's dries up (Velks) and will have to move full time to PoP zones like Torment and PoV for dual boxing experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but in the AA description it specifically states: &quot;6 general points&quot; and &quot;level 55 or higher&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why you can't buy WA, like you said looking at the description you should have the requirements met, the only reason I can think that you couldn't buy it is if you haven't actually bought/registered the GoD expansion.  <br />
<br />
Aside from that, I don't think there's any real reason to say that you'd be much better off with archtype AA or that the achetype AAs are obviously better.   For the same AA you get either a 10% added proc rate or 2% to avoidance, mitigation or hp.   Even without the upcomming changes that's a pretty nice tradeoff, although possibly saving some AA if the changes work the way they're expected to would surely be an added bonus.   Sure, CA/CS/ND are prereqs for other abilities, and you wouldn't want to max out WA before these, especially at the current cost, but choosing WA over achetypes when they're at the same cost is a perfectly valid AA path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i will ask the obvious: do you own GoD?<br />
<br />
Bah *punches himself in the head* I forgot that since I two box, one account has GoD and one doesn't .... argh!!!!!<br />
<br />
*bangs head repeatedly*  :mad: <br />
<br />
Now I gotta cough up bucks for the GoD expansion which I'll never use except for AA points.... Verant has it's way with my wallet yet again... noooooooo.<br />
<br />
Screw GoD... expansion is garbage for me until I get my three box setup up and running, guess I can live without the AA, I'm not buying GoD unless they drop the price to $9, I find it ridiculous that they are still charging $19 for this expansion where it is included with the platinum pack for $29 which includes all expansions.   *shakes fist at sky*<br />
<br />
I bought GoD for my one account, was the least used expansion out of any of them that I've bought, and I've played since pre-kunark days, about 2 months after EQ came out.  Every expansion has turned up useful to me except GoD, which is why I didn't purchase for 2nd account, nothing really that I can two box in there, plus the mobs are ugly and completely brutal for their level.  My two boxing wouldn't last a 30 seconds in vxed.  <br />
<br />
My apologies, didn't mean to turn this into another anti GoD rant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So much h8 for GoD I actualy enjoyed it for my cle and nec. Of course my war is subpar and got molested but it sure is alot more fun to heal and pull some 1200 hitting mobs vs 600-800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey they're changing AA costs! Sorry Shoth I hadn't seen that thread or I would have responded differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would buy it without a second thought if it wasn't $19, that's kind of a lot of money just to get tribute and some AA's.   If it was only $9, I would probably get it.  It just kinda sux that if I get it, basically would only see the 3 -4 entrance zones, if that.  Not sure if the GoD AA's are much of an upgrade at this point, either, although the tribute seems like it could be useful, then I gotta burn some equipment on that though.   Just not sure if it's worth it content wise, but the AA's plus the tribute bonus seems like it would be a nice benefit, just sucks I gotta pay $19 to get a few added features in the game.</div></div><hr />

Tribute varies itself on the class you play, but as many folks have moved over to tribute haste.... it offers some flexibility with gear.<br />
<br />
Multiboxing in Vxed is still good hunting grounds till 70 as i understand it, as well.<br />
<br />
Not to mention various epic(s) 1.5-2.0 requires step(s) into GoD territory...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I had a third box setup for multiboxing with a shaman on it, I would be probably be able to multibox a little further in, if I had better equipment.  With current equipment however, even Qimini is pretty tough, that prismatic resist -150 check for some of the procs just tears through my war currently at 6300 hp and 1400 AC with buffs on. <br />
<br />
I have a truncheon of doom for when I two box, if I'm two boxing in valor, tactics, etc it's pretty viable, but in vxed or the like there is just too much damage for me to deal with it until I get some ranks of weapon affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebast</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same as your wanting to do.  My warrior had his 6 general AA and even though the points would be better spent on CA or ND, I went ahead and got WA2 for the chance at saving 4 AA.  Like an above poster said, WA is a must have so its not like I'm wasting the points.  Also, about GoD...I love tribute.  I have a haste item so I use the AC/HP tribute.  For 23 points (I think) you can get 30ish AC and 100 HP.  Many people have said drop my waist slot (where haste is) for a better item, but I spend less tribute points for the AC/HP than I would for haste.  And I don't think I could pick up an item that would give me 30 AC/100 HP :).  Anyway, even though $19 is a bit much...GoD has some nice drops and is an OK expansion.</div></div><hr />
