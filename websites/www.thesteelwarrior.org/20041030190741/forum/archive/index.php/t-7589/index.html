<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't remember now, does a slot 1 in armor accept any aug?  I'm trying to decide what augs to dump in my bp that has slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.  If slot 1 takes any aug, then it should probably be a +40hp slot 7 aug from Ruj.  Slot 2 can be a +40 hp slot 2 aug from Tak.  Slot 3 will either be a regen V from Tak or vengeance III or IV (MM or Guk).<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, how about a slot 4 aug for a 2 hander I do not intend to tank with.  760 pts for 150  cold dmg?  510 pts for 125 poison dmg?  Or 510 pts for 100 pt yak proc?  Something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your BP has  type 1, type 2, and type 3 slots on them. That means you can use the type 2 40hps aug from Tak but not the type 7 40hps aug from Ruj. <br />
<br />
You can only put specific augments in their appropriate slot. Just look at what type of slot an augment has before you buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are actually interested in getting the greatest performance out of a slot, check the arms in my magelo for the names of the augs.  I have a 30 hp/end (any slot auggable) in my slot1, with +40 hp in my slot 2, and AoB in my slot 3.  The slot 3 is questionable, and generally accepted as the &quot;utility slot,&quot; since you can fit Enduring Breath, Haste, Regen5, Veng4, etc into it.  I chose the AoB because it was free, dropping out of Tipt.<br />
<br />
The 30 hp/end augs are pretty much the easiest augs to get that fit in slot1, besides the base +5-7 single stat augs out of LDoN.  I have found no augs that are type1 in nature, so the only ones you are going to find fit it are augs that fit in any slot type.  30 hp/end drops out of Tipt off enraged cragbeast mum, first &quot;trial&quot; in the event, and is farmable by killing her, leaving adventure, gettin a new one, and killing her again.  Also drops +30 hp/mana, Aura of Battle, and +2 hp/mana regen, so it's good for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rujark poison proc = Good. Poison resists are one of a mobs lower resists most of the time, and it's included in malo(sini) loving. That plus the resist mod means you'll connect with it for full more than most other procs.<br />
<br />
For a lot 1 aug, you need either a type 1 or type all aug, thus your Royal Sand armor will probably end up looking like this mostly: <br />
1: Stamina/Dex/Resist(dropped)<br />
2: 40 HP<br />
3: Vengeance/Haste/Useful Effect (EB, Vision)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For non-tanking weapon slot 4, I like the lifetap procs from MMC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best bet is to get a tak bp and augment:<br />
<br />
type 1 = hp30/end30 from tipt<br />
type 2 = ldon hp 40<br />
type 3 = hp30/mana30 from tipt</div></div><hr />
