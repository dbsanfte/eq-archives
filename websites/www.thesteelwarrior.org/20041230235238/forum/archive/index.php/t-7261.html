  All the other stats seems to always be ahead of agility in regards to importance. I known that 6 agility= 1 ac(I think). But doesnt agility also have to do with avoidance, and wouldnt you want better avoidance?<br />
<br />
 Has anyone ever parsed lets say a 275 agility warrior against a 155 warrior with same gear?<br />
<br />
 Just a question thats been bugging me for years.<br />
<br />
 thanks,<br />

that said, i dont think there have been any tests to prove my belief.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">max</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the thread link. What I basically got from thier aurguments were that a difference in 88 agility vs 188 agility is 3% avoidance, and 188 vs 250 maybe equals 1 more to make it 4% avoidance.<br />
<br />
 So in comparison having 188 agility is = to CA1 where as each is a 3% avoidance boost.<br />
<br />
 I know that end game gear will maximize most melee stats, but for the 85% of people that will never even see the elemental planes maybe this is a viable question.<br />
<br />
 Thanks again guys Im a new comer here,<br />

i do know of tests conducted by enchanters whereby you did not get the full extent of the total domination aa line unless you had near to max charisma.   ie if you had TD1 and 250 cha you got the full effect .. but needed 290 for TD2 and 305 for TD3.  this doesnt have to do whith the cha's innate aide in keeping a charmed mob charmed.<br />
<br />
it has been speculated that you dont get the full effect of the innate defense line unless you have &quot;x&quot; ac ... the same with agility and avoidance aa's.  i'm not sure of the truth to these cases, but sony builds lots of things in this game similarly, so i wouldnt be at all surprised if its set up in a like manner.<br />
<br />
ps-  on my ranger (max defensive aa) i notice a huge difference btw 220agi and 305 agility when tanking.  i havent tested it on my warrior, and i imagine the inc dmg wouldnt be as noticably different due to increased mitigatoin potential, but i can tell you that it really did make a difference on my ranger<br />
<br />
in HoH my average dmg taken per fight from Valorium guardians were<br />
<br />
duel wield + avatar = 8k dmg per fight average<br />
2hander w/ 220 agility = 6.5k dmg per fight<br />
2hander w/ avatar proc = 5.5k dmg per fight<br />
<br />
did somewhere around 20 fights on each to make sure it wasnt just lucky/unlucky rounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes back in Velious when I was doing my ac testing I did all the agi tests.  Essentially the ac you get from agility is avoidance ac and that's it.  As I recall from my tests there was no further benefit to Agi outside of the ac boost that was visible.</div></div><hr />
