<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiriely</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if there's a raid guild that operates on PST currently doing leading content?  IE: one that starts raids at 7 - 8 p PST?  If so could you be so kind as to point me at their webpage?  To be clear, I'm looking for a guild that's cleared time, done LDON and is now doing GoD...</div></div><hr />

Seems like end game guilds that raid during PST hours, especially late PST, are really hard to come by.  :\  <br />
<br />
That's because they are at a huge disadvantage compared to east coast guilds.  I was in a late PST guild on TM and we lost tons of races because other guilds were killin stuff 3 hours before we had people online.<br />
<br />
My old guild reformed though, and are still PST, probably even later than when I was in it.  They raid from 5 or 6 PST till the wee hours of the morning.  They are only elemental atm, but seem to be progressing pretty well.<br />
<br />
http://www.bcguild.com is their website but it apears to be broke atm.</div></div><hr />
