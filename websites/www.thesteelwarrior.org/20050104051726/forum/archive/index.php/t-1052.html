As per the advice givin to me here I upgraded my rings and started to upgrade earings.  I hate the look of the helm on a barbarian and I can't upgrade my crown untill I find something without a grafix. I want to replace my orc fang and I think I will be all set.  So out of these wich one would you pick?<br />

My str and stamina are usually buffed to the max so I wont really be gaining anything from the stamina.  I was thinking the tempest for resists?<br />

Up to you to see if 1ac and 65hp on earring is worth the 9k difference.. and the Agi Dex one seems pointless for a MT :/<br />
<br />
And Vah Shir Claw Earring is definitely not worth that price, I can buy em right now on TT for a lil over 1700pp I have seen them as low as 1450pp</div></div><hr />

For you to max STA with your current unbuffed STA, you are using up 2 buff slots (PE+Boar). When you hit level 62, you will no longer be able to max STA. Ideally, you need to have 245 unbuffed STA so you can max with only 1 buff. In your situation I would save the plats and get either a Mosquito earring or a Bloodmetal ring of engagement.</div></div><hr />

Those 2 are your best bets, I like the resists on the tempest one, I dont own one, but would prolly be worth picking one up.  Also look into Lizard Tooth Earring (shouldn't be too much more than the mosquito) since its a drop unlike the bloodmetal one which requires access to tier 3 zones and decent trade skills to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That should be it's superior to all but the Mosquito, if possible get Mosquito and Solstice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for Solstice as well.  On Tunare Server pieces can be bought in the Bazaar for around 5k total.<br />
<br />
Then I would save for Mosquito Leg.</div></div><hr />
