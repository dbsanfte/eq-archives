<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kataa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 67 Warrior in a non-raiding guild. I have for 2h Greatstaff of the Four Winds, and a War Marshall's Bladed Staff. For 1h I have a Cord-Hilted Driver and a Great Blade of Storms.   <br />
<br />
I would like to upgrade,  but, it needs to be something 1 groupable, or something I can buy.  Any recommendations?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blade of Carnage or Scepter of Destruction are the well known buyables.  There are also some 14/18 and 15/19 ratio weapons out there with debuff procs.<br />
<br />
For aggro you won't find much better than those buyable.  You probably wont find a buyable dps weapon much better than what you have either w/ GSoFW.<br />
<br />
My Bard roomate got a 17/20 piercer nodrop in riftseekers off a  groupable named ... 140 hp with a lifetap proc.  Good dps and type 8 aug slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your aggro weapons are good for now.  I'd concentrate upgrading a few random armor slots before anything else actually.  An EP bow, for example, would be a great investment.  Some new shoulders with nice hps as well.<br />
<br />
Your gear is pretty solid for a non-raider, but the bazaar can still be your friend in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
I'd move your anger2 to the CHSD and use GBoS mainhand CHSD offhand for aggro and leave the staff for dps only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kataa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I&quot;ve been looking for new shoulders. Anything come to mind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">rusted muramite are 105hp, attunable shoulders, 60k in bazaar on BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggest Horn Spiked shoulder Plates from PoN.  <br />
<br />
Redleaf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shroud of the Nimble is a decent shoulder item from WoS, drops off non named trash too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>arganax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think redleaf is right the Horn Spiked shoulders with 31ac and 65hp are about the best deal in town.  I've seen them for around 50k on my server in the bazaar.  Also you could just go kill the shade in PoN and get them, he's not that tough.  I like them much better than the rusted muramite ones, and although the shroud of the nimble is great, you may spend a very long time in WoS before you ever see it.  Additionally horn spiked are tradable, which is nice in this new era of attunable gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It would be a real stretch, but if you have a group that you can say, hunt in MPG with, maybe consider trying the Trial of Efficiency.<br />
<br />
Can net you a nice 2handblunt... 64/39, 260hp, procs a 250DD. I got mine a while ago and don't remember the name. trial was ridiculously easy.<br />
<br />
To be honest right now you dont look like you would be able to do it. The trial is really more about DPS than tanking, but if your friends have similar gear as you then you would have problems.<br />
<br />
However, its worth a try if you can group in MPG now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>srogue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree, if you can handle MPG, that is where it is at.  Even if you can't do the trials, some of the nameds there drop very nice shoulder items, augs, and weapons such as the Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance.  <br />
<br />
Another weapon you might want to look at is the Bygone Butcher Cleaver, I think it drops from Ruined City of Dranik.  Good stats, decent ratio, and debuff proc for agro.<br />
<br />
Other than that, yeah if you have cash, buy a BoC or Spiked Shoulderplates from PoN.</div></div><hr />
