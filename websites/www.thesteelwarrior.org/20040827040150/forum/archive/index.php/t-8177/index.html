<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for some feedback from this work that I did this afternoon.  I've never taken a photoshop class, the first computer graphics class I take is this fall so hopefully I learn more, but this is basically all hand done, painted the background with the paintbrush and made the stars by making little tiny dots and working with them to some special degree.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just looking for some feedback from the warrior community- This was ment to be a portrait not a signature.. so I know some will tell me I should shrink it up.  I'd do that for a sig but I just kinda like it in its current portrait look size. totaly time spent was maybe about 3 hours but thats alot due to just trying to figure out the tools I needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its nice.<br />

Makes learning photoshop so much more fun, not to mention it gives you dementions of control you never thought photoshop has once you get a tablet, just click brushes in the upper right, click &quot;dynamic shape&quot; and then it will work like a real pencil, push hard and you get dark, thick lines and if you press lightly, you get thin ghosty lines.<br />
<br />
I've had photoshop for 2ish years now, took a class or two but the biggest change for me was being able to use a tablet, let me just say WOW what a differance :P<br />
<br />
(Yes I am pushing wacom tablets as a brand to get, its the most sensitive pen/tablet I know of and they use RF to keep the pen location updated)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm ya, i've seen those :) I'll look into it as maybe a christmas present to myself one of these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">work on your text some more..overall the image is nice ( it's not centered and i loathe straightforward portrait style pics ) and as you learn more about photoshop you'll se more and more of their filters and sharpen/dull the image as needed/desired.<br />
<br />
overall it's a cool picture. the text though is in need of some attention, and usually the rule of thumb is 'less is more' .. don't go for too many effects and details unless you're ready to do a lot of fine tuning the final image to keep the text sharp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya I was trying to keep the text kinda to a lower value as to the picture and more as just a label.  All I did for that was paint bucket and contouring + some inner glow to light it up a bit.  I didnt want the text to take the viewers attention over the picture itself which was much more difficult to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to say that the text IS a bit hard to read. I'd try dropping the glow and going for more readability. The rest of the picture looks beautiful, and the text isn't even bad; it's just a bit fuzzy.</div></div><hr />
