<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the problems with taunt that most warriors see, or are the perceptions of other classes?<br />
<br />
These are a few of the things I see and what I would like to suggest to fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Warrior taunt is broken -- part 1: Are you sure you taunted?<br />
<br />
I hear this one all the time. did you taunt? why arent you taunting? why is the mob chasing me? owww oww oww, get it off (as casters runs around in circles) Whether or not taunt is working as intended (lol) and it does work, although no where near reliable enough for PoP grouping it does work. if you are successful and no one is on frenzy, they mob will at least for a moment turn to you. there are however problems with this still at the basic level. When a paladin casts a spell, there is a message 'paladin-01 begins to cast a spell' there are spell effects, there is a casting animation, there is sound, and there is the brodcast when spell lands 'Mab_02 is stunned' or if the spell fizzles there is a fizzle message for the paladin, or if spell is resisted there is a resist message. What is ther for taunt? EVERY single time 'You taunt Mob_01 to attack you and ignore others!' or the popular ' Mob_01 is too far away to taunt!' No one else ever sees us taunting, there is no message, there is no emote or animation. <br />
<br />
To fix this I suggest adding a few broadcasts - <br />
<br />
a.) First give us a different message wether we fail or succeed. <br />
b.) Also make an emote so that other classes at least THINK we are doing our job. This would also help seeing people taunting that should not. <br />
c.) Finally add the /rude animation to taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Warrior taunt is broken -- part 2: Why do I need to whisper in its ear?<br />
<br />
How many have ever seen the broadcast 'Mob_01 is too far away to taunt' How close do we have to be? You would think melee range at first, but I have been in auto=attack and never too far away to hit, and still too far away to taunt? Why do i need to be closer to taunt than to stab with a dagger? Why can I not taunt from some range? yelling insults, rude gestures etc... There are several soloutions to this, give taunt a fixxed range, give it a scaled range according to skill level, give it a range equivalent to melee range. Any change would be better than what we have now.<br />
<br />
To Fix this I suggest giving a scaled range to taunt -<br />
<br />
Warrior taunt skill caps at 230. With higher skill it would be nice if we had higher range. I would suggest start taunt with a range of 5 and then scale the range up to 130 at level 65.<br />
<br />
-- Warrior taunt is broken -- part 3: why wont this stupid sword thingee work?<br />
<br />
Warriors are slave to the RNG for aggro generation, always have been. It is one of our huge disadvantages, previously we had only two ways to innately generate aggro, DPS and Procing weapons. Procing weapons are very streaking and extremely unreliable for hate generation. Relying on them can work great and it can also leave you waiting forever for a timely proc. DPS is also streaky, being as we are normally in front of the mob, at least when we are doing our job, we get riposted, parried, dodged on a much higher percentage than those hitting from the rear. <br />
<br />
To fix this I suggest giving warriors innate aggro generation on attacks.<br />
 <br />
Add innate hate generation to every attack a warrior makes. EVEN misses or riposts, etc.. if resisted spells get aggro why do misses not? This innate aggro generation would be equivalent to the damage bonus on the weapons we use. this aggro+ would be added every attack, hit/miss/avoided, procs would then become a bonus and saftey feature a luxury for the elite, not a requirement for the masses. This would allow warriors to use our skills, not rely on dps which is highly situational or procs which are highly susceptable to the RNG to gain and maintain aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you joking? Why should our attacks generate any more agro than other melee. If they increase our melee agro they should increase it for all melee classes, and since our attacks are generally softer and slower we'd probably be in worse position than we are now.<br />
<br />
With TM3 those dodges and riposte that seem to be such a huge disadvantage to you all but dissapear. Also dps isn't really situational, the ratio between your average dps and that of the melee around you will always remain nearly the same. Now if you're talking about luclin encounters, caster dps may jump ahead a bit, but that's hardly a game breaking factor.</div></div><hr />

Why are we the only class without innate aggro abilities either to increase or decrease aggro? when maintaining aggro is our sle responsability?  Err I think that is the whole idea behind taunt...it just needs to work differently and better.<br />
<br />
Rangers Druids and Clerics get an invis that they can turn on and off instantlt from AAs...<br />
<br />
Why cant warriors get a turn it on turn it off AA that makes all of there attacks do 50% less damage but generate large amounts of aggro...hmmm</div></div><hr />

<br />
those are bandaids, and bones...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior taunt isn't what's broken, it works over 50% of the time for me in exp groups. And by your same definition, warrior agro isnt broken either since i never have any issues with agro in exp groups.<br />
<br />
So what exactly are we trying to fix? I'm able to gain and hold agro perfectly, because those bandaid weapons and aa's sure do add up. At times I even feel overpowered agro/tanking wise.<br />
<br />
We're looking for solutions for low end warriors, not to overthrow the whole warrior agro system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure Daddio, and the fact that YOU don't have any problems is a clear indication that about 95% of the warrior population is mistaken and there really isnt a problem.  Tell you what, I saw a 60 warrior in damn good gear fail to taunt a mob that was at best light blue off a chanter 4 times after a failed slow last night.  How often do knights lose aggro of a relatively weak mob and fail to get it back instantly.  Taunt is unreliable as hell, and in many cases aggro +1 just means the mob turns to you then immediately turns back to who it was killing until taunt refreshes and you get to pray that it works a second time.   Sure, sometimes I can taunt off the slower with one taunt, but there are also many cases where I can taunt and taunt and taunt some more and never get a mobs attention, solely due to the RNG not being kind to me.   THAT is the basis of the imbalance in tanking right now.  The fact that one of the 3 tanks is TOTALLY reliant on the RNG, which is fundamentally unreliable, and the other 2 are reliant on their own innate abilities, which are not at all random but instead function on demand.    The only way to balance that is to give us more aggro, or give us more mitigation/AC/HP, and even then, if we can't keep a mob's attention on us it doesnt matter if we have a billion HPS or 100, they're still worthless.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was just disputing this  <br />
an AA ability will not fix warrior taunt, equipment will not fix warrior taunt <br />
<br />
Because obviously, if you take my situation, with enough equiment and enough aa's warrior taunt is indeed fixed; if not somewhat overpowered. I didn't mean it to say that warrior taunt isn't underpowered at some level of the game, I just meant that aa's and gear can indeed remedy our situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so finally after every warrior has a BoW Vengance 11, 8000hps and elemental armor, they should finally be ADEQUATE to tank instead of a paladin with a vendor bought spell?<br />
<br />
THAT is what needs fixxed, I never really have aggro problems myself, so does that mean I should NOT care about my fellow warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug we just shouldn't rule out the possibilities of using aa's or equipment to resolve the agro problem. If some decent agro weapons dropped of single group mobs, i guaruntee there wouln't be so many people complaining. Also I seriously doubt SoE is just going to give us an innate ability that will give us agro, if they do make an ability that will help with hate generation it will most likely be an aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">last thing I want is to see more spam while I raid.... really if ppl you group with dont think you doing your job dont group with them. What the fuck kind of sadistic fun is that when you have to prove to ppl in your group that you are doing your job... I dont feel someone doing their job right I give them the boot no taunt message will change this.<br />
<br />
Too far away message could use a lil improvment my sugestion make it so taunt button doesnt grey out when that happens that would make me happy not range increase.<br />
<br />
Part3 - I dont want this in the game period. See that as a huge balancing hurdle and just not worth it. People learned to deal with streaks and this game has always tryed to make it so that NOTHING works 100% of the time and its one of its selling points. <br />
<br />
I'd like to see more things that deferintiate skilled warrior from a dumb ass. So I am againts all the changes that make our job easier then it allready is. I strongly feel learning what and how to do in different situations must be part of the game and we should stay away from trying to make it all the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A naked hybrid can still hold aggro.<br />
A naked warrior is completely and utterly useless.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to be given innate abilities.</div></div><hr />

Besides, you can't compare a naked paladin to a naked warrior. The warrior part of the paladin is worse off than we are, he gets all his agro and healing abilities from the cleric side. <br />
<br />
Warriors aren't meant to have spells, if you want spells play another class. Saying other classes are better naked than us is stupid. I'm sure wizards can still solo in fire naked, and we can't solo in fire with the best gear availible, it doesn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, warriors ARE NOT underpowered. If you compare the best paladin to the best warrior, there is a clear balance. The problem is that things don't balance out lower down, so we need a fix that will only upgrade the low end warriors, without throwing off the balance in the high end game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I very much agree with letting us know if taunt failed or succeeded.  I mean Rogue's can tell whether their hidden skill worked, why shouldnt we be able to tell if taunt worked.  Just an idea/complaint or whatever it might be.</div></div><hr />

which one would be preferred in groups?<br />
<br />
A Paladin with 9000hp, aggro lock, heals, roots, rez, buffs.<br />
<br />
Or a Warrior with 9500hp, defensive and /shield?...<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a clear balance, defensive obviously makes up for all those things paladins have!<br />
<br />
And aggro upgrade? pffff, why would we want those?<br />
The best equipped warriors out there with tons of aas can ALMOST aggro as well as any gimp paladin. <br />
I'd say that would almost be overpowered as well. Could put all those gimp paladins out of business :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine clerics with ONLY Completel Heals, and NO other spells...<br />
It would be balanced, since we'de still only use them in Raids for cheal chains, wouldnt it?<br />
Well that is where warriors are atm.<br />
We ONLY get Defensive, and its what makes us usefull at raids.<br />
<br />
WOOWOO!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the warrior will NOT tank a lot better than a naked paladin. He may be able to take a *bit* more of a beating, but that warrior will NOT be able to keep aggro. What's the point of being able to take damage if the mob won't pay any attention to you? As for the warrior part of the paladin being worse off, you're right. Paladins only take a hit 90% as well as a warrior. Poor them.<br />
<br />

<br />
You only think it's stupid because you don't understand the point I'm trying to make. That point is, knights have innate aggro generation capabilities, and warriors have none. Warriors, as a class that have given up everything including utility, and the ability to cast spells to be the best tank, do not have the innate capabilities that the hybrids have as secondary tanks. THAT is wrong.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, warriors ARE NOT underpowered. If you compare the best paladin to the best warrior, there is a clear balance. The problem is that things don't balance out lower down, so we need a fix that will only upgrade the low end warriors, without throwing off the balance in the high end game.  <br />
<br />
Warriors are underpowered in DPS compared to casters, and they are underpowered in the taunt/aggro issue compared to knights. These issues have been admitted to by SoE itself. The aggro issue is also recognized by the majority of warriors and by just about every class in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You all are looking at this as though warriors are underpowered.  I don't believe this is the case; instead i believe pallies and SKs are overpowered.  We can keep agro reliably with decent gear, and we have always been the class that required the most gear... that comes with the job.  We seem to have lost sight of the fact that the problems we have now arose because SOE upgraded pallies and SKs without upgrading warriors.<br />
<br />
I hate calling for nerfs of other classes, but it seems to me that that is exactly what is in order atm.  I don't have any brilliant ideas or anything to toss out on the matter, but I know for a fact that I have no problem holding agro... it's just that the pallies/sks can do it more reliable, and much more easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye...<br />
<br />
You also forgot that the pallies/sks can do it, at will, at range, instantly, and virtually without fail or delay for an almost infinite amount of time...<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
just one more note on balance of taunting forms, <br />
<br />
When our taunt fails... it does nothing...and takes 6 sec to refresh..<br />
<br />
When their taunt fails..ie resisted.. they STILL get a huge taunt effect...<br />
<br />
When their taunt fails..ie fizzles.. it refreshes instantly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is supposed to be a balance:<br />
<br />
Knights Aggro Great, but Tank ok.<br />
Warriors aggro ok, but tank great!<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is this:<br />
<br />
Knights Aggro great!, but tank almost as good as warriors.<br />
Warriors have a hard time aggroing, and tank a bit better then paladins.<br />
<br />
Yet this is only a SMALL part of the imbalance.<br />
<br />
Even if the aggro/tank part was balanced, you forget that :<br />
<br />
SKs, get FD, HT, self buffs, groups buffs, they can solo, they lifetape etc...<br />
<br />
Paladins can buff parties, rez, heal groups, stun, etc...<br />
<br />
Warriors can.. use defensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
You must be pretty blind to say there is no imbalance....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You compare the best paladin to the best Warrior?...which one would be preferred in groups?<br />

<br />
More accuratly the paladin would have somewhere around 9500hp, and the warrior would have around 11000. Both would have agro lock, the warrior probably deals around 30 extra dps, and has defensive disciplines which are very useful for minis. The paladin has some extra heals, and a root. <br />
<br />
Here is where it evens out, the warrior has enough hp to make up for ranged agro, a little extra dps, and gives the group the ability to take on mini bosses. The paladin offers extra heals and ghetto cc. (Warriors can cc 3 mobs aswell using evasive disc.) So it's pretty much a toss up for who you want for the group. Now the warrior goes to a raid and has far more utility than the paladin on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
As for not being the best tank we are, by far. However this is one of those raid utilities warriors have that not everybody uses. I don't know of any guild that uses a knight to tank fennin. Why? Because warriors are better at it, sure defensive may not make a huge difference in pickup groups, but in raids it's a big deal. This is where we have utility and where paladins have very little.<br />
<br />
I don't really compare my dps to casters, we do two completely different jobs, I really could care less if a caster was doing 500dps and i was doing 10dps and tanking the mob. However as it stands yes low-mid tier melee are being outdamaged by the low-mid tier casters by quite a bit. But again it evens out when the melee are equipped with weapons from elemental gods or time.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we shouldn't have something done to help out the 90% of warriors without elemental access, I'm saying the class balance isn't broken at all levels of the game. So we can't just add an innate ability for everybody, because it'll effect the balance that is already in place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you're only close to being right if he was referring to unbuffed hitpoints. Considering there is noone even close to that level of hitpoints, noone can say how it will be by then... it all depends on itemization in future expansions. <br />
However, he is referring to BUFFED hitpoints, and as such, he is absolutely right. The difference between the buffed warrior and the buffed paladin is about that, after pally buffs that are always up are taken into account.<br />
<br />
Here is where it evens out, the warrior has enough hp to make up for ranged agro, a little extra dps, and gives the group the ability to take on mini bosses.<br />
<br />
The warrior's hitpoint advantage is wiped out nearly the second the warrior is forced to tank the unslowed mob, while the pally does not. The ability to take on mini's is only relevant in a very few cases, as most groups aren't there to take on minis, they're there for experience, and when thinking of a tank, getting a tank that allows them to tank down minis is at best, a secondary consideration. The DPS difference is nearly insignificant with current itemization, and the warrior's inability to use DPS weapons when tanking, and having to use inferior damage, but better aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
 The paladin offers extra heals and ghetto cc. (Warriors can cc 3 mobs aswell using evasive disc.) So it's pretty much a toss up for who you want for the group. Now the warrior goes to a raid and has far more utility than the paladin on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
You're downplaying what a paladin offers to bolster your point. The paladin not only offers extra heals and ghetto CC, the paladin offers ranged aggro, offers an aggro lockdown, stuns to reduce damage taken, as well as buffs to increase the entire group's hitpoints.<br />
As for warriors being able to CC 3 mobs using evasive, that's a load of crap. Warriors have problems keeping aggro on more than one mob at a time to begin with. Add a damage and proc reducing disc, AND keeping CC on yet a third mob, and it's going to be just as difficult for the warrior as the hybrid.<br />
<br />
As for not being the best tank we are, by far. However this is one of those raid utilities warriors have that not everybody uses. I don't know of any guild that uses a knight to tank fennin. Why? Because warriors are better at it, sure defensive may not make a huge difference in pickup groups, but in raids it's a big deal. This is where we have utility and where paladins have very little.<br />
<br />
I agree warriors are a necessity on any mob that requires defensive, but that's it. Warriors have NO utility outside of that due to the lack of snap aggro generation. I challenge you to prove how warriors have &quot;utility&quot; in raids, as we as a class have none. We do ONE thing, and one thing only, and that's tank mobs.<br />
As for paladins not having utility, I'm calling that as false. Paladins have the fastest heal in the game. Paladins have the same utility in both exp groups and raids. They can heal people that are going to die RIGHT NOW, they can stun mobs to stop them from casting/gating, they have LoH, are one of the two classes that can rez, can generate snap aggro on mobs that need to be slowed ASAP, can DA pull to position hard hitting mobs, etc, etc etc. That is far from the &quot;no utility&quot; that you are claiming they have on raids.<br />
As for saying warriors are the best tank &quot;by far&quot;, that is only the case on mobs that require defensive. Outside of that, pallies have 90% of what we do in defensive skills, hitpoints, and AC. This TEN PERCENT difference is offset by aggro abilities while are widely agreed to be far, far better than warriors. So, overall, no. We are NOT the best tank by far. Only when it comes to named mobs are we appreciably better for the three minutes defensive is active.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we shouldn't have something done to help out the 90% of warriors without elemental access, I'm saying the class balance isn't broken at all levels of the game. So we can't just add an innate ability for everybody, because it'll effect the balance that is already in place.<br />
<br />
Actually, we can.<br />
<br />
We can give warriors innate aggro generation capabilities. Balance them so that they are inferior to knights. Then we remove EB from the game.<br />
Warrior aggro issues would be solved in one fell swoop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just aquick thought , if Warriorswith enough AA points are considered by some to be useful , how do they get those AA points? The answer is obviously through grouping for experience BUT How can a warrior get in an EXP group when Pallies and SK's are chosen above them because of superior agro holding abilities .<br />
 The point then becomes senseless , ALL classes can out damage and out agro the Warrior , but it's just sheer greed on the parts of many many people , if a Group wants to use all the AA points and abilities that their members have , then they will out damage and out agro ANY tank , this is why Wizards don't overnuke unless they want a quick visit to the soulbinder , Warriors taunt does need addressing badly , but only because warriors have stood still whilst other plate classes have had huge benefits bestowed upon them .<br />
  Fix agro very simply , increase the taunt skill cap to the maximum possible , and allow for the fact that you CAN overtaunt over a pally stun if you time it right and it &quot;hits &quot; , we know when taunt works , the mob hit's us again , or if increasing taunt cap is too much , reduce refresh on AE Taunt ,<br />
 BTW , I am a level 65 warrior with NO EB and 115 AA points , I still find work, but it is difficult at times .<br />
 Above all , enjoy the game , sooner or later it all comes together , this is why I still play after 4 years. <br />
 Happy hunting all .<br />

This is just to be used as an example of how the three classes do indeed blance in the endgame. Don't reply with &quot;so everyone needs to get elemental gear to be balanced?&quot; because that's not what I intend. I'm going to reply to each of your points with using my personal experiences, and the experiences of end tier warriors both on my server and on others.<br />
<br />
Actually, you're only close to being right if he was referring to unbuffed hitpoints. Considering there is noone even close to that level of hitpoints, noone can say how it will be by then... it all depends on itemization in future expansions.  <br />
<br />
The buffed hitpoints I selected are real, and they are both from the best of their respective classes serverwide. For your personal wellbeing, there are actually multiple warriors near or over 11k buffed. The best equipped paladin serverwide is just over 9.6k.<br />
<br />
The warrior's hitpoint advantage is wiped out nearly the second the warrior is forced to tank the unslowed mob, while the pally does not. <br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of shamans you group with, but the ones I know slow an exp mob long before I take 1500 in damage. With a BoW and full offensive aa's, agro is locked within the first 5 seconds of combat. On mobs that require multiple ch's our hp advantage only becomes more obvious.<br />
<br />
As for warriors being able to CC 3 mobs using evasive, that's a load of crap. Warriors have problems keeping aggro on more than one mob at a time to begin with. <br />
<br />
It's very possible for a warrior with dual EB, a BoW or elemental god/PoTime weapons to hold agro on 3 mobs. Infact, it isn't even that difficult, as soon as you get one eb proc on each mob they are basically locked to you and you can concentrate on on mob, switching off every 20 seconds of so to rebuild some hate on the others.<br />
<br />
As for paladin utility on raids, sure they have a buff, but you can raid without brells. It's pretty hard to kill Fennin Ro without a defensive warrior. My point being, Clerics can heal better than paladins, Warriors can tank better than paladins. They lose most of their raid utility to their two base classes.<br />
<br />
We can give warriors innate aggro generation capabilities. Balance them so that they are inferior to knights. Then we remove EB from the game. Warrior aggro issues would be solved in one fell swoop. <br />
<br />
And by do this reduce the warrior class to a single button, weapons no longer matter for us, we dont even have to attack, just hit your agro button, whoop de do we're having fun. No longer is there any skill or time invested for a warrior to be good, because joe blow who plays once a month is going to hold agro aswell as Furor Planedefiler.<br />
<br />
1. SoE already said they wouldn't inplement unrealistic changes requiring a large change in game mechanics. Adding an innate ability to a class is actually, believe it or not, rather difficult.<br />
<br />
2. It's make our class boring as hell, just mash agro button over and over again. Not very fun at all. Besides, many warriors don't even have agro problems, so a change of this magnitude is not required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are referring to raid buffed hitpoints of the two best in the game. You'e arguing a point using totally different sets of buffs and totally different people from the original poster.<br />
<br />
9000 for the XP group buffed paladin and 9500 for the XP group buffed warrior, in comparable gear, ARE quite close to the proper comparisons to make. Or are you trying to say that tanks just wander around in XP groups fully raid buffed? Are you trying to say that 11khp buffed warriors and 9600khp paladins are what you can expect even in an elemental equipped guild? Of course not.<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of shamans you group with, but the ones I know slow an exp mob long before I take 1500 in damage.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to say you have 1500hp more hp that an equivalent equipped paladin, with Paladin group and self-only buffs up? You and I BOTH know that's not the case. Come on man, you're taking extremes to try and make your point... <br />
<br />
With a BoW and full offensive aa's, agro is locked within the first 5 seconds of combat. On mobs that require multiple ch's our hp advantage only becomes more obvious.<br />
<br />
Ah, right. we're fine cause with a BoW and full offensive AA's, aggro is locked 5-10 seconds after the paladin would have it locked. I bow to your uberness.<br />
<br />
As for paladin utility on raids, sure they have a buff, but you can raid without brells. It's pretty hard to kill Fennin Ro without a defensive warrior. My point being, Clerics can heal better than paladins, Warriors can tank better than paladins. They lose most of their raid utility to their two base classes.<br />
<br />
That being said, they still play a very valid role, and have far more utility IN that role than the warriors. <br />
<br />
And by do this reduce the warrior class to a single button, weapons no longer matter for us, we dont even have to attack, just hit your agro button, whoop de do we're having fun.<br />
<br />
Actually, no. Sure, knights can do that, aren't they having fun? But if I have my way, warriors will be balanced enough where they are not able to hold aggro solely through the use of the aggro button. You're trying say that I'm looking for something far more powerful and unbalancing than I actually am.<br />
<br />
No longer is there any skill or time invested for a warrior to be good, because joe blow who plays once a month is going to hold agro aswell as Furor Planedefiler.<br />
<br />
More hyperbole.<br />
<br />
1. SoE already said they wouldn't inplement unrealistic changes requiring a large change in game mechanics. Adding an innate ability to a class is actually, believe it or not, rather difficult.<br />
<br />
That's fine. my vision of this ability is neither unrealistic or requiring a large change in game mechanics.<br />
<br />
2. It's make our class boring as hell, just mash agro button over and over again. Not very fun at all. Besides, many warriors don't even have agro problems, so a change of this magnitude is not required.  <br />
<br />
That's your vision of how powerful this skill would end up being balanced out, not mine. <br />
<br />
And yes, all warriors have aggro problems. Rather, it's not a problem, it's a weakness that all warrirors share.That problem is the snap aggro generation at the beginning of the fight, and that's what this skill would address. It would also address those unfortunate warriors that are not able to obtain aggro weapons.</div></div><hr />

1) Increase taunt success rate on xp mobs (white &amp; lower con)<br />

Warrior agro can be solved with itemization. By making some high agro weapons easily accessable we can fix the warrior problem. Since the &quot;ubers&quot; who already posess these weapons can hold agro just fine. <br />

<br />
The logic is; all naked 65 warriors are basically the same. When equipped; if some warriors can hold agro without the use of a &quot;gimmick&quot;; then it's possible for all warriors to hold agro without the use of a gimmick. The difference is experience and gear. Itemization is easy, changing warrior game mechanics is not. If we want to propose a change, which one should we pick?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet you wield an item with the very effect that developers ADMITTEDLY put into the game in the velious expansion as a, in thier own words, &quot;patch effort&quot; to deal with the warrior aggro issue. <br />
<br />
Warriors have been getting bandaids put on gaping wounds for several expansions now. you're just one of the ones that have been blinded into thinking there's no problems. Or you're another one of the elemental warriors that are so blinded by their own sense of uberness and how great they are that they can't admit there's a problem. And there is a problem. I don't car eif you're in banded wielding rusty weapons, or full elemental wielding a BoW, you have this problem. It's the problem of not being able to generate an aggro spike on demand to cover the initial slows and debuffs like the knights can.<br />
<br />
As for you saying you having 1500 hitpoints more than your closest paladin, obviously you ignored my statement of &quot;WHEN THEY ARE PALLY BUFFED.&quot; soon as a pally puts up his self buffs, BSS and AoTC, that difference shrinks to about 800ish hitpoints. That's just over 10%. Congrats, you're just like everyone else. That's what, ONE hit in elementals? Still, it invaldates your point about the shammy slowing before you take 1500 damage.</div></div><hr />

Now we have to factor in damage the paladin was taking against the slowed mob, lets make it one third. A warrior has now 3000 hp advantage over the pally if no discs are used. I often use evasive to conserve some mana, so the actual difference is pretty wide.<br />
<br />
Secondly, warriors aren't supposed to be able to generate agro on demand. It seems SoE likes the knight's agro capabilities as they made a few encounters where low dps mobs slow the tank. This is a pretty clear indication of when to use a hybrid tank. They have superior agro capabilties, they are SUPPOSED to have superior agro capabilties. Warriors are supposed to be able to hold agro, but we aren't supposed to have complete perma lock on agro even when slowed or blind or not even attacking. We gave that up for defensive and that's part of the reason why giving us an innate agro ability would overpower some of us.<br />
<br />
Right now i can think of about 5 encounters in PoP where we use knights to tank. If warriors got an innate agro proc all of a sudden these low dps mobs (low dps = quad for less than a total of 6000 damage) become trivial, cause we can defensive tank them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question really is not whether taunt is broken or knights should not be able to lock aggro.<br />
<br />
The real question is how do you balance the risk of damage to the other group members.<br />
<br />
This is the current scenario:<br />
<br />
When a warrior tanks, other group members will more than likely get hit if they do not manage their aggro.<br />
<br />
When a knight class tanks, other group  members seldom if ever get hit regardless of how early and hard they nuke/debuff/slow.<br />
<br />
It does not take a genius to see that the player base will move to the lowest risk and that is exactly what has happened.<br />
<br />
To fix this situation, SoE can either bring the warriors up in aggro generation so that the group risk is the same as knights or they can nerf the aggro generating abilities of knights to bring the group risk in line with warriors.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that warrior aggro generation is, for the most part, appropriate as I believe that there should be risk in every battle. Not only does it require the other group members to actually have to play the game, it also makes the game more exciting.<br />
<br />
Making the game so that all I need to do is hit my attack key and taunt key once and then go watch TV or read a book is not very fun.  That, to me, is what it is like when a knight class tanks.<br />
<br />
Can SoE improve us warriors?  They sure can by separating the offensive and defensive timers.<br />
<br />
They can even monkey with the aggro control if they want. I just don't want to see it trivalize the XP portion of the game, which it will do if they bring our taunt/aggro control in line with knights.<br />

That's pure manipulation of numbers that proves nothing. the &quot;warrior HP advantage&quot; is not commonly referred to in multiples of CHEAL landings, it is referred to as a single number of how many more hitpoints the warrior has. <br />
Secondly. You're not taking into account the less damage that the paladin takes by stunning the mob and interrupting its casting and melee. Nor are you taking into account the paladins ability to heal themselves as well as the entire group.<br />
Your supposed 3k hp advantage over the pally really doesn't exist, it's pure manipulation of numbers to try and inflate the difference to try and bolster your point.<br />
<br />
Secondly, warriors aren't supposed to be able to generate agro on demand.<br />
<br />
That's what YOU say. *I* say they are supposed to be able to. The reality is, neither you nor I have the authority to give a definitive answer on the subject, but I maintain the fact that a hate increasing proc was put into the game as a patch effort to give warriors luck-based and weapon-based aggro while they worked on a better option... that option being innate aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that you realise that it's already broken.  I gave up on my warrior when Luclin came out.  I saw paladins tanking exp mobs after they were tweeked and saw the end of warriors in the traditional group.  Paladins and SK's getting aggro lock as the mob is inc means the group kills the mob so much faster the knights require less healing during the fight.  If you don't believe me do what I did.  Retire your warrior.  Play up a caster (any caster) then get into a group with a knight.  If you have a bard in the party you can non-stop pull killing mobs within a minute.  Start nuking away at 96% health and chain until it's dead.  There is no way in hell a warrior can hold aggro as consistantly as a knight.  If you feel that warriors shouldn't get aggro lock because it will trivialize the XP portion of the game then you already missed the boat.<br />

<br />
Valid and significant point.  Trivialized is trivialized.  It doesn't matter if a Knight is doing the trivializing or it's a Warrior.  At this point Knight aggro control trivializes much of the exp content.  Warrior aggro control does not.  You can't really claim that making it less risk inherant for one tank class is perfectly fine but that it will break the game for another tank class to have the same reduced risk.  Either the risk is good or it is bad.  And whichever is decided to be the correct answer should be true consistantly or you're just arguing that you need to retain a benefit solely because it's a benefit you don't wish to share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is the huge amount of agro low level knight spells can cause, even on resists and did not take hold.<br />
<br />
SOE should implement a feature that makes resists higher for obsolete spells and make them generate less agro on resists or did not take hold situations.<br />
This would force knights to stop using their low level stuns and darkness for agro, because it would get resisted alot and generate little agro. They would then be &quot;forced&quot; to use their high level versions and mana would be a limit then.<br />
<br />
This feature would also force casters to use their higher level spell versions, but since knights have low versions spells of necros and clerics, then the feature would have to work based on the casters level of the spell, so a 50+ darkness from a SK would not have the same resist modifiers from the feature as the same darkness from a 29 necro.<br />
<br />
This feature would only really work if devs stopped making cross-class items with both mana and HP.<br />
These items do not &quot;force&quot; the knights into choosing between spells and melee stats.<br />
These items give knights the same melee stats as warriors and allow them to maintain a huge mana pool at the same time, which is really a big problem when balancing the tank classes.<br />
<br />
Another problem is the huge amount of knight weapons that seems far superior to the cross-class weapons and the huge lack of warrior only weapon.<br />
Today the knights can roll for their knight-only weapons and if the loose the roll, then they can roll for the cross-class weapons too.<br />
This means that the knight class in general has better weapons than the warrior.<br />
The warrior class really need a huge weapon upgrade for all levels with warrior only weapons that really are better than the cross-class weapons.</div></div><hr />

Even with 5 aa's to get ae taunt (roughly 15 mins without 18 *extra* aa's to bring the refresh time to around 10 minutes) and defensive we still have 8 1/2 min refresh, in xp groups, living sheild is a great tool I have it AA maxed, but this isnt a tool that fixes our taunt issues eaither, ping pong still exists.<br />
<br />
We are not as godly as people think.  We dont raid every single day folks.  Its simple I not asking anyone to re-invent warriors or sk's,<br />
just please toss us a bone, improve our taunt button, im not an sk or pally hater, I have been a good boy, I'm not power hungry, I *dont* want to put pally's or sk's on the unemployment line, my heart is true here.<br />
<br />
Please dont tell me we are currently overpowered...thats just biased...just improve the taunt generated by the taunt button , is that really asking to much? Is it?:(</div></div><hr />

Again you're talking about high-end warriors with great gear and exp out the ass.  Most of the warriors that play this game do not have that kind of gear or experience or the real life time to get it.  Honestly, I'd rather do group dungeons any day than raid.  Raids are fucking boring as far as I'm concerned.  All that prep time to kill one creature and *maybe* get loot for 2 or 3 folks?  Bullshit.  Add to the fact that you have to be on the ball and therefore generally not joking around having fun quite as much.  I'd rather fuck up and kill just myself than fuck up and kill 40 people.  I don't have time for doing 5 hour raids AND get the experience necessary to be at the top of my game.  I'm betting at least 80% of the people that play EQ don't have the time to do both.<br />
<br />
If I were still playing my warrior, I bet I'd be using a barnacle covered axe and a frosty (or some such combination) just for aggro reasons, because that's what I was able to quest and afford.  If I had the luxury of better DPS weapons that had the aggro generation of those weapons I'd use it.  However, knights and monks of that level don't have to worry about such things.  It's always been a trade off for warriors, DPS or aggro.  Too bad knights don't have to follow that example.  What's going to generate more DPS, a windblade or a BCA and frosty?<br />

<br />
I love how you both quoted the part of my post that proved your point and then completly ignore the part that goes against it.<br />
<br />
The point is. My monk level 58 with a droppable weapon and no offensive AAs outdamaged a Paladin that had 5 levels on him and his class title...by uh yeah...DOUBLE. <br />
<br />
Warrior damage is at least in line with monk damage, if not better than monk damage all the way through the levels. Which means that you TOO destroy crappy paladin DPS. <br />
<br />
Why dont you start looking at yourself from a DPS perspective and realize that you can TANK, and are in the high end tier of melee DPS? And that THAT sets you apart more from paladins as well.</div></div><hr />

Get real for a minute.   Your anecdotal &quot;my 58 monk outdamaged a Paladin with a CLASS TITLE&quot; is entirely meaningless.   Not a little, but entirely.<br />
<br />
1. What haste did your 58 monk have and what haste did the paladin have?<br />
<br />
2. What droppable weapons did you have and what kind did they have?<br />
<br />
3. What KIND of AA's did that Paladin have?   I mean if it was Slay Undead (a popular fast AA choice among Paladins) and you werent' fighting undead, then their 'class title&quot; is kind of meaningless.<br />
<br />
4. You were attacking from the rear of the mob i presume whereas they were fighting from the front?  <br />
<br />
5. How much were other DPS people in your group enabled to generate because of the aggro lock?    <br />
<br />
6. How come DPS parses on many fights show a consistent pattern of ROG&gt;MNK&gt;BST&gt;SK&gt;WAR&gt;PAL&gt;BRD if this is correct?    I think someone's been drinking too much bog juice because they saw &quot;a parse&quot; of &quot;a warrior&quot; outdamaging &quot;a monk&quot; and assumed that this is a consistent pattern throughout all of the levels.</div></div><hr />

2. What droppable weapons did you have and what kind did they have? I have a staff of flowing water...he had a windblade<br />

and what do you do? you show me an elemental parse...<br />

Oh and btw the ranger in that parse is melleing...with his bow hes at the tops of the list.<br />

<br />
I dont see how it can be consitant throughout all those encounters considering that...SKs parse GROSSLY higher in PoP fights than luclin fights because their harm touch is factored into their DPS calculations and the shorter the fight the more weight its going to have. Additionally, most warriors wont use their offensive discs during raid encounters in the event that they need to tank. So if we are talking raid DPS calculuations I still believe that the warrior is more in the monk rogue range...then in the SK Pali Range....<br />
<br />
Also...<br />
<br />
I dont know where those numbers come from BUT...<br />
<br />
The most uber of uber monks at MB, fully raid buffed, overhasted, and from the back of the mob, in PoP report barley creaping over 200 DPS...so how this parsed monk is getting 220 in an exp group is rather perplexing</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got it fool?!! This has been parsed by COMPETANT people a zillion times, you are not competant.<br />

<br />
Since this is the case, make some warrior only weapons with resonable ratios and some type of agro proc. More weapons like that 2hander on innoruuk for the masses. Not some uber weapon that is going to parse crazy dps, but a weapon that will parse resonable dps and hold agro.</div></div><hr />

Was that parsing, with an all offensive AA warrior with BoW vs. an all offensive monk with Exquisite Puresteel Wraps and Stone Etched Mallet, done with the warrior tanking without defensive, so alot of ripostes got added to the parsing?<br />
Was the procs from the Exquisite Puresteel Wraps calculated in?<br />
<br />
Even if the parsing still say the warrior can outdamage a monk at that level, then your assumption that this is also the case at all other level TOTALLY wrong.<br />
Decent warrior weapons are HARD to find, which is not in the same degree the case with monk weapons and certainly not with knight weapons.<br />
<br />
If your 3AA 58 monk can outdamage a 63 Pally with class title, then you can pretty much be sure you can do the same to the general warrior of same level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">urkira</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair enough Zuk,<br />
<br />
To answer your question the warrior in that case was not tanking. The point was that high end warriors are outdamaging high end monks (high end monks with equipment from much more difficult content mind you) from a damage dealing position, which is something that no paladin could EVER hope to do.<br />
<br />
Perhaps my example wasnt perfect, Im not an end game player myself...but I was just offering an example from personal observation about just how bad Paladin DPS is. Ive never had the same perceptions about a warrior, and I parse most of my fighting.<br />
<br />
And to the person who stated that you must remove all variables for a parse to be accurate, I agree with you, however if you read my answers to the questions posed to me before that, I believe that the variables werent too unbalanced, and were in fact tipped in the paladins favor. We had all the same buffs, were fighting the same mobs, from the same position, for the same amount of time. The pali wasn't tanking so he wasnt really casting spells to affect his swing amounts, he had 5 levels on me, obviously a lot of AA, including slay undead...fighting undead mobs. I cant speak to the quality of his gear, all I know for a fact was that he was using a windblade, and I assume that he had a haste item, which at 63 isnt an unfair assumption IMO. <br />
<br />
As an epic monk, it is likley that my attack was higher than his, and the staff of flowing water has a better ratio than the windblade...but i dont think either of those things are enough in themselves to justify the huge difference in damage shown.<br />
<br />
So from what I see...either paladins suck at doing damage, or his 2hs skill wasnt anywhere near maxed...I think warriors should be content to believe the former :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in melee damage on our raids we consistently see this..<br />
<br />
rogues &gt; monks &gt; BL pets &gt; SK &gt; Pal &gt; war<br />
<br />
some of that may be skewed as our warriors are usually tanking. and warriors do not assist but are always on add watch. But it is pretty much always the case.<br />
<br />
rogues- wicked shanks<br />
monks - rebb's<br />
BL pets - summoned gear<br />
sk/pal - sol ro weapons<br />
war - BoC's<br />
<br />
DPS is a useless argument, Tanking lowers dps due to the defenses of the mob, and no back attacks.</div></div><hr />

The bottom line is, warriors ARE NOT underpowered. If you compare the best paladin to the best warrior, there is a clear balance. The problem is that things don't balance out lower down, so we need a fix that will only upgrade the low end warriors, without throwing off the balance in the high end game.  <br />
<br />
Solution, Edit the /shield command to slightly different settings, Rather then being able to use it on anyone any time the ability is up and have it last only a few minutes, make it so that it his more fire and forget, you set /shield on a player and it remains there indefinatly untill you zone or are no longer grouped with that player,  this way a warrior can set it on the person most likely to take agro (in most groups this is the slower) for any class/player that is able to maintain agro well this would be a minor change, so the high end warriors who maintain agro will not be affected nor will paladins, shadowknights.  however should a tank loose agro the shield is constantly in effect, even a roleplaying reason for this as any tank/warrior would know that a mob is likely to attack certain classes after they use a certain ability (shaman/chanter slow, ranger/druid snare) and the warrior would be in a constant state of rediness waiting to jump inbetween the mob and this partner to save him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, a 1500hp difference, factor in brells to be 1200 in groups.<br />
<br />
A paladin can't solo efficiently either, a well equipped warrior can solo well enough to get by, not really a make or break point.<br />
<br />
Yeah he has spells, i have disciplines and higher hp/ac. Thanks for pointing that out...<br />
<br />
A paladin can instantly lock agro, a warrior can come damn close to that. We don't have spells so we shouldn't be as good as them anyway, but as it turns out, in the endgame we get pretty damn close to it.<br />
<br />
Shields aren't meant for warriorsin pickup groups so it's completely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I don't know how you figure the paladin needs less healing, but generally in elemental groups if the paladin is tanking he isn't using his mana healing himself, thats what the cleric is for.<br />
<br />
Who wins in a duel isn't really relevant either, I'm pretty sure I'd lose to a cleric with a ds potion aswell, that doesn't really prove anything.<br />
<br />
The paladin loses a lot of raid functionality and gains a little in groups. Ofcourse this balance only applies to a rather small group (say 10-15% of the population.)</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that the ratio of your SoFW is slightly better than the windblade the paladin was using.<br />
<br />
I am quite a bit surprised that the monk in the elemental comparision was using 1handers.<br />
Almost every parse i have seen comes out with 2handed weapons on top of dualwielding 1handers (rogues aside).<br />
This is assuming the monk has a good 2hander, but i think it is pretty safe to say that this is not more likely or unlikely as a warrior having a decent (dps) 2hander.</div></div><hr />

What are the problems with taunt that most warriors see, or are the perceptions of other classes?<br />
<br />
a.) First give us a different message wether we fail or succeed. <br />
b.) Also make an emote so that other classes at least THINK we are doing our job. This would also help seeing people taunting that should not. <br />
c.) Finally add the /rude animation to taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Warrior taunt is broken -- part 2: Why do I need to whisper in its ear?<br />
<br />
a.) Warrior taunt skill caps at 230. With higher skill it would be nice if we had higher range. I would suggest start taunt with a range of 5 and then scale the range up to 130 at level 65.<br />
<br />
-- Warrior taunt is broken -- part 3: why wont this stupid sword thingee work?<br />
<br />
a.) To fix this I suggest giving warriors innate aggro generation on attacks. <br />
 <br />
  <br />
<br />
+ Hate = damage bonus, <br />
 or even better,  <br />
just add a HATE FACTOR to weapons that only warriors get to use...<br />
<br />
I see no good reasons why any of these should not or cannot be done.</div></div><hr />

Excluding PoT items The best monk 2hb is the fiery staff of zha, the best one hand combo is the exquisitte puresteel wraps/stone etched mallet. The two have been parsed very close to one another with the one coming out on top usually ending up dependent on proc rates. Puresteel/Stone etched has about double the stats tho. <br />
<br />
The true thing to consider tho is that a warrior with a weapon that drops in a tier 3 encounter is outdamaging a monk with weapons from an elemental god.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I feel that often warriors dont put enough weight on the value that they bring to the group as a damage dealer...and they should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much has been made that the best War weapon is from RZ.. it is appropriate from a Role Playing point of view.<br />
<br />
And warriors have a few disadvantages in the DPS department, we almost always face the mobs, so we get ripost/parry/dodged, and UNTIL the BoW, all our taunt weapons are 1hs, there is a great disparity in DPS from dual wield to two-handed.<br />
<br />
the perception that we are not DPS is not a warrior only feeling, ALL of EQ see warriors as a low-dps class.<br />
<br />
You need to look at base classes, not AA's when looking at DPS.  base classes with equivalent weapons dps will go.. <br />

<br />
back this shit up.  this is nonsense.<br />
<br />
paladins are warriors who can heal and rez, SKs are warriors who can FD and lifetap.  knight agro is an accident - an exploit - a result of bad design decisions.<br />
<br />
your statement is akin to saying &quot;enchanters are meant to be able to solo mobs that wipe out entire raids&quot;.<br />
<br />
the existence of an ability does not prove it was intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, can't say what was &quot;intended&quot; for paladins, though it is does seem apparent that SOE does see aggro generation as part of the paladin toolbox now, but as far as SKs are concerned:<br />
Terror of Darkness<br />
Terror of Shadows<br />
Terror of Death<br />
Terror of Terris<br />
Terror of Thule<br />
Ring a bell? Seems pretty obvious that SKs were meant to be able to grab aggro when they want to.</div></div><hr />

no, a 1500hp difference, factor in brells to be 1200 in groups.<br />
<br />
No, actually, it's not usually even a full 1500, its between that and 1000hp. And not only do you have to take in BSS, you also have to take AoTC into account. So the truth of the matter, it's  actually between 300 and 800. <br />
<br />
A paladin can't solo efficiently either, a well equipped warrior can solo well enough to get by, not really a make or break point.<br />
<br />
Bull. Unless you're talking about soloing light blues in velks with a ToD and fungi, etc. Even then the paladin has a MUCH easier time of it. Being able to heal, and all.<br />
<br />
A paladin can instantly lock agro, a warrior can come damn close to that. We don't have spells so we shouldn't be as good as them anyway, but as it turns out, in the endgame we get pretty damn close to it.<br />
<br />
Maybe with a BoW and 200 offensive AA's, yo ucan lock aggro about 5 to 10 seconds after the paladin does... but you see, mos tof us aren't in the .001% of warriors that have this. I dual wield EB and I don't lock aggro anywher enear as fast as a paladin.<br />
<br />
Shields aren't meant for warriorsin pickup groups so it's completely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Says you. SoE has stated that they are trying to make shields usable for warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean is a paladin can't solo efficently for experience. Now they might be better at soloing blues than we are, but we are perfectly capable of soloing well enough to farm most non-PoP content.<br />

What you can't seem to grasp is that I'm only talking about the balance post-elemental. I don't have a warrior with 20aa and a windblade so i can't speak for the lower tier. But my whole point is that we need a morderate fix that will boost up the lower warriors without overpowering the higher ones.<br />
<br />
Says you. SoE has stated that they are trying to make shields usable for warriors. <br />
<br />
So paladin's can use shields and maintain resonable dps, it's not the same dps as dual wielding two 1handers from the same tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, what you're telling me is, Paladins can't solo effectively for experience, and they're better soloers than we are? <br />
<br />
By your own statement, we're even less effective than Paladins in soloing for experience.<br />
<br />
Unless of course you're talking about farming for plat. No one in their right mind takes the ability to farm plat into consideration when talking about balance in XP groups or raids. That, and even then, hybrids are far superior in ability to warriors in that regard.<br />

<br />
What you can't seem to grasp is only when confronted about it do you admit that you're only talking about post elemental warriors. The way you come across when noone confronts you about what you're saying is, NO warrior has the problems Anywhere. ALL warriors are able to log aggro nearly instantly. That's where we keep bumping heads. You need to be perfectly clear and make sure people know that when you say warriors can lock down aggro nearly instantly, you're referring to the fact that &quot;elemental planes warriors can lock down aggro nearly instantly&quot; instead of &quot;warriors can lock down aggro nearly instantly.&quot; When you don't, you're insinuating that this claim applies to ALL warriors, not the top 1%.<br />
 <br />
<br />
So paladin's can use shields and maintain resonable dps, it's not the same dps as dual wielding two 1handers from the same tier.<br />
<br />
So? the discussion wasn't about paladins usin ga shield, it was about warriors using a shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right, they can't solo efficiently for experience and neither can we. So the only differenece is they can kill non-exp mobs a little better than us, but both classes are easily able to solo old content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you ARE talking about the ability to farm for plat.<br />
<br />
Like I said. The ability to farm plat in old world zones is COMPLETELY irrelevant and not even taken into consideration when considering class balance. <br />
<br />
I don't understand why you'd make an issue out of such a minor consideration.</div></div><hr />

Paladin agro is more or less a side effect of a massive stun nerf from 2 years ago.<br />
I remember stun locking mobs on raids with my cleric back then and that was where most of the cleric mana was spent.<br />
Before this nerf, stun generated almost  zero agro.</div></div><hr />
