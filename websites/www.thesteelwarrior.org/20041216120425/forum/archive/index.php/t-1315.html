Need a new option: &quot;Shush and make a different class if you aren't happy.&quot; <br />
<br />
And thats a broken record reply.<br />
<br />
Heres another one:  If you don't like reading it then don't read it.<br />
<br />
When some people posting here have been playing thier character going on for 4 years now its a bit harsh to say &quot;shush and make a different class if you aren't happy&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Sure if class balance today was what it was in Kunark or Velious and nothing had changed then you could say that you knew what it was like when they made your character, you made your bed you sleep in it.  But when I made my warrior 2 and a bit years ago I wanted to tank in XP groups as well as raids, and that is what I did in the oasis, lake of ill omen, CT, OT, Sol B, KC, Velks, Seb, on raids with my guild etc.<br />
<br />
Now PoP has come out and I'm no longer desirable for that tanking role I should just shush and re-roll as a pally?<br />
<br />
There are posts about this issue because it is one that has made a fun game not fun for a lot of people who have invested a large amount of time in it.   If those who want to change things and make the game a bit more fun again for people playing their warriors then what are their options beyond posting on class boards and trying to find a solution because clearly if the devs had the perfect fix in their pockets Im sure we'd have seen something done by now.</div></div><hr />

So I voted for #2 simply because from my perspective we are no longer the master of taking a beating.  Sure we might be a &quot;little&quot; better than the others but we are hardly &quot;Masters&quot;.  <br />

If a group &quot;WANTS&quot; a Warrior to be the tank, then he/she will have the aggro he/she needs.</div></div><hr />

Paladin's have spells that will make up for the mitigation difference, where as it is now they are on par with warrior without the spells, with the spells they excell warriors, and I am not talking about taunt. I will be totally happy having significantly less agro if I can actually be better at taking damage.<br />

even if i still it's a delicate issue to deal with, SoE has to do something about it.<br />
Aggro, that is our main problem.<br />

Mitigation change ? why ? <br />
Nerf knights mitigation ? why ?<br />

I can tank anything in EQ and i can surely do it better than any silly paladin or shadow knight.<br />

<br />
 As I've stated before, it's obvious from the start that Paladins were supposed to be superior in mitigation, while being worse at straight tanking and aggro generation. Lowering the aggro generation brings back this balance without having to retune great amount of content. If a dev is looking (ha ha) -<br />
<br />
 Recode Paladin stuns for lower aggro.</div></div><hr />

Right now all you can do is tell them what they have to do for the warrior to hold agro .I think it would be awesome if some kind of skill would be made available to warirors to at least give them a fighting chance of holding smooth agro while grouped .</div></div><hr />

a permanent agro lock that lets wizards chain nuke their biggest spells is overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then you've got a problem bub. If anything is done to 'fix' this problem rather than sidestep it, then knights will face more competition for group slots i.e. their group desireability gets a 'nerf' (back to kunark if you believe some :p ) <br />
<br />
If a character ability is overpowered (like say Manaburn, Mod rods, pet charms etc) then it most definately should be nerfed, and has been in the past. <br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that aggro as it stands for knights is overpowered, I don't particularly want warriors to have it but they do need to be competitive in that department so what (from my point of view) would you suggest as an alternative to a 'knight nerf'? <br />
<br />
All plate tanks should have higher aggro than an unassisted warrior, all plate tanks should be vaguely equal in aggro abilities as they are now for mitigation in the majority of tanking situations. If knights need snap/range aggro to keep their role then it should be theirs but with much more severe limitations (Sony seems to believe AEtaunt on a 15 minute refresh is 'balanced' after all - compare that with a stun on a couple second refresh or a group heal :p) <br />
<br />
I'd like to point out that my closest friends in game are a bard, 2 Paladins and an SK. Despite how many who disagree with me  would like to paint my views I did not come to this conclusion from envy or small minded protectionism. <br />
<br />
Sony, knights, and everyone else on this board are of course free to disagree with me. Hopefully this won't turn into another rant thread however. Been there, done that, way to many times. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe.  But I think that if we get additional agro I will at least be able to do my job (which for me is pure LDoN....no raids maintaining decent...note not *perfect* agro).  I don't really compete with other classes for tanking spots because I make my own group practically every night.  My personal frustration is only in doing my job in a group as it relates to my toon.<br />
<br />
The reason I don't like nerfing unless absolutely necssary (Haass pointed out the Necro nerf in year 1 which was a good example of when to) because it hurts another human being enjoyment of the game....I know how I'd feel if they altered my class.</div></div><hr />

manaburn never was overpowered -_-</div></div><hr />
