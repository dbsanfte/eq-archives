ANYWAY i reinstalled my old card for the time being, put drivers in etc etc, log into EQ and textures are all fucked up.  I see missing textures, pure white, where there should be certain textures NOTE missing textures on PCs and NPCs, not zone textures.  So i figured oh well it'll sort out once my new card comes w/e i'll play through it.  Well that worked fine for 2 days, but today i go to play, patcher goes fine screen goes black like its gonna prompt the EULA and i get this &quot;An error has occured and Everquest must shut down, we're sorry for the inconvenience&quot; or some shit like that.  im like ok w/e restart should fix it, restart comp try again, same thing.  ok wtf irl . . . so i try once more, SAME THING.  Fuck ok uninstall ALL of EQ, delete all left over files, EVERYTHING, no trace of EQ on my machine.  reinstall and repatch . . . 2.5 hours later try to log on . .  SAME FUCKING THING!!!  punch monitor, uninstall EQ again completely, uninstall video card, reinstall card and im currently reinstalling EQ . . .  now before i put my hand through the monitor, PLEASE . . . one of you computer gods out there in nerd land HELP ME!</div></div><hr />

You may want to try to reinstall the video driver, but make  sure the old video drivers are completely uninstalled.  The first time you boot system after doing this, do not install you drivers off disc, let windows install the default VGA drver, then install your drivers for your card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i uninstalled eq once more, then the drivers/card deleted every remaining EQ file or EQ hack i had, anything EQ related, threw em out the window and started fresh.  I got EQ working again after 3 hours of installation/patching (again!) but im still having the funky graphics thing.  Will try the card again this evening when i get home from work . . no sign of my replacement 6600 though . .  i cry irl.  Maybe when that one blew it somehow hurt my computer?  It got REALLY hot . . hot enough to lock up the computer, but i had no idea that the fan and other parts of the card had died until i saw the visual symptoms on my screen . . . then i proceeded to touch the white hot vid card heat sink and have a lovely striped burn across the palm of my right hand.  Yay for technology!</div></div><hr />

Start - Programs - Accessories - System Tools - System Restore.<br />

Pick a date PRIOR to getting the video card that melted.  If it is a software problem, this may get you back up and running.<br />

Having the old video card overheat like that could've also fubar'd your motherboard, power supply, etc.</div></div><hr />
