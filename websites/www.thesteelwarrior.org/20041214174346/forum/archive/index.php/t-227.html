<br />
(here goes thread 1001 with the same topic...will these ever stop...here we go again!!!)<br />
<br />
I am glad to annouce that the Warrior class is my newest addition to my very very small collection of characters. (57 Bard 24 Shammy)<br />
<br />
I have searched the boards looking for specific information. I have not made up my mind what race tp play. I wanted to be strong, powerful but not hated by every Tom Dick and Joe. I want my cake and eat it to heh...<br />
<br />
I have resources to midly twink him out so that wont be a problem. I want to be able to get cultural armor crafted for him once he gets old enough.<br />
<br />
What would be the best race to play as a Warrior?<br />
<br />
Now for the most important question...<br />
<br />
Once I establish a race where should I put the points?<br />
<br />
Minor one here: Would it be wiseto train only 1 HS or mix in some 2 HS?<br />
<br />
I thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Ibash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danathor</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Race isn't really important.  Just make sure you choose Rallos Zek diety.  As for stats, max out stamina then either agi or dex for the rest.  Thirdly, it would be very wise to keep all weapon skills trained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perpull</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with bash.  Rallos Zek is great, if you decide to be an ogre (which i would if i were you) you can get the Crimson Darkscale gear (which make me better than most (yes i did say MOST) of the lvl 63 warriors i see ac/hp wise) and i'm only 56.  I'm sure there are lots of other opinions but my warrior is lvl 56, has 3300hp/1231 ac and i got him there in 15 days of play time.  And I still had time to get a few aa's and screw off with tradeskills and sell some crap.<br />
<br />
Of course ogres aren't very friendly therefor you have to learn the &quot;underground&quot; routes to places but in my opinion it's well worth it.  Just plan on spending a lot of pp on shrink potions, because groups will be the first to gripe about you being big but the shaman will never want to mem shrink, and the chanters will only boon you once you've already used your shrink potion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope any flaws in this can be corrected by gear at the higher end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't troll's have natural regeneration? Or does that really not add up to anything? I knowif wont in the planes and further...<br />
<br />
Nice info...keep it coming!<br />
<br />
I only had the Bard for so so long. Now I want a &quot;up in your face&quot; action kindaa guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash as an ability is nice and so is no frontal stun.  An ogre has both of these.  Troll and barbs have the big race bash as well.  As for regen, its not a super big deal due to being hit for 1k a pop and regenning 15(?) points per tick.  <br />
<br />
Iskar also regen but are a small race and have medium race stats.  The general opinion is to choose a toon you like to look at...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, aside from the usual pro-ughre propaganda, some of this is decent info.<br />
<br />
In the end game, all the races even out. Until then there are some subtle differences.<br />
<br />
Ogre - has slam, unstunnable from frontal melee.<br />
Troll -  has slam, regen.<br />
Barbarian -  slam, not us ugly as ughres, night blind<br />
Dark elves - have ultravision<br />
Iksar - innate AC, regen, lower level armour difficulties<br />
<br />
Woodies, Half elves and the runt races are all about the same, with some variation in base stats.<br />
<br />
Your god of choice is important if you wish to take advantage of cultural armours.  Contrary to the Ughre Propagandists, Tribunal &gt; Rallos Zek but Helanic Tundra (which is limited to barbs, humans and half elves) is harder to find than Fierce Heraldic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want to be strong and powerful, but not hated by every Tom, Dick and Joe?<br />
<br />
Obvious answer's Barbarian, although Vah Shir probably rate in there somewhere too.<br />
<br />
Your race won't really determine your stats anyway, given that you said you're going to twink - Your gear will.<br />
<br />
That said, unless you pick Ogre or Troll, put everything in STA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the short term, the extra hp from STA is nice. But in the long run it is wasted because STR and STA will cap out faster than anything with warrior gear. With buffs, you should cap out fast.. especially considering you are twinking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking at a guide on Allakhazam on starting stats and he said <br />
<br />
&quot;Halflings have poor starting stats for warriors and are really out of the question entirely&quot;<br />
<br />
Wells lets see then...<br />
<br />
What stats do warriors need? Wis? no, Int? no, Cha? no.<br />
<br />
So leaving all the rest, my base stats were (without bonus points), what?<br />
<br />
85, 80, 95, and 100?<br />
<br />
(Another Halfling back me up, I can't remember exactly)<br />
<br />
So make that 95 STR and 95 STA (10 and 15 for total of 25) and you have:<br />
<br />
95 STR<br />
95 STA<br />
90 AGI<br />
100 DEX<br />
<br />
These look good to me.<br />
<br />
And don't even get me started about the experience bonus!<br />
<br />
My wife hates me for it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frogloks get the EXACT same stats.<br />
<br />
They have above average STR, STA, DEX and AGI.<br />
<br />
And halflings level faster, can hide AND sneak.<br />
<br />
They make good warriors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perpull</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes getting stuck in doors sucks arse, and trolls regen, but Ogres don't get stunned.(from the front)  WHICH ROCKS! I play with 2 barbie warriors and they both spend about 5% of the fight standing there with little birdies running around their heads.  As for the best starting zone...paineel.  Fenced in, move on to Warrens when you're done.  Nuff said.  Not real impressed with troll regen and the 15hp regen is when youre sitting down which shouldn't matter much anyway cause warriors have to have a healer with them any time it counts anyway.  Screw heraldic, go with crimson, the ac is superior and hit points can always be added with stamina and other HP items.  Sure you lose a few hitpoints to mana but put all your points into stamina and the rest to dex and you're set.  Dont worry about strength on anything, i've never seen my str less than 255 when in a group anyway.  Everyone can buff str, but stamina is hard to buff. One think to keep in mind also about trolls, ogres and iksar is gear is harder to come by.  Since they are sooooooo superior (joke) verant/sony decided to screw us on equipment.  Unlike earlier posts this is not ogre propaganda, i'm showing both sides to be fair, but I am WAY happier with my warrior than most others I see. The key is to don't ride the fence, and pick a diety.  Cultural is the rule.  Most of my peices are better than Myrmadon stuff and some of them even better than warlords so stick to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be a lizzy!  We have the natural AC bonus, regen, and we look bad ass!!  And don't listen to what anyone says about us not being able to wear plate, that problem disappears after level 20.  And now that PoK can get us anywhere the faction thing doesn't matter anymore either.  And if you wanna be unique, iksar's the way to go, I rarely see more than five lizzy/wars on my server at any one time, and I havn't been in a group with one in months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarax</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">personaly i would make a ogre with all points into agi because sta str and dex are all easily maxed.<br />
<br />
i made my war 2 years ago with the same idea when they where capped at 250 and now that the cap was lifted the sanme still holds true because gear will take care of along with spells but agi always was something that kinda laged behind for warriors . sure its only a few extra ac but its ac you get when you are already way above max on sta str dex anyways .</div></div><hr />

GRATZ ! Race done !<br />
<br />
Now for stats ....<br />
Get Agi to 80, then max stamina.<br />
<br />
Now for diety.<br />
If you can pick RZTW do it. if not, well dont worry.<br />
<br />
Now for weapons ... (keep all skills maxed)<br />
Get 2 crappy 1H (to use until lvl20)<br />
Get a good fast 2H (33/36 or so) and keep it for a long long time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go for a large race or an Iksar.  Racial slam is very handy.  When I started way back in 1999, I chose barbarian because travelling was really hard back then and all my friends were playing good races, so I chose a race that was big and brawny and was close to/could hunt in the same zones they did. (Also, I'm basically a barbarian in RL too, so it was a logical choice) :)<br />
With PoP faction and travelling problems are virtually nonexistent.  And beyond a certain level the only racial advantages that really matter much are frontal stun immunity for ogres, racial slam for large races, regen for trolls and iksar, and ac bonus for iksar.  The disadvantage of being a big oaf is difficulty fitting into small places. The disadvantage of being a stunty race (some of my best friends are dwarves, so I can call you stunty if I damned well please) :) , is that you might have difficulty getting around in some of the giant sized areas (read stairs).  Ultimately, with all the good gear that's out there now, race doesnt matter nearly as much as it used to, so play what you like or can most identify with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hidaguard</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, there's been a significant lack of discussion concerning smaller races, so I'll add my short bit (/grin). <br />
<br />
I play a dwarven warrior (now almost 49 yay!), and have to say that I'm very happy with her.  Most of the peeps who know me give me mad props for my skills while playing her, though she doesn't have the best equipment/ac/hp.  I've found myself tauning off of higher lvl warriors with better gear/weapons/whatever, and I've found it's mainly what you know that makes or breaks a warrior.  I've basically got 15 slots of inventory space devoted to weapons alone, and am workin up to fitting in some armor for resists/effects/whatnot.  So let's see what I know of smaller race warriors and abilities...<br />
<br />
Dwarf- fairly high sta/str to start.  Starts at 50Sense Dir (I use dir almost exclusively to navigate) infra<br />
Gnome-nice dex infra, can tinker (that means your epic just got about 2kpp easier my friend, or that much harder, depending on how you look at it.)<br />
Halfer- Sneak/Hide, infra, exp bonus just to look like Frodo, nice starting dex and agi<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of atm.  Good luck with yer warrior, friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ibash</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually this warrior will be an alt to assist my wife in her new characters (more then likely a healing class: Cleric).<br />
<br />
Since she cant beat um (SoE and me playing EQ) she has decided to join um. I think we can effectively duo with her as a cleric and me as a pure tank. Granted a kite class would probanbly be more effective but I really really want to be up in your face action guy &lt;---warrior.<br />
<br />
I cant wait till I get her' new PC in the mail and set this router up. <br />
<br />
See you in game.</div></div><hr />

Warriors number one for sheer ability to get the piss beat of em, SK's for ability to just not get hit at all, snare, and self heal to an extent (read, darkness line/fear/lifetap.  With my SK, I rarely need heals, unless I'm OOM), and pallies, just because pallies can heal and can take ok dmg.  Personally, my favorite combos in the game are war/shammy or SK/druid.  I'll explain if anyone's interested.</div></div><hr />

Half elf &gt; all<br />
<br />
not because of stats and not because of racial bonuses (frontal stun immunity / slam pffft) but because the half elves get the chicks~<br />
<br />
You wont need any extra hps when you have hordes of High elf cleric honeys, wood elf druid chicks and buxom barb shammy babes fighting over who gets to heal ya~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok not gonna talk about race as most everyone here has been doing that - but just a few short pointers.<br />
<br />
if you go for a large race - dont waste money on shrink potions at 150pp a  pop. Spend 500 pp on a anizok minimising device - comes with 20 charges but can be recharged with a class 6 mana battery - which u can pick up in bazaar for about 150 pp. so with it for 150 pp u get 20 charges of shrink as opposed to 10 charges for the ants potion for same price.<br />
<br />
when u start out, get a 1hs, 1hb, 1hpiercing and 2 handers - personally i didnt go for 2hb, but theres a lot of nice 2hb weps out there now so if i started again id make sure it was maxed<br />
<br />
ok heres the trick to keep all your skills levelled. on your hotbank drag a couple of blank inventory slots to a hotbank button. also drag your primary and secondary melee wep slots to the same hotbank. if you then equip your weapons, you can interchance them via the hotbank buttons without having to open inventory. that way - you can rotate your 1 handers and your 2 handers during the course of a fight with ease and thereby keeping them all maxed. if your swopping out 2 1 handers for a 2 hander in invetory - remember that the other inventory slot has to be free to be able to accomondate the 1 hander - so always keep those both free.<br />
<br />
i also do the same thing with my ranged item and bow , as ranged has better ac - i tag with bow then swop out with range item when mob is inc. so i drag the range item and a third inventory slot to the same hotbank.<br />
<br />
if you go large race, i woudnt worry about being kos. with PoT ability to move around quickly, luclin to buy all your stuff, theres really hardly any need to go to old world cities like freeport anymore.<br />
<br />
when you get to lvl 35 you get shield - dont forget to use it, theres lots of threads here about how to do it best.<br />
<br />
have fun.</div></div><hr />

I like the Ogre's natural Slam and immunity to frontal stuns but neither is all that great.  When it comes down to it, it doesn't matter what you play, just do what ever seems cool.  If you go Ogre, do not be agnostic.<br />
<br />
The whole Evil vs. Good thing is pretty much a wash since Luclin and even more so since PoP.  When you can travel almost anywhere without seeing a city, can trade in Shadowhaven and Tanaan without a problem, Old World racism isn't such a big factor.<br />
<br />
For starting stats, get agility to 75, put the rest in stamina.<br />
<br />
Weapon skills, this is more than minor.  If you only use 1hs your entire career, you absolutely deserve the pain you'll have in your 50s and 60s when kickass weapons drop and you have single digit skill in those weapons.  Train ALL five skills.  Even piercing, which caps lower than the others, but there are some nice ones anyway.  Yes, it is a huge pain to train all five weapon skills and you will always be behind until your late 40s, but work at it.  The best advice I got when I started was to train all 5 skills.  My current primary weapon is now a 2hb.</div></div><hr />

Again, thanks for the pointers all. See you in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So there goes the dead sexay Half Elf down the drain and here comes something meatier! I will still stick with Rallos Zek Deity so in order to get my hands on some player crafted Fierce Heraldic Plate armor...Grab me a Greater Lightstone to overcome his blind arse and get to mash'in mob!<br />
