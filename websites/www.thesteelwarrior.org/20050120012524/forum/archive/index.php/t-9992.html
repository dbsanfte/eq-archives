<br />
in no way am i trying to relate this with arggo.  straight up dps mods for those times when you are Not the main tank/assist.  and need to concern yourself with damage output without arggo.<br />
<br />
so  i have not tracked down all the damage augs or all the proc augs.<br />
<br />
would like to see some info on both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dps proc are generaally the 150DD proc (cold or poison)<br />
LDoN have some dm aug but they are very poor (1DM for 1Her and 2DM for 2Her if I recall it well). There is a 4DM aug (without dl restriction) for 2Her that was droping in late God but I am not sure it s still dropping.<br />
<br />
Basically, the DD aug can be resisted while the straight dm can't. but for their relative power it must be parsed, since one will be affected by WA and ingenuity, while the other will be by your haste, skills and other AA.<br />
<br />
So finally, it's so dependent on your gears and AA, that there is no general answer. It has to be studied carefully.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SincroFashad</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming max, or close to max dexterity, without WA, you will proc main hand ~2 times per minute, and off hand ~1 time per minute.  With WA5, those number are doubled.<br />
<br />
Knowing this, to get an average of 1 dps, you need 30 points of main-hand DD proc, or 60 points of off-hand DD proc with no Weapon Affinity, or half those numbers with WA5.  With WA5, plus Ingenuity, minus resist rate, a 150 DD proc will do ~10 dps in main hand, and ~5 dps in off hand.<br />
<br />
Those numbers will be almost totally unaffected by haste level.<br />
<br />
For a straight damage augment, you have to decide how many points of damage = 10 or 5 dps.  I don't know the calculations for warriors off the top of my head, but I kow for rogues a 1 damage augment &gt; all proc augments for dps in main hand.<br />
<br />
Of course, no damage augment is going to come remotely close to matching the hate-building power of Anger/Ykesha augments, or the healing power of lifetap augments.</div></div><hr />

1. ppm are maxed at 255 dex<br />
2. WA give only 50% proc rate bonus, not 100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 point for a rogue = increases in thier backstab abilities so theres no question there.<br />
<br />
I am more interested if anyone has sat down and parsed something like this for warriors.<br />
<br />
and skipping over arggo procs  thats not what im trying to determine. <br />
<br />
so far we have 150 damage proc equaling 10 dps with wa5 in primary. thats fairly respectable.<br />
<br />
anyone have numbers on damage augs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's HIGLY dependent on your HASTE, and WEAPON, and AA, and SKILLS, and LEVEL, and MOB, and MOB's POSITION !!!!<br />
if you swing 155 times per minutes, you will get more results as if you swing 21 times. If you want to know what a DM aug will do to you, you first have to know what is YOUR average hit per second (hps : you have to take into account the miss/dodge/parry/... of the mob) and YOUR average DI multiplier (avg_rng : your avarage domage minus your min domage divided by your domage listed on your weapon). Thus if you increase your DI by one, you will increase your dps, from this weapon, by hps*avg_rng.<br />
<br />
it's your toon, thus it's your job to calculate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, 150DD is 7.5DPS in primary with 255+ DEX, WA5, and CE0, without counting crit and resist/immune.</div></div><hr />

The only weapons with type 6 slot i know are bought from LDoN merchant too. I don't know if there are others with type 6 slots.</div></div><hr />

The most apealing are in slot 8 (slots 5,6, and 8 exist).  <br />
for exemple &quot;Worked Granite of Sundering&quot; and &quot;Enhanced Gem of the First Witness&quot; (or &quot;Ritana's Sandstone of Prowess&quot;) are quite nice.<br />

Its better than 150DD proc in offhand but worse than 150DD in mainhand (at 20 delay). I dont think there is an 1H damage augment which produce more DPS than an 150DD in mainhand and its available for warrior (or ranger). The 4 damage (or 5 damage) 2H augs are nice dps augs on 30 (or less) delay 2-handers.<br />
My 1-hand tests are done with maxed GOD DPS AA and 20 combat effects using raidbuffs (maxed ATK and haste). Parse target was MSha in Qvic.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
1hd 25dely&gt; primary. Well, what weapon would you use ? Dbow (it have proc modifikator) what is with agro augment A3? you charakter have AA in CE? equipment with CE ?</div></div><hr />
