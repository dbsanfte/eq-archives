<br />
Going to attempt one of these tonight, with the expedition requestor being level 70.  Haven't been able to find alot of information about these expeditions, can anyone shed light in terms of PH's/Named possible loots?  I've played in here a few times, and we found the mobs to be tightly packed and fairly fast repops (we never really got much further than the ZI), so if anyone has some techniques they use to move fairly quickly I'd appreciate that was well.<br />
<br />
Crew I'm going with tonight is war, bard, rogue, chanter, cleric and necro.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated, goal is to pick up the anquish key piece, but anything else would just be a bonus.<br />
<br />
Thanks- Axxe</div></div><hr />
