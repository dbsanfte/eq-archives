The other 2 are 2.5weight.<br />
Please help me in this for i have used them in both combo's and cant decide wich is better. The only thing i have noticed is that the weight of the Ornate sword sucks down the stamina a lil. <br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the SotB/TP setup is the best dual wield option. Although the ratio on the Ornate is actually pretty good (34/23 == 17/11.5), but it's delay is terrible for aggro purposes.  In the mainhand, the damage bonus will not help you as much with a faster weapon.  Not only will the speed of the Parryblade in your offhand help you maintain aggro, but  the debuff proc should aggro better than the DD proc you've added to the Ornate.<br />
<br />
I use an SotB in the mainhand (still hunting/saving for a better offhand ...), and it works terrifically.<br />
<br />
Lemme also add to the chorus of voices recommending the Greatstaff of Thunder (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24799)  for a two handed aggro option.  There's on on Tarew Marr right now for 100p - and it's a wonderful aggro weapon, don't let the price fool you.</div></div><hr />

The shammy i was with was only 55 so he dont have acumen. The ornate takes down my stamina real bad. The other 2 dont tho. Do you think i should remove the augment and add it to the Parryblade? Its only a 40point aug in Takish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're magelo's correct, then you have well over 100 sta, so the little yellow bar being gone only means that you can't jump.  That shouldn't be a factor in gear or buff selection.<br />
<br />
Doggabone's got the right idea, though.  Go with SotB/parryblade if you want to dual wield, pick up a GSoT for cheap if you want really good aggro.</div></div><hr />

I think you know this, but if you remove the aug, you have to buy a new one.  If you're gonna add an aug to any blade ... hrm ... I'd add an aug to your SotB first, and make it an aggro aug (Yakesha or Anger, and I prefer the Anger augs myself).    You will eventually want to upgrade that offhander for something more aggro-ish, and I'm betting that, like me, you're budgeting your points, and so there is little value in augmenting it.  You could, however, put a cheap Yakesha augment on each of those weapons for now and have a decent DW aggro combo.  But augment the SotB first - it's your mainhand weapon AND it's the one you'll keep the longest.<br />
<br />
You may as well keep the DD aug on your Ornate in the meantime, you're only going to lose it forever by removing it.  Later, when you have the points to burn, you can put another DD aug on it (OR you can get a better DPS weapon, and augment THAT with a DD or Lifetap widget).  Keep it as a DPS weapon, there are times you can use it safely and see some nice big numbers.   For what I can get my hands on, 2H &gt; DW for DPS, but I like to have a DW DPS (non-aggro) set up available for fun, and the Ornate fits in there well.<br />
<br />
One more note about the GSoT ... not only is it good aggro, but riposte damage on the Planes will hurt you much, especially when it comes in spikes.  Your gear is a little better than mine I think, but not so much that you're not feeling the pain when you DW as much as I.  I read it here first, and have the bruises to prove it - 2H weapons reduce the damage you take from ripostes, and do better DPS.  Your survivability and aggro generation improve.  Personally, I prefer to DW (it's a style thing), and I do in LDoN most of the time.<br />
<br />
Whether or not SOE decides to make the stamina bar relevant to the game in the future is anyone's guess, but until it is I wouldn't give it a second thought.</div></div><hr />

Glad to know that that little bar dont = crap. I need to upgrade my magelo. got a new bracer in SG. That whore was suposed to drop the sweet mask but the bracer is just as good since i got rid of lodi shield i needed a new EB item. I used to have RBB and lodi. We killed Ixil something in BW for cleric epic and OMG a cloak of flames. Gave the RBB and lodi up for guildies to roll for. So i got cloak. (i still had to roll for it tho)</div></div><hr />
