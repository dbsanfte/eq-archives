<br />
Zems were recently removed from game.  This was in a patch message and can be verified with some tools.<br />
<br />
All mobs give exp based on the MOB now.  It seems the more HP the more exp.  Level of the mob has a little to do with the exp also.</div></div><hr />

Do you have a link to the patch message? How do hotspot zones work, then? Why does SOE post things like &quot;the xp in Barindu and Ferubi has been increased&quot; if the amount of xp gained isn't based on zone? My gut tells me that xp is based on mob level * zem, and not much else, but I haven't done any scientificish testing.</div></div><hr />

PoP zones have 40% bonus, newbies zones upwards of 80%. cities give 33% bonus, LOIO is -20%, the Grey is -10%. Indoor zones usually fare better than outdoor zones as a rule of thumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok, I'll believe that. I imagine you could compute ZEM by comparing the number of level 60 mobs it takes to get 10% aa in two zones, or some such though. I'm pretty convinced xp is level * zem and nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was under the impression that LOIO had the 80percent newbie modifier.. since after all, it is possible to level from 1 to 50 there.  And this is why it was so popular when Kunark came out.. through early Luclin.</div></div><hr />

XP there sucks now, I can tell you that for sure.<br />
<br />
WTF doesn't SOE balance zone usage more by shifting ZEMS, I have no idea. Hell, post the damn zem when you zone in, or in a patch message like they did with &quot;hotspots&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Ok that makes much more sense than how I interpreted it lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Lokkak really means is that the ZEM was removed from anything that can be seen with memory or packet information (it's ENTIRELY serverside now). <br />
<br />
So, the list is outdated by default. Of course, a lot of it is probably still fairly accurate, but there is no way of knowing nowadays :/<br />
<br />
What I mean is:<br />
<br />
There are no longer ANY ZEMs in game.<br />
<br />
Hot spots are bonuses to SPECIFIC mobs in a zone that are around the level of the player levels the hot spot was designed.<br />
<br />
If a higher level player goes to a Hot Spot zone and kills higher level mobs they gain LESS exp even if the mob is yellow to them than a lower level player killing one of the &quot;hot spot&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
Hot spots are REGIONS of the zone and not the whole zone.<br />
<br />
Any chart listing ZEMS MAY appear to be current because they may have used a similar brush when painting the exp per mob in the zone.<br />
<br />
Mob HP is now more tuned to mob exp than mob level.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, prove me wrong, because I have done extensive research on this for power leveling purposes.  Many of the good locations (like hob goblins in PoN no longer give 9 percent AA exp per kill to a level 54 grouped with a level 60 that would gain 7 percent AA exp per kill.)  It was an over night change (before/after the patch.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so my first read of your statement still stands. Do you have a link to the patch message you referred to before? Why do you believe hotspot zones are only specific mobs in the zone? The patch messages and messages you get when you level indicate nothing of the sort.<br />
<br />
I'm somewhat skeptical about your exp based on hp claims. I get positively crap for xp on luclin high hp, low level mobs. Compare that to GoD sewers mobs, with high levels and low hp. Multi %aa kills every time. I'll start investigating this a little more closely, I  haven't been paying much attention to mobs total hp much recently.<br />
<br />
I do believe that the relative level between the player and the mob plays into xp gained significantly as well. Killing white cons seems to be the sweet spot for xp to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't believe me, prove me wrong<br />
<br />
Except that isn't how it works.  If you are bold enough to make such a sweeping statement then it is up to you to provide the proof.<br />
<br />
So ... can you provide a link to this patch message you keep referring to?  It seems to me that a change of this magnitude probably would not have slipped by so quietly, especially if it was an announced change.<br />
<br />
The burden of proof is on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm I thought hotspots just meant they increased the ZEM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If that were the case than Ssra would be THE exp zone in the game for level 55-60. Mob hps has zero to do with how much exp is given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spikela</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If that were the case than Ssra would be THE exp zone in the game for level 55-60. Mob hps has zero to do with how much exp is given.<br />
<br />
<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
Ssra mobs have MUCH more HP than most other mobs in the game. Also, as for ZEMs... you can't really say they don't exist can you? Sol Ro mobs... level 65... nice exp... PoEarth mobs... 62-64... MASSIVE exp... and less HP to boot. This throws your theory upside down. Good luck!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dbyx</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the patch message in question (copy and pasted, of course):<br />
<br />
Patch Message, April 28, 2004<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone goes to Stormhammer <br />
<br />
We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge for 2 groups of about 50th level.*<br />
<br />
A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with the undead. Will you brave the catacombs to find them? <br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone moves to Live <br />
<br />
The adventure zone currently on Stormhammer will move to live servers. You can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. <br />
<br />
This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck. <br />
<br />
Hot Spots <br />
<br />
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The current Hot Spots are: <br />
<br />
The Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level) <br />
<br />
The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level) <br />
<br />
Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level) <br />
<br />
The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level) <br />
<br />
The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level) <br />
<br />
Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level) <br />
<br />
The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level) <br />
<br />
The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These Hot Spot zones are generally aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where the new ones may be. <br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge <br />
<br />
All EQ characters can now access the Plane of Knowledge whether they have purchased Planes of Power or not! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
General <br />
<br />
We have decreased load times when zoning. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gates Sewers and Vxed <br />
<br />
Rare NPCs in the Gates sewers and Vxed will not spawn at the creation of the expedition zone. They will now spawn after the zone has been occupied for some time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items <br />
<br />
Skill percent-mods now work for Ammo slot items. <br />
<br />
Grand Tunic of the Oracle and the Grand Robe of the Oracle have had a type 7 augmentation slot added to them. <br />
<br />
Lungi of the Forbidden will display a robe graphic once again. Monks and Beastlords will be able to swap the robe in for a leather looking BP with the same stats by visiting Garath the Trader in East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth with Garath for your desired look. (Lungi? Lungi? What is a Lungi?) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells <br />
<br />
Characters in illusion form can again be targeted. <br />
<br />
Bull Rush is now a magical resist. Please do not use in a china shop. <br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil has had its Mana and Slow percentage increased. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tracking <br />
<br />
More NPC's in Qinimi now leave tracks for trackers to find. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie Server<br />
<br />
The Shuriken of Eternity and Ton Po's Mystical Pouch are now no-drop.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">miakiss</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure from my own experience that the ZEMs are still in place, as well as the so-called HCB (&quot;high con bonus&quot;) which gives a multiple to exp if the MOB is no more than 5 levels below you [Note that the HCB only applies for MOBs of 55 and above and characters of 50 and above].<br />
<br />
In zones I have hunted in a LOT recently I think the following ZEMs are still about right:<br />
<br />
Nurga 89<br />
Plane of Nightmares 119<br />
<br />
As for hot spot zones, I have also hunted a lot in Nadox and would guess that the ZEM is around the 120-130 range.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, experience is proportional to the square of the MOBs level, the ZEM, the HCB and the bonus for the number of players in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalthanan</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, given all this information, where would be the best spot to level my 57 warrior?<br />
<br />
I have a 65 druid that I can group him with and &quot;solo&quot; with him in the group leeching XP, but it's slow going (1% XP per two kills in HoH now, I believe.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">miakiss</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not such an easy question to answer, because it also depends on how quickly you can pull and kill.<br />
<br />
In a group of four (61 druid, 60 shaman, 59 Enchanter) my 57 warrior gets 1% every 2 kills of Hobgoblins in Plane of Nightmare. For a very low stress experience we can single pull about 15/16 an hour. So only 8% an hour - not exactly fantastic - but all the others are getting exp too. Hobgoblins are immune to snare/root though so not so good for your druid, but at least they don't summon.<br />
<br />
I would say you want to find the level 55+ planar/ykesha mob that you can pull/kill fastest. Also HoH has a slightly lower ZEM than the other planes for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy to demostrate in other ways too.  Hunt Blues to Reds in PoTactics for a while with a good group, then head to Kod'Taz and do the same.  If you don't make more exp against much harder blue/reds in KT I'll be shocked to the core.  Oh and by harder, I don't mean more HP most certainly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another example of this. Hunt High Guards in PoJ basement area (58% ZEM quoted). They are lvl 60 and about 1.5-2% AA per kill. Hunt in LDoNs (0% ZEM in everything I have seen) with mobs running 58-62 for an average of around 60. 60 kills in LDoN = just under/around 0.4AA at 65, 100%, no LAA. 60 kills in PoJ = easily 1AA under same guidelines. In fact if the ZEMs were gone then LDoN xp should have ticked up substantially relative to pre-nerf and having done 20-30 LDoNs a week since the middle of Feb I can say with absolute certainty that the xp is relatively constant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not such an easy question to answer, because it also depends on how quickly you can pull and kill.<br />

<br />
As a reference, before the hot spot patch, killing hobgoblins in the cave (level 59 to 63 mobs) at level 59 I used to get 7 percent per kill.  Grouped with a level 61 cleric (and later a level 65 cleric) but still level 59 was still got 4 percent per kill.  It no longer gives that much exp.<br />
<br />
You guys are trying to prove the zems are still present.  I was suggesting from my experience that the zems are gone and each zone had the mobs that spawn in it retuned to have exp that approximated the zem of the zone via the mobs.  Within the same zone, if you kill mobs with more hp but the same level, you get more exp.  Within the same zone if you kill mob A instead of mob B while mob A and mob B are the same level, you get vastly different exp values.<br />
<br />
The main thrust of my assertion is that it is no longer like it was.  ZEM, level of mob, and level of player/group no longer are the only factors in exp awarded.  I do not suggest that a white mob in zone A gives the same as zone B, I only suggest that ZEM is gone and been replaced by &quot;per npc&quot; exp values, and certain NPC give more than others.<br />
