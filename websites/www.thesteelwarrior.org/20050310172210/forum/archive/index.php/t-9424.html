I did one this afternoon with 5 level 65 friends, and was supposedly awarded 51 points, but they never were added to my total points. I petitioned and naturally the gm said they couldn't do anything about it and to /bug it.<br />
<br />
Very lame. Hello chain /bug /petition.</div></div><hr />

Ended up in what used to be hard ldon, and got 105 points. Nfc if it matters but a lvl 70 grabbed the adventure.</div></div><hr />

So 5 70's and a 65 could get a normal 65 adv?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you get it by the average level of your group.  If your average level was below 63 in the old system you got a level 60 adventure, so I imagine if you want one of the old 51 point level 65 normals you need your group level average to be below 67.  Otherwise you're going to get the level 65 hard.  And no I don't believe they are going to put in a level 70 hard.</div></div><hr />

Grr I got screwed. I wonder if I'll get points next time.</div></div><hr />
