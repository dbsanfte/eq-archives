<br />
I was grouped with monk, necro, cleric, shammy, and druid.  Mob would be on monk, I would taunt, mob would not turn, just keep beating on the monk.  About 1 out of 5 times I could count on the mob turning.<br />
<br />
Same thing if it jumped on any of the others.  I know I can get taunt off a standing shammy after the slow with a successful taunt but nothing would happen.  No one was rooting, I checked.  I would chase the mob from one toon to the other, never getting taunt.<br />
<br />
Once in a while a taunt would work or taunt/incite combo.<br />
<br />
/shrug anyway I bug reported it.  It was just to strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our warrior last night had trouble holding aggro as well.  I mean, there are off nights but last night was REALLY bad.  Add that whenever our group zoned into an expedition, some were ported to behind the last room in vxed, and then when zoning out into barindu, we were ported an entire zonelength of barindu south.  Back to aggro issues, the wizard getting aggro at 30% from draught of thunder with a warrior that's used taunt, incite, BoC/GBoS both anger 3 augged with WA whatever...that's not right.  That was the ONLY thing that the wizard did, one nuke at 30%</div></div><hr />

I have been loosing agro more latly and even AETaunt hasn't been turning mobs back torwards me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got on last night to do one adv because I was only 20 points away from an anger aug.  I wish I had just skipped logging in and went straight to the scotch... it was the most frustrating 90 minutes of my EQ career.  Granted, it wasn't the best group, but under most circumstances I feel I can be an effective tank.  I would have to say I held aggro maybe 50% of the time.  After a while, I just threw my hands up, and the other warrior in the group, who had just been chillin on 2h dps thus far, became MT.  I went to my wmbs, he pulled out a BoC and SoD... and he was having the same problems.  Mobs were turning on ME randomly, and I wasn't even kicking just to be safe!  It was nuts... I really think the changes to collision are causing proximity issues.  I noticed that when the monk would pull, when I was able to grab aggro, the mob would run basically right into me... not stay at melee distance.  At first I would turn around, thinking that it had run right past me, but I would pan out using mouse wheel, and the mob was basically occupying the same physical space I was.  It was messed up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelvon</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proximity issues sound right.  I like to fight right on top of the mob, I would step back for one reason or another and instantly get an out of range error when I should've been fine.<br />
<br />
so /bugreport the issue if you get a chance, something is sure screwy.</div></div><hr />

Usually I can incite pull and a single taunt, at very most two, will regain me agro after a slow.  Since the patch, I basically feel I might as well not bother taunting; the only thing regaining me agro are my procs and my dps.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed any change in AE taunt, except that the range seems to have been shortened.</div></div><hr />

I had almost exactly the same experience last night (except it was 10 points, for a haste aug), and had exactly this thought.  The rogue managed to hold aggro more often than I did.  The only thing that saved me from embarassment was that  it was a group  of guildies who know I do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh* .. does this mean i have to play alts for the next month?<br />
<br />
i havent been on my warrior since the patch since i know more things are broken than working. my druid can solo and save himself the embarassment but with him distance issues are so screwed up he sometimes doesnt even have enough time to snare from maximum mob distance. needless to say his own rate of experience gain is way down. hasnt died yet though.<br />
<br />
every time he gets hit he get repositioned  to face away from the mob. he also gets stunned constantly. he also gets agrod a lot by mobs that are not visible until after they hit him. good thing he is maxed out on defensive aas.<br />
<br />
so would anyone blame me by not wanting to embarass myself by playing my warrior inside an ldon? i can think of a dozen reasons we would lose an adventure with so many things malfunctioning. how is he supposed to hold taunt if getting hit causes him to be repositioned facting away from the mob? and now i hear even taunt doesnt do any good.<br />
<br />
what they need is a test server to serve as a place to verify new code before it goes live. what a concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullius</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I have not had any aggro issues since the patch and I have tanked numerous Elemental raiding mobs.  I do use an augg'ed BoW + WA5 however.  <br />
<br />
Taunt has never been reliabie, and it certainly is not now.  EB procs are the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can't see your target, or are too far away (according to the EQ engine, anyway), you can't swing.  If you can't swing, you can't proc. ;)  Even an auged BoW with WA 5 won't proc on a proximity error. :P<br />
<br />
And yeah, about embarrassment... I felt like a total tool by my performance that night, and I didn't have the luxury of being with, as was mentioned before, friends who know I am better than that.  For me, the only saving grace was that the other warrior was having the same problems.<br />

Same stuff though, mobs not turning.  Seems I couldn't break aggro from the person that initially had it.  But the same went for the ranger with a ba-jillion AA's with me, he could not take aggro from me if I initially had it.<br />
<br />
Got a lot of too far away messages when right on top of the mob.<br />
<br />
Had some problems with myself and mobs warping around.<br />
<br />
On the upside the graphics look nice. hehe</div></div><hr />

I could /sheild some people but others consistently gave me the too far away message.</div></div><hr />

Interesting .. I wonder if this is an indication of a widely reported (possibly known) issue, or they're just running thru the list.<br />
<br />
Tho taunt has never been very reliable, my negative experiences recently were that aggro management as a whole was horribly unreliable (taunt, procs, Incite, other players actions - sitting seemed to work for moments here and there tho :p).  That being said, last night the guild romped in Katta and Plane of Storms, and aside from a few oddities on the desert slopes (too few to be a pattern, and I've seen such stuffs before anyway), aggro behaved as I'm used to.  And that was a big chunk of relief ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No real problems with agro here but some mobs are all but impossible to target, have to click 20 time on some all over their model before I get it on target. And don't seem to be tied to particular models either, can have two of the same mobs with one giving trouble and the other not, very annoying.<br />
Also half my guild had trouble finding the right spot to click on to zone into Plane of Water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baeaan</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time is being a pain to zone into as well pretty much just randomly clicking gets you in. As to taunt and aggro, yea maybe some prox issues but I've had no trouble with taunt not working correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was tanking at outter.  I have never had that many problems holding agro.  Taunt was failing consistantly after the shm slowed.  It got to the point that the mob was just rooted so I could hold agro.  At least the shm and another person in grp were also guildies who know I can hold agro better.  The sk, the other guildie, was also having the same trouble getting agro sometimes and he was using spells.  So I think that agro is general is truely fucked up now.  Everyone needs to do a /bug and a /feedback about it until they know that its a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no unusal problems with taunt since patch.<br />
<br />
then again ive had many problems since the patch that others havent.<br />
<br />
and this seems to be a pattern that a lot of these problems are individual specific which makes debugging it all the harder. dont you love sloppy coding?<br />
<br />
i have severe lag in some zones and practically none in others. then soe tries to tell me my video card is incompatible or obsolete. why dont they just code the bad zones the same way they code the good zones?<br />
<br />
id love to know how you all are doing with cornering. my experience with pushing my toon into a corner is that it is THE way to get my toon warped over to a new spot. hardly a desirable thing for a MT.</div></div><hr />
