<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>etah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been camping this sword for 2 weeks. And am going on about 50ish hours. I duo box my cleric and pull the single island hut (the one the Jopal Seer spawns in), keeping it clear. As I dont think I would be able to manage the big island just myself. I have only spawned the seer once. This is out of sitting there for an average of 4-6 hours per camp. Am I doing something wrong here? I know the war pet sword is rare, but I didnt realize it would be so hard to spawn the bugger. Any advice on clearing and spawning would be extremely helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">to go faster, only thing you can do would be to bring a group instead of going there alone, to clean more spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've only tried the camp there once, we went with a group and cleared the main and 1 hut islands.  We got 2 seers to spawn, so yes they do spawn on the 1 hut island but inside the hut, were you pulling all the mobs there?  (2 Seers, 2 knight maces btw.)<br />
<br />
How hard was it to single pull that island?  I have a 65 cleric I can borrow to bot, if I could solo that camp that would be pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>etah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">easy for me to 2box a cleric pulling just the 1 hut (seer hut). Only 5 mobs on that island. 1 outside and 4 inside. 40 min spawn timer. I pacify to break up the mobs and after that its a cake walk. On the seer spawn I needed to call in reinforcement, no way i could duo the seer, hits to fast. I just cant seem to get him to spawn. <br />
<br />
I did a group and cleared the main island and 1 hut island and even then had only 1 named (the Jopal Flame Guy) spawn in 7 hours of clearing. Just must be the way it is set up then. Will keep at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll most likely just get a group to help me keep the whole island clear again, better than the slower camping 1 spawn point only with a bot would be.</div></div><hr />
