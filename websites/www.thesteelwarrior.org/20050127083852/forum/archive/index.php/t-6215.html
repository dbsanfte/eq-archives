<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I recently was able to loot a Tu'Nakk Parryblade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=65563)  that was rotting.<br />
<br />
Currently I do not have a DW setup.  Ive been able to get a Sword of the Bloodsworn but have been unable to get the CHoS due to it being permacamped and it being extermely expensive on my server (25kish).  It will be sometime before I can get enough people to try to get the Hook weapon from the remains.<br />
<br />
I realize the proc on the Parryblade is pretty much useless but if I were to Aug it with Ykesha or Anger would it make a good enough partner for the Bloodsworn?   <br />
<br />
I like the look of the Parryblade and the speed and the price :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Ya it would probably work out ok partnered with a double proc'd bloodsworn (I would aug bloodsworn first though and main hand it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Flair said, aug your sotb and mainhand it.  I wouldn't bother to aug the parry blade since your probably not swimming in adventure points right now and even anger II is relatively expensive.  Wait till you can get a chos or better (price is probably already dropping since proc level changed), and aug that. <br />
&lt;3 anger aug'd stun weapons</div></div><hr />

Well except on my server where they have actualy gone up abit since fix.  Figures :(<br />
<br />
I was always told that Torvo = Greed and im starting to see why.<br />
<br />
But ill work on Auging the Bloodsworn and my GSOT instead.  I really dont see myself using DW over the GSOT...the Aggro from the GSOT is working just fine and its more DPS and less reposte.  But i just hate not having a DW setup on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that unless you're really pushing the envelope of what you're capable of fighting, riposte damage isn't a big deal,  and a good aggro dual wield combo usually beats a 2h, just because you get more procs.   (for me, chos/sotb combo out aggro'd my gsot before I auged the 1handers) For DPS, it's the other way around.  Ultimately, I'd try to have a good aggro dual wield combo and aug the GSoT.  That way you're not restricting yourself to one setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mobs do notice debuffs not as much as snare or stun, but they definlty don't like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, last night with the help of a Druid and Rogue friend i was able to successfully camp the King room and got myself a CHoS. Was tough breaking the camp but after the initial set of spawns were cleared it was a cake walk.  :)<br />
<br />
Now im off to play around and see if the Bloodsworn/CHoS is better for me that my trusty ol GSoT. :)  Oh the fun times :)</div></div><hr />

Get anger augs for all of the above and you're golden.</div></div><hr />
