<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Borommir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1072586<br />
<br />
This is an alt my main is a 67 SK Ele/ Fire 200ish AA and I usually box a 65 shm 100ish AA.<br />
<br />
My GF started a guild and they are doing velious/luclin mobs i'm looking to gear him out with droppable / one group attainable gear until they get to the higher end luclin mobs. <br />
<br />
Me and my buddies farm vxed / tipt most nights and do hard ldons like crazy soon as he is 65 i'll be swapping him in and out with my main to get xp and loot items.<br />
<br />
Money isn't a big deal I can get it if I need to. <br />
<br />
The upgrades I am currently considering are:<br />
Mace of Memories<br />
Tainted Cloak of Treachery <br />
Necklace of the Troglodyte <br />
Warlord's Steel Gauntlets <br />
Burnished Antique Greaves<br />
Preserved Fleshmantle<br />
Earring of Sand Tides<br />
Polished Garnet Loop<br />
Fiercely Hooked Claw<br />
<br />
Looking for haste ideas and upgrade advice if any of my upgrades are better replaced with another item that I might not have considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nab whatever droppable haste ya can get. spiked seahorse belt should work well and have some survivability.<br />
<br />
rest of the gear...well, get hwatever you can. the warr you're building will be horribly twinked out so it really won't matter, it's all flash and glam. whatever you get will be beter than whatever the little dude would have been able to get in normal hunting.<br />
<br />
so just have fun chief. don't sweat the details.</div></div><hr />

Well the thing is once he's 65 with AA he will be the best tank she has so I need it to be more than flash and glam. He needs to beable to tank AL, Xtc, AoW, etc reasonably well I'm looking for the best way to get him near 10khp buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, flash and glam is the sh*t he'll be wearing is beyond what casual players eee; and i honestly don't see ya at a 10K tank UNTIL you get him into GoD land for no-drop goodies plus a ton of aa's. <br />
<br />
heck, with the OoW expansion...you might want to find yourself some Magnetic Armor.....there's threads on it here and it's comparable to ornate minus the effects. seems to me that's the way to go for ya.<br />
<br />
but i don't mean flash and glam like you're a bazaar hound looking good in PoK...just that your gear will probabally never get upgraded until you get to tipt/vxed+ ( if that ).. it's top of the line stuff ya plan on getting already.<br />
<br />
once magelo is updated proper; plug in the pieces + all the defensive + hp AA's and see what it looks like..it's a great tool for planning routes to look for upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Helmet of Rallos Zek? Go go tin can head =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borommir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea but HoRZ is a bitch to get ahold of plunking down 200k on an item I'd rather not do I plan on doing advs anyway so I'm thinking a royal attendent helm with the 40hp aug 36% haste aug and an AC in the slot 1. That and i'm soooo seksy without a helm graphic =p go go woodelf warrior.<br />
<br />
Shikarii I already have Acatu parked outside tipt/vxed to loot anything that rots =p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome way to ruin guild moral too! wtg<br />
<br />
I'm in an almost guild with almost EP-acces, I joined em before we could handle Vindi. I'm proud to say we use the same tanks who tanked Vindi the first time and the fact we equipped them outselves, that's what keeps a guild together and makes ppl enjoy playing. If my Guildleaders BF's warrior twink would be our MT I would have left a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Maybe a bit offtopic tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Borommir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well they are new and I always help them on my shaman, SK or druid, but the problem right now is they don't have an equip'd main tank and i am almost always available unless I am raiding. So my theory is I will twink out a main tank for them to use untill they can gear one out with things they have raided I wouldn't take anything that dropped from raids and once they have a geared MT I will just be available if they don't have a geared tank on and have the warrior for my personal use =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Perhaps use Tribute haste and look for a better belt. <br />
Heavy rubicite gridle would give you more hp's and ac -- drops in CT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea but HoRZ is a bitch to get ahold of plunking down 200k on an item I'd rather not do I plan on doing advs anyway so I'm thinking a royal attendent helm with the 40hp aug 36% haste aug and an AC in the slot 1. That and i'm soooo seksy without a helm graphic =p go go woodelf warrior. I paid 100k for mine, I'd assume it would go down more because of oow drops and magnetic helm. Yeah, go be some random hatless elf. Just like the rest of em!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you are going to be doing Velious, there is a nice 41% haste wrist quest in HoT. Not to hard to do anymore, 1 groupable easily, more is always better. Then of course AoW, Cursed Cycle XTC Blood Emp and a few others in SSRA. Shea in AR drops and nice face and shoulder item, but bring some friends. The Va'Dynn (sp) drops the a 100hp neck item.</div></div><hr />
