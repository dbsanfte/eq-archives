<br />
copy that and make sure the  parts between  - 's are on the same line as the inc (note this will put it on the first slot of the second page of the Hot Keys change numbers appropriately to put them in teh correct place for you to use them :) )<br />
<br />
also not the file that has to be altered has the name <br />
&lt;insert toon name&gt;_&lt;insert servername&gt;.ini and the section that wants altering is socials in that file<br />
<br />
hope this helps you :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Copy this into your Charname_servername.ini file<br />

Page2Button7Name=INC<br />
Page2Button7Color=18<br />
Page2Button7Line1=/g INCOMING [ 0028071-00001-00001-00001-00001-000015ED87FFC %t  ]<br />
<br />
Your groupmates will see:<br />
<br />
Soandso tells the group, 'INCOMING [ Target ]<br />
<br />
The color=18 line means that the color of the hotkey title is light blue (my code for knowing it is a /gsay hotkey) and the Page2Button7 thing means it is on the second page, 7th button of the socials bank (the window that has the Main, Combat, Ability, and Socials tabs, it used to only have the 10 slots that came preprogrammed with stuff like /who all Friend and /who all GM but now has 10 pages with 10 slots) The Page#Button# has no bearing on the hotkey's location in your hotbox (the hotbox is the window with 10 slots where you drag the hotkeys so pressing '1' will make you Kick or Taunt or whatever.<br />
