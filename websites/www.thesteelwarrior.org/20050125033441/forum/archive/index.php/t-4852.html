<br />
friday i went into EJ and found severlius up, i needed my greenscale and i thought, eh wtf ill try it.<br />
<br />
at the raid there where 2 warriors, myself, and another in the top end of the game, i was his friend and had him on loan for this raid :)<br />
<br />
anyhow, even with paladins stunning, SEW/CHSD/red epic going off, i was able to keep aggro thru the whole thing using stonewall and incite, my weapon was a GSo4W with vampire talon, before i could not keep this amount of aggro on a raid<br />
<br />
that was old world, lets jump up to the BoT wind tower boss, mister choaswind<br />
<br />
i again was called on to MT(because other tanks wernt watching, afterword i found out i was tanking it at 7k hp while the other warrior had 9k and aggro weapons..... i wonder why i was MT? this was a pick up btw) people waited about 5 seconds for me to call assist and jumped in<br />
<br />
again FLAWLESS aggro control, i burned thru my entire stonewall discpline and i tank swapped with the 9k hp warrior, he got aggro after i called for it and he had flawless control untill the end<br />
<br />
that was new world, seems to function on both<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now for the F**ked up part<br />
<br />
in LDoN i was loosing aggro to slows, stuns, and bard songs/toetwister a bunch more spells then normal were landing on my party (meaning we didnt resist them) and it was generally weird, i got aggro back almost right after i lost it, but it was more than enough to PO myself in seeing my shaman at 80% after i got agro back :D<br />
<br />
<br />
so what i find odd here is it rocks on raids, but its kinda shaky on LDoN groups, also had a BoT group before the towers raid, and i had alot better results(after i got incite, taunt, kick and disarm off i had aggro 85% of the time, but the SK or paladin could steal it off me if they wanted to, this is fine to me because i think its ok if their control is a hair better, the group didnt notice at all)<br />
<br />
<br />
also i noticed the /tell feature /who feature and general zoning was as slow as ass... as well as general instability, who know maybe the new abilitys are very taxing or the SH casino mob keeps popping and causing a jam<br />
<br />
also i LOVE the seperation of discplines, its been great i could use stonewall, and then when i called for tank swap i could use fort, then when i was not going to regain aggro i could use aggressive.<br />
<br />
now this is balanced out by the fact i cant do it in XP groups because incite slowly eats it away, if i were to do the same discpline chain in a xp group i would take along time to be useful again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bewkar</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
    Im posting from the clerics point of veiw on ths subject.  I play a 65 cleric and my brother plays a 65 warrior.  So i understand how bad warriors had it before. <br />
 <br />
First off get the Hate 3 augs from LDoN and let me tell you they are amazing for prolonged agro.  My brother has hate 3 on both his weapon Prim is PoI dragon hammer and off hand is Copper Hammer.  Bacically before the Provoke patch he needed that first proc to control agro and once had it never lost  it for most part.  <br />
<br />
Since the provoke patch his agro is absolutely amazing.  I only XP in LDoN anymore and let me tell you provoke isnt broke in LDoN.  I am always in about the highest dps/agro groups i can make and there is no SK/Pally that hold agro as well as my brothers warrior so people dont worry about that.  <br />
<br />
I say this cause warriors generally dont get in multi tank groups and if you are they arent High DPS so agro is easier to control anddont get to see the full picture.  I actually had to let my brother watch over my shoulder while in one of my groups to prove pallies and SK lose agro sometimed too , especially in LDoN.  All i can say is I will put any comparable warrior over a SK or a Pally any day of the week now that provoke is out.  It really works.  Now if all you guys would get the Hate augs from LDoN you will be seeing a whole lot of SK/Pallies lfg for 3 hours =)<br />
<br />
Grats you guys and if any of you warriors need a bad arse LDoN group on brell send me a tell this cleric will take you in a sec.<br />

<br />
I found that the new skills were much more helpful in LDoN and exp groups than they were on raids.  But then again, our equip and raid/exp groups are composed of vastly different things.</div></div><hr />

having them on different timers is very good,,,but until there is a spell that regenerates endurance we are still going to see knights with c3 taking agro and being prefered in xp grps.</div></div><hr />

I can't find it now ... but I am certain that I've read, from a dev post somewhere, that there will be no endurance regen spell buffs.  The idea, iirc, was to keep this particular melee tweak independent of any buff or spell caster type.  I remember something to the effect that stamina is leaving the game, the stamina regen effects will summarily be removed as well, and will not be replaced by endurance regen buffs.  (Mebbe foci tho?  I forget.)  If my memory is correct, then the discussion could be turned to the rate of innate regeneration (in my limited experimentation, it seemed to regen quickly enough), and NOT the presence or lack of KEI for Endurance.  <br />
<br />
If anyone can confirm or deny how I remember it ... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doggabone: Yes, I remember seeing it mentioned more than once that they don't intend on forcing the melee classes to rely on buffs for endurance regen - I agree with this notion. It would be just stupid to implement a new system and turn around and go, &quot;HA now you have to go pay a shaman 50plat for a buff so you can be useful to a group.&quot; If serious issues with endurance regen unfold themselves they need to tweak our innate regen, not make us go begging in PoK like those mana users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so why the fuck are there spells that used to drain the stanmia bar now draining the endurance one? if there is no buff for it there shouldnt be a spell to hurt it eather</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jumelin</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so if there are no new endurance regen spells isnt that going to benefit the hybrids even more???? seems they can swing away with abandon and not run out,,,,as posted above there seem to be endurance sapping spells,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">arf arf<br />
<br />
/agree Gharghael<br />
<br />
I think the better argument should be &quot;if there are no regen spells, is our innate endurance regeneration sufficient&quot;?   Fek it, I don't want to have to find class &quot;X&quot; before I qualify for a p/u group.  I think *mebbe* a faster regen is in order.  <br />
<br />
But I don't have to sit down to regen, and I still regen reasonably well in combat.  My pool empties less often than the cleric's (over a typical night) and fills faster.   When it does empty, it empties in one fell swoop focussed on me, instead of keeping the whole group on it's feet.  Taken on that anecdotal expereience alone ... I don't think it's far off from where it should be, if it should be tweaked at all.  And I'm sure we've all seen a caster - or hybrid - get dispelled and say &quot;Fekker got my KEI&quot; and watched the group gimp it's way along, or wait for whomever to get a refresh.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no issue at all with endurance drain attacks, even if I'd hate to be hit with one.  I would be less crippled than a caster hit with a mana drain, or one of those silence spells I hear about, etc.   I can still &quot;swing away without abandon&quot;, weapon attacks don't touch the endurance bar.<br />
<br />
What are we gonna say (other than *d'oh!* :p) if the endurance regen buff comes from a paladin - - call it &quot;Divine Inspiration&quot;?  No thanks, I hope they keep my endurance off the buff list and if it needs to be tweaked, let 'em tweak it  at the innate level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Doggabone said i believe this is a definate attempt to avoid the headaches of imbalance that various buffs stacking up and up have caused with mana regen. Sounds fair to me, hopefully all tweaks will be innate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, the END regen rate is just about perfect, when a disc pops, I usually have regened enough or nearly enough by then to use it again.<br />
<br />
For example, a small group of us did RoS the other night. The fight lasted 1hour 15mins from trigger to final death (don't ask why it took so long, hehe). During the fight, I would cycle Stonewall, Furious, Fellstrike and each time the disc popped, I had nearly enough END to pop them right away.<br />
<br />
END draining AE sucks to me, but I guess it isn't that bad. I will just have to get creative. :) It is kinda a tradeoff getting multiple timers to use more discs during a raid/xp group vs. not having any discs available because of a END drain AE, one that I can live with.</div></div><hr />
