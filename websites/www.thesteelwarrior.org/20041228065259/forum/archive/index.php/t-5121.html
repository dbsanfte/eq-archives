<br />
I never mind the snare, but has anyone any figures to show what the overall effects of this are?<br />
<br />
Is it the same as the defensive line (mitigation), the same as the evasive line (avoidance) or both?<br />
<br />
it's a higher level skill, so my utopian hope is that it's a better version of defensive with a snare attached - if so, I'll replace my defensive use with stonewall in almost every situation.<br />
<br />
Any log parsing people have done would be helpful  :)<br />

While using Defensive you also hit for less. That drawback got replaced with snare in Stonewall mode - which isn't a big deal.<br />
So I always prefer Stonewall nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh the snare effect is damn annoying in my opinion, trying to back into a corner you can't back up fast enough just holding down back most of the time so you find yourself having to turn around and run.  I like stonewall for xp groups though on occasion.  I just hate being so restrained in my movement hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edone</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">stonewall and def remove your crits also,makes evas a tiny bit better now that we get to use it with 5 % def always on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest most annoying problem with stonewall is when you use it on a mob that can't be corned.  More often then not, you will have it pushed right over you and lose quite a bit of aggro if it happens consistantly.  I prefer defensive on any mob that get pushed around.  On a side note, did anyone resolve why the damage spikes are greater when in a defensive stance?  I tanked the fake rallos and for the first time he killed me after chewing through 2 di's (which i've never needed before and the clerics were using the same pattern as always.  The adds never touched the clerics.)</div></div><hr />

I prefer defensive in most of time fights but there are exceptions like RZ and Inny where i use stonewall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQLiquidslow</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">overall, stonewall seems to be better than defensive for some reason, in my opinion anyway. However, it's no good if you are MTing a raid and its a mob where ya have to do any moving at all, in which case i use defensive. Use stonewall for permaroot mobs and things that you can corner, like AoW etc...</div></div><hr />

Oooookay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use stonewall in XP groups and tanking where a mob can be cornered, defensive in places like water where you get pushed about a bit, and evasive on mobs that you use evasive on ;)<br />
<br />
Stonewall is particularly nice in Earth against mobs where you are snared anyway because snared + stonewall doesnt snare you anymore than normal.</div></div><hr />
