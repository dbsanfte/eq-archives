<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a chance to go for a JoS last night, but held up, since I am not 100 % sure how the agro on it is, and do not have a great offhand to pair it with currently, and was iffy about spending DKP on something I would back for a time.  So the basic question is:  how is agro with JoS mainhand, is it worthwhile to get back to dual weilding with one of these if you currently have BoW?  My 2 offhand options are Hategiver and Stone Etched Mallet, would either of those along with JoS be a noticable step up from BoW, and carry me till I can get DBoW/FB(or could possibly pick up EoE as well to offhand with it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexus</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">General benefits of dual wielding are more stats, and compared to a BoW, DBoW+JoS/EoE DPS is relative. DBoW+Demerix (or DBoW+Epic2) would be the combo to really aim for, and with how rare DBoW's are you might end up mainhanding the Demerix/Epic anyway. I see a lot of new and old warriors using DBoW and JoS/Demerix/Epic since EoE is very uncommon and the 20/20 ratio can now be beaten by more common weapons in GoD.<br />
<br />
A lot of it depends on where your guild is progression wise. I would personally dual wield even over the MSC simply because of 5 procs over 3. The DPS difference is marginal when pure hate is the key goal, and 15 AA's in Slippery Attacks removes the already miniscule number of offhand ripostes entirely.<br />
<br />
Some swear by 2handers, but even in the current state I would never stray from dual wielding if you have better than minimal playtime and the ability to get 2 good weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the benefit of dual weilding(it is something I want to get back to), the question here is more specific.  Would JoS +(Hategiver/SEM/EoE) be at least comparable agro to BoW(in other words, would it not be a step backwards)?  Would it be something that would be a definate overal upgrade(statswise) while still keeping my ability to hold a mobs attention, until such time as I can get DBoW/FB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexus</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW - 175 HP. EB + A3/Yak<br />
<br />
JoS+Hategiver - 285 HP. EB + A3x2 + Frostbite<br />
<br />
For tanking, especially agro, JoS/Hategiver is superior in my opinion. For stats, the JoS alone with absolutely no secondary is superior. Some would shy away for the look, but to be completely honest, I would take a JoS+Hategiver/EoE over BoW any day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still a good choice to offhand with DBoW because an Anger 3 aug fits it nicely with the lifetap. The key reason to focus on the Demerix is that due to the ratio alone, it's dps makes up for the lack of a stun proc.</div></div><hr />

It's still a pwn offhand weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offhand, ratio is a much bigger portion of weapon aggro than in the mainhand because you proc so much less.The ratio differance has to be significant tho. and people can easily gripe about where to draw the line.Imo the aggro output of a JOS/HG will be a little less than a BOW(if you have all your swing aa),but,close enough that it's easily argued.JOS would be a  good offhander for some time to come tho when you get a new mainhander.I'm sure you could easily tank with it augged in mainhand and you'll get the better stats.<br />
<br />
Depends on your situation really.I was in that position not long ago and personally I would not have traded out my BOW for anything short of a DBOTW,FB,BBB etc.However,I knew I would get the next good mainhander to come along because I was holding my DKP to do so.I think you'll be fine either way though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that is the case, then it will be a long time before I dual wield again, as BoW is much greater than Hategiver + anything I tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since getting a JoS the other day, I've been using it with my Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled (13+1/17, 95dd/stun, +65% procmod) for a JoS+Ykesha/BBotE+A3 setup.  It's good agro, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's better than my BoW+A3.  I honestly wasn't overly impressed.<br />
<br />
Once I get my epic, I'll pair it with the JoS for sure, but something tells me I'll be doing it for stat purposes alone.  I'm still not thoroughly convinced that there is a weapon or combo significantly better than the Blade of War until the Darkblade (Heh, please read that sentence carefully).  While some of the OoW trial weapons, as basass as they are, are technically available to me, my guild won't start raiding until we hit Qvic/Inktu`ta first.</div></div><hr />

Read it carefully. I still believe my Bloodfrenzy+A3/Epic1.5+2xYkesha is significantly better than BoW.</div></div><hr />

Hrm ... something about the ratio would leave me to think:<br />
<br />
JoS + Anger3 &gt;&gt;&gt; Hategiver + A3, and JoS + anything else &gt;&gt;&gt; HG + the same 2nd weapon.<br />
<br />
HG's proc is stronger for sure, but honestly the ratios are such polar opposites that the HG really is outclassed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the same however when you do the math you get what I said : HG / JOS &gt; JOS / HG<br />
explanation  : <br />
mainhand &amp; offhand JOS &gt; HG<br />
however HG is so weak offhand that if you use those two weapons only, then you've better put HG mainhand because the difference between HG and JOS is two to three time bigger in offhand than in mainhand.<br />
We thus get this strange result : even if JOS is better than HG you have to offhand JOS if you use both weapons in order to maximise your aggro.</div></div><hr />

Conclusion for this thread though:  JoS + any half decent  (GBoS or better?) offhander should in pwn a BoWar.  The offhanded procs/augments alone will make up for the lesser proc str .. and the dps aggro should be far superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No thats total BS.Stats are better but not aggro hehe.Aggro between those kinda setups is fairly competitive.Overall,I woulda gone with either,but,never upgraded to a JOS/EOE or similiar from the BOW.Only thing I don't see BOWs pulling aggro from competitively are DBOTW or stuff we don't have yet like FB's and better.Pwn leaves one with the impression that the JOS combo would walk over the BOW for aggro as well and thats not true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunnar ... to drive the point home, i'll run some proc only numbers here with an offhanded weapon being Fine Steel + Anger3<br />
<br />
Total proc aggro with WA5 and anger3 for BoWar= <br />
(3 x 700) + (3 x 600) = 3900 hate/min from procs<br />
<br />
Total proc aggro with JoS + anger3 + Fine Steel weapon + A3 =<br />
(3 x 350) + (3 x 600) + (1.5 x 600) = 3750 hate/min from procs<br />
<br />
Now, change that offhander to, say, a Copper Hammer of Striking and you're looking at another ~675 aggro bringing the total to 4425 proc aggro per minute.  So with a CHoS in the offhand we're now looking at over 500 more hate per minute with a CHoS offhand from procs.  Add in a Decent weapon such as a HG, BoC, GBoS etc in the offhand and you're even that much better. Add in an solid <br />
weapon like an EoE and it will literally run circles around a BoWar over time :D .<br />
<br />
What are we left with?  DPS aggro from here on out, baby, and I seriously doubt a BoWar is even close to the same league as a JoS for dps aggro ... especially considering that an EoE at 20/20 is considered a superior dps aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
BoWars are nice, but any aggro weapon you find at time quality or higher will outclass the BoWar.  I've used my friends BoWar on multiple occasions.  It's nice aggro for sure, but it's nowhere near invincible, with my own aggro being actually very very close to if not greater than his over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From personnal experience :<br />
<br />
ED+A3 &amp; JoS+3  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BoW + A3 <br />
<br />
Thats with 600+AA , CE 25 (at the time).<br />
<br />
I even ended up feeling ED+A3 = JoS+A3 Mainhanded.<br />
While this might be totally false, i found no &quot;lack of agro&quot; with ED mainhanded over JoS.<br />
And the fun factor of the 750/1500 procs made my day.<br />
<br />
The BoW is a GREAT weapon, and will beat any combo for DPS.<br />
However once you factor in WA5 &amp; Augments, any dual wield combo BoC/BF/BBoE/RandomStun<br />
Will beat the BoW in total agro generation.<br />
<br />
If you factor good 1 handers (With a 20/20 or better ratio) the BoW just cant keep up.<br />
<br />
If you have a JoS, grab that BoT weapon or a BoC or any decent 1 hander.<br />
Put 2 Anger3/Ykesha, and you will totally own the BoW, both in agro &amp; DPS.</div></div><hr />

Hehe.No where did I suggest a BOW is invicible.I agree that over enough time without ever using taunt some of the dualwield combos suggested will pump out more hate.Personally,I don't believe the EOE or JOS mainhand combos in practice generate more aggro even over time.However,it doesn't really matter and folks can produce lots of lil theorys to back up whatever they want.I don't understand the coding and cannot accurately balance the BOW's ratio against 1 handers.I can say what I've seen over and over again in practice.The BOW is competitive for aggro with the above combos.I never had any problems tanking with a BOW using simaltaneous assist.The BOW is a very good choice imo until you get a DBOTW,FB or BBB.Certainly its as good as a JOS or EOE mainhand combo.It's far too close to suggest the BOW is pwned or blown away by those combos.<br />
<br />
It was the same with the BF/BOW thingy.There was a weapon you could say had proc aggro superiority on a BOW plainly.However,in actual use I found the 2 too close to call,it was a matter of luck.Did I think the BF have more potential hate over time if no taunt was ever used? Yeah,prolly.It wasn't black and white tho and in the end I bagged my BF for my BOW.Personally,I'd still use the BF over a EOE mainhanded hehe.<br />
<br />
In actual prctice the BOW worked very well for me.I see it work well for our other tanks too and definately do not see it as inferior to JOS/EOE stuff when aggro is being established or held.Neither set up s strng enough to routinely overcome proc luck between the 2 sets.<br />
<br />
PS.An EOE and many other time quality weapons do not hold aggro lrelatively as well as war tanking weapons from earlier periods.An EOE isn't a Time level equivalent for a BOW or BF from there content.It's usuable ,but, it's not a DBOTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely have to agree with Gunnar. <br />
<br />
I think some of you are overvalueing the hate generation of some of these dual wielding combos.  It's not to say that they're not bad agro.  In fact, they're all very good in terms of agro generation, but I do not believe they are BoW Killers which many of you seem to think they are.  If they were BoW Killers, then the warriors in my guild who do have these combos would be juggling agro with me while having fewer AAs and CE.  The fact is, they don't.  Also, by using the same thought process, if these dual wielding combos listed are BoW killers, then that would imply that they're at or near Darkblade levels.  I seriously have a hard time believing that.<br />
<br />
 and I seriously doubt a BoWar is even close to the same league as a JoS for dps aggro <br />
<br />
Then, by your statement, a Warrior wielding just a JoS is going to keep agro off another warrior wielding just a BoW?  That's the most ludicrous idea I've ever heard.  We're not talking quantum physics here.<br />
<br />
JoS = 1.16 to 1.2 ratio weapon depending on how ya look at it<br />
BoW = 1.5 ratio weapon, also affected by Punishing Blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, ED is supperior to JOS because of its proc mod.<br />
but remember that 2Her have BIG DB and that our hate bonus works only on the DB part of our aggro thus we have a bigger boost from 2Her than from DW. Thus 2Her can't be compared without correct swing hate analysis.<br />
Unfortunatly, my formula is fucked up with 2Her (I have BoW above DBotW/EoE if we don't have at least 70CE and all the offencives AA and EoA :() so I can only be accurate when comparing 1Her. After that I must use 'feeling' and 'personnal experience' and we all know that it's too biaised and too unparsable to be accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye,but the formulas we use to calculate hate on this board are also unreliable imo.Any war who has spent serious time thinking about and using these weapons should have a better innate understanding of their aggro qualities than those formulas often render.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, wars make quick judgements on this stuff based upon isolated experiences with particular people.If you work with and beside the weapons a lot you do get a reasonable expectation of their output.Not all fights are 10 second assist delays on a boss with controlled prox,furious mt and tight control.Not all clearing is perma stunned mobs dropping like flys with simaltaneous assist and multi taunting wars.Theres a lot of ways to play with aggro of course.Over time (especially if you have some control over who does what and or tank a lot) you can't help but recognize patterns.If you like the warrior class as most posters here do it leads you to experimenting and seat of the pants analysis.<br />
<br />
Yeah, one mans sense of feel easily differs from another and it is hard to prove anything without scientific data.However,the aggro data I see given as support here often comes up short because we don't fully understand all the variables.They are not truly scientific ,or,controlled.Mind you I try not to argue the small stuff.BOW,JOS/EOE,BF/BOC and similiar examples have too small of aggro differance to stae anything boldly as clear fact here.At least not using the words pwn or destroy.Trying to support such a conclusion with bits of made up formula data is misleading.I'll take the opinons of &quot;feel&quot; from experienced,thoughtful tanks more seriously myself.Often times irl folks try to spout questionable theory as fact against  opinions based upon experience and do poorly.<br />
<br />
It's a small part of the game.Gawd my guildies must think I lose my mind on this board cuz I'm pretty big on not sweating the little stuff in game.However, I guess this is the place to do it.Imo it is popular now for various reasons to like the newer stuff.For one new tanks bein brought up in guilds get some of these weapons easily and people want to be happy with what they get.Another reason is people gat sick of their old stuff.<br />
<br />
WA does advantage procs and you get more of them dualwielding.However,offhand procs are not huge compared to ratio and it is difficult to gauge.After I got my DBOTW I offhanded my bf awhile.For fun I picked up the Quarm hammer(not tanking as much hehe and decided I could be silly for once and get somethin for fun)and found my aggro to be at least as good.<br />
<br />
A lot of warriors ask me stuff in game.I can only tell them what I believe based upon my experience because the absolute measures are not known to us.The weapons in question can all be used well to tank for a guild like mine.We are only doing Uqua and still clear Time every week.I have played a lot with folks with higher end gear using my BOW until recently.I MT'd every fight from tactics thru Quarm.After we beat Time I started backing off tanking ,tho I have still MT'd every hard mob once at least and pay close attention to the tanks.<br />
<br />
The BOW is dated and no where near invincable.It was however the best weapon in it's time.Like the BF it carries weight through newer content well.It competes well with EOE's and JOS's from what I've seen.Like I said I never had a problem tanking beside folks wielding that those.Put a warrior in there with a FB,BBB,or DBOTW and you can see the differance.In clearing a BOW can still draw aggro on that stuff if assist is simaltaneous.I put the BOW,BF/BOC,JOS/EOE etc fairly close for aggro.Imo the BOW is the best of those for overall raid tanking excepting stats.However,it's too close to call as fact.They compete well together.<br />
<br />
Not tryin to go nutz.I just see a trend of dualwield is godly i don't really agree with.It's the weapons themselves,not whether you wield one or two.I remember posts from folks here before and after WA came out how the BOW could still be used well and even draw aggro sometimes from DBOTW quality set ups.It's still true.DBOTW,FB &amp; BBB are solid aggro upgrades from a BOW ,the other stuff isn't imo.<br />
<br />
Ther's a huge amount of variables that go into aggro production not the least of which is luck.This is what I've seen though.<br />

<br />
Don't get ahead of yourself there ... for dps aggro no they are not in the same league.  JoS will blow the BoWar away.  You can't line up apples and oranges and compare them as such.  I seriously doubt there are many 1handers out there which can begin to compete with their 2hander counterparts (or even those far beneath their value) for dps or dps aggro with no offhanded weapon.  Fuck ... a Windblade will put out more dps than a JoS by itself.  Toss in an offhanded weapon and it's an entirely different matter.<br />
<br />
Point was that dps aggro over time should be greater with JoS and a decent offhander.  Proc aggro would also be superior.  If both dps and proc aggro win out by a fair margin, i fail to see where the BoWar has the advantage.  Unlike the BF/BoC argument here we aren't trying to see whether the dps aggro outweighs the proc aggro ... in both cases it would seem the JoS + offhander would win out.  Where, then, is the argument?<br />
<br />
1 + 1 = 2.<br />
<br />
BoWar is a competitive weapon for sure for that level of content.  It's a great weapon, but when you stack it up against time quality weaponry with time + ratio's and half decent procs, it's gonna fall short.<br />
<br />
It is, after all, a tier 3 PoP 2hander.  It's only saving grace is it carries a relatively strong proc.</div></div><hr />

I myself was using dual wield combo, obstinantly proclaiming that two fully aug'd weapons with full AAs and WA5 would blow mostly any two hander out the window, but after just having acquired a BoW myself, I'm finding myself holding more competitive aggro - especially in the first 2 ticks of a fight - using the two hander. It's contrary to every forumla and every hypothesis I've read on these boards, but with the other tanks in my guild's rot using DBoW/Epic or DBoW/JoS or FB/Arani's Rage (which would truly surprise you with the aggro generation thereof) - none of who bag their weapons or pulse their attacks heh - I have aggro stolen less often with the BoWar. I thus use it primarily over Epic/JoS</div></div><hr />

PS.1 + 1 only equals 2 if you know that 1 is really 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My opinion of the BoW took a nose-dive the day I actually got to try one.  It was comparable aggro on average to the duel wield setup in my magelo ... more at the start ... felt like less over time (though i can't be sure) ... etc, and yes this was with both chars having WA5, max flurry, and max 2hander aa's.  It was stronger, but not this god-like weapon i envisioned it to be.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong ... it's a great weapon and the aggro is very competitive ... I just honestly cannot see how a duel wield setup so far superior to my own wouldn't take the BoW to the cleaners.  That said, dps aggro to a large degree is relatively unknown. <br />
<br />
That said, i'd upgrade to a BoW from my combo or even a BF/BoC any day for the comparable aggro, superior dps, and megalithic ac (for my area of the game) ... but given the chance at a JoS i think i'd go the duel wielding route.</div></div><hr />

Actually Erathia no one said JoS+?? were &quot;BoW killers&quot; thats the Halberd &amp; MSC <br />
<br />
However what people are saying is that JoS+?? will give (assuming a 1.0 ratio weapon)<br />
- More DPS than BoW<br />
- More Procs than BoW<br />
- More HP than BoW<br />
- A bit less AC than BoW<br />
<br />
So overall, yes they are better.<br />
<br />
PS : Saying/Thinking JoS &gt;&gt; BoW is retarded, i hope you can all see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the thing.They are all relatively close aggro producers in my experience.I believe the BOW has a small advantage,but, thats only when I'm getting anal.It definately has more snap to it on engage so im tempted to go with the BOW on dps aggro,tho I don't know how the game calculates it and wouldn't begin to try to add that stuff up.I would tell any warrior that they are all relatively close weapon sets.Imo I wouldn't suggest someone try to upgrade a BOW with a JOS or EOE combo unless they really thot it seemed fun,wanted the stats,or figured they were outa the loop on a real upgrade.JOS and EOE are easy to get relatively when you get your mainhander.<br />
<br />
I never expected the BOW to be godly hehe.It did a good job for me when I mt'd every single mob and 90+ pct of clears for a long time.It's a good weapon don't knock it.The DBOTW at this point kinda reminds me of the feel i had when i got my BF and we were luclin/velious/oldworld geared.BOW is a good choice until one of the real good raid mainhanders or the new weapons like maybe the claymore.</div></div><hr />

damn me !!<br />
I was very tired when I verified proc rate of ED on lucy, I understood proc rate = 85% as +85% not -15% ...<br />
I really need more rest sometimes cause I can use my memory neither my brain when I am out of sleep for a too long time.</div></div><hr />
