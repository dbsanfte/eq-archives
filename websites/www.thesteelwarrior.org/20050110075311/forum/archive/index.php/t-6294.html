We're just tried RZ for the first time last night and got him down to 25% before the adds owned us.<br />
<br />
Right now we're trying to tweak our add-managing strats and I have chanters wondering if any AE mez other than bliss of the nihil would work on them?<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

RZ down, but yet again shafted on the BoW drops!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, kite the adds and have anyone that can charm do that.  Send your bards and SKs out to kite cause your chanters are too much dps to waste doing crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZtW is all about the charmed adds. Your MT/healer force is there basically to keep the big guy placed and not running about killing the healers.</div></div><hr />

Hitting the nail on the head and well said.  Rztw has a shitload of hp suprisingly enough.  If you're sending 2-3 charmed pets against Rztw, you'll probably want to start preparing the CR, hehe.  We had 7 pets the last time we did it and we barely eeked out a win.  The adds converged on the raid force at 5% and, for those who have done this encounter, you'll probably know that once they do, the raid gets demolished *VERY* fast.<br />
<br />
It's still a tough script for even elemental crewed guilds.  Get good at it though.  Getting Blades of War for every warrior in your guild is an incredible thing to do cause 50ac and 175hp are just &quot;teh winn!&quot;.  Also, augging it in combination with WA5 is damn near agro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each charmed pet is = to 10 players DPS, its absolutely insane. The charmers just have to be bacl far enough and against the wall that when the charm breaks you have time to recast it. If your doing the encounter they should all have extended range 4 anyway, so they should have plenty of room to work. <br />
<br />
Also, after the encounter, we would always do a mass TL since we are all bound outside of the tactics stone and then have a bard go in and kite the mobs away from the PP so everyone can go in and get their hails done, but you gotta be quick, the PP for RZtWL is a timed one and he doesnt stay up long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seveirn</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druid is my main, i norm charm Boar's For this fight and haste them, They can put out some damn nice DPS before RZ's Rampage kill's them (which is not often so they last a while) <br />
<br />
Btw boars hit 480ish? tripple + druids 87% Pet Haste.<br />
<br />
Most time we do this flawlessly, Just make sure you snare your pets first when the fights accually done, anouther good idea if you have your pet after RZ is dead is to Go take on adds, Kill them or your pet, wouldnt really wana hasted pet barrling toward you or others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grev</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any input on whether the fake RZ got a HP boost ? On yesters RZ raid, the fake one took almost double the usual time to poof.</div></div><hr />
