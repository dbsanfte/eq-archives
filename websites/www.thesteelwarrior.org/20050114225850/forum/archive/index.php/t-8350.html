<br />
standard set up for me has been blade of carnage/horn of hsgara. recently completed my pride of the legion quest, however. also finally got enough ef points to buy anger augs. anger 2, that is.<br />
<br />
immediately put anger 2 in boc. winwin. but now a bit loss. horn is nice weapon w/ cold resist and big ac bonus on it. i really love my pride though, and the innate proc on it is nice.<br />
<br />
but when i equip my pride in primary and boc in secondary, i lose approx 32 ac and 17 atk. plus the reduced proc amount w/ boc in offhand.<br />
<br />
i feel like it's silly to anger aug a weapon w/o an innate proc. but i feel it's silly to offhand my boc.<br />
<br />
i've read/heard/dreamt that they are considering upping the piercing cap for warriors. that would solve some of my atk problems w/ the pride in mainhand. anyone confirm/deny this?<br />
<br />
and boc offhand. thoughts/suggestions?<br />
<br />
pride goes on back too. and it fits there well. should i stick w/ it there?<br />
<br />
considering the kind of tank i am, should that boc be permabonded to my primary hand no matter what? or can i move it offhand and use my pride in primary? i have enough points to anger aug my pride 2. the pride has innate stun/dd on it as well.<br />
<br />
or should i suck it up and buy the sotbs and aug that and stick that in secondary?<br />
<br />
i guess i feel very hesitant to anger aug my horn because it lacks an innate proc. seems silly to me. someone convince me otherwise.<br />
<br />
lot of rambling here, but i can't really make a decision on this. kinda stuck and need someone on the outside to help clear things up for me.<br />
<br />
thanks. i appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  Get a copper hammer offhand, put the horn on your twink rogue :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i know how much you dont want to hear the advice of giving up a hoh with its 35 raw ac.<br />
<br />
so here is a post from someone who used one from about level 30 until actually i think level 65 but then gave it up for a copper hammer<br />
<br />
it was a painful decision giving up all that ac because i used to pride myself on it.but i gave it up for an innate procing weapon which i then anger augged. and i have no regrets even if i cringe to look at my ac and know it could have been so much higher.<br />
<br />
but what it comes down to is you cannot fight the battle alone in your group as if your ac all by itself is going to make or break the effectiveness of the group. the better the agro you have the faster your group can kill the mob you are on and the less they will need to heal you. the better your agro the less often mobs will hit others in your group and the less they will need to be healed as well. and injustice as it may seem people are rarely impressed with your mitigation ability near so much as they are impressed with your ability to keep a mob glued to yourself.</div></div><hr />

Your job is to hold agro as a primary, secondary to take having agro well, and thirdly to do a little DPS. Get an inate agro proc weapon, it'll help you tons.<br />
<br />
Just because your attack raises when when BoC is in primary doesn't mean it raises for both hands, primary hand atk is the only one shown, but both are calculated separately. Just as is range, kick, bash, and slam, you just don't see the numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for your concerns about piercing:  Weapon skill has no effect on your aggro, and 240 piercing skill gives only about 5% DPS loss vs. the other skills.  So my advice is to judge piercing weapons by their merits, rather than by their weapon type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the HoH is just a crutch, the sooner you get rid of it the better off you'll be. when choosing a weapon you should be concerned with 2 things. holding agro and DPS, in that order. after that, everything else is a luxery. if you want more hp or AC look towards your armor slots, you only get 2 weapon slots.</div></div><hr />
