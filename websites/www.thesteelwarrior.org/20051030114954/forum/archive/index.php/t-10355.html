Any time I tried to start an alliance alt, id have to get into virtual fist fights over the low level quests. Dwarf, night elf, human, it didnt matter, all of them was a mad scramble for spawns. On the horde side, I only once had to race to a quest mob and that wasted two minutes out of my game time because it respawned so fast. I dont really see the more quests than horde thing though. I never have less than 15 active quests on my shaman, all currently yellow or higher. If I felt like taking the time to complete them, id no doubt level faster lol.</div></div><hr />

He frequently soloes multiple mobs a few levels higher than him without a problem.  That said, I'd have to say this guy was the single most-skilled EQ player I've ever seen.  As a bonus, the end-level instances currently seem to require you enter with either a Mage or a Warlock, preferably both.</div></div><hr />
