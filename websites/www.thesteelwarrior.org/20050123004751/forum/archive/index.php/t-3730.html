<br />
As you can see in This (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3713) post, there was talk that a development team was looking into tuning pure melee and such. My concern is that is there has been no progress on that project since it's birth 9 months ago, why would these people/person still be assigned to the task?<br />
<br />
I am sure that thread will continue to grow as older information is dug up, and new information is laid to bare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about an update of some sorts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said they would plan in taking a look at class balance.<br />
<br />
Just another way to gain time, before the next expansion is released.<br />
<br />
There IS NO melee team,<br />
or if there is, it's probably lead by the nephew of some important SOE guy.</div></div><hr />

His response has been that he doesn't have any information for us.  You can take that to mean either they've not actually begun looking at the problem, they're looking at it but haven't come up with any good solutions as of yet, or they're just not willing to let us know what they have come up with for fear that if it doesn't end up going live for some reason the shit storm generated would be unbelievable.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't hold out much hope for us getting any good information until just prior to something being implemented, if then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After 9 months, him coming hear to say something as vague as, &quot;We have something in the works&quot; would make me happy right about now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coming up with an idea that could solve class balance issues does NOT take time.<br />
Especially when the game is this advanced, and that there's few choices to make.<br />
<br />
What takes time is balancing it out right... and that happens on the test server...<br />
that's what the test server is for...<br />
3 to 4 months of something being kept on the test server, without going live, is perfectly fine.<br />
But over 9months of still not having the slightest clue, that should be reserved for politicians.<br />
<br />
Absor has ZERO clue of what the hell is happening, because nothing is happening yet.<br />
<br />
When you see such a company spend this much time, on something this urgent and important..<br />
you understand why every other product they bring out is complete trash.<br />
<br />
Ya, Absor only represents SOE for us, and in that case he is only a messenger, and we shouldn't shoot him.<br />
<br />
BUT, don't forget he's also suppose to represent US.<br />
WE have been asking for something for ages, we have been pleading...<br />
OTHER CLASSES have been pleading for us!!<br />
<br />
And what does our representent give us?? after all these months...<br />
hell! even after all these years!!!<br />
<br />
&quot;I got no information&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but Absor deserves to be shot down.<br />
<br />
We have been in desperate need of attention for ages... and all we get from him is:<br />
&quot;Any questions about LDoN?&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;I got no information&quot;<br />
<br />
How can you ever hope for evolution, when the only connection we have with SOE, is an absent public relations ghost?<br />
<br />
What do you think Absor told the team responsible for melee balancing (if there is one)???<br />
&quot;The classes are balanced&quot;<br />
or<br />
&quot;I got no information&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I understand the frustrations.  I'm there with you.  I'm frustrated beyond compare.  If SoE was to ship to me a new game, something I hadn't spent four years investing in, free, gratis, no charge what so ever.  And told me I could play the game for a 6 month trial period with no service charges, I'd still not play.  That's how frustrated I am with them as a company.<br />
<br />
Absor is, by the very nature of his position, a corporate stooge.  He can't tell us anything the company doesn't let him tell us.  He has no insight to share that the company doesn't want him to share.  So railing at him really serves no particular purpose, because all he can really do is sit there silently and take it.  I don't envy him for it.  And I believe that it's pertty much out of his control, if he want's to continue to be employed.<br />
<br />
Am I angry with SoE?  You bet.  Am I angry with Absor?  I would be, since he is there representive, if I didn't know that he really has little or no say in the matter.</div></div><hr />
