Over time those stats will mean little of nothing due to gear, unless they really depart from the item progression of other MMOs. I say play what you like.<br />
<br />
I'll probably go guardian for the vanguard armor look. And maybe wood elf or human. Kinda depends on what races my friends decide to start with, good or bad, so we can level together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think SOE said races will matter. And that could either mean a little, or alot like in FFXI. There, a human tank in the best possible gear won't match that of a galka tank with average gear. Of the same level. If this is the case here...hrm. That would actually be pretty bad for a game like this. I hope the difference isn't *that* huge.</div></div><hr />

'They' keep saying that this is a very balanced game and encouragement is being given to the any any race can be any class idea. I think if there are any massive differences between two races they will tweak the lesser race or take the nerf bat to the better race. You can almost smell it happening already ...<br />
<br />
Anyhow I plan on going dwarven in EQ 2 and I am split between Guardian, Berserker or maybe even monk.<br />
<br />
My original idea was to go guardian as I figured this would be the ultimate tank - although according to the spiel out there all subclasses of the fighter archetype will be able to tank just as well, and on creating him on the cc disk he felt a little bit more berserk than guardian like to me.<br />
<br />
Also my RL friend is going to play a shaman and I was under the impression that shamans wards affect brawler sub class better, although they seem to rely more on avoidance and a good agility score which is not really the forte of the vertically challenged one.<br />
<br />
So do any of you have any input as to which to go for given that I want duo my way to the end game with a shaman as a dwarf and want to be as good a tank as possible when i get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tineras</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any insight into how these subclasses will play out?<br />
<br />
I was toying with paladin, guardian or beserker for tank, but honestly I haven't seen enough information to let me make an informed choice...<br />
<br />
I've picked a race that favors warriors now, and was thinking maybe berserker since I haven't raided a lot in the past and was thinking for smaller groups a berserker would be more dps than a guardian (who presumably has better taunt/mitigation)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the nice things about EQ2 is that you don't need to worry about this question until you are 19th level and by then you'll have a much better idea, having likely seen both choices in action.<br />
<br />
I plan on Guardian because I group with some RL friends and they have DPS and healing well covered (two Priests, a Mage and two Scouts), my job is nothing more than keeping aggro, if I could keep flawless aggro and do 0 DPS we would win most fights.  I think it's likely to not make much a difference most of the time, a Berserker might need more burst healing but in the end the fight is over faster so it balances out.<br />
<br />
You get stat boosts according to class and equipment and character traits but since everyone gets pretty much the same boosts you will obviously be most successful if you choose a race appropriate to your class.  Yes, you can play a Gnome Fighter.  Yes, you will be able to tank and do your job.  Yes, the Ogre will be able to do more than you, given equal player skill.  So if you're a min/maxer this was never a question and you're playing an Ogre, Troll, or Barbarian to begin with.  If you're not a min/maxer play what you want and have a good time.  I have seen an Erudite tank and she didn't have the margin of error of the bigger races but it worked out, she kept aggro and (often) lived and that's all that matters.<br />
<br />
Note that, at least at the low levels, fights are almost uniformly short and brutal.  If things go wrong it can snowball in a hurry and before you can type, &quot;/g RUN&quot; it's all over.  As the tank in EQ2 you WILL die unless you're fighting trivial mobs, regardless of race.  Don't get discouraged, death isn't really that big a deal unless it comes in bunches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are all essentially the same with just cosmetic differences, pick whichever one appeals to you the most and go with it.  The game is designed so they are all interchangable and hence the same under the covers.</div></div><hr />

The difference in tanking ability beween guardian, berserker, pally, and sk isnt' huge... the difference come from special abilities.  Guardian gets more defensive abilities, berserkers get more offensive abilities etc.  But just as meatshields go, the difference is minimal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was looking at the descriptions and neither lists whether the subclasses have those abilities.  The ability to wield 2 weapons at once is what im really looking for, as sword and shield is boring (thus no knight for me).  If guardian is best with a shield, I dont think I could take it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldra</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights can dual wield &quot;I Think&quot; as long as they use two DW weapons.  In EQ2 weapons are classified as one handed, two handed or dual wield.  <br />
<br />
To DW both weapons have to be DW weapons, and those tend to do lower damage; a one handed hammer would be 9-20 damage and two DW weapons would be 4-12 each.</div></div><hr />

There are restrictions for knights that I am not totally familiar with.  Such as a 2H Harpoon dropped in Serpent Sewers that I could use but the Knight Could not for some reason.  Doesn't make sense that a spear would be gated by warrior/crusader.</div></div><hr />

Instead of having level requirements and class restrictions, the weapons have a minimum skill.  Again as far as I can tell the skill for specefic weapons automaticaly max out with level.  Some weapons can not be used until you reach a certain skill level.  Like EQ 1 there is a minumum level that weapons can be used, but the damge will be less until you reach a certain skill level.

At 20 I got kneebreak (upgrade to kick) and Sentinal which is a 3 minute non conentration more effective version of intervene.  At 21 I got Allay, which lends my parry/block skill to my designated target (1 concentration).  <br />
<br />
I'll ding 22 tonight, not sure what I get then but I hear I get some personal defensive skills in the next 3 levels which will be nice, because even apprentice III toughness is grey.</div></div><hr />

Haven't had any agro problems even when fighting orange and red cons (tanked giants in Thunder Steppes at 22 with a group of mostly 25s just fine).<br />
<br />
Both tanks can dual wield, even if we do get 2handers upon subclass completion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that's a thing that I think a lot of people still haven't gotten used to. All fighters are equal tanks, barring bugs (like deflection not working for a while for monks brawlers), just choose what you like.<br />
<br />
Berzerkers do a bit more dps than guardians, and its true, not by much though. DPS does hold agro quite well, even better than some of the taunt abilities. However, the only people that you are really going to be fighting for agro are other fighters. Agro is not much of an issue as it is in EQ. The tanks were given plenty of tools for this job and they work.<br />
<br />
There's a big debate that berzerkers are more useful because DPS stacks and is generally more useful in a group than defense buffs. I've only made it to 22, but I don't see why its an issue. Guardians get plenty in return for less DPS.<br />
<br />
I can't overstate how good the guardian buffs are. I can make a wizard tank if neccessary. Our buffs stack with each other and its a snap to protect someone from too much damage. Warriors get intervien, which is relatively weak, but is purely concentration based. Most importantly, it does work, you can even be behind the mob beating on him and the buff works so lang as you don't get too far from your group member. Later on you get ally and some other buff. These things are priceless. Tank stacking is not an issue, at least for gaurdians. We can tank without even having agro.<br />
<br />
These buffs really work if you give them a chance. They are get at getting agro back from a wayward caster, and great for tough encounters because you can spead the spike damage off the main tank and help decrease the likelyness of them being one rounded.<br />
<br />
In short, we all tank just as well, but each fighter has other abilities to differentiate themselves from other fighter classes. Berzerkers do better damage, and guardians can protect anyone in the group.<br />
<br />
I chose guardian, and I'm very happy with my decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolsdar</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So glad i chose guardian, it rocks.<br />
<br />
You wont go far wrong with either guardian or beserker, there really isnt much difference. We take more damage, they do more. Both can tank equally as well.<br />
<br />
What i have started to notice is the difference between us and other fighter classes, at 29 i take a hell of a lot less damage than a pally/sk of similar lvl and gear. Dunno how this pans out at higher lvl's as im only low atm, it would be interesting to find out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't know about that. The major differences I've seen between fighters seems to nearly always gear related. I had a Paladin that was so sure that he class was gimp and that fighters do not tank equally well.<br />
<br />
You know, that may be the case, but that wasn't he problem. I pointed out to him that he was wearing all grey gear (grey = you might as well not be wearign anything, no, really...) except for a few peices of jewelry and I think a pair of blue gloves. Whereas I was in full orange heavy plate, ecept for my gloves and waist (yellow and blue respectively). Yeah, I think that might have had something to do with it. He tanked just as well as I did naked (yeah, no shit).<br />
<br />
Brawler subs had some issues with deflection for a while there and I suspect that a few issues with thier tanking remain, but over all, given equal gear, we all from my experience tank very similarly. The only differnce I've seen is that Knights get horses, Brawlers wear cheaper armor, Berzerkers hold agro well, as do guardians, but the difference between us is that berzerkers can only hit on the mob and taunt when they lose agro to the cleric whereas, I can just just ally and sentinel, and I'll be tanking the mobs no matter who it chosses to beat on. Very handy ability, but if I had to choose sub class again, I'd have a hard choice between berzerker and guardian. DPS is very handy when you mostly solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, Not many peope realize it yet, but gaurdians stack very well. @ guardians in a group? Have the secondary tank buff the primary. the the damage is spread over 2 tanks instead of just one, which can be very easily one rounded without wards/reactives/regens going already. Since most groups have 2 healers anyways, they can both choose a tank to heal and with the buffs they'll take about the same amount of damage, and less damage over all, because of the block/parry mods on the buffs. it makes those boss encounters cake, and raid encounters even easeir.<br />
<br />
But, I guess that means there no such thing as the uber MT like there is in EQLive. Now guardians have to work together, not just wait for the guy before them in rotation to die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khiva</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/AGREE with Vikken<br />
<br />
   Just hit 22.6 tonight, got a new skill to add to my beserker line. Ended up going Barb Beserker, and it is great fun. As far as the difference goes, i have to say with tanking in this game, we all get similar skills along different lines, but it all comes down to the GEAR. <br />
<br />
   From level 17 - 22 i have spent all my gold on upgrading my gear, i buy everything red or orange and as soon as it turns blue i get better. This goes for weapons too, many tradeskillers will trade with you or cut you a deal if you work with them. I've only bothered buying a few app3's or Adept's so far, i find that the coin is much better spent on the faster, harder-hitting weapon.<br />
<br />
  So no matter if you choose Beserker or Guardian, you are going to want to keep yourself in the latest fashion when it comes to equipment. =]</div></div><hr />

i dont know how well zerkers like shields, but i hear guardians love them, lots<br />
<br />
<br />
theres a neat quest, (read EASY quest) that you get in the baubleshire from the gnome blacksmith findlebop. He wants you to go to the oakmyst forest and get ONE rat tail. Oakmyst forest, to get there just click the outside qeynos mariners bell and pick oakmyst. Thats it, one rat tail. The rat is like level 9-11 i think, 2 arrows on him. He is tough so you may need a partner. I solo'd him at 14 no prob. The reward is your choice of shield. As i understand warriors are the only ones that can use a tower shield so pick the tower shield.<br />
<br />
IIRC its like shield factor 60 and some stats. I think that translates to 60 ac, though im not sure. As a bonus this thing is HUGE. When you wear it on you back it blocks off your entire torso from view.<br />
<br />
Full suit of plate off a merchant, this shield, and a long sword.....i look like a tank, and it feels good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far it seems like most healers prefer guardians over berzerkers as far as tanking goes. A templar can have as much AC as a guardian, but a templar will still take more damage. There has to be some kind of difference between guardians and berzerkers as well. Not sure about guardian vs knights though - i sure hope there is a difference! Still have an inherent dislike of paladins, and i don't think it wants to go anywhere any time soon.<br />
<br />
As far as having 2 guardians in a group - that can work. One can focus on tanking, the other can allay him and focus on dps and protecting anyone if that might be in trouble. However, having 1 guardian use protection abilities on the other constantly would annoy the healer quite a bit. Having to heal 2 tanks instead of one does that. Of course, there are situations when the tank is taking too much of a beating, a guardian protecting another can help alot in those cases. However, as far as regular mobs go, it seems like Allay would be the only productive protection skill - because that one doesn't make the protecting guardian take any damage. <br />
<br />
There were also discussions of a guardian protecting a berzerker tank, but i don't see that working very well either. Let's say a berzerker takes 110 damage from a hit that a guardian would take 100 damage on. It seems like the protecting guardian would take the whole 110 damage if he protected the berzerker. So it would make more sense to have the highest mitigation and AC person tank (unless we're talking about monks here)</div></div><hr />

However, as far as regular mobs go, it seems like Allay would be the only productive protection skill - because that one doesn't make the protecting guardian take any damage. <br />

Depends on the healer. Druids primarily use heals over time, so spreading the damage out is pretty helpful, especially on high damage output mobs. Clerics (which are much more numerous, at least on Blackburrow) use mostly instant heals. Clerics probably would prefer damage concentrated on one player to maximize heal effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, perhaps I didn't post clearly enough. I wasn't suggesting that the guardian intervein/sentinel the MT in normal group situations. That would be inefficient, unless the group is way undercon. In that caseits more like a single group raid.<br />
<br />
The damage spreading spells, like intervien, sentinel, and stand firm really come in useful when taking on raid mobs. Most raids that I've been on have a MT that is higher level than the encounter. I have tanked a few as well as secondary tanked raids where this is the case, where no one will do the raid unless the tank is some arbitratry level above the mob. This is rediculous, and is not what is going ot be happening as people get higher level. Players will have to deal having an undercon tank just like the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
So, one way to deal with this is to have your tanks protect the MT. Each healer is assigned a tank, just one tank for them to heal. The MT is going to take th brunt of the damage, but with the other guardians spreading the dmaage across player, essentially, you have tank with much more hitpoints, since its very unlikely that the tank will be killed in ONE HIT, the damage will spread to the other tanks, because they each have a chance to take the damage instead of MT. They each have healer ready to heal them also.<br />
<br />
So, for instance,  you could have the MT a berzerker, which holds agro much better than a guardian, wears the same armor, ans simial hitpoints. Then have your secondary tank a guardian, he has all his protection buffs on the berzerker, intervien/sentinel/stand firm/ally. Have a healer on each, one being a shaman doing wards on the MT and spot healing the guardian. There's very little chance of the MT doing down, and almost no chance of the berzerker losing agro, since very little raw healing power is being used on him, and berzerkers are just awesome at keeping agro. That leaves you with no less than 8 DPS spots to work with. Nothing I've come across can deal with that much pure DPS, but if you need to you can have 1 or 2 spots for extra healers for ae damage or whatnot. But chances are, from my experience so far, you'll have more than enough DPS to kill the encounter before ae dmage kills a significant portion of your dps, if any at all.<br />

More than one tank in a group is a waste. Two different types of healers are usually a good idea for most groups though to keep things moving. My thoughts hae olways been that xp gain will come best from going without a none dps than with one. By that I mean, that there's no reason to take a tank, that includes monks, if you already have one, ever. You'd just be spreading xp across more people with seeing even a signifiant increase in DPS. People need to learn that tanks aren't an exceptable source of DPS, its just way too inefficient. it'd be better for those extra tanks to go solo. they'd be getting more xp over time than wasting a spot in a tank heavy group.<br />
<br />
That will probably make some people made around here, but thats how I see it so far. In a group with myself, 2 healers, and 3 dps, we can kill nonstop orange/low reds encounters. losing just one of those DPS makes healers use more power, kills come much slower and xp over time drops drasticly. Anything less just means more downtime, and slower xp for those that like to do that sort of thing. Myslef? I prefer this setup because I can pull my quest mobs constantly, or get to the boss I need to kill much faster and smoother than dragging along another tank.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I'm really pissed off! First off, I wanted to say hahaha. In that, I was making a joke. Hahaha<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think  in a standard pickup group, yeah, you have the MT, healer, scout, mage, mage, variable. Your hope is if the MT dies for whatever reason the scout would be tough enough to hold aggro. That being said, 1 good tank, 1 good healer, and four nukers would get the job done. Three tanks, one healer, one chanter and a bard would get the job done. It really depends on players available and the content you're facing.<br />
<br />
Also, just out of curiosity, what sort of raids are you going on at level 24? Are you on the good side or the bad side?<br />
<br />
Just chiming in on the guardian thing I usually cast Intervene on the healers and also try and keep a slot open to cast on the MT if I don't happen to be the MT and it looks like he is low on health or the cleric LDs etc. I've noted you only take damage if you get in between the mob and the mob's target however, so make sure you tell the healers to do tghe work. With that auto target thing that faces you towards the mob its much too hard to unclick your target and try and find the healer.. especially if you do not have a top end system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If about 1/4rth the people are fighters, and only 1 is needed in a group, then 1/3rd of the fighters are stuck group-less. Soloing is possible, but it's boring and not good exp compared to a group exp - for a fighter anyway. I've tried it once, and almost all of my gear is orange, the rest is yellow. Oh, and some fighters tank better then others, while others do more damage then others. With a elitist group with 4 scouts/mages, they might as well pick the most defensive fighter for the tank, so some fighters are *useless* in groups if you look at it that way. <br />
<br />
I doubt a 2nd fighter brings nothing to the group. Some of the fighters were meant to be more DPS then tanks. Sure, may be not as much damage as a scout or mage, but they have other perks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the biggest misconception people have about fighters is that some tank better than others. And by tanking, I mean mitigating or avoiding damage, so that the tank takes less damage over time than a non-tank.<br />
<br />
ALL fighters are tanks, get it through your head. They all tank just as well, though some have special abilities or raical abilities that make them stand out. So its important to remember that even 2 guardinas wearing the same gear can tank quite differently. For instance, I took added defense as one fo my traits? I could have chosen mitigation or regen or any number of things.<br />
<br />
The thing to note is that fighters each do it differently. People commonly mistake monks as a DPS class. While it is true that that they do miuch more damage than say a guardian or a knight, its far from what you would call great DPS, though it is passable as a very badly geared scout, very badly. They however didn't give up defense for the added DPS, as many people believe. the gave up other useful abilities that other classes have, but not tanking ability. Monk avoid as much damage as a knight or warrior mitigates. I all evens out. Any differences you see come from gear, skill, and the traits/traditions? that are chosen as they level up.<br />
<br />
As a guardian, I got protection buffs for my party members. Very good buffs in fact. I can save other party members from harm if I know what I'm doing. i don't tank any better than a berzerker or a shadowknight. the different classes got things to differentiate each other, but they all have the same ability to tank, because thats the fighters main purpose. We just each do it differently.<br />
<br />
I've been tanking in Varsoon's tonight and we had a monk 3 evels higher than me and the group wanted me to tank because I had higher AC. I told them flat out, not, the monk would tank. The group was a great success, with me protecting the monk, while watching caster agro. Luckly the MOnk was pretty well geared, so the Lack of DPS didn't matter so much. Also we had a shaman warding and fury that never had to heal. She nuked the whole time, because the monk wasn't taking much, if any, damage except on the very nastiest of pulls. With the monks avoidance, and my shielding and added defense to him was enough to almost completely remove any chance for the monks to damage the monk. It was a blast, I was very sad to have to leave for dinner. It was an awesome group.<br />
<br />
The monk didn't think he could tank, mainly because every group he's had in there had very bad setups, and he said the I was the first guardian to ever use my buffs on him. he said the different was astounding. I'll take hiw word for it, because he's been leveling there for the last 3 levels.<br />
<br />
The important thing ot remember is to always sue all the tools at your disposal. Mangle and Ruin are offense debuffs that most peope dont bother with unless they have extra refresh time to work with. Those debuffs actually work, as does the damage debuff on your ae taunt. make sure you run thorugh all your abilities and use them. The EQ devs seem to have went to great lengths to give us useful abilities in all situations, instead of like in EQ were most of your abilities were very situational.<br />

ok, I think thats all.</div></div><hr />
