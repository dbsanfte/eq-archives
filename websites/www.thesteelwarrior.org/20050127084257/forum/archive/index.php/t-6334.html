<br />
I've been a long time reader of the The Steel Warrior. My main character has been a level 65 Druid for ever, I've been playing everquest since the Tribunal Server has came out. I've always liked warriors and had numerous twinks of them in the past, but always concentrated on my druid. After a while of messing around with my druid in my small little guild with friends I got bored of EQ, so I took a few month vacation from it. <br />
<br />
I've come back to EQ yet again, but this time I want to do something a bit different. A bunch of friends got together and made little characters, I made a warrior of the group. We didnt twink until level 20 so we'd get some of an idea in playing the character. I got to level 25 on the newbie gear and items like that. Well after 25 I put some money into my warrior, not alot, most of the stuff I had, I had in the bank from various adventures with the big kids. <br />
<br />
Well to get to the bottom of this long winded question, what would you guys suggest as better alternatives to what I have now? I'm a frog warrior who worships Mith Marr. We all made frogs as our race just because the backflip was fun to see! We have 2 other non frogs in the group, but we dont hold that against them! I have about 150k to blow on this twink ( Mainly because this is the only twink that I have and will not make another) My idea's include getting a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt for better haste, but after that I'm not 100% sure. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help guys included is my Magelo!  Dont mind the name please, I know its dumb, but thats what you get when you make a character while being drunk and just getting done watching Kung Pow the movie! http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=976119<br />

thanks again!</div></div><hr />
