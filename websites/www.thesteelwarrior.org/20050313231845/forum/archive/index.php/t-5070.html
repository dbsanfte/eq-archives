Valdoon has an AE Drunk ability. With max or near max AT you are immune to the effect. It's a PoTime level LDoN raid (albeit probably by far the easiest of them all).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience, there are chests with this trap on it. It is 2 fold. First, it is a curse which drops all your stats down to the same level as if you had wulfed down 20 short beers. The second part is the actual 'drunk' effects. Eventually, the 'drunk effect' will where off like a normal drunk will. However, if you do not cure the curse, your stats will remain at 1 even though the tunnel vision/sway, and slurred speach will go away.<br />
<br />
I think the main reason to have 200AT is for the drunk effects to be nulled. The curse would still need to be cured or your stats will be at 'suck'.</div></div><hr />

But that only works if you had 200 AT before Kunark. Anything later and you're obviously just trying to fit in at parties. You probably dump the booze over your shoulder half the time, pussy!</div></div><hr />

Was me, another barb warrior, a dwarf cleric and a dwarf paladin.  Occasionally  others of our friends would join us. Nothing like being 14th level, pounding down about a stack of gnomish spirits, and pulling Peg Leg over to your group.  (sometimes things went south if the cleric overdid the drinking though).  <br />
PS: Never drink with a dwarf that brews his own booze.</div></div><hr />
