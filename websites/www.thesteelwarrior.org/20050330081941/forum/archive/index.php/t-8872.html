Seem to remember some old parses here or on the old board, but couldnt find em.  My guild are ready for trying her and im wondering what to expect.  Anything nice to know things about her or the script would be most welcome. BTW got 1889 AC(buffed without songs)and all def AAs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lower than Fenin, much lower , but tends to be just as dangerous because you cant put every healer on the MT.<br />
<br />
With 2Kish AC, she min hits like 50% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Busstin1</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What i like to do on Xeg is use Defensive at first and once your reuse time is over use Evasive, its a much faster reuse time about 3 mins faster than defensive or stonewall. Seriously she doesnt hit that hard though you have probably tanked single group GoD stuff that hits harder  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah bummer.  I just deleted most of my EQ stuff so I don't have the parses any longer.  It's been so long since I last fought her so I don't remember her DPS pre 1900ac and post 1900ac.. Maybe someone still playing the game will have some parses or remember the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going by memory... tanks my guild had were somewhere around 1950 AC at the time, I remember Xegony a little over 800 dps, Fennin was closer to 1100 dps vs. the same tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had 3 parses of Xegony in between the ranges of 2280 and almost 2400ac.  Her dps can vary a bit depending on the attentiveness of your bard, your buffs, your debuffers especially, and your own visual recognition that your Evasive disc is up (rofl).  I don't remember the absolute exact numbers of her dps the three times I tanked her for over 45 minutes, but they were in the 720 and 780dps range.  <br />
<br />
Even slowed, Xegony is a fast hitter, and her rampage is actually Flurry I'm pretty sure.  She also has a pretty wide hit distrubution, so AC and ATK debuffs make GIGANTIC differences in her dps.  Overall though, her dps is really no more than your average Fire/Water mini.  It just fluctuates a lot more, and you're tanking her more than half the time outside of a defensive type disc (Defensive/Evasive/Stonewall).  <br />
<br />
Fennin Ro's dps is actually a lot more than Xegony's, but on the same token, you only fight him for a fraction of the time.  He's also built differently than Xegony.  While Xegony's hit distribution is very wide (600s to 2400s), Fennin's is very small (1000s to 1900s).  Both, once slowed, hit at relatively the same speed (17 delay vs 18 delay)  His ATK really isn't all that high either, but because you're taking a minimum of 1000 damage per hit, as you're not in a point of the game where you'll have Shielding yet, they add up considerably.  Most of my parses show Fennin's dps in between 1050 and 1200 or so.  Because his minimum hit is so high, my guild has always used Evasive, and to astonishing success.  However, as we all know, Evasive tends to be a bit more streaky at times, and due to the fact that Fennin Ro is a relatively short fight (we down him in about 3-3.5 minutes now, ranged), it's really up to the luck of the RNG.  <br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, my last parse of him showed 909dps @ 17 delay.  I guess I got real lucky.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, perhaps I should elaborate on that a little more.  :)<br />
<br />
I play a cleric as my alt-main, and I take her wherever I go.  I also actively participates in the CH rotation about 95% of the time in my guild.  The third time I tanked Xegony, my cleric was #6 in the rotation if I remember correctly.  I was so focused on keeping Xegony perfectly positioned and not missing a beat in the rotation that I forgot my Evasive disc was up and ready for use.  Doh!  I didn't die, but there was probably a good 10 minutes of that fight I could have spent IN disc, when I wasn't.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time I actually parsed Xegony I had her at about 750 dps.  This was with around 2000 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodeus</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found an old Xegony parse from february : http://membres.lycos.fr/Odeus/eqparses/xegony-0216.html<br />
<br />
I had no time loots.<br />
<br />
I think was our fastest Xegony kill. One of our first Xeg kill took us like 40 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has done Xegony twice, once before we were in Time and once again after a month or so of farming Time. I tanked both, and at the first encounter I was around 2000 AC. With the second encounter I was at around 2250 pushing 2300 AC. Both encounters were maxxed defensive AA, maxxed melee stats. She was fully ATK debuffed both times (Cripple, Ro, and the necro debuff).<br />
<br />
Our first win her DPS was  826, not counting her AE which does affect things. Most hits were for 608 with a second peak at 564.<br />
<br />
Our second fight her DPS was 814, with the same pattern of hits.<br />
<br />
That said, our second fight was much easier, partially because I also had 1500 more HP roughly, and partially because we were just that much more experienced. We were also 9 minutes faster on the second win.<br />
<br />
I think I can confidently say that you won't see a significant reduction in her DPS past 2000 AC unless you throw in +shielding and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, just an amusing note, DPS from some mobs we've recently beaten in PoTime:<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule: 417 (not a typo, his DPS is gimpy)<br />
Tallon Zek: 1774 (not counting AE's!)<br />
Vallon Zek: 1405<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek is definitely the hardest thing I've tanked to date, and he's way harder than the DPS would seem to indicate because of the AE's. Look it up sometime if you want to have a good laugh. :)</div></div><hr />
