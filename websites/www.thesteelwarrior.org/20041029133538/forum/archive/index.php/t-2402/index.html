<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ele planes weapons with Elemental damage were changed. The ele dmg was removed and changed to straight damage. And some other stuff<br />
<br />
Ifir is 18/19. Was 17/19 +1fire<br />
Coirniav hammer is 19/20. Was 18/20 +1cold<br />
Dagger of Distraction from Time was upped to 18/20 and kept 3 cold dmg. Was 17/20 +3cold<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord made 38/35 from 34/31<br />
<br />
Monk/Bst Time 1H supposedly made 23/20. Was 21/19. It's proc was upped fromm 100 to 150hp. Had stun removed and -50atk added to it. And their 2H proc got upped from 150 to 200dmg with a bigger resist adjust and stun made to work on mobs up to 68.<br />
<br />
All I could find so far.<br />
<br />
Oh, and in Lucy Emp/Seru bane weapons have been de-baned. Nothing added at all.<br />
<br />
 Looks like they had a typo on the mnk/bst 1H. It's now 23/30 live=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">THANK GOD!<br />
<br />
No beastlord in their right might was going to use that Shinai with the stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hopefully these are NOT all of the promised melee upgrades...<br />
<br />
2 God drops in Elementals and POTime gear? That doesn't help the average melee type at all..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah but it helps the people who worked their ass off with flakey elemental dmg+1 bonuses.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty sure this isnt the upgrade, like you said, it'd suck for the average player who isnt elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and in Lucy Emp/Seru bane weapons have been de-baned. Nothing added at all.<br />
<br />
WTF... how do they expect people to kill emp/seru then... the only thing I can think of is they made those two hittable with any weapon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Razzinel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't need bane weapons to kill Seru.  It only needs one tank with aggro procs and several casters.  I have tanked Seru just fine without any bane weps (just BF and POI hammer dual wield.)<br />
<br />
The change to the Darkblade of the Warlord seems more like a downgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just comfirmed Emp bane weapons have no bane any longer on my char.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know you don't need Seru bane weapons to kill Seru. I've tanked Seru a few times myself with just Dual EB and no bane, and the rest of the melee standing around with their thumb up their rear while the casters do all the work.Iit's a lot longer and more annoying of a fight than it needs to be.<br />
<br />
The removal of needing bane to hit Seru will make the fight a hell of a lot easier, and cut the fight likely in half at least. It will also have the effect of making Seru a  MUCH more viable target for many guilds. If only casters can hit it... well, that's not much of a change for most raids that already killed Seru.<br />
<br />
The removal of needing bane to kill Emp will make the kill a bit faster, and make Emp an easier target. Making Emp only hittable via magical means will make the fight much more difficult, as he is already 100% magic resistant.<br />
<br />
Either way, this is a huge change for guilds at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The change to bane is probably a typo unless Seru/Emp no longer needs bane to be hit.<br />
<br />
Still no real incentive for warriors to DW besides for stats, and I guess for aggro if you happen to have a Darkblade of the Warlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lol wtf, they upgrade weapons left and right(ifir being the most common EP rogue weapon), and DOWNGRADE Darkblade from a 1.0977 ratio to a 1.08577 ratio?  <br />
<br />
There better be a hidden boost in proc rate to make up for that :p<br />
<br />
The difference in ripostes is probably so small so you wont be able to parse a difference.<br />
<br />
Props up on the boost to monk weapons though, they needed a boost. Rogues on the other hand imo did not(Ifir was fine for the difficulty of the encounter).<br />
 <br />
The 19/19 weapon they recently got also means less chance of any real fix for dual-wielders because any boost to dualwield would propel the DPS of very top end rogues too high.<br />
<br />
In fact rogues complicate the Dual Wield issue alot. Because lets assume they now after these changes have rogues doing the damage they want them to do. <br />
<br />
If they then later go and improve general damage for dualwielding(perhaps by adding offhand bonus) to bring warriors/ranger and monk dualwield damage &quot;in line&quot; with their 2-Hand weapons, then rogue DPS (once again) go over the top.<br />
<br />
I very much doubt that the once official SoE guideline(rogue=140, warrior=100 ratio) still holds true if you equip a rogue with the 19/19+quarm offhander and warrior with darkblade+quarm offhander. SoE run that through your &quot;combat simulator&quot; please, if there ever was one..<br />
<br />
Edit: Looks like I spoke too soon.. Seems they upgraded the Jagged Timeforged Blade to 20/19 as well. Almost makes you wonder if they re-hired Kendrick :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Well Rog dagger is now 20/19 rejoice!</div></div><hr />

Shinai was indeed a typo, and it's been changed to 23/20 as suggested</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where exactly did you get the idea that they no longer required bane to hit? The weapons are bugged, the mobs are the same. I tanked Seru the day of the patch, I did a total of 0 damage from melee over the course of about an hour fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd bet it's more like rogue 250 warrior 100 atm.<br />
<br />
Warrior with a top 2h (vanazir) can prolly crank out 160 DPS without disc on average.<br />
<br />
Rogues before the upgrade could crank out 220 maybe 230 DPS on average.<br />
<br />
230/160=1.4375  pretty close.<br />
<br />
for a rogue to be 250% of a warriors DPS, they would have to do 160 X 2.5 = 400 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bet you rogues can do more then that. 300 dps with bard and all, but it will also depend on constant good positioning.<br />
<br />
Still, I agree with Solinar that 250% is very unlikely :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You still need bane weapons to hit Emp/Seru. However, while the bane weapons were broken, my guild decided to kill emp anyway, it was a hella long fight, we should have gotten double lewts for that &gt;&lt;  Then of course they had to go and fix them the next day. They have bane damage again so its all good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Guildie tanked PoTime Bertox from the start last night with Vanazir. Zero agro problems. I had autoattack on with BoW from a couple of seconds after her, didn't turn attack off once, and didn't turn him once. Course, when the other warrior died, I was instantly summoned hehe, but I was expecting that. I was testing the Vanazir agro. Passed with flying colors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">nice! any idea how the dps compares to a BoW?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sindael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">please pardon my ignorance on the subject, but how is going from 18 damage to 17+1 fire an upgrade in damage?<br />
 isnt the fire damage resistable, thus decreasing avg damage output?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It went from 17+1 to 18. Thats how its an upgrade. You've got it right, just the order of events wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sindael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">ahh ok. thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Bet you rogues can do more then that. 300 dps with bard and all, but it will also depend on constant good positioning.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact they can.<br />
<br />
Its not, however, average.  I can crank out damn near 300 DPS with full ATK buffs, bard, and aggressive, but in the same conditions the very next fight I will get only 200 DPS.<br />
<br />
People too often throw out DPS they have seen on particular fights as &quot;average&quot; when its really just the results of that one fight that can be wildly skewed.<br />
<br />
Have your rogues parse their damage repeatedly.  They get some good numbers sometimes, but sometimes they dont, and the average is not all that impressive.<br />
<br />
Both monks and rogues have gotten screwed on DPS (their top priorities) in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Im sure rogues can average close to 300</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enough with the conspiracy theory.  The entire PoP was badly itemized for DW versus 2H.  Knights happen to benefit because they cannot dual wield at all.  Every DW class (minus rogue who cannot use 2H) has vastly inferior DW options relative to 2H, but apparently people at SoE decide they're equal.  Rangers, Warriors, and Monks that do not have Staff of Transcendence do significantly less damage with their DW counterparts.  <br />
<br />
Greatblade of Chaos is 1.6 ratio while the monk Staff of Transcendence is 1.8.  There's no doubt in my mind that SoE actually believes Darkblade of Warlord + another weapon (say Edge of Eternity) is equal to a 1.7ish weapon even though it is not.  If you look at the weapons superficially, DBoW is 1.1, and add say an EoE on offhand, it stands to reason it can function at at least 0.6 so you've 1.7.  Sure you don't get the damage bonus on the offhand and 2H in general has slightly more damage bonus, but that's supposed to be balanced by the extra stats from 2 weapons.  <br />
<br />
Of course that's not how it actually works out but I can easily see why SoE would believe it works that way.  If you don't actually parse the weapons, you'd think putting 2 ratio 1 weapons together ought to be better than a 1.7.</div></div><hr />
