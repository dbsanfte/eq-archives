<br />
if any of ya have the data/images or the links to the original posts of Sscaley's parses (and subsequent others) of LR, ID, and so on, feel free to drop me or one of the other mods a PM and we'll add the parses to this forum. Thanks! -Isk<br />

Okay, I caved in and parsed my logs (nothing like patch day, eh?). I had a slew of logs from when I had just gotten PoP and was exping in HoH on the guards/guardians there. Those two have *exactly* the same combat characteristics with regard to hit/miss-% and damage distribution, so I compiled a bunch of log entries from those types from when I had CA3/CS3/LR1/ID0 and then I grouped up a bunch of logs from after I bought LD5 and ID5, but basically keep in mind that my LR data starts with me having LR1, not LR0 and the ID data starts with me at 0 - so there is some discrepancy in the results, but I feel they are good enough to convince me anyway.<br />
<br />
  <br />
Raw Data ----- LR1 --------- LR5 -----<br />
swings    39,573 (100.0%)   6,272 (100.0%)<br />
hits      21,182  (53.5%)   3,178  (50.7%)<br />
misses    12,701  (32.1%)   2,202  (35.1%)<br />
dodges     1,634   (4.1%)     260   (4.1%)<br />
parries    2,254   (5.7%)     355   (5.7%)<br />
ripostes   1,820   (4.6%)     277   (4.4%)<br />
<br />
<br />
I grouped the hits by their respective number and sorted all kicks and bashes out since they distort the image. I'll spare you the listing of them, because the histogram speaks for itself:<br />
<br />
Valorian Guards/Guardians have the following charactaristics:<br />
<br />
BD = 101.9<br />
DI = 22.1<br />
Min hit = 124<br />
Max hit = 544<br />
<br />
At ID0 - their average hit on me was 8.38 DI, that translates to 287<br />
At ID5 - their average hit on me was 7.68 DI, that translates to 272<br />
<br />
Which is to say, that going from ID0 to ID5 (on Valorian Guards in HoH) will net you an average 15hp/hit mitigation - which is roughly 15/2.87 = 5.2% decrease in damage taken. Given the linearity of ID cost, I'd wager a round of beer that it's intended to give you ~1% of damage per skill level (or ~4% for an increase from DI1 to DI5, for comparison).<br />
<br />
Going from LR1 to LR5 will increase your avoidance by 3%, from 32% misses to 35% misses. Miss+Hit at LR1 is 85.6% of the swings, while Miss+Hit at LR5 is 85.8% of swings. 32% of 85.6% is 37.4% of damage avoided while 35% of 85.8% is 40.8% of damage avoided - or about a 4%-point increase in damage avoided.<br />
<br />
From this little test, I would hypothesise that ID and LR are about the same efficiency in reducing total damage taken - however, LR will make you get hit less which can affect any innate proc related additional damage/stuns.</div></div><hr />
