<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a level 61 (human) warrior (RZ deity) currently using the following 1h weapons (haven't decided on the best combo yet):<br />
<br />
Wavecrasher - 9/19 with a 20% slow proc<br />
<br />
Frostbringer - 12/22 with an AC and HP debuffer proc<br />
<br />
Lurid Dagger - 12/20 with an AC debuffer proc<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild can usually muster between 20 and 25 people for a typical raid night, average level about 59.<br />
<br />
My question is, what 1-handed weapons would we be capable of getting to with the raid force above, that are better than what I already have?  I'm looking at raids that take no longer than 4 hours max.</div></div><hr />

That mob should be doable in the lv 61~65 range.  POI dragon should be doable and that has a taunting blow proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">with 25 people and they maybe never tried vindi/statue yet; than AoW will be a nightmare for first timers.<br />
<br />
might want to look more towards getting some equipment pgrades for your guildies ( depending on what you all got ) [u]plus[/b] start the route most of us went through to proep those later stages...farm the HoT armours, make Vindi Runs, Hit up Rumblecrush in UP, try some other minibosses up on the moon ( Grieg, IV ) ... than progress through.<br />
<br />
But when my old guild started out in HoT we wer emostl 55-60 and about the same armour/weapon wise as you are...it takes time and practice practice practice !!<br />
but once you get the strats down and guild equipped better than try the bigger stuff with the smaller raid force you have available. you'll be better prepared for it.<br />
<br />
what you have though no w is good enough to get going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What 1-handed weapons is this raid force capable of getting that would improve my ability as an MT holding aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">go kill vaniki in DN<br />
<br />
goto chardok B, get the stun weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chardok B<br />
Vaniki (DN)<br />
Exiled (Ssra , the BBoE is INSANE)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are always the two stun proccing weapons in the new Droga as well.  I have heard many good things about them, and you could probably even one group camp them.  Sword of the Bloodsworn (1HS) and Copper Hammer of Striking (1HB) or something to that effect.  There are quite a few threads on them lately, and both drop in the same area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBoE = Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled.  Has a 90 some dmg stun proc and a nice ratio.  However given the makeup of your raid force, willsapper off of Vaniki is one of your best bets for a nice aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThanAlhazred</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me they could also go into CT and get the trigger stuff to spawn the Horror.  Horror Shard Claw isn't bad 13/17 and a 125dd cold proc, as some AC and HP also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoW is not really an option I'd say...20-25 lvl 59 avg would be almost a guaranteed waste of attempt. Possible but not likely IMO.<br />
<br />
For dps the disembowler off Shade in PoN is an easy grab. The claws from the croc in PoN is a quick grab too while yer there. The hammer in PoI of xanamech is also a nice taunter for the ease. The new Droga drops will be cake for you.<br />
<br />
All I can think of for now...but there are quite a few I'm sure ppl can point u toward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vaniki in DN for a Willsapper or Droga for the hammer and 1hs.  Other than that, I think you would wipe on AOW with average lvl of 59 and 20-25 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qris</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some decent weapons off of Tawro and Radir in UP i think :p  Could take them out with that force easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now the VERY BEST bang for the buck for argo weapons is Droga for your lvl and the caves in UP for non-argo weapons.  Also take a look in the bazaar GSoT's are down to 5k on some severs thats one hell of a good argo weapon, also take a look at WMBS very good 2hs non-argo for 10-15k better damage then a windy at 10k less.   Someone else already talked about HOT but I think we all need to do are time there for more then one reason.<br />

Thats good general advice Shikarii but it didn't answer my question.<br />
Helps for me to put in the quote tags since it was partly in response to weoden ;); but the rest still applies. YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't sound like AoW or PoI dragon are within reach for you yet, so it makes the choice VERY simple. Get a single group and do Droga king/pool camp. 2 of the best pre-EB agro weapons drop there and the camp is insanely easy for the reward.<br />
<br />
Copper hammer of striking (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62186) - 13/20 + 179dd+ 0 sec stun<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188)  - 12/19 + 75dd+ 0 sec stun up to lvl 65<br />
<br />
These weapon own. I currently weild a Copper hammer and a Dragonrib club and my warrior has no agro problems even in the all 65 groups he tanks for usually.<br />
<br />
The only tradeable 1h weapons you are going to find are SoD and BoC, so this combo should last you a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also do the named up in BoT. They drop a few nice weapons (Greatstaff of Thunder, Shortblade of Lightning, Great Staff of the Four winds, Great Blade of Storms, Wicked Shank, Wind-worn Handblade, etc.), but also spell turn-in scrolls and runes, as well as the odd Ornate armor pattern/mold.<br />
<br />
Lower tower nameds are 1-2 group doable, upper tower nameds may take 20-25, depending on the mix of classes and experience.</div></div><hr />
