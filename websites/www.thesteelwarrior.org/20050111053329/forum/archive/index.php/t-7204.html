VDD(can aug with anger3, have the points)<br />
BoC + Anger2<br />
Shield of Strife.<br />
<br />
My delima is this:  Should I augment the VDD with Anger3 and use it for normal everyday tanking, and just use BoC + Shield for boss mob tanking?  I know the optimal boss mob tanking setup is Shield + Darkblade, but I'm pretty low on the list for one atm.  I should be able to pick up an EoE with relative ease though.  So how should these 3 setups be listed in overall tankability?<br />

VDD(Anger3) &gt; EoE+Shield &gt; BoC+Shield?<br />
<br />
EoE+Shield &gt; VDD(Anger3) &gt; BoC+Shield?<br />
<br />
EoE+Shield &gt; BoC+Shield &gt; VDD(Anger3)?<br />
<br />
I really dunno if I should turn my VDD into an aggro weapon or just make it a DPS weapon and wait.  Like I said I'm about 2-4 warriors down from getting a Darkblade most likely, and we all know what the drop rate on em is like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about picking up a JoS too?<br />
JoS + EoE, both anger auged, should be a decend dps + hate combo, also for boss tanking and leaves you the shield for offhanding after you built upenough aggro. As you said, putting A3 on the VDD would pretty much destroy it as a dps weapon versus bossmobs when your not tanking. Btw i doubt auged BoC and shield of strife would be sufficient aggro for most tanking situations, same with EoE + shield.</div></div><hr />

Maybe get a Darkblade too, would be nice combo with eoe/jos<br />
<br />
Fuck the droprate =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said (and please jump in if yas think I'm dead wrong), in your position I'd put Force of YKesha on the VDD and try to get a Symbol of the Planesmaster asap (unless you have Aten gloves already). It &quot;should&quot; generate enough aggro with Incite for you to squeek by for awhile and not be useless as a dps weapon when not MTing or when you get better. Get an SK to give you a Kick Me buff until you get a Raex BP.<br />
<br />
Then I would get the EoE if it's easy for you. You can try the EoE and BoC, but I'm not sure you'll like how it works out. You'll just have to wait for a DBoW.<br />
<br />
I've tried a shield only a couple of times and once was a disaster. Maybe things have changed, but afaic shields are Magelo+ and nothing more.<br />

The worst thing you can possibly do is waste dkp on weapons.  Armor is far more important to a warrior assuming you can aggro effectively.  I assume you dont tank much in your guild since you arnt high on the totem pole for dbotw, and sos was probably dirt cheap because normally they are hard to give away so i personally would stick with the vanazir.  If you are going to tank a bit more i would wait for the dbotw assuming your aggro is ok with the boc.  The decision really lies in how much you feel you are going to tank.   As for auging, the only weapons i would aug with anger 3 in time are VDD and DBotW.  I wouldnt waste it on eoe, or even waste a loot on it since it really gains you nothing used in tandem with the shield.<br />
<br />
Oh and i agree with chidder, if you can get a frenzy do it, and wait for a dbotw.</div></div><hr />

You know you are eventually going to get a DBotW. You know that the majority of the time you will be dual weidling the darkblade + EoE/JoS. If you have access to a JoS then take it, otherwise loot the next EoE and offhand it with the BoC mainhand. BoC is ass for DPS, but EB+A3 is still the best agro proc set up you will get until you get a darkblade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While i disagree on the principle (18 slots dedicated to tanking, 2 dedicated to agro).<br />
In his case,  getting more weapons is a waste.<br />
<br />
Keep VDD &amp; A3 as main tanking weapon (I have BoW+A3 and ZERO complains)<br />
<br />
Keep BoC+SoS for add tanking (useless otherwise if u ask me Burning &gt;&gt; All)<br />
<br />
You have enough Agro &amp; Weapons to keep you OK agrowise for a long long time.<br />
Get some Tanking gear.<br />
<br />
And if by some miracle a DBoW drops (and you can get it) and never regret it.<br />
Until that day, loot armor , and remember , you have the best War 2H in the game.</div></div><hr />

  Jesus christ, why is it people suddenly think that BFs drop like candy? It's true; cursed cycle isn't very hard anymore. That was NEVER the big problem with cursed, at least since PoP. The problems are that it's a heavily contested spawn because of the number/quality of drops, AND that the damn BF almost never drops. My guild killed cursed some 40+ times for 3 BFs. Sure, it's great in theory for a couple groups of Time equiped people to go run back and kill cursed for the very low chance of the *1* item they'd use. In reality, it's just not going to happen. Once a week mobs that most every raiding guild can kill that drop the most accessible, best warrior aggro weapon pre-Time are NOT easy to come by.<br />
<br />
  On to the original post... Don't use your shield unless you're really worried about dying for some reason, and only switch it in when defensive is down. Just anger 3 the VDD and go with it. If you get a DBotW, augment it and your EoE and be happy forever.</div></div><hr />

The problem with doing that is that he is going to get ass raped tanking.  Even with sos equiped he is just over 1800 ac, which doesnt cut it by a long shot in time.  Now assume he is using a boc and eoe combo, thats going to drop him another 100+ ac down to 1700ish, which is bad even by elemental standards + the extra riposte dmg from dw.</div></div><hr />

EoE main + boc offhand is better aggro then an aug'd vdd.  If you dont have an EoE yet i'd just use a3 vdd.  Its a good amount of aggro until you get a dbotw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PinaduzRZ</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stick with VDD and spend your dkp points on elemental BP (effect Echo of Anger = 15% aggro modifier).  VDD is a good tanking weapon in PoP and you can augment it with Yekisha or Rujak Venom so it will still be a useful dps weapon.   <br />
<br />
Pick up DBoW, EoE, or JoS when you can.  Seems like every time we killed RZ DBoW dropped, so every guild warrior, twink, and recruit got one, but rot still got more.  As a tank I've always placed more importance on survivability (gear) than on weapons.  <br />
<br />
I do most of the main tanking for my guild and have never had a problem holding aggro using VDD (augmented rujak venom).  Recently I changed my setup to DBoW and JOS (both augmented anger 3).  The new setup generates more aggro, but as I said, I never had problems establishing or losing aggro using VDD.  I still switch back to VDD when we're doing Time because of the ripostes on dual wield.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you in your progression through Time and GoD.<br />

<br />
Pick up some armor if you can, aggro wont help too much if your dead<br />
<br />
If a JoS or EoE drops and NO one else need sit, pick it up and use it with BoC for DPS.<br />
<br />
If by then your tanking a lot, and DBOTWL are doing their noramlly shitty droprate and your far in line for it, pick up The other side of EoE/JoS (IE get both) if your close to getting a DBOTWL or have a good chance, then save for that<br />
<br />
Eventually you might get a DB, when that happens A3 aug both DB, and EoE, use shield once you feel aggro is secure (Either after disc fades, or a little bit before depending on aggro/healing situation, really gotta get a feel for it)</div></div><hr />

Went ahead and put A3 on VDD and love it.  I'm really surprised at what a great tanking weapon it is.  Doesn't have the &quot;snap&quot; aggro that I'd like but it seems to be great sustained aggro. :)</div></div><hr />
