<br />
No, shielding only lowers the DB, which means 1% shielding is never 1% damage reduction (it can be close depending on the mob).<br />
<br />
Avoidance like you said is in fact 10 = 1.0% fewer hits, which should equate to 1% less damage overall.<br />
<br />
It's sort of like the difference between defensive and evasive.  Shielding takes a little off of each hit, while avoidance means you avoid a small percentage of hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah , <br />
hrmm  im thinking more of the net effect <br />
<br />
lets say you are hit 100 times at an averadge of 1000hp per hit <br />
total dam taken is 100,000<br />
<br />
with avoidance 10 you would be hit 99 of that 100 times<br />
total dam taken 99,000<br />
<br />
with shield 1% you would take 100 of 100 hits for 99 %<br />
total damage taken 99,000<br />
<br />
end result the same , but different way to get there?<br />
<br />
what im getting at is i may have undervalued avoidance when going in on items, atm i have none but sitting pretty well on shielding mods( bp, q bracer,bert legs, necklace of visions)<br />
 ..<br />
<br />
for the means of selecting gear to go in on , would one consider avoidance 10 a fair trade off for a 1 percent shield mod?<br />
<br />
if u could chose one or the outher ,, would u chose 1 % shield or 10 percent avoidance?<br />
<br />
<br />
1% shield&gt;10 avoidance?<br />
10 avoidance &gt;1 % shield?<br />
i understand its apples to ornges but for the sake of argument</div></div><hr />

As a rule of thumb avoidance is always &gt; shielding.  Its very hard to gauge though.  Take for example quarm who has a db of 1k.  I have 14 shielding 30 avoidance, so he will have roughly a lower hit % on me by 3% as compared to a warrior with 0 avoidance.  These hits can range anywhere from 3660 to 600ish, i forget what his min hit is.  But there is no way to see what the actual damage avoided is, although you could parse him and take the average hit times (.03 x the number of swings).  This would give you and estimate of the total damage value of all missed attacks directly attributed to avoidance.  Compare that to shielding 14, where every attack he lands deals 140 less damage than a warrior with 0 shielding.  Multiply 140 by his total number of claws(i believe) since his bash and kick really isnt anything significant.  Once you have these two figures you can compare the forcast damage avoided with avoidance 30 and the actual damage avoided through sheilding 14.  You also have to realize that the effects of shielding are lessened the higher your avoidance is, because obviously shielding doesnt effect a miss.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that you need to look at how shielding works.  Shielding does not reduce damage by 1%, like ever, it only reduces DB 1%, every swing, which means it varies from mob to mob how much each percent does.  Avoidance does not vary in that regard so some may consider it better.<br />
<br />
Which they prefer is different from person to person.  Both are useful just in different ways.  For me, I prefer shielding, since first it isn't a very fair comparison to compare 10 avoidance to 1% shielding since most items have 2-5% shielding, and I'd rather have a per hit damage reduction, than avoid a swing rarely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well not getting hit was always better than getting hit for less.<br />
<br />
However i dont totally agree with you aspit.<br />
While mathematically 30 avoidance will bring greater results that lets say 10% shielding on a 1k-3k mob.<br />
<br />
The advantage shielding has is its enables you to soak up damage.<br />
I prefer taking 100 less per hit (which is a big deal since it takes usually 6-12 hits to get me killed).<br />
Than gaining 3% raw more avoidance.<br />
<br />
Dunno maybe its a sideeffect of having played Wherewolf :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the way i see it is that with a stroke of bad luck you'll get hit a lot of times for a lot of damage die before any heals reach you. this you want to avoid.<br />
<br />
with avoidance you lower the statiscal chance of this happening to you. but it can/will still happen, just need worse luck.<br />
<br />
with shielding you get hit a lot of times for a little less damage than you otherwise would have.<br />
<br />
but if the trend of GoD mobs having small db and big di continues i guess avoidance might be worth a bit more than it was at first attributed, which just leaves us with another question;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Who says 10 avoidance = 1% more total evasion? How can you parse that? Couldnt it be that avoidance just add's more AC and thats why you take less dmg, couldnt you just put a 20ac aug on your equip and come up with the same result?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you can switch out items with same ac values and record that avoidance does infact increase your chance to avoid attacks (aka. 'misses you').</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since you only get hit 50% of the time (roughly), 1% more avoided is actually 2% less damage taken (49/50).  So, on a 10K HP warrior, 1% damage avoided is the same as having 200 more HP.<br />
<br />
The effect is even more significant under evasive if the amount you avoid from avoidance is constant, i.e. if you get hit say 33% under evasive, then (32/33) = 3% less damage taken, or 300 HP on 10K HP warrior.  However, since there are mobs with elevated to hit in GoD, avoidance won't work quite as well on them.<br />
<br />
Shielding and Avoidance both factor into survivability.  It is really not practical to talk about spikes anyway because the only conclusion you can get when worrying about spikes is no warrior should ever be alive.  I view both ways as effectively increasing the HP I have, and if I get one rounded, then that's just the way it is.  I try to get both, though haven't had much luck with avoidance (probably shouldn't have taken a Deathwrap of Rites... maybe I'll blow some DKP on the near rot Plat Cloak and rot VZ range).<br />
<br />
For sake of simplicty, let's say a mob hits 1k-3k, 50% hit rate, on a 10K HP warrior.  Then each avoidance = 20 HP (1% avoided = 200 HP = 10 avoidance).  Assuming that a warrior never dies in less than one round (because it'd be utterly pointless to tank such a mob if it can kill you in 3 hits), we'll assume you can expect to take 4 hits before getting a heal, then each shielding % = 40 HP.  Of course, shielding's effect is lessened when you don't take 4 hits in between heals, due to whatever reason (usually due to the mob missing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
From everything I have read, Avoidance does add AC.  But it is Avoidance AC, which is only added via base class/race avoidance, class bonus avoidance (monks), AGI based AC (avoidance AC), and +avoidance items.<br />
<br />
A 20 AC augment (and every other way to gain AC) only adds mitigation AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i parsed 0 avoid vs 30 avoid in time about 2 weeks ago on every mob.  The difference in my ac was roughly 100 less with 0 avoid, but the hit% on mobs was around 3% less hit% on each and ever mob regardless of no disc, evasive, or defensive up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">K think its a bit more clear now I always thought AC helped chances to completely avoid as well as mitigate though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">K think its a bit more clear now I always thought AC helped chances to completely avoid as well as mitigate though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raw AC (from armor) only affects how hard the hit is, i.e. the more AC you have the more often you see minimum hits vs. max hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You also have to realize that the effects of shielding are lessened the higher your avoidance is, because obviously shielding doesnt effect a miss.<br />
<br />
Aspit, with that logic shielding lessens the impact of avoidance, because avoiding a hit for 2860 is not as useful as avoiding a hit for 3000  :p <br />
<br />
You have to realize the effects are compounded and have diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />
