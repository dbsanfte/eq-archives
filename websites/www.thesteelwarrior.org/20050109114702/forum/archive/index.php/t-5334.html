I heard he has been extremely beefed up to the point of being really hard.  Ive seen his new loot table and he has some nice things, like that really nice back item.  Also, my wife follows Bristlebane and she was wondering if you get bad faction for killing him like if you would if you killed Tunare?  She said it would really suck bad if she couldnt use her Faithstone anymore.</div></div><hr />

With the number of people you're limited to do him with, I'd say he's at least harder than Fennin Ro.  Most of his abilities are obvious, like if his hands speed up he's going to flurry, and so on and the order of his powerups is random.</div></div><hr />
