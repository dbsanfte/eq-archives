<br />
2 aa away from rampage, level 65. 6400 hps unbuffed.<br />
<br />
65 Cleric Shaman that I can bot or have a friend run.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this possible, or should we just do the Caller cycle?<br />
<br />
Plan is to get as many AA's as fast as possible with the least amount of work, also LDON AP's wouldnt be bad since 40hp augs and 10ac augs are nice...<br />
<br />
<br />
If planning on doing 100+ AA in Caller cycle, is it worth deleveling to do it? If so how far? I'm guessing its possible to level up pretty fast doing this as well...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edarila</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at 65 if you can get every mob in the dungeon bunched up correctly, you could do it.  Anything less than 40 - 50 mobs and you are going to need another war or two to do it at the same time to make sure they all die.</div></div><hr />

And rather against the whole nature of the game?  I appreciate it's not doing anyone any harm, but surely Sony must feel it's unreasonable?<br />

Perhaps it's just me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theoretically it is, but when you look at the success rate, the fact that really not many people do it, and the fact that the earthshaker doesn't drop anymore, it's not really a very serious problem.  If anything I could see them nerfing the caller ring so if the mobs aren't engaged after a couple minutes the ring despawns or something, but anywhere else the shakerpage is barely doable for faction farming, and not really all that effective for exp at all.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it's officially considered a problem, but as long as it's been out with no changes to it, I assume that SOE decided that it's not a big enough problem to bother nerfing it.</div></div><hr />

Thats just to get enough handins. At 65 it was great xp if i kicked the two other from grp. And it was very relaxing. Slow-log on bard-hand in-read a book for 10 mins-shake-repeat.  Probably did 4+ AAs pr hour. As soon as i hit 66, all slowed down. I moved to Nadox and learned to pull all the luggalds and undead, aprox 160 mobs, which gave 10%ish normal xp all the way to 70(solo), after resurection(i died after each pull, 5-10 survivors each time).<br />
 After i hit 70 i havent found a good spot to shake for xp.  Have tried to pull PoV, but its hard and you need everything that moves. First time i tried i got all the kos mobs i found in all the zone, and managed to kill only one skelly in that train.  All the trees and the lag from the train makes pulling even worse.<br />

160 Mobs  ! yikes... 10% exp means 10 pulls per level , so 50 pulls to get to 70, 8,000 mobs dead O.o</div></div><hr />
