Should I care? Should I die and start it? Your info. is need, a little help her for Mr. Dumas Please:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want it for the accomplishment of completing your epic then it's worth it.<br />
<br />
If you want it to use as a weapon, no there are much better weapons for both dps and aggro available in the bazaar or easily camped in a few hours as opposed to the weeks of work the epic can take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Batem Tuhates</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, the epic is only good prestige now. There are too many good weapons out there. But if you are just looking for the challenge and want a feeling of accomplishment go for it =)<br />
<br />
Edit: De javu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior epic is better than the mystical staff of prosperity you have in your magelo.<br />
<br />
But, you'd probably do better to get something like a War Marshall's Bladed Staff, or Copper Hammer of Striking ... or Sword of the Bloodsworn maybe?<br />
<br />
Or Honed Blade of the Ykesha.<br />
<br />
Or Frostbringer.<br />
<br />
Maybe toss a Blackened Acrylia Blade in your offhand. It's good DPS.<br />
<br />
Or the Vampire Hunter's Stake (anger 1 proc, decent enough damage).<br />
<br />
At level 55 you can equip the Greatstaff of Thunder, and that's a pretty good weapon for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean die and start it, in order to get a Red Scale from Naggy?  <br />
<br />
If so, there's no need.  Red Scales can also drop from Talendor in Skyfire and from Nortlav in the Hole. <br />
<br />
Should you care?  Only if you want them for looks really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did my epic when it was still a good weapon to wield (back in velious when people had just started doing ntov). I say go for it if you have the patience to put in all the hours to get the pieces. It's really more for showmanship than usefulness now days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If ya actually care to want it, then do it. Having the option of swappin it out doesnt hurt imo. Of course, I can't wait to have the option myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kardein</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, then I can do this quest anytime? If so, I will do it when I get to a higher level. I don't want to miss the oppertunity to get my epic. I should work on my leveling as much as I can. If I don't need to be level 52 to start the quest, then I will wait. Info. is always welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shmashed</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to not care about my epic, but that changed somewhere along the line.  Even I had cared at 52 I dont think I would stop xping for weeks and weeks to work my way up a list to get a red scale drop.<br />
<br />
Im told the guy in the Hole you can kill for a red scale isnt too hard with two enchanters chain runeing, Im going to see if thats the case soon enough.  Anyone know much about this guy btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Hole's been revamped recently. I don't know much about the new Nortlaav at all, except that his location is in front of the pool, and not in the corner where the old Norty used to be. They both conned indifferent to my brell worshipping rogue, when not hiding or sneaking. The old Norty was just like fighting Venril.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when i started my warrior all my friends were telling me that the epic was one of the hardest to do.  so i never really concentrated on getting it.  i just gradually picked up pieces as i went along, when we raided Hate, i got a piece, same as Fear and Plane of Air.  I never camped mobs for the soul purpose of getting epic drops.  i got a red dragon scale from helping with cleric epic and my green dragon scale when someone noticed Severilous up, my chardok drop came from helping with cleric epic.....eventually i got all the pieces i needed and got my epic...used it for a few weeks and got a BOC.  Now my epics are banked and only time i pull em out is when i am taking screenshots or for nostalgia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior epic is only useful if:<br />
<br />
<br />
 You want it for role-playing purposes<br />
 You want to embark on a quest of epic proportions for a sense of accomplishment<br />
 You want to look awesome when your bazaaring/running through zones. The glow really impresses the newer folks :D<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want it because its a &quot;good&quot; weapon, don't bother. There are MUCH better weapons out there, and the best (affordable) dual wield combo goes for less than 25k total (if you don't know what they are, go look up &quot;Copper Hammer of Striking&quot; and &quot;Sword of the Bloodsworn&quot;). Last I checked, the scales costed at least that 25k EACH, and if you've got a solid group of friends you can go camp the weapons in droga for fun and profit.<br />
<br />
If for some reason your too poor to buy them and dont have any friends to camp the weapons, you can level yourself to 55 and buy a Greatstaff of Thunder for less than 100 PP. Its a solid agro weapon, I use it and its more than enough for me, and it'll only get better once I stuff an anger proc in it.</div></div><hr />
