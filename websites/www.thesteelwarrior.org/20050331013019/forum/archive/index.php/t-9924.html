I bet you'd be hard pressed to find alot of NEWER peeps in the better guilds with VT or Sleepers keys...or even if they care about them for that matter. Seems like all the focus is on getting to EP then Time and all the &quot;old world&quot; zones have been put on the back burner where the pilot lights been out for a year or so huh? Might as well just erase these zones or put some revamp into em' to arouse curiousity (hint hint). Why go back and get a new guildy VT keyed if your working on Time. I just feel the roots of the game, the zones that we dreamed about getting to, are no more because you can single group pretty decent  gear now in the newer expansions....just my 2cp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT is still very decent lootwise, the drawback is the time sink. Ssra gives great aggro weapon (BF can compete with time+ weapon). <br />
but Sleeper tomb seams too old now; same for old planes (fear, hate, sky), they are surely out of PC... and same for Kunark (except VP since it is revamped).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroalak</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We farmed Ssra for 3 months this summer while working on VT keys.  Killed Emp in the begining of august.  killed maybe 10 named mobs in ssra before starting our push in PoP.  3 weeks ago we killed RZtw and this week killed solro to open fire.<br />
<br />
Ssra was a good training ground for the guild and alot of gear to help the guild.  We basically skipped VT to try flagging and eached EP with no problem.  The older zones are just no longer needed to reach EP and beyond.  VT allows you to reach EP with fewer people if you spend time clearing VT to gear up the guild.  But with the release of oow its easier to gear up by killing targets such as Velk in Wos then to farm VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doirche</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kael is still farmed quite regularly on The Rathe as well as SSRA for BoC and BF. Hell, I even see some quilds farming Sebilis from time to time too. Most of our top end guilds pretty much stay in OOW now. GoD zones are filled with cobwebs except for the occasional jaunt for Epic mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The weekend before i quit, myself and 6 close friends including my roomate cleared from zin to the bottom of ST and killed all 4 Ancients.   I'd never been down there before.  It was hands down the most fun and rewarding EQ experience to this date.<br />
<br />
On a side note ... practically everything rotted  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still want to go to ST and get an avatar weapon of some kind :( May just get that sometime since we just stomped AoW (slowly, damn that guy has a lot of hp) Saturday and I got a shard of hsagra's talisman from the statue (woot!) From what I know, Kael is still farmed regularly on our server as well (AoW for BoC + 30 ac ring, helmet all come to mind) and King Tormax too (velium encrusted gauntlets, his crown too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are three guilds currently who raid VT/Ssra. Two guilds still raid ToV. Rest are Ele+.<br />
<br />
Though the other night took like 12 people and cleaned fear + ct lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raiding ToV seems like a waste gear-wise.  You can get better stuff in the bazaar or exp grouping in OoW.  It was fun though, gotta love killing dragons.  Makes me wonder why no one did the new Veeshan's Peak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roanne Lefaye</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience has been when the level cap was 65, many guilds considered the time sink to key and farm VT gear worthy with the grand scheme of getting through the elemental planes.  Now that 5 more levels and higher spell lines are available to compensate for what used to come from VT gear, the farming balance of time:benefit will likely shift to the elemental planes (especially with backflag quests being added) to get people geared to handle the OoW endgame.<br />
<br />
I know there are lots of cases of guilds still spending time in the lower zones, but as more and more people are reaching level 70, there will come a time when one or two groups will farm VT (and Ssra by inclusion) and guilds/raids as a whole wont consider it worth the time on a grand scale.<br />
<br />
Just my prophecy for what its worth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trueda</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT=Alt farming zone now.  Any of the older zones that have ok loot are farmed if the items are tradeable.  Everything else is a case of being bored and in the mood to be old school.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the old world zones are much less crowded (sometimes empty), but lots of factors are at work here.  <br />
<br />
1.  Less players due to other games.<br />
2.  More zones in EQ so players are spread more thinly.<br />
3.   Player level is going up and hitting higher level zones.<br />
<br />
Not all is doom and gloom.  Pok sems very empty these day, but I have come to the realization when I look at my guild roster that not many guildies are sitting in pok, they are off doing stuff.  It seems to me that I have very little idle time in EQ.  Grouping, rading, factioning, questing, trade skills, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Late Sunday night 3-4 guildmates were on low-50s alts looking for something to do for an hour. I was on a 56 War, but we had no healing (bst, ranger, bard). Couple of the players are fairly new to the game and had never seen Karnors (heh) and one of them wants to do Venril eventually, so we went there for a lark.<br />
I expected it to be empty, but there were at least 2 groups of low-to-mid 50s players at the zoneline. We set up to the left along the moat to be out of their way. <br />
What was odd was, they kept training themselves, and after a while we realized that they had been on a raid trying to kill Venril in one form or another. They'd wiped and were trying to recover their corpses--hence the trains. So we joined the raid and helped 'em clear in a ways, although before we got all the way in they found a necro to come summon.<br />
It took me a long time to figure out what was going on because it's pretty rare to see that low a level group of people attempting a target that would be difficult for them without some big guns for back up.<br />
So, you never know. I'd have thought that perhaps outside of Vox &amp; Naggy, no low 50s-level raiding was being done, but I guess it still happens a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I also think that the fact that a lot of instanced zones existing now a days factors in.  That takes a number of groups away from the public eye into their own private areas where you never run into them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hydra'd Cursed, XTC and AL for my friends gimp to gear him up fast, then went over to greig, then itraer vius, then restless burrower, then thought horror - fun stuff with 6/7 people Though all the zones were empty when I went sadly =\<br />
<br />
<br />
Something else thats sad was bloodfrenzy dropped off cursed, I did him like, 40+ times back when my guild was in that stage of progression and got one on the last kill heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarr</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoW and Tormax are all Kael is used for on Eci, from what I've seen. I have plate gauntlets, chain gauntlets, silk gloves, and leather boots from Kael rotting in my bank. I have /ooc'd that they are free for MQ as long as they have the Coldain faction and gems several times and noone has shown any interest to date. <br />
<br />
Our guild was working towards VT before OoW and I'm still LP rift for my VT key. Unfortunately, our guild now consists of me and a couple of alts. Most retired while some moved to Uber guilds which are now having a little trouble with not having the numbers/classes to raid what they want to raid. I hope they can get through the holiday/new game lull without collapsing. <br />

We also go in and one group the TVXs now and then (GDI those are long fights, thank god for qvic geared clerics hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at level 70 , time flagged (altho the Diaspora has left very few time flagged europeans on CT server ) 12500 and 2400 fuly buffed 475 AA spent (hmm /Auc wtb a life , 302 days played ) and epic 1.5 , i still use a bloodfrenzy in main for agro , only weapon i found near it is Velitorkins femur with an anger three proc , epic 1.5 even with A3 and Yak 125 proc doesnt come near that ol' leg bone , so i guess it's more Ldon for me , and at level 70 they are freakin hard now <br />
<br />
similarly theres a load of good stuff in places like VT and VP , i challenge anyone realistically to not have an item from the older zones that they wouldnt want , SOE has lost the plot when it comes to pure entertainment .<br />
<br />
amulet of necropotence = fabulous toy <br />
holgresh elder beads or what ever with the eye ?  =  another <br />
the uber ponies from a couple of emperors = fast as fack (altho i like my yellow horse , it matches the yard wide streak down my spine  :o ) <br />
various drops with SPAM FOOD and drink , ideal to AE the raid and upset ppl when everyone 'chomp chomp CHIMPS , ' <br />
ant legs , illusions , interesting procs , Avatar procs , slows , haste items like the legendary silversteel cloak ?VT , anyone out there actually got one? <br />
<br />
What about the cord of midnight ? great haste item with great AC , <br />
AC Humungous face item (50 ? ) <br />
Seru's toys , who can resist linking a 'sword of truth ' ? or getting a free SOW item ? or even the stuff like BP of speed ? not many warriors wouldnt want that either for use OR for back up CR gear , <br />
<br />
Hategiver from SSRA , nice backup agro with 25 AC , 85 HP , ??? trouble is XTC drops the smithing boost hammer more often ,how about the old planes?<br />
<br />
theres actually not bad EXP from handing in planar armour , and you get a 'free peridot ' ( when you really hoped for a BD m ) and not to mention the huge FUN involved of really embarrassing CR when some prat aggroed the IREBLIND IMP in fear , <br />
<br />
Gods , dragons and quests  :p , but theres so much content in the 'old world ' which mebbe not be the be all and end all of your gaming experience , but above all is still FUN , and if anyone says they don't play to have fun, look at them as you would a Troll with a bar of soap , IE , EXTREMELY SUSPECT , as are their motives  ;)</div></div><hr />
