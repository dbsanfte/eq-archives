<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thuump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I am thinking in what order would you guys prioritize weapons aquired from the end game zones and why.(ok my list isint that thurough, but I thought this could be a cool thread for equipment discussion about something so important to us - agro)<br />
I only did 2handers that I either thought alot about or had the chance of aquiring, post to whatever specifications you like - just keep the talk elemental weapons (or comparable)<br />
<br />
<br />
Crow footed lance-  good amount of + to hps and is very fast dam/dly quite nice I won one my first uber raid in air, most established guilds end up giving this to apps.newmembers/twinks<br />
<br />
The Ornate GreatBlade - pretty nice can be auged and has a dd nice damage delay<br />
<br />
Sews - I love this weapon it is what I use right now its like 45/30 2hand slash very cool looking, I hit like constand 100s-200s low 300s and crit like 500s crip 700... the rune creates alot of agro and can be auged with anger 3<br />
<br />
Blade Of War - very  nice proc for agro ( cants recal the name) this weapon's dam/dly prolly th best pre elemental warrior usable. 2hhnd slash<br />
<br />
Vanazer(sp?) this is a 2 hand blunt weapon that is like a massive 62/30 something, very very nice drops off of sayrn in tier 4 time, i am thinking of getting this buy am thinking dark blade of the warlord is alot cooler/useful not sure much on how others see it, I beleive it has a direct damage proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please dont hesitate to make your own rendition in a list of this fashion, throw in your 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SEWS, BoW, and VDD are the only things on that list worth getting, and only get one of the three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SEWS, BoW, and VDD are the only things on that list worth getting, and only get one of the three.<br />
<br />
...and as to not confuse the original poster, DBotWL ranks over all those three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Edge of Eternity is a pretty popular DPS/aggro weapon for DW as well, due to its stun proc and great ratio. So the list of good EP+ warrior weapons is pretty much limited to:<br />
<br />
Dual Weild:<br />
DBotW<br />
EoE<br />
<br />
2 handed:<br />
BoW<br />
VDD<br />
SEWS<br />
<br />
In that order of aggro, imo. For DPS, the Ornate Greatblade would be really low aggro for good DPS. There are probably some decent DW setups are available for solid DPS, though you might have some trouble prying them away from rogues and ranjas.</div></div><hr />

Blade Of War - very  nice proc for agro ( cants recal the name) this weapon's dam/dly prolly th best pre elemental warrior usable. 2hhnd slash <br />
<br />
The proc is Enraging Blow. This proc can also be found on Blade of Carnage, Hategiver, Anathema, and Bloodfrenzy. The proc increases hate by 700. <br />
<br />
Also the proc on SEWS is affects all the mobs around you that you have already established agro with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Firemore pretty much said it how it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanazir drops off Terris Thule.  :D <br />
<br />
Saryrn drops Edge of Eternity.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never been too impressed with the Ornate Greatblade.  Even with an aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya I agree, hold out for 1 of sews/bow/vdd. A good warrior needs a good 2 hander in his arsenal; VDD+ang3 is probably the best but any of the 3 will get the job done well, so whichever you have a good opportuninty to pounce on will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What do you guys use for a low-aggro weapon?  BoW with Anger III is great for tanking, but a little too much aggro when not tanking, especially when the MT doesn't have Anger Augments or WA (describes all but 2 of our warriors).  Ornate greatblade has a slightly better ratio than the BoW but the delay is pretty lame.  Still might pick one up for when I don't have aggro if it's cheap, but so far the rangers seem to like it.  SEWS would be the best obviously, but I don't know if I could justify the cost of one of those when it would only be a situational weapon.  Vanazir is probably the ultimate, but it will be a long time before we get to time since we are just starting the EPlanes now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used an ornate greatblade for a long time as a dps weapon when i wasnt tanking and couldnt use the BoW. Really not alot of options in the elementals that wont cost an arm or a legs worth or merit/dkp (aka Sews). Snag the Ornate Greatblade and hang onto it until you can get into the first couple tiers of time and snag a Cudgel of Wrecking and Ethereal Destroyer or a Timeless Coral Greatsword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use my BBB for DPS now; I haven't felt it too important to grab something new. I augmented it with a lame 50hp lifetap aug for fun, and incidentally I actually improve my survivability against AEs. If you take a look here (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2367.topic), you'll notice that the ornate greatblade comes out fairly nicely for DPS for a pally. I don't know exactly how good it'd be for a warrior, but I'd imagine it'd work very well for low aggro DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The very first ornate greatblade we got sold for minimum hehe, so that sounds like the way to go I guess, especially since I know we will be doing fire a lot.  Nice lookin sword too :)<br />
<br />
Just noticed this thread is in the Arena so I'm sending it over to the bunker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Muurlat McKrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i am right now very happy with my sews with anger3. i have no problem with gaining and maintaining aggro while i mt. its also great for soloing because that rune proc is just teh win, bar none. <br />
<br />
i seriously dont see myself going for two 1h weapons for quite some time. the reposte damage now of god mobs is absurd and in my opinion not worth the pretty stats that they have. perhaps if i was xping in the elementals a lesser zone i would use them but anything from god, i am gonna stick with my sews.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GSo4W for dps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Had BoW+A3 then got for the fun of it SEWS + Ykesha<br />
<br />
Of course i use the sews when not MTing.<br />
However its still very dangerous ...<br />
Have died with BDoW/EoE + 2xA3 warriors tanking.<br />
<br />
Its a great medium agro overall weapon (the sews that is).<br />
<br />
But if you dont want to waste DKP, ornate greatblade &amp; some of the trash from Time2/3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Had BoW+A3 then got for the fun of it SEWS + Ykesha <br />
<br />
Well, the problem is that Ykesha still is over around half the aggro of EB. If you want it for pure DPS, get one of the 150 point DDs on it and you should steal aggro ALOT less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heh I use Darwol's cleaver sometimes for dps only 100hps but 43/35 ratio and unresistable 125dd. put another dd proc on it and prolly good dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if u missed out on BoW and your into ele and farming it regularly, then chances are youll see more Sews start to drop than bow. i picked one up and have no problems with it.<br />
<br />
dont waste your time with ornate gayblade but if sews isnt dropping then its not bad as a dps option, especially as its really comon drop so you should be able to get it cheap.<br />
<br />
So i got my sews for aggro/dps. the next eoe drop ill probably get and dbow is not much further off. in that case ill still need a dps combo. what i did was to pick up a DoD from time tier 3 as its at rot stage, so figure i can pair that with EoE for non aggro dps or the SeWs.<br />
<br />
being a weapon hog, im proably also gonna pick up the next VDD that drops as its pretty cheap for DKP for us atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sews + Ykesha is very nice dps &amp; agro.<br />
Its more than enough for Xp groups (add the fun factor).<br />
<br />
And the agro in raids is often sufficient to get me killed<br />
(rarely from overagro, really often when MT dies).<br />
<br />
So if you havent got at a BoW, get a SEWS, slap A3 on it.<br />
And you will have a good weapon that will serve you for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gakmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually i have a VDD and i have no problem to hold aggro (aug'd with anger3)<br />
Though imo if you have either a bow a sews or a vdd wait for dbow, if not, grab one of these till you can have a dbow. Actually thats what am doing, my guild doesnt work with dkp (its bid, if you have 100 pts and feel like bidding em, you can), so am gunna wait for the dbow to be very very very cheap, just because ii need to catch up on hp.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I'm using a Fabled Exe Axe for DPS when I'm not tanking.  But then again, my only real aggro weapon so far is my Xana Hammer, and that's iffy.  God I hope we start farming Inny soon...</div></div><hr />
