<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, maybe I wasn't paying as much attention back then, but I'm really starting to miss the days when warriors sucked.  I look at some &quot;what AAs now&quot; post where some ebayer with a 60 warrior and 800k worth of gear who doesn't have a fucking permanent haste item wants to know what AAs to get after run and regen.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU STUPID???  YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT AA'S TO GET BECAUSE YOU JUST BOUGHT A 60 WARRIOR, A BOC AND FULL ORNATE BUT NO HASTE????<br />
<br />
That money would have been better spent buying a God-damned clue!<br />
<br />
You know, back before Incite when we sucked, all these morons knew we sucked and they all played paladins.  Now they want some shiny plate covered toy and warriors are back in fashion.<br />
<br />
A month ago, you saw 65 warrior lfg and you knew that you, that guy, and the other 6 warriors lfg all knew wtf they were doing because we were the hardcore dumbasses who were too stubborn to give up the class that we knew and loved.  I loved every damn tell I got from friends who bitched about some knight who didn't know one end of their spear from another because they were an ebayed/powerleveled alt played by some druid who didn't have a damn clue.  Well great, now these morons are coming back to warriors.  That's just fucking great.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm already missing the days when you knew any warrior still left was there because they knew their shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As what feels to be an absolutely ancient knight, all I have to say is this: <br />
Take your idiot twinks that abandoned the warriors they made in Kunark for PoP knights, back, and keep them this time. <br />
With great power comes the great responsibility of training the twinks, and brother, it's your turn, I'm done. Have a nice day!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except when your chanter/shaman dies or isn't paying attention and your haste fades or is dispelled and your agro goes to shit because you have zero worn haste to fall back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Htf can you say you don't need a haste item? Lol, haste buffs won't cap you alone, so wearing no haste item, is the same as losing out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I don't wear my haste item, I can see a huge difference in my ability to keep aggro. /rude missing the Cloak of the Black Wind on corpse loot screen because it's so damn close to being as black as the loot boxes!<br />
<br />
A good haste item is the single most important thing for warriors besides, and possibly even surpassing, a good aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />

hahaahahahah....how envious I am of people who just buy a BoC.<br />
<br />
I think they need to nerf us back to *before* kunark that so only silly crazy people play warriors.  But I still think knights need to be nerfed back *to* Kunark (just on principle mind you) and monks stay where they are (cause nerfing them back would actually make them more powerful...and they might start soloing Sol B again).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides, it makes me look so much better.<br />
<br />
&quot;WTF does your shield refresh faster than most peoples or something??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WTF how are you scoring triple 871 hp crippling blows? Is that a disc or something??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WTF how do you keep agro like that? Are you a paladin?&quot;<br />
<br />
...Keep it up =) Yeah, haste doesnt matter, and agi is more important than hp, and dual wield is a really great option if you want to do damage.  /nods</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was with ya till you said dual wield sucks for DPS.<br />

Grrrrr.<br />
<br />
How many times do people have to parse time weapons before we can get away from this &quot;2handers roxorz&quot; mentality?<br />
<br />
Dual Wield is not dead.<br />
<br />
There are great dual wield options out there. There are, for the most part, aslo great 2handed options.<br />
<br />
It's actually nice to be able to have the choice between the two for once. On BOTH of my toons.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this here is one monk who's quite happy with the twink mob being mainly beastlords and warriors. My own twink is a warrior, but, eh, I'll deal. Less monks means less headaches.<br />

Dual Wield is not dead.<br />
<br />
Its not dead in Time. Its not dead up to the end of Luclin. It's not dead for sub-elemental exp groups. It is dead for tanking bosses beyond around Mechagodzilla in POI until you get those Time weapons.<br />
<br />
Seriously my Anger III auged Greatstaff of the Four Winds holds as much aggro as my Anger III auged Hategiver and BoC. It also does an additional 30DPS (115ish to 85ish) with fewer ripostes (in exp groups to me they don't matter but they do on bosses). There is no question what works better: on bosses those extra ripostes mean a DI fire or maybe a dirtnap.<br />
<br />
A good haste item is the single most important thing for warriors besides, and possibly even surpassing, a good aggro weapon. <br />
/agree totally<br />
You may be able to cap with 31% or 36% and Vallon's but if you don't have it an ENC...</div></div><hr />

I find the number of high-level warriors here saying that haste is not important quite disturbing.  You do realize that item and spell haste stack right?  You can probably tank with no offhand weapon too, doesn't mean it's not a really horrible idea though.  <br />
<br />
sadly enough,  i agree 100%. i used to read TSW looking for ideas and now i mostly find myself reading the tavern and outhouse. DW isn't dead. haste IS important and the lvl 65&gt;all mantra is WRONG( yes i could tank the same mob better at 65 when it is a LOW dark blue con but i'd rather tank it better NOW and tank appropiate lvl mobs better at 65 than some noob who rushed there with no AAs and crappy gear) i also have time to upgrade MY gear while getting those AAs.<br />
<br />
it may seem to alotta people here that i am wrong but in groups clerics LOVE me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I found a decent post about hotkeying Area Taunt along with some other stuff and that helped me a bit.  I talked it over with some of the senior warriors I play with, and got some good advice and made adjustments accordingly.<br />
 I had some problems trying to grab agro in PoFire (I type slightly dyslexic at times) and this will sure help.  <br />
<br />
Like any website, you can't believe everything you read and have to remember everyone has an opinion.<br />
<br />
We'll get things back to what they were here soon I'm sure.  The Steel Warrior has been a great source for sharing experiences and ideas.  Thanks!!!<br />
<br />
I did get asked for a BSS the other night from a new cleric.  I've asked for the wrong buff from a caster before. All casters look alike to me. *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">oh Id agree that once you reach Time DW is an option again (and back during Luclin sure.)<br />
<br />
But during current-day EQ, before you reach time?  I dunno... GSoT - BoW ... I just never was able to touch any of my 2H damage numbers with DW damage.</div></div><hr />

   I am soory that your class is now being delouted by ebayers/alts.  I have almost stopped playing EQ altogether due to the dishearting fact of all the boted clerics. so trust me i feel your pain.  I have played a cleric since beta, a long time for most of you all call a boring job. But for me it wasnt the fact of what i was doing but how well i did it. I am sure some of you all remember when you needed skill, and a attention span of over 3seconds to play and class well, when you know most of the other players and if cleric_002 sucked then he got a bad rep and didnt get groups. When thier where areas that you would only attempt to travel to and do with a trusted group. But as for now all i see is alts/ebayed clerics running around who have NO clue how to play a cleric to its full potential, the ones who try to demand things and think all they need to do is buff then hit cheal. Worse though are the other players who think they are right /shrug. But i guess that is the way of things now, so i just wanted to say that i am truly sorry that your class has been reduced to what mine (cleric) has already became :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Bad clerics still get bad reps, so do bad warriors. It is weeding them out that it hard. I have met many who Bot who could play circles aaround those watching TV, the kids, cooking, doing laundry, walking the dog and everything EXCEPT playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have a friend who two boxes a cler with his BST, msot people never realzie his cleric is two boxed until we replace him with someone we know or they asks why hes so quiet...</div></div><hr />

During my normal play time, I NEVER see more than 1 cleric (if even one :( ) LFG.  Rather than whine about it, I just bring out my alt/bot and go about my merry way with the guildmates.</div></div><hr />
