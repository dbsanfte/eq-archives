<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just purchased one of these in the bazaar on Zeb figuring it would be great to have for an instaclick - plus of course it shrinks my hulking Troll form into something spindly so the raidleaders are happy.<br />
<br />
I was thinking and just came up with a possible drawback - does the Illusion Skeleton remove my innate troll regen?  That may be too high a price to pay if it does.  Does anyone know for sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure on regen, but it does take away your large race ability to bash with no shield, so it is possible it removes regen as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try it out.<br />
<br />
Fall off a high cliff or something to lose some HP.  Stand up and watch ure HP's regen.<br />
<br />
Then use the AoN and try again.<br />
<br />
When in another form, I wasnt able to slam/bash.  But also I didnt get frontal stun either (Ogre ability)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heheh, I'll try taking some damage and checking it.  I'm at work right now and just came to the realization that I may have made an ooops in buying it - will have to try it when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ghworg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">does not negate regen but you wont be able to slam with illusion on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another annoying thing about it is that it negates your natural infra/ultravision... so if you don't have a sight enhancing effect/spell active, you'll be night blind.  I used to really hate that before I got my helm.<br />
<br />
Whou woulda thought that skeletons can't see in the dark? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty sure it's also a bad item to use if you're MA and cornering a mob, since it'll unshrink you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep- as do all illusions I believe (well, they make you the normal size of whatever you're turned into). Skelly is roughly human size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Umm, isnt' that the one with -100HPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Amulet has -100hp but is clickable from inventory.  I did however find that I can use my cobalt bracer on my skellie form until I'm stupidly tiny and made of bones.  THAT is cool.<br />
<br />
Nightvision goes bye bye, not sure about the stun immunity that I've heard about.  I'll post more as I learn more about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SkafflocTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play on a PvP server. These are great there because it is VERY difficult to target by clicking on someone who is shrunk and in skellie form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have mine because Ihave all the new graphics off, so when I need to make a horse I turn into a skel and summon my horse :)</div></div><hr />
