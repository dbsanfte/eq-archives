<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend of mine has been trying to e-mail me all day via Hotmail (a friend who e-mails me frequently) but I haven't received one e-mail from her. I can't think of a reason why this would happen since I haven't changed anything recently. Any suggestions would be helpful.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

check yer bulk email folder.<br />
<br />
make sure spam mail is being delivered to the bulk mail folder and not deleted outright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've noticed that email I've sent from Hotmail is taking hours to reach my g/f who uses Yahoo.  I don't know how long the reverse takes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There for a while, I was receiving emails one day later than they sent the email. Somehow, it cleared up on it's own and i get emails normally. Dunno, but hotmail is wierd sometimes.<br />
<br />
but do what the other folks have said. Check your bulk mail and make sure it's not being deleted (highly doubt though honestly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Checked the junk mail filter and they're not being instantly deleted so that's not the problem. I'm hoping what Thalzaar said about the e-mails being received a day later is the case... but that would be pretty weird cause I got the instant notification e-mails when each of you replied to this thread :P Ahhh this is driving me nuts lol... oh well thanks for the replies guys :D</div></div><hr />
