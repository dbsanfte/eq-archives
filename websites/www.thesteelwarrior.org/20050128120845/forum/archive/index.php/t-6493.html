My question is in regards of how the point that  you acquired in various differant camps can be used.  For Example here is a list of points that you acquired at various LDON camps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mistmoore-510<br />
East Commonlands-306<br />
Everfrost- 760<br />
Deepest Guk- 200<br />
North Ro- 200<br />
<br />
<br />
Now all I care about is purchasing the warrior armor at everfrost that costs 760 points.  By my example I have successfully unlocked them.  I purchased a peice using the 760 points I acquired at everfrost.  Now here is the question.  Since I have enough point combine in the other 4 camps can I purchase another peice or do I have to acquire 760 points at each camp to purchase another peice of armor?  To make it clearer I want to use the points I have at east commonlands (306) and the points from mistmoore (510) which combined makes 816 points enough for one more peice of armor.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for the info</div></div><hr />

if you have unlocked an item then you can purchase it with points earned in any camp.<br />
<br />
so yes you can purchase another piece.</div></div><hr />

This is great news since I play mostly at nights I can just do any camps while during primetime I will just do everfrost.</div></div><hr />
