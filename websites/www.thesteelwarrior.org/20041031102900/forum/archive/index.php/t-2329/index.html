<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nirebauu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are 3 weapons(1H) that have EnragingBlow proc.<br />
<br />
1.Blade of Carnage<br />
2.HateGiver<br />
3.BloodFrenzy<br />
<br />
Which weapon more proceccing EB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bloodfrenzy procs about 2x as much as BoC/HG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lesse...My BoC procs on the 13th day of the 5th month on a leap year...<br />
<br />
To say the least, I wouldn't notice if I had a rusty spoon instead of a BoC. Never proced much for me. On the other hand, BF procs a hell of a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Man, I don't get all this BoC slamming I see going on.  My BoC procs plenty enough to hold aggro, and then some.<br />
<br />
Could be my perspective tho...which was going from a windblade to BoC/SoD overnite.  I'm pretty humble about my aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">15/20 by itself is goign to get you good agro, with the proc you just build hate that much faster.  <br />
<br />
honestly think the great blade of storms is better dmg and procs more than BoC, not sure how common it is but the better item imo. at least the mob who drops it is up every 6 hours, think he drops some nice shoulders too if nothing else.<br />
<br />
cant rely on any item for snap agro though, normally guilds will weaponshield, LoH, divine arbitration etc to let tank get initial agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I find my BoC proccing a ton.  Hell farming dorfs for head to get my dain belt (about a 20 second fight solo) i would proc 2-5 times per dorf.  That alone tells me im getting good proc rate on it.<br />
<br />
sure, i wish it would proc more, but if ive got procs, i want them to go off every swing.  <br />
<br />
any EB weapon is better than not having one.<br />
<br />
And theres 4, not 3<br />
<br />
Dont forget Blade of War</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is 5 if you wanna get picky, Inny drops one now too.  And he mentioned EB proccing 1h weapons anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BoC proc rate is just fine, I dont know what you guys complaining expect from it really. I have 0 problems with aggro on raids, which is all I care about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BoC proc rate is just fine, I dont know what you guys complaining expect from it really. I have 0 problems with aggro on raids, which is all I care about.<br />

Man, I don't get all this BoC slamming I see going on. My BoC procs plenty enough to hold aggro, and then some.<br />
<br />
Could be my perspective tho...which was going from a windblade to BoC/SoD overnite. I'm pretty humble about my aggro.<br />
<br />
once your guild starts getting better weapons, more atk and more nuke focuses, the neccessity to obtain better aggro weapons than a BoC inreases... that is why you see some people slamming the BoC. I see daily other warriors in my guild tanking the big mobs in EPs as well as trash mobs with a BoC and a Vallon sword etc., and they don't do nearly as well as in Luclin anymore.<br />
<br />
edit: oh, and nobody can say &quot;oh, but the BoC is a velious weapon!&quot; because when he first was killed, and after Luclin was released, the weapon was a 15/23 same stats, but no proc. :) useless, but interesting tidbit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I got BoC I was amazed , I thought it procced a ton.<br />
Then I got Bloodfrenzy, and definately noticed the difference. I'd say Bloodfrenzy procs twice as much. In a raid situation I need procs as often as possible, I love my Bloodfrenzy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found the BoC to be a little light on the proc rate to the point where I tend to tank with a BBB instead.<br />
<br />
According to warriors in my guild HG's proc rate is almost on par with Bloodfrenzy, either seems to work fine for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Crystara ... Anathema is Taunting Blow, not enraging blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anathema (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=52058) - sure looks like EB to me.<br />
<br />
Weapons with enraging blow. (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2675)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Eoden beat me...&lt;3 for Lucy though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Looks like I didn't have to post that link myself after all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">2-5 procs the first 20 seconds frequently is a little hard to swollow. Maybe just some luck, but if you parse that out over 100 mobs you'd probably paint a different picture. If you think a BoC procs a ton you need to see a bloodfrenzy or blasphemous blade of the exiled in action, because I can guarantee you they proc twice as much or more. If you like it, that's great. More power to you. It is not an end all/be all weapon like some make it out to be however. There is still a gap between it and the various &quot;higher performance&quot; weapons from it. It's just the best tradeable warrior weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bashing BoC is retarded. Old items will look worse (in most cases) compared to new items and BoC was godly when it first dropped (After the upgrade tho)</div></div><hr />
