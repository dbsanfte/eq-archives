<br />
I was wondering if anyone savvy with UI design could answer whether or not it would be possible for an indicator of some kind to be created that would let someone who uses the /ALT ACTIVATE commands for a skill know when the skill is available.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
My primary key configuration is for Hotkeybank1 to have 10 very useful hotkeys on there, including my Area Taunt hotkey, which uses an ALT ACTIVATE command and a group message that I've used it.  On my page 3, I have the Hotbutton for AETaunt created by using the 'Create Hotbutton' option on the AA skill page there that remains depressed until the AE Taunt skill recycles and I can use it again.  My Area Taunt hotkey on Hotkeybank1, however, will recycle after all the text is gone and everything has been run.<br />
<br />
The problem with that configuration is that I can't easily see w/o switching hotkeybanks whether or not AET has recycled...unless I wish to dedicate another hotkey slot on bank1 to the AA created AET hotkey, or switch back and forth to page 3 to see if it's live again.<br />
<br />
The Question:<br />
<br />
Using an UI or some sort of other method, can either of the following be made/constructed:<br />
<br />
1.  Have my hotkey button that I created with the line ALT ACTIVATE in it be tied to the refresh of my AE Taunt button so that it will not undepress until AET refreshes.<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
2.  Make another window/indicator/something outside of hotbuttons that tells whether or not a skill has recycled or is ready (red light/green light would be sufficient).<br />
<br />
The same question would apply for some other ALT ACTIVATE ability like RAMPAGE.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any replies...thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The result of that on a 10 min refresh ability would be that I would be unable to use any other hotkeys in that entire time...<br />
<br />
...not useful...</div></div><hr />

Never done it myself but guildie posted about it a while back, let me see if I can find it.<br />

I doubt it's possible.</div></div><hr />
