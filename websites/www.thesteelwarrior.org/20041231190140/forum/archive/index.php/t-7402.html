Haven't been able to locate anything saying whether this skill can be augmented by an attribute.  Lowest is 203 and that's CHA.  Would figure low CHA for better taunt (if anything).  Anyone have a comment about this?  Every since they started showing the fails of taunts I've become rather upset with my fail rate.<br />
<br />
Second, in dealing with GoD mobs what would one suggest to keep aggro from the onset of the fight on through to the end?  I end up having wizards,  shaman and other high aggro spell casters rip through my &quot;wall of aggro&quot; as it were and basically place me in the inept waste basket.  I want some help on this cuz I can't stand playing my class this way.  I'd be better off buying a gnome wiz and pking.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt success depends on the mob's level relative to yours. The higher they are, the more you'll fail.<br />
<br />
  What weapons do you use? Are they augmented? Do you mash taunt? Do you incite often? Do you have WA5? Warrior aggro isn't perfect, but if you've done all you can to maximize your aggro, it's the high aggro classes fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slight and pedantic clarification --<br />
<br />
One of the developers stopped by in the past few weeks and confirmed that the only factors which affect the success of taunt are 1) your skill level in taunt, 2) your level, and 3) the target's level.<br />
<br />
So, yes -- you'll fail more if the mob is higher level than you.</div></div><hr />

I don't notice it as much in fights, but I like to have a sucessful taunt before a break a mezz.  Lately in LDoN adventures I've had up to 6 failed taunts on mezzed mobs,  that con blue to me, and my taunt is 230 etc...   It's frustrating when the rest of the group gets impatient and forces me to break the mezz early, then it runs right to the chanter etc..  Someone suggested my charisma is too low ( which it is ) but I was wondering if that effected taunt.  I'll assume now that it doesn't.  =)  <br />

<br />
oddly when i was doing GoD the other day, i noticed a startling drop in the failed taunts. i have no explanation for it other than streaky RNG</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever since we could see the fail message people have had ungodly luck with high streaks of fails.<br />
<br />
Taunt (Fail or succeed), Incite, attack.<br />
You should have no problem chain pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard mez is incredibly low aggro compared to enchanter mez.  If the bard mez-parks each pull when it arrives, you should have no difficulty in grabbing aggro immediately through incite, whether your taunt fails or succeeds.</div></div><hr />

CHANTER mez, Taunt (fail or success), incite, taunt if first failed, break (so if 2 fail in a row, the agro generated from the incite,will give you agro.)</div></div><hr />

cool thanks for the tips all =).  I hate slowing down dungeons when we're cranking them out at a fast pace.   I'm getting really impatient with my LDoN pts.  I have 721 in mira and I'm saving up for Anger 3.  But some nights if I lose aggro I get temped to just get Anger 2 to hold me over til I can afford anger 3.  But I know I'd regret that, lol.<br />

Wanting to ninja Timeless BP soon so perhaps the echo will assist in that case.  Everything except for WA is maxxed (WA4).  I hadn't aug'd my weapons to keep the separation of processing down to a minimum.  I'd rather see the aggro from an Anger proc than from something I'd decided to toss on the weapon for fun.</div></div><hr />
