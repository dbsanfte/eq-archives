<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked this question before and was told that after 10/10/03 Patch the anger procs had been made available to 2-handers.  I am not yet close enough to look for myself but I did look at a website from the Phantom Raiders Guild on Bertoxx Server and from the screen shot I saw it says anger 3 is still restricted to 1handed weapons.  So, can someone please tell me that this is wrong?  Someone that has augmented a 2hander already?  Perhaps the image on this website is incorrect?  Here is the link I was looking it up at.<br />

The screenshot taken on the website above just must be old or something.</div></div><hr />

She does alot of stuff with that site though and is generally busy.</div></div><hr />

The type 4 anger 3 is in everfrost, the one in Sro is type 8.  I augmented BoW with anger 3 augment from everfrost, if that makes better sense hehe =)</div></div><hr />
