<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went LDoNing today, had grouped a 200AA Pally w/ Sot4W.  That pally likes to MT.  So we ended up in a taunting duel.<br />
<br />
With Incite, 3 anger procs, and taunt, I was unable to taunt off the pally consistently.  Sometimes I'd get 4 procs in short order and still not get aggro.<br />
<br />
I tell ya folks, Stun aggro needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if he taunts after you proc and incite, he's ganna have your agro, plus the agro from his 2h DPS, stuns and whatever else his 200AA are giving him. <br />
of course if a knight really wants the agro not much a warrior can do about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you could be wielding 2 dbotws with anger 3 each and youd still probably lose to a pally that wanted to steal aggro. and dont forget pallys have taunt button also...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Indeed we have 400 hate every 30 seconds while pallys have around 600-1000 hate every 3 seconds or so i would guess.<br />
<br />
If a pally wants agro they best you can hope for is a successfull taunt then incite and a couple EB procs all in quick succession, say he starts casting right away when you take agro 12 seconds after you took it he will take it back not to mention group healing agro that could take it back with one cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blah, I had no idea they had THAT level of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Magnar Midgeteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The pallies can take the agro but can not do the tankn!  So don't worry if he can take your agro in a group or even in a raid, because he/she/it (pally) will die very very fast.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that pally's are the worst at controling their agro and die constantly on raids, which is annoying because when I parse them...they stay about 70+ dps lower than a decent warrior.<br />
<br />
...the Midgeteater</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Old skool Pallies seem to be unable to shake their Kunark Complex.  It makes them overaggro and insist upon tanking.   But Mag, against exp mobs, Pallies do just fine tanking.  That's the 2nd problem.  In a hard LDoN the 900+ hits might take her down faster than me, but that hasdn't been demonstrated.</div></div><hr />

This is so absolutely true.  It may be by design however.  SK's (as opposed to Palaldins) are built around aggro: getting it when they need it, keeping it when they should have it, and losing it when they shouldn't have it.<br />
<br />
For example...<br />
<br />
On my SK I have specific weapons that I use when I am MT, as well as a specific spell set.  All designed around keeping and holding aggro.  I switch out weapons and spells for different sets when I am not MT (i.e. if there is a warrior in the group better suited to tank than me).  Should I draw aggro I just back off or FD.  IMHO this is the vision of what a Hybrid should be.  Tank if there is no Warrior, DPS and utility when there is. <br />
<br />
The problem is (as far as I know, I've never played one) Paladins don't have the ability to shed aggro like an SK does.  Yeah, they can back off, but if they've just dropped 14 stuns on a mob, that's not really going to work like FD can.  Of course the over stunning is attributed to a poorly played Paladin.  But unless the Paladin has leveled up with a Warrior odds are they have been MT most of their career, and this is the only way they know how to play.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is a lot of Hybrid tanks (there ARE some SK's that fit into this category too!) don't understand that just because you can take aggro doesn't mean that you should.<br />

<br />
Fortunately most people don't want to out aggro a warrior.</div></div><hr />
