<br />
Here is my magelo, my question is not really about my equipment, what I wanna know is do I have a decent enough amount of HP/AC to tank in the tier 1 planes.  Mind you im just talkin about normal grind groups on trash mobs.  I have a little over 4k hitpoints and about 1060 or so AC when I get virtue, is this sufficient?  I cant wait till I get 51 so I can hurry up and get to 65.  Just dinged 48 about 5 minutes ago.  <br />
<br />
P.S. Basically all ive been doing is LDoN which is awesome xp but its starting to slow down so would i stand a chance of getting a grind group at 48 in tier 1??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try to get a group or partner in Justice. It's pretty much the easiest of the PoP planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say yes to POJ. I would wait to try main tanking in POI or PON though some of these mobs can hit pretty hard. (300 plus) So basically with just a few more lvls you will be ok there. Ideally if you can get in a grp as off tank that would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As people commented above, PoJ is perfect for you.  You will have no issues tanking their.  Once exp slows down there, move onto PoD and PoI trash mobs, then onto some of the higher level mobs in tier 1.  When PoP came out, I was I think 53, but had about the same hp's as you, and not much more AC.  I could tank most tier 1, but not at all well.  Don't hesitate to exp other places too, where you can get cash and drops that will help you improve your gear while you exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify:<br />
<br />
when people are talking PoJ, they are talking the zone out area, probably.  They aren't talking High Guardians of Justice (the equivalent of Tier 2), they aren't talking the mines, they probably aren't talking enforcers (enforcers and punishers are around level 51, hit for about 200 maxish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woojed</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do PoJ, but do the area by the exit.  Pull the people in the cells, they hit around 180 to 220 if I remember correctly.  They have low hp but prolly higher ac that what you used too.  <br />
<br />
GL and have fun bro!  <br />
<br />
Get around 54 or 55 before u start tanking in PoI or PoD, but once u start tanking those spots, the exp will start flying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traask</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 48, you will definitely be of interest to groups hunting zone out. Traditionally 2 camps, left and right of the zone out corridor. <br />
<br />
Mobs are easy there, and xp rocks to about 51/52. If you end up as puller, you'll notice there are some odd adds, until you level up a bit. You'll be pulling rats/prisoners and the guards (coolest mob model, IMO) - the prisoners are all different classes, and you'll learn which is the biggest PITA (Zanoux, mid left cell)<br />
<br />
There are no faction hits, everything at the zone out is indifferent and runs at low health, rats being the worst. (They cast an innate SoW)<br />
<br />
XP Starts slowing down fast at 51/52, we moved to the PoJ Basement (aka Mavuin's Hall)  which is ok xp there til 54ish. You might also be ok tanking the PoI zone in mobs, but without a chanter/bard for CC, that can get ugly.<br />
<br />
At 54ish, grab a chanter/bard, healer and a slower and head over to PoD and kill the flies there (From Zone head across water to first shore, they spawn on the right), they dont hit hard, but the xp is very good.  You WILL get a rat add from time to time that will be a harder fight, do NOT pull Malarians.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, PoN yard trash is your next bet. (Bugs, Bushes and Birds (Spiders, Trees and Ravens))<br />
<br />
55-58 , its a slow grind, as PoV groups wont want you tanking (nor should you really til 58 min) I've heard people say Crypt of Decay Zone in mobs are good, but havent played around with them.<br />
<br />
XP in LDoNs will still be a good option, it won't come in as steady, but gear wise, it will be better.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit.</div></div><hr />

You might want to make sure you have a usable 2HB and that your skill is up. The reason is that at lvl 55 you'll probably want to get a Greatstaff of thunder, a very nice very cheap agro weapon. Even though your weapons are pretty good, GSoT will certainly be handy as you fight in tougher zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaddu1256</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a GSoT already....just forgot to put it in the list ) and my 2hb skill is at about 180 right now.  I was fighting with some other 2hb thing just for skillups but bought one to use on the tribute guy before they nerfed it, so now I have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As has been previously mentioned, I was 51 and had about the same HP/AC as you when I first went to PoJ and I did fine.  PoD, PoI and PoN are much tougher than PoJ.  You could tank some trash mobs there, but they'll hand you your ass while you're doing it, so your group will have to be on the ball.   Stick with PoJ for a while, get a few upgrades here and there when you can, then at about 55ish, PoI wont be a problem. (aside from the fact that it's a trainfest if you hunt near the zone in) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 53 with about 1150ac and 4500hps buffed with Temp, is that sufficient to be able to hit PoI/PoD/PoN?  Which of these three zones should be best for xp?  I like PoI better than PoN or PoD, but am wondering which zone would be best xp and difficulty wise....  or should I hit PoJ until I get a bit higher level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuff near the zone in area in PoI should be the best xps per time spent of all of those.  Once you're a little higher level, hobgoblins and gargoyles in PoN are probably better xp, but they'd probably rip you a new one unless you had a really good supporting cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Telen yes you should be able to handle trash mobs in PoN and PoD. Once you get to about 58 you can tank the courtyards in PoD. Those are decent exp spots until you can start doing PoV and PoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 53 do PoI to lvl 55, lvl 55-58 do LDoNs, PoN and PoD, but no courtyards those mobs hit upto 400s or so.  At 58 I can tank PoV mobs but fights are kinda long and I prefer to get another tank lvl 60+ because they are much better at tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to add I was tanking PoD courtyards at 58 with a slower. Without a slower do not think it would have been doable. Also will want some MR buffs since these mobs do HT and fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure you've got better gear than I had at your level and I just went straight to PoJ and did one of the exit camps till level 51-52.  At 52 the xp slowed WAY down, or for me atleast it seemed too and lots of friends have confirmed that feeling.  So as soon as I got 52 I went straight to PoI and would always go straight down that left corridor and never had any real problems.  I prolly had 3khp and 1k ac unbuffed but never had any clerics complain and alway seemed to do just fine.  Only few times I ever died in there was from a train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the advice.  I have done PoN, PoD, PoJ, PoI seems too overcamped at my server.  My favorite spot is...  for fear of others showing up there...  is PoJ caves.  XP rocks there at 54 and my group has a blast.  It's challenging and definitely riskier as the zone is a long long ways, but I enjoy it and the xp is great.  Also hit PoM and the xp was decent there as well, although we tried to pull that level 55-56 named Bixie, ouch hit for almost 400, negated some of the slow % also, be careful of that mob, it is mean.  :)  LDoN at 54 also seems pretty close to as good as PoP, not quite but close, and the opportunity for points and gear is better, so I'll be mixing it up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good call on the LDoN.

Thanks...you answered my question and I didnt even have to ask.  Was going to ask for a good LDON camp for warrior gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;&lt;Was going to ask for a good LDON camp for warrior gear.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
all of them since any points past 1495 in a particular camp are unnecessary for having access to all the vendor gear there. takish is the one with the royal armor for warriors and a few other classes. some of the augs you will need to get elsewhere.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt get too concerned whether you ldon or planes or whatever gets you experience fastest for now. the amount of adventure points you get in ldon in the 40s is kind of low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">all of them since any points past 1495 in a particular camp are unnecessary for having access to all the vendor gear there.  <br />
<br />
That's true, but you still need to get 1495 points in a particular camp before everything is unlocked, and that's a lot of points.  ;)<br />
<br />
For me, I make enough pp farming with my wiz that I expect to be in full ornate or better by the time I have access to Mir or Tak armor, so I am focusing more on where I want to gain augments from.  In my case I am most interested in the anger augs from Miraguls, so that's what I am planning to focus on.  I am figuring that in full ornate or better I'll have np tanking anything I need to for my usual group, and that my biggest issue is going to be holding aggro.<br />
<br />
I also like to focus on what is most fun for me, and although sitting in PoI pulling yard trash may be great xp, it's pretty boring.  I have much more fun crawling through a dungeon in an LDoN or hitting the caves in PoJ.  I also have more fun in Sebilis and Nurga and expect to be exploring Droga and Veksar soon.</div></div><hr />
