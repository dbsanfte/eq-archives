All you Rathe guys;  I can kill you now and put you out of your misery if you like :D <br />
<br />
Seriously, how messed up must the game be to have GREIG on rotation. <br />
<br />
And I thought Povar was bad...</div></div><hr />

Might be a good time for this, my guild just got on the NToV rotation :)  sure, its a old expansion, but we arent as hardcore as some of you guys.  /em buys beers fer everyone!</div></div><hr />

At the time, he was a contested mob so the rotation was made.  We only clean up the rotations if there are no longer 2 guilds after the mob in which case the mob is removed from rotation.  No need to kill us :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are events designed by SOE to be done in sequence.  Why would you go and kill Blood, and leave the Emperor up? Or kill Glyphed/Exiled and leave Cursed up?<br />
<br />
Rotations suck, but splitting encounters like that sucks even more!<br />
<br />
I wonder how many guilds on Rathe simply ignore the rotaitons?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't get  me wrong, I think rotations are a good idea, especially usually for small guilds that cannot quickly mobilize.  I was just SHOCKED by the sheer number of mobs on the Rathe rotation!<br />
<br />
The rotation makes it impossible for any smaller guild to gear up its folks and hop up to, say, POP.  Why?  Well, how would they possibly do it?  They can't get into ST because they can't kill any of the dragons to get into ST.  They can't get any of the velious kings because all are on rotation.  They can't get any of the luclin FT items for casters because most are on rotation...<br />
<br />
Dine, how does one move up to the next mob on a rotation?  Just ask?  Or do they need to &quot;prove&quot; themselves in some way?  (For example, to get into NTOV on Povar you have to kill Tormax, Yelinak and Cazic, all of which are FFA).  I suspect its a system that DEMANDS that guilds move through a certain progression and sort of ... maintains the status quo.  Lens, congratulations on NTOV, its a very exciting first clear usually.  But that also means you are pretty much stuck in a rotation progression which may or may not be great for your guild depending on how fast its growing. <br />
<br />
/shrug  A schedule is nice, but too much rigidity is not so great.  But if Rathe likes it, hey, its working as intended =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rotations do not make it impossible for the smaller guilds to get on rotation/gear up.  My guild is a smaller guild, compared to the big guns.  We only raid twice a week, unless a rotation mob we have falls on a off raid day.  <br />
<br />
To get in on the rotations is simple, you just have to beat the currently scheduled guild to the mob, then bam, your on the rotation.  Thats really the only time you have to race, if at all.  To get on NToV Rot on the rathe, you have to kill Aary.  For ST, just have to kill MotG and Prog i think.  There is seperate rotation for the ST Ancients.   True, you cant gear up real fast by farming one set of mobs for a month or whatever, but you have a garunteed(sp?) shot at them, and no races make the Rathe a very civil place to play :)  And the guilds in the elementals, tend to leave the other rotations(autopassing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a guild wants to get on a rotation, they either a) have to race the guild up or b) ask for a shot.  The Rathe is very civil and option b) works 95% of the time.  As far as the split rotations, they are meant as clean up if a guild is unable to kill the entire cycle.  The rotations HELP the smaller guilds actually, it gives them a shot at content.  If the rotations were not in place, the bigger guilds on the sever would just clean house on stuff like AoW and Luclin with small groups when they could, especially since we have 6 elemental guilds now with only one of them being in time.  Overall I enjoy the rotations and think they work good for our sever and the way it has developed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had two rotations on Erollisi Marr - Venril Sathir and Trakanon - up until just a few months ago. The EMarr community was split about it, both with very good points:<br />
<br />
1) Not all guilds can mobilize easily, so this gives access to those who play in a low-pressure guild, to do epic / decent drop mobs, without too much hassle.<br />
<br />
2) No other epic mob or dragon was on a rotation, so why bother in the first place, for these two?<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that the rotation dated back to the heyday of Kunark, when it was set up to prevent direct conflict b/w the power guilds on our server. Why it stopped there, and why those rotations lasted so long, is a tribute to both of the points made, above.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the arrangement of the mobs being open, now. I don't need a rotation for &quot;a large rat,&quot; I don't need a rotation for any raid-level mob, either. If we can take it, we will have the force ready, or we don't get to take it &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ok,this year your team wins the superbowl,next year you win,next year you win...etc&quot;<br />

I play an avg of 30 hours a weekor sometimes more,although I still consider myself overall an &quot;average player&quot;<br />

I dont expect to get everything out of the game as someone who plays all the time and I dont see why other casuel players seam to think they should.<br />

<br />
Surely a rotation would allow more people the opportunity at a mob / drop and prevent price jacking rather than a FFA situation where groups of people have in the past been able to control a spawn by ensuring it spawns in thier peak time and knowing when it is due.<br />

Im not a rotation supporter by any means, but that just struck me as funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
back in the glory days of emar rotations they made rules to keep the rotation list small, such as NO outside help or be banished from the rotation for good(so that means no guild allies) they had a honor amung theives policy which i dont care to go into because it was complete gay bullshit, the people the wrote it up where free to add and remove guilds at their whimes and if they wanted to they could jump ahead of anyone, the older guilds used the honor amung theives to &quot;double shot&quot; a spawn meaning 1 guild had a spot on the rotation that they didnt want(and if you didnt want it, the spot was MENT to go FFA) they would go into that zone anyway, have the guild they trade spots with slip in anon and then the guild that didnt want it left, meaning the just killed the purpose of FFAing the spot to upcoming none rotation guilds, this ment that AoN got VT twice in the same month while SoN got sleepers tomb twice in that month<br />
<br />
(assholes of norrath, shitheads of norrath)<br />
<br />
this also ment that tradable items could be held from the FFA people, meaning that SoN and AoN got to price jack the green scale if they wanted to because the cockblocked all FFA spots with &quot;double shot&quot; trading which was illegal to do in rotation but there was no one upholding the rules.<br />
<br />
anyhow i am happy to say that the rotation crashed and burned a few months ago :)</div></div><hr />

The only rotations there have ever been on E-Marr were for Venril Sathir, and Trakanon.<br />

This rotation degraded though after awhile because some guilds couldn't kill Emp on their appointed time which let it go to the Japanese guilds on Emarr and fooked up the time zone.<br />
<br />
After that flame fest now Emp and VT are FFA. I only think CoI and Res (former RoD) are the only two guilds on emarr who still hit VT. Everyone else is either above in Elem planes or below and can't kill Emp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weird thing about this Rathe rotation... You have a guild that apparently is in VT still killing Klandicar and Sontalak. WTF is up with that? Presumably they're still doing ST too I guess?<br />
<br />
Xev is a bit of a backwater, Quarm only died a couple weeks ago, but my guild hasn't done ST for 9 months now. We just did VT for the first time this weekend.<br />
<br />
The only rotation Xev has is VT, actually, and there's a good chance we would have been in there sooner without the rotation (not that I mind, just saying that we would have had access to the zone sooner without that).<br />
<br />
So, I'm not sure how it works out that there's more content for the smaller guilds, if a guild that should be wayyy past  certain content is still doing it simply because they can schedule it.<br />
<br />
Zlandicar on a rotation is kind of an amusing concept, too. Hasn't he been duo'd at this point? Grieg's been done with 6 people on Xev as well, just to pick another example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm certain that's fully possible, I'm also certain that most of the playerbase couldn't do that either. All rotations do is reduce pressure to mobilize after that first time. Of course, there were some on Brell who argued that rotations hurt the progress of the server, but seeing how quickly they made up lost ground, it doesn't seem as bad as the doomsayers used to cry.<br />
<br />
 Of course, there are no rotations anymore, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the point of a rotation is to promote repeated access to a mob by the guilds that are ready and able to kill said mob and move on when they are done needing him, as the Rathe rots appear to be, then the can be a useful thing. Anyone happen to know when Blood of the Spider last actually, you know, killed Zlandicar? I'll bet it's sometime before the release of SOL. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the Brell rotations were doing quite the opposite. A year long wait on Vox and Nagafen, sir, is idiotic beyond belief. When I was level 30, my guild at the time, Quorum Angelus, signed up for a Naggy kill. By the time our 'turn' came up 9 months later, I was level 57, QA had disintegated, and the man who'd signed us up had deleted his character. To this day, I have not seen Vox. I saw Nagafen only because I joined a pickup raid that went in the night of a scheduled patch, and that single spawn had been called FFA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, while I'm sure BotS isn't killing Zlandicar, the fact that a guild who is clearing VT and close if not already flagged for Elementals is in the rotation for it and other *easy* Velious mobs (and not in &quot;autopass&quot; mode, whatever that is) -- means the guilds that actually need ST to advance are probably not getting keys fast enough.<br />
<br />
When my guild decided we were ready for ST, we were able to get 40-50 keys in the space of a few months, simply because most of the larger guilds on the server no longer raced for those. We were in a position to race for them and often win, because that was the stage our development was at. Guilds past us were racing for higher level stuff, and guilds below us in advancement could get a spawn here and there but generally focused on other stuff.<br />
<br />
It was similar when we wanted to get into VT, although it took longer because of all the damn camping involved. I got up at some ungodly hour so we could be ready for an Emp spawn, since we knew that particular spawn was our best chance at it. In the rotation I see on that site, we'd still be waiting for our second shot at Emp and enough rifts to finally go in. Note that BotS *is* still in the Emp rotation apparently, despite having beaten Quarm. On Xev, there are 3 guilds that consider themselves so over with Luclin that they're not even the VT rotation anymore. Only one of those guilds has killed Quarm, one is in stage 4 of Time, and the third is still working on getting into Time.<br />
<br />
If BotS is still doing Emperor, that means there are fewer people seeing him, not more. I can only assume they're equipping alts of alts at this point. On a server with competition, they'd be focused on other things.</div></div><hr />

I am eternally grateful to what was the guild Vindication (many of whom left soon after to start TR) for blowing our rotation farce out the window where it belonged.   Oh the grind and boredom and fat and lazy days of having everything rigidly fixed on your plate ....  I feel for those servers who still have to deal with it...<br />
<br />
<br />
... and no small irony in the fact that Vindication busted the rotation on Dru-Ro, left for the greener pastures of Legends, and low and behold, got a rotation forced down their throats in the end anyway ;)<br />
