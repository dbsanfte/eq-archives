Are these instances designed for 5 man groups?  Can you complete the quests while in a raid?<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that Onyxia and Molten Core were the only real raid zones, but after seeing the Rend Blackhand encounter in upper BRS, I am not sure how 5 people are supposed to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure how quests work in raids (since I haven't raided anything) but from the message boards it sounds a bit messed up.  Like maybe you disband from the raid and then you can loot?  Not sure...</div></div><hr />

Strath and scholo are hard freaking zones with 1 group.  They're a little buggy, and the learning curve is steep, you'll probably die lots until you get the zones figured out.   After that, they're not nearly so bad.   If you're in &quot;kill for loot&quot; mode, it's usually more time effecient to raid them.<br />
<br />
Upper blackrock, MC, Onyxia, Stormwind Rendzevous, and blightcaller are the only quests I've seen flagged as raids so far.</div></div><hr />

I have done these both 1 man, and let me tell ya, its so much easier to just grab 2-3 groups and plow through it, then spend 4-6 hours clearing it with one group. In that time you could have cleared the zones with the raid 2 or 3 times and gotten alot more lot to gear up the guild. <br />

You can do single group quests will still in raid. For the kill quests like boss and what not, drop out of raid just before he dies and you get credit. Also any collect stuff can be done, but once again you have to drop out of the raid, if its drop of boss mob, need to leave before he goes down also. Don't think that is intened to be the way, who knows.</div></div><hr />

UBRS I don't know, as the quests for General Drakk are all labeled raid.  That being said I don't know anyone on my server who really does one group Strath and Scholo anymore or UBRS for that matter.  Most of the time they're done with 10-20 people, kill bosses, collect loot, do quests etc.  For kill/loot quests, you just drop the raid before the mob dies, get kill credit/loot head or whatever, and get invited back.  I'm sure this isn't intended, and I do see Blizzard fixing this one day.  But probably not before they put in the revisions to Strath/Scholo to make them more one group friendly.</div></div><hr />
