<br />
I'm coming here to ask which upgrade path that I should go down. I can probably scrounge up around 150k by the end of the week. I can either buy a Helm of Rallos Zek and completely bankrupt myself, or I can put something like Magnetic or Ornate in that slot and still have 100k+ to play around with for my other slots. I have a 66 beastlord main to do some farming if need be (note the bloodstone of agony), so anything that he can solo or duo with a 7k mana cleric is possible as well. My guild is raiding Ssra and the planes up to Mith Marr at the moment, as well as smaller Luclin targets and 1.5 monters, but I can't get raid loot as my warrior until he hits 60 and I make him my main.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help that you might have  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CCoM is actually a pretty good suggestion for haste, you want to get rid of the Helmet of Raldukan anyway and your back and belt slows are decent.   Besides that, your rings look like a place to get some healthy upgrades in my opinion, Steel Ring of Earthen Resistance x2 would be a good AC/hp boost.   Your weapons are pretty good, Sword of the bloodworn would be a good offhand upgrade but there's no reason to get a wind-worn handblade, not much agro and only a slight bit more dps than sotbs.  Unless you're going to have tons of money flowing in regularly, or ornate/magnetic prices are different on your server than mine, magnetic gives you a lot more bang for the buck, only 5 less AC and 15 hp less than ornate, so all you really lose is the clicky (which isnt a big deal if the bst you farm with is a 2box.)  Other than that it looks like you're looking at fairly expensive upgrades for less return in the other slots, head and rings seem the worst off, although you may want to consider an elemental bow too depending on price, and if you need the see invis from Blindeye.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now I use the Reinforced Sandstone-Hilt thingy over a Sword of the Bloodsworn is because the proc checks at a -100 and provides an actual duration (2 seconds). A string of procs, or just a couple per fight, can provide an extra measure of avoided damage. When the monsters I'm fighting become to high to be stunned by it I'll look into a SotBS or something else.<br />
<br />
The ring suggestion sounds good. The Steel rings go around 30k on my server, but I may be able to scrape the combine items off of an EP-flagged friend and have a guildie do the combine.<br />
<br />
The Fiercely Hooked Claw is something I'm looking for now for sure, and is the single biggest upgrade I can think of outside of a HoRZ at the moment.<br />
<br />
I'm looking into some OoW items, but a lot of the high HP items I can find so far have puny AC, enough that it's almost a lateral upgrade outside of stats and saves at the moment. Pretty sure I'm going to look into spending the money in non-visible areas for more bang-for-my-buck AC/HP wise.<br />

Thanks for all the suggestions</div></div><hr />
