So... the BoC has a better ratio still and should do better DPS, not to mention it still has all those stats and the proc. I also think that with 15 damage weapons you get an extra point added to your minimum hit? I seem to remember reading a while back your offhand hits for 2 when you have a 15 damage or higher weapon at least. Never really paid attention to it myself though.<br />

Great Staff of Thunder is selling for 1000pp in the bazzar right now (of course Dathor Great Hammer going for 250,000pp heh), I find it hard to belive that such cheap junks gonna out dps much of anything.<br />

hummm 3.26 for GSoT vs. 3.00 for my set up .... humm.... <br />
<br />
WMbS rates to 3.46 humm.... at 4000pp well <br />

Windblade 3.29<br />

And how long does it take to camp them? I can camp enough pp to buy a GSoT in 30-45 minutes easily.  Now, I'm not sure how much time it will take you to camp a CHoS and a SotB, but I am prety sure farming plat for half an hour is easier then getting a group to go to droga, getting them both to drop, and then actually winning the roll on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a difference of 1 delay over 1 damage... I'll take the damage. I'm almost positive you'll do more damage with 1 more damage than 1 less delay on any weapon anywhere. The delay difference is so small as to be negligible. Yes I realize a weapon with a larger delay advantage will make a big difference, but I don't believe so with these 2 weapons. I'd borrow a SBoD to do a test, but honestly I don't care!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, this is fucked on so many levels.<br />
<br />
First off, if you're of the level to be needing aggro weapons, then maybe you should have made some friends by now that you can take to Droga with you.  It doesn't take much..I can 2 box both camps, and with a good group, I can CLEAR both camps from one location.<br />
<br />
Second, Droga is some goddamned fine XP, with some decent loot to boot.  15pp/mob average + the nameds aren't really that rare, and you can do an AA in 2 hours being lazy there.  Yes, it's not your PoV XP, but you don't get shit for loot in PoV either.<br />
<br />
If you wanna go farm plat to buy a greatstaff of thunder, that's one thing, but there is absolutely zero, none whatsoever excuses for anyone who does not have SoD/GBoS/BoC or better to go camp those 2 weapons.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, sam, your splitblade of destruction and shortblade of lightning are absolute garbage compared to both droga weapons.  I know it's difficult for you to understand that there are times when you don't know what you're talking about, but put the &quot;I'm better than everyone else because I 6 box&quot; attitude aside and listen to what you're being told.  Those weapons are for rangers...but you're gonna find that out soon enough I'm sure because you refuse to pay any heed to what players more experienced than you are telling you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why are you suggesting CHoS and SotB at the top of the forum to hold agro if GSoT has stun proc, higher DPS and costs 1/20th or less the price? Am I missing somehting here?<br />
<br />
First of all, yes you are correct, there are many easily-available 2-handed weapons that significantly outdamage the SBOD.  This is a fact.  The best of the cheap ones is probably the WMBS as you noticed.<br />
<br />
Why do they suggest CHoS and SotB at the top of the forum?  Because they produce superior AGGRO over the GSoT.  For most of us, aggro is more important than DPS, because the rest of the group is doing things that cause aggro at the same time that the warrior is attacking.<br />
<br />
Your own requirements are different, Sam.  You want the warrior to do 20% damage up front so that your 4 wizards can collectively do the rest of the damage all at once.  Your strategy doesn't need sustained warrior aggro, all you need is for the warrior to do his 20% as efficiently as possible.  That's not how most groups work.<br />
<br />
Your own requirements would be much better served by the best DPS 2-hander that you can get.  In terms of cheap buyable weapons this means the WMBS.  This would accomplish two things: it would get the warrior's part of the damage done faster (probably 15-20% faster), and it would also swing the riposte equation in your favor.<br />
<br />
You'll have a bitch of a time training that skill up, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Guys. Lay off Sam.<br />
<br />
I've nothing but a vague idea of who this guy is. Used to post on Graffe, but that must've been before he did, and i've been first lurking, then posting on steel warrior for a long time.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see right now, he hasn't made any inaproppriate posts yet. So he has a wrong idea of what warriors are, so what? That's the point of posting here, to learn. But instead of constructive criticism (which is what I usually see the the steel warrior gang do) you're all jumping on him and attacking him out of the blue.<br />
<br />
I must assume it's because of some old anger against him or what he did on other boards, since he hasn't stepped on any toes here, but... that makes the community look bad to people like me, who don't know or care what happened last year on boards other than TSW.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
Now, Sam: in reply to your post, I'd sell that SBoD and get your money back, even if you have to take a loss, then spend 4k on a WMBS for damage and 1k on GSoT for agro. Items lose value with time, plat doesn't, which is why it's better to put those expensive one handers you won't be using into the hands of some ranger who will, even at a loss - over time, it'll turn into a gain. <br />
<br />
If you insist on dual wielding, camp or buy the droga weapons. You can buy them after selling the SBoD, in addition to the two 2-handers I've listed, and still have change left over. Warriors aren't there to do damage; so a WMBS is plenty for that (it's the best droppable DPS for a warrior until you get the 2-hand offensive aas, in which case a WB will move ahead), and if you want to keep agro a stun proc is simply necessary since taunt is such an unreliable skill.<br />
<br />
What you're using now undoubtedly works for you, but a warrior and 5 wizards is a highly unusual setup. Sooner or later you'll want to group your warrior with a regular group; maybe to try something different, maybe just to have some human contact - EQ is a social game. In a regular group in your 60s, your current ranger setup will simply NOT work, so why not get the agro weapons and have something that works when 6-boxing, and when grouping too?<br />

<br />
I have the Copper Hammer, just traded the SoTB for another SoLighting (good 8K profit for me heh).<br />
<br />
WMBS is going for 4K right now... I do agree it does have more DPS but as the poster stated it will take me a long time to work the skill up (my current skill is 2). <br />
<br />
Also I just like the way the Split Blade looks to much. Ill post a pic of my warrior soon heh....<br />
<br />
Probably I pick up a WMBS and see whats up with it 4K is nothing, I took in 30K in 3 days again, after I bought the SBoD, but I am very satisfired with my current set up. I am hitting fast and hard, for my level, and someone else said that faster swinging weapons will get agro sooner, dont know if that is true or not. <br />
<br />
Also that 5 foot knockback on the stun proc weapons (one of them) was really anyoning, these non proc weapons kinda keep the mob in the same spot.<br />
<br />
Na I got the set up I want now, I sticking with it until a better 1H dps comes along, humm I know who killed that mob with the 13dam 17del weapon heh... <br />
<br />
Yes eq is social. I can port, KEI, Virtue, Rez and GoD, just guess how many tells I get for buffs sitting in PoT in 5 mintues.<br />

<br />
Well one question is does lower weapon delay cause more agro, i.e. does the mob check per swing? Does swining and missing cause agro.... if so then the lower delay weapons are probably all around better then the 2H...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">IT's a combo of 3 factors ( to my knowledge only 3 ... may god save my soul if I'm wrong )<br />
<br />
first factor - dmg,  the amount of dmg you do per swing<br />
<br />
Second speed - the amount of wrings per a set amount of time<br />
<br />
Procs and proc rates (single catagory for both) - certain weapons proc less or more,  and some weps do not have procs.<br />
<br />
ALL of those things working together in unison creat aggro,  this can be shown in one wep pretty much,  weighted axe,  now bear with me,  ok weighted axe is 45/150 now back when I remember playing with it it seemed like a cool deal hit the mob for 200+ only wait 15 seconds between swings,  NO AGGRO.......<br />
<br />
So yeah,  it's like... you can have a wep swinging hella fast,  and if it's proccing soemthing like a stun or a pure hate procs ( I do NOT reccomend slow effects because last time I checked slow was nerfed for aggro on weps )  Or you can have a wep swinging hard with a good proc,  like ... well this wep is also fast, but BoW.<br />
<br />
So,  it's not one of those things,  it's at least 2,  but speed and dmg do not factor in quite as much as proc,  you need proc somewhere in there.....</div></div><hr />

How can you say misses don't add agro? If a mob is not kos, and you miss it, it still agros. It might be such a small amount (since anything over 0 would agro the mob) but it's probably still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">IT's a combo of 3 factors ( to my knowledge only 3 ... may god save my soul if I'm wrong )<br />
<br />
first factor - dmg, the amount of dmg you do per swing<br />
<br />
Second speed - the amount of wrings per a set amount of time<br />
<br />
Procs and proc rates (single catagory for both) - certain weapons proc less or more, and some weps do not have procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok Assigning 3 points for best and 1 point for worst:<br />
<br />
WMBS Damage 3, Speed 1, Proc 1<br />
CHoS, SoTB: Damage 1, Speed 2, Proc 3<br />
SBoD, SoL Damage 2, Speed 3, Proc 1<br />
<br />
<br />
WMBS seems the worst overall, and the CHoS setup vs. SBoD serup seems fairly close..... Procs have a push back that makes them worse then DPS, so if DPS and Procs are equal DPS is better. Also this list is just for agro generation, clearly more DPS is better then less so again DPS vs. Procs is a plus for DPS. <br />
<br />
I just think overall the SBoD / SoL is the better setup... I like hitting hard and fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also given that weapons proc 2 times a minute on average then your average time to proc is like 15 seconds (10 seconds if the offhand procs 1/2 the time as the main hand and is cumilative to it).... if DPS will lock agro at 10 seonds then proc not doing you a whole lot.<br />
<br />
on a 19delay weapon with 99percnet haste dealy is like 10, so you have 10 swings with main hand and I guess 5 with offhand (is that right) prior to average proc lock... hard to say...</div></div><hr />

<br />
lvl 55 56 is the breakover point for dw vs. 2h dps. as samlancer gets closer to 60 the innate tripple main hand will push 2h dps past dw dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">As Mokor says, 2 handers have an inherent aggro bonus.  You will be surprised at the effectiveness of the WMBS for aggro.  I am quite certain it will outaggro a SBOD+misc.<br />
<br />
For pure DPS aggro, nothing beats 2 handed weapons.<br />
<br />
Generally the reason you see many warriors dual wield instead is because dual wield = dual procs.<br />
<br />
The ideal situation for a warrior is to get the best of both worlds: a 2 handed weapon with a great proc.  But you can count those kinds of weapons on one hand.  So most warriors dual wield if they want procs, and use 2 handers if they want DPS.</div></div><hr />

Dissarms don't add any  significant aggro unless they are used as the first contact agianst the mob.</div></div><hr />

Using the War Master Blade and got skill up to like 80 in a few hours... I yet to see how effective it is as skill to low to really tell. Using NDT and dex is 255.<br />
<br />
One thing because the bonus is delay dependant and not level dependent like the one handers I get the full 21 bonus at level 55.... hummm nice plus there.<br />

Sure nothing to brag about owning a War Master Blade Staff though.</div></div><hr />

That's the point. Not all your weapons/armor have to scream &quot;I own a huge internet penis&quot;<br />
<br />
GSoT is a godsend for aggro, and you probably couldn't give em away nowadays....</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may get away with outtaunting someone with worse ratio weapons (who doesn t backstab), but the second you go defensive (Yes, I actually do use defensive in exp groups; it has saved me plenty of times) there is no way you will hold aggro. You will have to get very lucky to taunt off the slower quickly without a proc too. <br />
<br />
Aggro-wise CHoS imo is superior to either and BoC is in a different league alltogether. <br />
<br />
If you only want to look cool, well.....I m sure you ll leave a good-looking corpse when your group wipes for the 5th time in a row. <br />
<br />
If you want dps, use a WMBS. No droppable 1h combo is likely to outdamage it. <br />

This weekend I was SA for both RC and grumus.   On the flip side I was a dps fan long ago (cant remeber how long its been from 55).<br />
<br />
  I found that with dps weapons set at least once a night I  ping-pong'd from every member in the group and ended in a wipe.  At least with a good weapon poc ( Cooper and Blood set) the ping-pong stops with a proc.  I have been using the copper and blood from the first week they were out and up till now have never lost a shaman or hcanter**, and the shaman I group with slows on inc.<br />

I guess the WMBS is a nice DPS weapon, but since Im 99% MT when I group/raid, I really really dont care about that, and in my groups, all I want is agro, I let the other classes work around the dps. Still, the CHoS and SotB combo is not bad dmg, with a few points in Ingenuity, you can crit those procs and do some wicked dmg (with Ingenuity 1, CHoS crits 238+stun), duoing with a shammy yesterday in PoI to help her get her lvl (she was 59), I was proccing like mad with 280dex, even dual procs one hand right after the other and I was amazed... my point is that the procs can really make up for their not-so-dps-oriented ratios. But then again, I dont look for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Ealsur, look up spell info for force shock on Lucy, you'll find your pushback. CHoS procs force shock.<br />
<br />
As far as 2-handers, a delay of 28-31 does seem to have a sweet spot for damage bonus, so 2-handers with this delay will enjoy a DPS superior to slower, same-ratio weapons because of it.<br />
<br />
Which is why WMBS rocks.</div></div><hr />

But still, its not that bad, I rarely see it, maybe cause every other meele and pets are on the mob's back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get a buddy with a hammer and both stand on the same side of a mob and watch that thing move all over the room...it's pretty big.</div></div><hr />
