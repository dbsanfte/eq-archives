<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went up to PoJ the other night looking for an exit group.  There was only 1 and they were full.  So I plopped down in the other corner while I checked to see if any guildies had a spot for me.  A monk came up and asked if I wanted to start a group with him.<br />
<br />
We made the group and he said he needed a quick afk.  So I start looking for a healer and a slower.  Do a /who cleric and find a 51 out in tranquility.  Send a tell asking if she'd like to join us and she said sure.  Cool.  Do a /who chanter.  Nada.  /who shaman.  Nada again.  Just then I see an /ooc for a 50 chanter.  Get her to come join us.  Cleric, chanter, monk, and me...good start.<br />
<br />
Now for some dps.  Checked for every class under the sun.  Everyone is 60+ or in the 30s.  I see a 53 war shout he's lfg and pick him up.  And I notice the cleric still isn't here.  Do a /who all for the cleric.  She is still in tranquility and its been about 15 minutes.  Send another tell asking if she is still coming.  She says she is.  Ok, try to hurry, everyone is here.<br />
<br />
Everyone asks their friends if they need a spot.  Nobody is on yet.  Cleric is finally in PoJ.  Wait about 5 more minutes.  Cleric is finally at the exit.  Invite her and wait for her to start buffs.  She cast Temp on herself and everyone else said they were good on buffs.<br />
<br />
Quick mana check and the cleric doesn't answer.  We figure she has to be FM, she only cast 1 buff.  Send the other warrior out to pull 1.  He says he has 1 rat inc.  Cleric starts screaming she isn't ready.  Kinda late now isn't it?<br />
<br />
Chanter jumped the gun bad.  Kick hadn't even refreshed and she tashed.  I tried to /shield her but I musta been half a step out of range.  We get agro back and start beating the rat down.  The other warrior is at about 25% health and the rat isnt slowed.  Cleric still isn't doing anything.  I get lucky and finally pull agro.<br />
<br />
We get the rat down to around 25% and i tell the cleric to root the rat before it can run.  She says that rooting isn't her job. WTF?!?!  I tell her that if she doesn't, we are going to get 10 adds and wipe if she doesn't root it right the hell now.  She replies that she didn't have root memmed and we pulled when she wasn't ready.<br />
<br />
Rat runs at 20% health.  We chase it hoping we can catch a lucky streak of crits.  We didn't.  2 rats and a sentry jump us before it died.  We make our way back to the exit hoping the cleric has her head out of her arse by now and will do something.  She hit us each with a HoT and zoned.  I held them off and the other warrior ran for it.<br />
<br />
I disbanded her as soon as I popped in PoK and found another cleric. Got everyone rezzed that needed it and watched the exp roll in.  Made just over a lvl in 3 hours or so.<br />
<br />
But I still gotta wonder how the hell that 1st cleric made it to lvl 51.  How can you take half an hour to get from any part of tranquility to the exits in PoJ and then NOT be ready to fight?  I dunno, I've got her name written down and won't group with her again.<br />

<br />
So, uh ... what was the monk doing? Cause you know, if the monk had been sent to do the pull, he could have FD'd and all that would have been lost was time.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still gotta wonder how the hell that 1st cleric made it to lvl 51.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the same reason that cleric ended up in your group.<br />
<br />
Bad Clerics get groups pretty easily regardless of play skill.<br />
<br />
Tis a sad tale you weave. You have my comfort. At least you had the happy ending of getting things together and getting it going and dinging and having a good time at the end of it all.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun. And be wary of anyone who doesn't have root memmed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or she soloed the whole way up, had a cleric like that in my guild. She had to be told to buff and which spells to cast. Clerics get groups because groups need them, they can completely suck and still get groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of shamans these days are soloing or powerleveling  their way to 50 and then getting groups in the tier 1 planes.  I like grouping with shamans, but lately it seems like I've been getting a string of them in Innovation and justice that malo and slow immediately from 50 feet away and then run around in circles like a level 18 wizard in Oasis, making it very frustrating to try to tank.  I have to give props to the level 56 frog that I was grouped with in Valor the other day though.  He definitely didn't have a huge amount of hps but he stood there and took his licks from those 500 dmg hitters and let me shield him and taunt off of him after slows.  On average though I'm really getting to the point where I prefer to pick up an enchanter just because I've grouped with so many lousy shamans lately.  Not to say that there's no crappy enchanters, but the fact that aggro=death probably 30% of the time for an enchanter in PoP they seem to get the hint faster hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I am noticing alot of these types of players of running around like a chicken with its head I got so sick of it and told them next time they run I am not chasing.  Had a druid in the group as Main healer in POI a level 61 monk was MA and he let the monk get down to 30% before healing.  After 5 tells and 20 in group messages he finally got the hint to heal at 60% later he told us that he never grouped.  I guess that is the problem soloers now getting force to group have no idea how to their job in group roles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt that soloing or ebay would be the cause of a crap lvl51 cleric.  Just blame EQ's group dynamic that requires 1 in 6 players be clerics.  <br />
<br />
I know lvl65 clerics who have been playing the game less than 5 months.  Sure you can guarantee they wont get a group if another healer is LFG, but eventually there will be 5 peeps who are sick of sitting on their arses not getting XP for long enough to invite them, and there will still be a score of warriors and knights sitting at the GY with LFG on.<br />
<br />
If you hate LFG just roll up a cleric or a slower and once you hit 50 your LFG days will be over.  My enchanter hit 65 with 30 days played not because I always got phat XP, I rarely solo'd and was never power levelled, but I always had a group within 15 mins of logging on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One the other side of that issue I ran into a level 55 shaman last week who was the bomb. Buffed me better then I ever been buffed and rebuffed before I even knew the buffs where low. Had a great group all togther that night got 55 it was awesome. I know alot of people hate pickup groups and if i had my choice I would stay away from them to. But you are almost always gonna get into the postion of having to jump into one so just try to make the best of it.</div></div><hr />
