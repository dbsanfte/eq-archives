I would say no for Sinister Strikes.<br />
Of course yes for Weapon Affinity.<br />
A yes for rampage.<br />
I guess a no for Tactical mastery as you dont need to hit to proc.<br />
A sorta/kinda for Stalwart Endurance as less stuns means more attacks.</div></div><hr />

More attacks does not increase your proc rate.  All weapons (minus a short list) proc at a given 2 per minute (mainhand) and 1 per minute (offhand) on average.  There was a thread on this board covering this, with long parses as well.  The weapon proc % is now shown on lucy's site (lucy.allakhazam.com), if no value is listed then it would be 100% aka 2ppm/1ppm.  Items like Bloodfrenzy show 155% which means 2ppm * 1.55 = 3.1ppm main and 1.55ppm offhand.<br />
<br />
It was meant to specifically cover how much Combat Effects (CE) and Weapon Affinity (WA) increase your chance to proc.  So, I'd say rampage has no bearing, just like haste does not increase your proc rate (average).  Due to the fact that proc rate is measured against time, independent of # attacks / etc.<br />

More attacks due to a change in relative weapon delay does not increase your proc rate. More attacks with no change in relative weapon delay does increase your proc rate.<br />
<br />
Proc rate is based on the delay of a weapon. If a weapon has 20 delay, the combat engine expects that weapon to swing 30 times in 1 minute. Of those 30 swings, there will be 2 procs or a 6.6% chance to proc on any given swing.<br />
<br />
Now if we add more attacks without changing the delay of the weapon - ambidexterity, PB, flurry, rampage, ferocity - you still have the same weapon delay so you still have a 6.6% chance to proc on any given swing. The difference is now instead of 30 swings in a minute, you have 40 swings per minute. This could change your proc rate to 2.6 PPM. This phenomenon can be seen by using an Earthshaker and rampage, procs out the wazoo. Of course the numbers are purely made up, but the theory is accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor is correct.  Extra attacks such as Flurry and ferocity and PB do increase procs per minute.  Extra ripostes do not increase procs per minute since for some strange reason you cannot proc on a riposte.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, flurries themselves are good agro generators (more swings) and it does look like the others do increase proc rate (proc / time).<br />
<br />
Stalwart endurace would probably be useful for increasing agro in those that get stunned, because of the reasons indicated.  While stunned, you arnt swinging, thus LOWERING your proc rate.<br />
<br />
It, i think, is important to understand proc rate = proc / time.  not proc / swing, which none of these change (except haste as has been discussed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If this is true, this explains alot.  I have maxed offensive aa's,<br />
including WA5. <br />
<br />
Backround info: BOC Anger 3 primary | SOD w/ Anger 3 offhand.<br />
<br />
Now until recently my BOC was always in my primary, the dps seemed to be a tad better to hold through streaky procs, as it is (slightly) more dps, and the 700 eb plus A3 aug, outweighed agro of the sod proc with anger 3, slightly, or so I thought...<br />
<br />
So, I'm pulling in ldon hard, pally is tanking pulling mobs off me with stun on inc.<br />
<br />
I swap to my sod because my agro from procs was kind of an issue, wasnt able to attack much because I'm procing non stop and the mobs are following me.<br />
<br />
Sod gets swapped to my primary.  I'm thinking as long as I dont taunt, the procs from sod should be slightly less hate, plus in a hard mission, i need backup agro in case the pally died.<br />
<br />
To my suprise, it (*FELT*)  like I was procing more, and I certaintly<br />
had more agro, there was some lucky procs there were just insane, chain proc x 5-7 in a row, things like that.<br />
<br />
MOving on I started notice more agro with sod in my primary, again gut feeling, *felt like procs were less streaky*.<br />
<br />
Now SOD is always in my primary, there have been so many times<br />
in the past I have questioned which is better agro. Since the raw dps without procs is so slight, the agro from both weapons are so close...only made it harder to decide.<br />
<br />
It was always a toss up. I'd loose agro and go, damit maybe ill swap again... lol, it was all in my head until WA5.  I have really noticed less streakiness with SOD primary, and this post confirms it.<br />
<br />
I was determined to find a post that declairs weapon delay directly affects proc rates.  WA5 only makes delay stand out more,<br />
2 delay or not.<br />
<br />
Unless someone cares to post that this delay affecting proc rates theory is off?</div></div><hr />

I dont have an accurate parser atm, and many of them are to confusing for me with all the intervals.<br />
<br />
I'm not claiming i know for a fact that weapon delay affects proc rate, I was merely going off (wandor's) post, which seemed to support this.<br />

Unless I misunderstood him?<br />

Proc rate is based on the delay of a weapon. If a weapon has 20 delay, the combat engine expects that weapon to swing 30 times in 1 minute.</div></div><hr />

I am under the impression that you can only proc once per combat round. Meaning whether you swing once with that weapon, or double, or triple, or quad (with  PB or Fero) that you can only proc once in that round. If this is the case, then PB, Fero would do nothing for proc rate, but Ambi would, since it actually give you additional &quot;rounds&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Unless I misunderstood him?  I think you misunderstand. Lower delay &lt;&gt; more procs. When relating weapon delay to procs, all that a change in delay does is change the % chance that a particular weapon will proc on a single swing. This is because most weapons proc 2 times per minute. In order to calculate a weapon's chance to proc on a single swing you would divide the number of procs per minute for that weapon (2 PPM for almost everything a warrior swings) by the number of expected swings in 1 minute.<br />
<br />
SoD = 2 PPM, unhasted 18 delay = 33.3 swings per minute (60/1.8)<br />
Chance to proc = 2/33.3 = 6% chance per swing<br />
41% Hasted SoD = 2 PPP, 41% more swings = 46.95 swings per minute<br />
Chance to proc = 2/46.95 = 4.2% chance per swing<br />
<br />
Now lets say that you ding 60 and now you get triple attack. The delay of your weapon has not changed. However, due to your new skill, you swing your weapon 10% more than you did before. This is where it gets tricky. Since the delay has not changed, your SoD is still going to have a 6% chance to proc on any given swing. Since you are swinging more than the expected 33.3 swings per minute unhasted, your PPM fgoes up.<br />
<br />
unhasted 33.3 swings per minute X 10% extra sings due to triple attack = 36.6 attack<br />
Each attack has a 6% chance to proc, so 36.6 x 6% = 2.19 procs per minute<br />
<br />
When you start adding more skills/AAs that increase the number of attacks your weapon makes, your proc rate will continue to rise. Of course this is pretty simplified for the sake of getting the point across.</div></div><hr />

You can however proc every time your weapon swings. A single rampage can proc multiple times if there are enough mobs in range and the chance to proc/swing is high enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belwolf</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gotta agree with wandor, as much as it pains me to agree with anyone lol. i have seen more procs as i swing more with more haste and ferocity3 and PB2.  i have four procs but that cannont account for the strings of procs i haven seen and since parses don't measure anything under 1 second gotta go with gut feeling.<br />
now if anyone has a parsers that proves my gut wrong tell me but it has to measure 1/10th a secound and qauds otherwise i'll go with my gut.<br />
<br />
people may disagree but i am loved for my agro even by necros who are agro magnets and if ya don't believe they are duo with one lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor Knows what he's talking about.<br />
<br />
Now, all the math tells you what the random number generator will do on average--that is, with a large enough sample, the procs you experience will converge on the average that Wandor describes.<br />
<br />
The real trick is to get your weapon to proc at exactly the right time--when mob suddenly takes a distinct dislike to your slower or healer, for example, and you've got to get the mob of 'em NOW.<br />
<br />
To do this, you have to hold your mouth just right while crossing the index and middle fingers of your left hand, making sure that the index finger is crossed OVER the top of your middle finger (unless you're left-handed, in which case use the same fingers, but on your right hand, and make sure that the MIDDLE finger goes over the index finger).</div></div><hr />
