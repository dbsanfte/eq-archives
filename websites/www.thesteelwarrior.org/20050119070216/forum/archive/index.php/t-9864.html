<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me and my guild have been trying these raids a few times now (3 attempts on Specialization, 2 on Foresight and 2 on Corruption) and I was wondering if you guys could clear some things up for me. To be clear I am *Not* looking for strats here, my guild enjoys a challenge and loves new content, but theres a few questions which will save us time if you guys know the answer to it. Also we field usually 42-49ish on these raids so you have an idea of what we work with (Thanks WoW and EQ2 ;p )<br />
<br />
Firstly, our gear level: We've farmed qvic most days for about a month or so and have done Kelekdrix in Inktu'ta 2 times, the latest with 30, but are stuck on mites atm. Do you think these trials are doable with this sort of level of gear or should we not expect alot until we have Inktu'ta cleared?<br />
<br />
Second, in Arcana(Specialization) is the AE blockable/dodgable? I couldn't see a way on Lucy looking at the spell data, atm we've done MGB heals/group heals and slugged him down (50% lowest before we lost tanks to unlucky spell dmg). I noticed it use to be NPC hatelist but got changed so can't memblur it to just the tank, and now with the neg check from debuff, resisting them is about out of the question.<br />
<br />
Third, in Simon Says, the &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Run around&quot; emotes, seemed to hit alot, even when they did what was asked, stop especially would get people if they were not already standing still. Are these always like this or was it just our raid not doing what was needed? (aka slacking)<br />
<br />
Finally in Corruption, we've done the first wave (hard not to win that hehe) but the second wave is hitting hard, we know to get the rogues first as thier dps is high but it seems we loose alot on the initial inc of 12 NPC's all bunched together, and then the Shadow stepping rogues with Mezzes and charms is doing us in, tonight we managed to get nearly both rogues down but the Caster NPC's had erroded most our healers. Question is, is there something to do about the casters, stuns seemed to bounce off them, and is there a better way to CC the rogues than running around hoping taunt gets off?<br />
<br />
Any help is much appreciated, and I'll edit this clear if poeple think it's too spoilerish or asking to much, just looking for some pointers.<br />
We intend to try it again, so people saying &quot;Go try and learn&quot; premepted you ;p<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

Yes but it will be significantly harder than if you were a Txevu / Tacvi guild.<br />

Spellshield gear helps but, but thats sorta part of question one.<br />

Probably afk'ers and slackers.<br />

<br />
Trial and error, depending on your guild and the numbers you field of different classes, different things are going to work here, its really something you have to work through for the most part.<br />
<br />
If my answers are sorta vague its intentional, just for the record  ;p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys just what I was looking for :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for power<br />
TM rog, stun cle , kill enc faster ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good to know Gulug that it's doable at this level, our raid had about 5-8 apps so that could of been our downfall a bit but as I said before gonna go back and keep trying it.<br />
<br />
For power we we're doing rogues first but getting charmers dead may be a better way, thanks for the idea Issu :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can &quot;block&quot; the AE.<br />
<br />
There are actually 8 AEs -- four are unresistable debuffs, and four are the DDs that hurt you.<br />
<br />
The unresistable debuffs are cureable (I think 45 counters, so not easy really) and last for something like 30 seconds.  They lower one resist by a large amount (200?)<br />
<br />
The DDs are tied to the unresistable debuffs, and are -300 resist check.  Cure the dot, get your resists back up, then resist the AE.  The DD AE goes off about 18 secs after the AE.<br />
<br />
So, THEORETICALLY you could cure the Debuff, then resist the -300 (rather than the theoretical -500 resist check with the debuff on you).  It's not viable to block everybody's, but if you have a lot of shm/pal with cures, you could cut down the DPS a group takes (and then have healers who only need to do single-target heals to get those who werent cured, rather than mana-intensive group heals)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for this:<br />
<br />
Third, in Simon Says, the &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Run around&quot; emotes, seemed to hit alot, even when they did what was asked, stop especially would get people if they were not already standing still. Are these always like this or was it just our raid not doing what was needed? (aka slacking)<br />
<br />
It's not slacking...at least not for stop.  For stop moving, you need to be standing in THE EXACT location the message gave.  That's what our guild has the most trouble with handling as well.  As for move, the hint I'll give you is that you just need to move from your spot where you get the message..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Simon Says, the only time you should ever move is when you get a move emote.  That means if you're standing in a platform with nothing on it as the result of a move, you stay there until they tell you to move again (it'd be better if you moved to somewhere that you can hit stuff, though).  Moving without seeing an emote is simply asking to get nailed by a stop emote while moving.  You will not be able to stop on time to react to a stop emote if you're already moving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're gonna bop yourself on the head once you figure out how easy stonemites are.  I still feel like a Doltz for the times it took to figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe good to know, Inktu'ta and MPG raids have been the most fun we've had, when we first tried Kelekdrix I was puzzling for hours over the nukes with AE heals etc, until we realised it's more simple than what we were looking for and it worked well.<br />
<br />
As for the Stonemites, last time the first &quot;Group&quot; got Mited as the raid went the opposite way to them, wiped the grin off my face when Lightblues we're hitting for 600...and there was 15 of them :( Oh and the spike traps &gt;.&lt; got to get the rogues to work next time.<br />
<br />
All in all a ton more fun than Uqua (bleh) and farming PoTime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corpsed</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For Simon Says, when I get move message I run a lap, but sometimes still get hit?  Is it like a quadrant thing? Like if you are south have to move n,e, or w?  The other ones I have np dodging, just the multiple move messages get me sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at each of the 6 platforms the Dragorns are, moving from one platform at the start of a move to another platform is always enough.  Moving from any one platform to the center platform is also always enough.  If you only move when being told to move and move exactly one platform away (to side or to center), you'll always end up either at the side platforms or the center platforms so you don't have to worry about roomwide AEs either.  <br />
<br />
If you get two consecutive moves and you're not sure if the first one is off, I usually go to the center platform during this time since it's easy to trace a path that's always safe from the first move, and then run back to starting point if I get another move emote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried again last night, think we may have Corruption on next try and got alot further in Simon says. Cheers guys for all the pointers.</div></div><hr />
