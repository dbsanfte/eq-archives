9. Retriving augments from old equipment is wonderful, BUT because of type 7 and 8 armor doesn't fairly prevent players from having to redo up to ~10k Adventure Points as they move into Type 8 armor.<br />

10. Warriors do a range of activities from soloing, two-boxing, grouping, casual raiding, hardcore raiding, etc. Warriors ought to be a viable and fun to play class in all of these environments even WITHOUT having to buy OoW and getting the improvements in these opprotunities hinted at in the advertising.<br />
<br />
11. Raids and even trials are starting to take 3-5 hours. In many cases this is too much time for anyone to devote to playing a game on a regular basis.<br />

12. Tradeskills are still for the most part not worthwhile.<br />

There are hundreds of more issues. Feel free to add some if you like.<br />

#1 was the catalyst for me to cancel my accounts and quit playing for a couple weeks because I feared this would become common in OOW.<br />
<br />
#2 There isn't much need for anything a warrior has available.  It is just so sad that a paladin with no mana can be so close to a warrior you would need an 10 hour parse to notice the difference.  Then you add their spells and if the warrior doesnt have 3 to 5 k more hp or something, it is silly to pick the warrior.<br />
<br />
#4 This will totally destroy any hope of balance.<br />
<br />
#5 I think this is a good thing.  If there is no diminishing returns all the way up to 3100 ac as parsed, why do people care?  I mean, if you can't find the soft cap, that is a GOOD THING.<br />
<br />
#6 Not much my uncreative mind can think to give us that would matter.  I guess they could take the easy way out and give us stuns that work to level 75 with no recast time.  Where would that leav sk's with two classes instead of just one destroying any hope of usefulness a SK may have.<br />
<br />
#7 GoD is still too much of a pita for a warrior.  Spell agro is sky high, so if you don't group with 200 AA enchanter, shaman, or cleric, why group in GoD?  I mean when a 130 AA cleric can't start a CH **after** the mob hits the tank and not get agro, there is a major problem.  So how long should they wait to heal?  Until the tank is dead?  Why bother slowing?  Slow too soon the enchanter is tanking.  I have done vxed runs where the cleric died 27 times (I counted my logs) in 5 hours.  The cleric had 130 AA, but didn't have LR5/ID5.  If she ever got agro she was dead (mob just one rounds her.)<br />
<br />
#8 I am playing WoW now, but it also has it's problems.  At this point, if WoW were released I would probably be playing WoW.  I just don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't see what they could do to make warriors useful in EQ that wouldn't have the paladins screaming bloody murder.  I don't think SoE is likely to avoid putting insane stuns in game with OOW.  I don't see them giving any reason to pick a warrior over a paladin in ANY content right now.  I see how powerful the paladin lobby is and how much it seems they may be successful in taking over all MT duties when OOW is released.  They certainly are not shy about saying that is what they want (to be able to tank every single mob in game just as a warrior can today, but with their spells to add.)<br />
<br />
#12 this is a dead horse.  It was killed when every item got rec/req level (which discourages trading/buying/selling items) and the death blow from adding JCM (which taught everyone that all tradeskill combines are 95 percent successful and as a result, you can ALWAYS sell the parts for more than you can sell the end product with &quot;average&quot; success rates which is between 25 percent and 75 percent for non JCM combines.)  So basically no one buys/sells anymore (average people in auction channel has declined from 200 ish to 70 to 100 today) and no one except enchanters actually make money from combines.  I have 1750 tradeskills and there isn't a single combine I would waste my time doing, I just sell the drops in the baz.  I make more money that way.</div></div><hr />

brenlo said so himself<br />
In the past, the Warrior Class Description coupled with Defensive defined our role. One could argue (and I have) that for all parctical purposes &quot;brutal&quot; battles are high DI mobs where you benefit from a Warrior using Defensive. Since raid boss mobs are generally high DI, this is consistant with the tools we have been given and our traditional role.<br />
<br />
SoE has stated (I'd quote it if I could find it) that they are reviewing class designs to insure all class have a role and are fun to play throughout the game in any sized party. They also stated they would not remove from classes their traditional roles.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping SoE does exactly this. It's overdue. Unfortunately, players are unlikely to have any input into this process. SoE does not want to either initiate or participate in spirited debate with their customers. I don't know if this is because they are convinced as professionals they know best, or if they think it creates the wrong out of game atmosphere. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistiv</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for fun going to respond to every suggestion. s<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  You still have furious, gimped the boss mobs and even though we can't use defensive discs we still tank about 14 percent better than a sk/pal. doesnt sound like much but when you roughly have to chain SL/HL to keep a warrior up that 14 percent really matters.  These were also 1 group trials so it is pretty silly that you lock down the group with cleric/warrior every time. (oh yea another good thing that came from this is they fixed the BDA pet exploit.)<br />
<br />
2. 14 percent mitigation difference as stated above. to put that in perspective an elemental geared Sk tanks about as good as a VT geared warrior.  They nerfed defensive only in one group content so far and that is all they have even hinted at doing.<br />
<br />
3. Great debate on this but im 90 percent sure that anger procs still give the aggro just dont do the damage or the stun part of the proc.  I base this on exping in qvic quite a bit and having same aggro as i did in kod taz-<br />
<br />
4. Can elaborate on this please but if you are worried that soe is going to let pallidans keep a level 60 mob stunned for a whole fight then you are just being silly. <br />
<br />
5. Not important information for us to have?<br />
<br />
6.  Why don't we wait until we get some more information before we complain about this?<br />
<br />
7. The 3 inku'ta + guilds on my server have had more members come back lately than leave. Are people on other servers having problems? What do you base your people leaving at an alarming rate on? <br />
<br />
8. How is this a warrior problem?  In my opinion WoW will be just like every other mmorpg. People leave and come back. WoW just has lots of hype thanks to FoH<br />
<br />
9. Another just silly question. Wait for them to implement this before you complain. Personally I hope they make it so you do have to get whole new augs for type 8 gear. Welcome to high-end.<br />
<br />
10. You can go 2box bot all you want and stay level 65. heck dont buy kunark just stay level 50 and farm vox.  If you don't want to buy an expansion don't complain about not getting the benefits from it.<br />
<br />
11. This is actually the only one i can agree with. <br />
<br />
12. I guess this one i am not totally against but like most Eq players just dont care about.</div></div><hr />

BB<br />
<br />
<br />
you dont have to be the best tank to be a tank, that is my point.<br />
<br />
people would rather kick that leather bound tome under the rug and bitch about not having the warrior 5% bonus, not having duel weild, not having defensive, and not having all the same tanking AAs than rather count their blessings, i consider all of the above the things they decided to discard in favor of a spell book, anything more is rather silly.<br />
<br />
mist i'd like to see your proof that ALL warriors mitigate 14% better, that is itemization, and 14% better than what? it is like being able to go 150 MPH, why would you want a car that can go that fast when there is no real benefit? it is wasted power.<br />
<br />
if you didnt know furious was also effected by the nerf, you loose your place on the aggro list, thing is, that you only loose your place by so much hate per tic that the discpline is active, furious is so short you hardly notice if you have a good aggro set up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The AC softcap question has raised it's head yet again because a DoE developer was kind enough to let us know shield AC was not diminished by the softcap - making it appear that shields were a possitive benefit.<br />
<br />
SoE has also suggested that reching the softcap was significant to give all of the defensive-type AA abilities best-effect.<br />
<br />
Brael has probably done the most extensive parsing of anyone recently looking for the softcap and he can't find it~! Frodlin has made a few suggestions that Warirors favor AC on items, augs, and buffs - very reasonable if the effects of adding AC is constant given what players can achieve.<br />
<br />
The days of Verant giggling while Warriors equipped Executioners Hoods and Fire Emerald rings are over. Players have invested YEARS of effort to discover reasonable guidelines for equipping themselves. They DESERVE to know how Guard II, Avoidance, Shielding, and AC works. And they are entitled to not to be misled by a Developer asserting shields are a positive benefit because they aren't subject to the softcap - if the softcap is 5000AC, then such a statemnt is bunk.<br />

I have to agree with BB, why cant they tell us? the already let casters know what each and every last focus effect does, have even put spell effect listings on the spells themselves, you dont even need to look at a spell book or sit anymore(horses)<br />

They wouldn't mind if there were a line of no-drop tradeskill items that were possible to make at a level that such items could be reasonably useful.<br />
I assume that on some level tradeskills were partly designed to give players a reason to interact with each other, and to develop characters in interesting ways. With few exceptions, mudflation has increased so much faster than useful tradeskill combines that neither of these goals is really being met. Tradeskills mainly function as a means of syphoning plat out of the game, and to give bored lvl 65 characters something to do (Hmmm. No raid this afternoon? Let's see...what to do...well, I guess I could GM brewing....).</div></div><hr />

In my guild (mostly post-PoTime) 5ish goodbyes and 2+ taking a break posts in 30 days. In many other guilds, active recruitment. Several top guilds having left and not returned post GoD adjustments. Many of my acquaintences spending non-raid days and even some raid days playing CoH or WoW beta.<br />
<br />
SoE did not fly people in for the summit because things were going well. Make a list of the actual changes to EQ in the last 30 days - it's a little anemic. More is planned 'tis true and Rome wasn't built in a day, BUT every level 65 guilded raiding player that departs requires backflagging and re-equipping a new recruit.<br />
<br />
A lot of guilds felt their wheels were spinning wildly in GoD and a lot of casual players felt almost totally excluded. SoE may be making changes, but they have not affected the vast majority of players who for a variety of reasons do not even bother to do GoD groups at this time.<br />

<br />
Uhm, BB, why are you being a jerk?  This is not the outhouse.<br />
<br />
He made a druid 3 years ago, but stopped playing him at least 2 years ago in favor of a warrior.  He chose to go by Kalanu because it's a tribute to his Cherokee heritage, and it was the name of his Guide-like character in Ultima Online as long as 4 years ago.  Changing his online handle to Tsaotsao would be absolutely ridiculous.<br />
<br />
That said, no offense BB, but I'd rather see somebody else moderate and decide what is listed as warrior concerns on our site.  I expect your list to include a lot about Tanking Parity (and spellbook superiority).  (note: I also would not even expect myself to be capable of doing this -- people like you, me, pumilio, and daemonwynd have proven that we should not be put into a situation where we act as the Voice of Warriors, lest we lose our cool)</div></div><hr />

Sorry you think I'm being a jerk. Tsaotsao afaik has posted under the Warrior name here at TSW. His sig over at SoE's site is Tsaotsao. His Druid's name, post handle, and name he was introduced as by whatsherfish on the SoE boards can be corrected as I outlined. I assume his WARRIOR name also has some significance to him and it would be a nice gesture by SoE to rewind and use it. I'm faulting SoE in this, not Tsaotsao. Not a good customer relations move.<br />
<br />
I'm semi-aware of his history as a Druid and as a Wariror. I bothered to look it up. Frankly, I don't much care. To be perfectly honest, I would have been happiest if Frodlin had recieved this role (any shouting he did was as a result of provocation). But let's remember this is a SoE selection for an SoE role, not one made by the Warrior community.<br />
<br />
And I agree, there's not a Warrior pasionate about the issues with a posting history about them that either SoE or the various communities would be happy with.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you remember &quot;Tank Parity (and Spellbook superiority)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you remember &quot;Tank = survivability + aggro&quot; [not that all tanks should be equal, obviously a 100% tank should be the best] AND<br />
<br />
&quot;The Warrior HP advantage is ~386HP after AoTC.&quot; AND<br />
<br />
The Warrior Class Description [I'd repeat it, but I think most readers are familiar with it by now eheh.] AND<br />
<br />
the various other debates Warriors that are actually concerned with the state of their class engaged in.<br />
<br />
I shan't apologise for either my ardor or phrase making - you can't pound a nail with a marshmallow, it takes repeated blows with a hammer.<br />

<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Im sorry but 30 minute parses trying to prove additional returns from a shield is 100% useless.  Parse shit so that its sound statictically.  He has parsed nothing worthwhile to the effect of proving a softcap.  You also have to realize the ac softcap is a function of the mobs attack.  So if the mob has 2k attack your softcap will be roughly 2k.  After 2k your additional ac will have far less effect.  You can parse this in pvp very effectively and noticable.  Take a mob like rallos in time who has a very high attack.  I didnt see a drop in ac until about 26-2700 ac.<br />
<br />
Edit oh yeah god expeditions take way too long.  Im not logging on for more than 5 hours at a time after 10 hours at work for anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The irony of you taking a tiny sample of Brael's parses (that which has to do with the shields) and calling them worthless because they represent a small sample size cannot be overlooked.<br />
<br />
Breal has been running the most extensive tests available since GoD release.   While they could be better done, they're the most commonly available, and most extensive available.   They run the gamut from regular mobs to Ikkinz, etc.  <br />
<br />
I suspect that to see the effectiveness of shields at 'raising the softcap', a low level, low atk mob would be more effective, since you KNOW you're at the softcap for that mob, and seeing improvement would confirm this.   <br />
<br />
In other words, if the goal of the test is to see if shields add benefit while below the softcap for the mob, then it's appropriate to test at a higher AC point and see if you see any improvement.   You have then confirmed that you're below the softcap.    Then to attempt to see the difference in tankability while at the same AC (or as close to possible) with shield and without it.  This seems to be precisely what Brael was getting at.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, don't jump on the only aspect of Brael's data that you've seen and assume that that is his entire collection any more than going &quot;Pfft, the Beatles have only 14 songs&quot; based on the fact that you've only heard one record.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To put that in perspective, 14% is wrong.  :p<br />
<br />
Mitigation advantage is more like 4-8% depending on the mob (because the effect of -1 DI will vary).  Warriors generally  have more hit points, though in comparable gear/AA levels I don't think it's a lot.  Hit points is not the same as mitigation though.</div></div><hr />
