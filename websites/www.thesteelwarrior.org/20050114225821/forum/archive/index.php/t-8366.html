<br />
I am sure you get tired of the &quot;Could you look at my gear and give me advice on upgrades path&quot; posts.   However, I have about 100K to spend and was wondering if there is anything worth buying as an upgrade bazaar wise.  <br />
<br />
You can check out Kilamana magelo in my Sig.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

You're gear looks good with very little to upgrade in the bazaar. You might look into the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest to get rid of that Lodi shield. <br />
<br />
If you're really looking to do a few small upgrades you could look for a Ear Symbol of the Veteran and/or Tear of the Rainmaker to give a little more AC/HP in the ears or a Steel Ring of Earthen Risiliance(sp?) would upgrade the Valorium rings. However I'd wait until I could afford a BoC or Helm of RZ if I were you.</div></div><hr />
