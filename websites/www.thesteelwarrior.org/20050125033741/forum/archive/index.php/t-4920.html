<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, now that I can actually use Furious (thx for the different timers SOE!), I need advice on a tradeable high dmg wpn to take advantage of the ripostes.  I don't want to spend more than 5 to 10k (preferably less) since I'll only use it when Furious is on.  Also, are there any easy to obtain no-drop wpns that would be better?  (something that a group of 63 to 65 non-uber types could obtain without days and days of camping)<br />
<br />
Second, since I'm always grouped with a 65 chanter, what % haste should I have on my haste item?  I currently use CoCW and was going to upgrade to CoF until the prices got screwed on Emarr (CoF went from 50k to 150k+)...but, if I'm not getting the full benefit from the 36% haste I could get a lesser haste aug and sell the CoCW to buy some other stuff I need...like ornate.  ;) <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You can get it free for about 30 minutes of travel and killing at the fort in FM.  I'm guessing that with Furious, the Axe would be pretty brutal and the price is damn cheap.  Absolutely useless for anything but Furious though.<br />
<br />
Any of your standard high damage, high ratio weapons would work though, Tantor's Tusk, Windblade, etc.<br />
<br />
The best droppable weapon for this is probably the Dathor Great Hammer, something like a 72/93 2hb.  For some reason the prices on these have always been stupidly high, I've never seen one under 70k despite the fact that it is useless for anything except eyecandy.  Then again, maybe that is a server thing.</div></div><hr />
