<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my guild board:<br />
<br />
1. Death scene: A very cool and impressive death involving a great deal of violence, bloodspray, and dramatic music. The warrior immediately dies, but the enemy mob takes 10,000 damage from overacting. <br />
<br />
2. Remezzing: When a warrior screws up and breaks a chanter's mez, said warrior can immediately re-engage mez by apologizing profusely to the now-battered chanter and promising to be a good boy/girl from now on. <br />
<br />
3. Cowardice: A warrior should be able to instantly FD when he/she falls below ten percent health while the cleric is discussing strategy with the druid and the shaman is teaching his/her dog how to roll over and shake hands. <br />
<br />
4. HOLY @#%$: A warrior can succor (casting time 1.5) when pulling and turning a corner to find twenty-four red mobs looking at him/her like a finely marinated and barbequed ribeye. <br />
<br />
5. KAG: Kiss Ass Goodbye: A warrior can close his/her eyes and perform a feat of impressive contortionism when being told that he/she is going to pull and tank a mob fully capable of killing GMs. <br />
<br />
6. Sharing the Love: The warrior forms a link between him/herself and the entire group. When the warrior dies, so does the entire group. <br />
<br />
7. MINE DAMMIT! The warrior will automatically beat the /ran 100 rolls of any caster on any melee-only item. <br />
<br />
8. Wile E Coyote: Automatically activated skill that will allow a warrior to survive a fall of up to 10,000 paces with 10 health left by releasing a large cloud of smoke at the site of impact and creating a warrior-shaped hole in the ground. <br />
<br />
9. Mounted Bonus: Warriors on horseback/lizardback receive +100 to ATTK, AC, and a 50 damage bonus just so we have a reason to buy one of the damn things. <br />
<br />
10. Mine's Bigger than Yours Is: Warriors can instantly enlarge breast and/or penis size up to 200 percent so they feel less inadequate, and no longer have to rely upon 2-handed slashers to compensate. <br />
<br />
11. Pet: Warriors can summon a rabid pit bull of their own level without any names like 'Jarer' 'Kabober' or 'Jibn'. They would have names like &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Slayer&quot;, &quot;Eviscerator&quot; or &quot;One Mean Bastard&quot;. <br />
<br />
12. Psyche Out: This skill allows a warrior to essentially cast a fear spell on a mob by trash talking, flexing, and puffing his/her chest out. <br />
<br />
13. Emergency Invisibility: The warrior immediately falls down, curls into the fetal position, and covers his/her own eyes. Success is not guaranteed each time this skill is used. Chanting 'find the happy place, find the happy place' can improve the odds of success. <br />
<br />
14. Bitch Slap: When a green mob aggros the warrior, he/she can give the mob a disgusted look, slap it across the face (or similar appendage), and cause the mob to instantly lose aggro and flee. This will also work for PvP. <br />
<br />
15. Sphincter Reinforcement: The warrior appears calm, collected, and infinitely composed when faced with certain and total annihilation, even laughing and singing in the face of gory, painful death while the rest of the group loses control of bodily functions. <br />
<br />
16. Ask Nicely: The warrior can drag his/her corpse past high aggro mobs without being attacked. For use on CR's. <br />
<br />
17. Flashback: The warrior suffers an immediate attack of post-traumatic-stress syndrome and goes berserk, regardless of health level. Warriors already berserk become &quot;Nucking Futs&quot;, and every successful hit is treated as a critical, with critical hits being treated as crippling blows. <br />
<br />
18. I'm Not Quite Dead: Warriors reduced to zero health can cling to the edge of life for up to ten minutes, allowing the group healer to complete his/her masturbation and actually cast a healing spell on them. <br />
<br />
19. Buff Bod Factor: Warriors can instantly tell the true gender of every player, and will strongly attract (RL)hawt members of the opposite sex by flexing and striking various seductive poses. <br />
<br />
20. Punt: Warriors that have become annoyed with gnomes or halflings can kick them into other zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;In order to keep this skill running for its entire duration the warrior must periodically say things such as...<br />
<br />
I'm not dead...<br />
I'm feeling much better...<br />
I think I'll go for a walk...<br />
and I feel HAPPY!!</div></div><hr />
