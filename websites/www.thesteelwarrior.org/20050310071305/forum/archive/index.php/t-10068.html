<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chuckles</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My friend wants to start the game (despite EQ2 and WoW being out, his friends are here), but we can't provide much twinkery and Plvling, have tasks and stuff made it even worth trying to start up as a warrior now, with a reduced lower level populace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If he has friends in the game, it doesn't matter how many people are on who are not his friends.<br />
On the other hand, if half of his friends are already tanks, he might try something else if he intends to play with them eventually.<br />
It's not that expensive to provide a warrior with useable gear for the first 50ish levels. Before that point, your friend will really like playing a warrior or he won't. If he does, heh, he'll put up with the problems of finding better gear. If he doesn't, he'll switch to something else.<br />
I wouldn't worry too much about not being able to twink/pl to the max. In some ways, it's detrimental to a new player to level too fast/be too twinked.<br />
I think warriors are the most fun class to play (though I certainly haven't played them all). I think that because I like to tank. If I didn't like to tank, warriors would be about the worst class to play. Your friend will know after being in one half-way decent, non-pl'd group in M Seru or DSP or OT what he thinks (I don't think he'll know in PC, because that's a bar fight, not a tanking situation). If he gets to level 33 and he doesn't like tanking, he'll do something else. If he does like it, you won't be able to talk him out of the warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the new stuff out there make our solo life much easier than before thus a solo newbie will do better now than before ... untill a given point where he will have to group, and can't find a group. But untill this point, his friend would give him enougth pp to get the correct solo gears and will break some spwan spots for him. and after that he will catch the train of the lvl 60+ and he will meet his friends in no delay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our group only has one warrior already, me :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, otherwise a lvl 44 would be able to group with a lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chuckles</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, thanks for straightening me out there :)<br />
<br />
Anyone know the min level to group with lvl70's?<br />
<br />
Once he's able to gimp his way up to that level we can group up and get him some EXP :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can.  Actually a level 43 can as well.  The 65 sucks a lot of exp though.  Should be able to group with 70s at 46, or possibly 47 but I haven't tried it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bushinda</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is the same ax 1.5 x level, and that is the truth.  Its 1.5x the lower, or 2/3x the higher.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i grouped my 61 druid with my girlfriend's 43 cleric once and she got exp and it appeared to be at the same rate .. that is we each got one bubble in the same amount of time. interestingly since my druid was charm-hunting and she was ch'ing the pet she got exp faster than she ever could at the time with my (then) 43 warrior.<br />
it was funny too because everything was so deep red to her that she absolutely positively would have been resisted on every spell she might cast on a mob :)  when i was 29 once i grouped with a level 20 and he got exp as well. so i say the 1.5x rule is probably valid. i believe you can always group with someone within 5 levels so a level 1 could group with a level 6.</div></div><hr />
