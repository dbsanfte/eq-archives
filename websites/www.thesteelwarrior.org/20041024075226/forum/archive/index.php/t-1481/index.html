<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm looking to do some questing.  The rewards don't have to be great, but there has to be something.  Wether it be xp, an item, or worthy faction, it has to gimme something I suppose.<br />
<br />
So what do you fin warriors out there suggest I start attempting?  Is there some website out there that would guide me towards soloable quests?<br />
<br />
Since I'm unguilded, it's too difficult to get a group together to do good quests, so I just thought it would be nice to start doing some just to do em.  Yeah.  And blargh bluh bah.<br />
<br />
Any input is greatly appreciated.  I've looked through the quests already listed here, but nothing really struck my fancy.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go here:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/<br />
<br />
Check out the quest section. They are broken down by a bunch of different options. Just browse through quests by zone, and look at the quests that involve zones youre capable of fighting/solo'ing in. It should give you a walkthrough and stats on the reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some quests to try at 35:<br />
<br />
1) The first two Veracity Earrings. Doable at your level. You may die when the guard pops after handing the report in. And to hand the report in, you'll need to have someone invis you or wolf form you since you can't sneak, but it's not a &quot;difficult&quot; task, like say your epic quest is.<br />
<br />
2) The Fishing Rod from Kerra Isle. It's a really fast 1hb, so it's kind of a neat toy to have for training 1hb. I'm sure you can solo it at your level. The only problem is, it's a long, boring quest so it may take you awhile.<br />
<br />
3) The Eye of Trust in Sanctus Seru. A nifty, and somewhat useful reward (not as good a range item as a Goranga Idol, but I used mine for a long, long time because I quested it and was proud of it).<br />
<br />
4) You can get pretty far in the Qeynos Badge series of quests. at your level. They're worth starting, because it's a really great quest series. The end result, which requires killing the head boss gnoll in Jaggedpine which is a bit out of your level range right now, is a nifty AC 6 40 HP, see invis neck item. Not that bad. It stacks up ok to things like Velious dragon talismen and Dragon Tooth Chokers and Clattering Bone Necklaces.<br />
<br />
5) Jeweled Quiver of the Hand. May be rough. Probably need to DUO this one with a healer. I did it at a bit higher level than you. BUT, it's a good quiver to have if you don't have a fleeting quiver. So it's useful.<br />
<br />
6) Praetor's Blade of Debility. Again, you probably need a healer for this one. But I did it at your level with a Ranger friend of mine and a Cleric. And the Sword lasted me until I got my epic. The proc is that good. A very under-rated aggro proc that retains its usefulness for quite some time, if you can deal with the low DPS output of the sword.<br />
<br />
7) Gnollslayer. I'm originally from Qeynos with my monk. And I have long been a fan of the lore in there. So I made it a point to do Gnollslayer with my warrior. In fact, he now has BOTH swords sitting in the bank as, one time I got lucky and Elgnub spawned while I was running around in Blackburrow killing gnolls for kicks. I like the second sword a lot because it's a lightsource, and it felt very satisfying to complete my final Qeynos Badge, while tanking Barducks wielding Gnollslayer. (I really got into the lore of this quest, as you can tell). To complete the second sword at your level you're probably going to need help to spellunk deep into Splitpaw.  If you're interested however, I can offer a neat guide on how to avoid a LOT of the dangers and get right to the two quest mobs quickly.<br />
<br />
8) You can always START your epic. 35 is a fine level to begin doing some of the legwork and earlier parts.<br />
<br />
9) 35 might be a little young to start this one, but Sebilis Key is a good quest to consider doing as soon as you can.<br />
<br />
10) Speaking of keys, Howling Stones key is fun and useful. You get to kill Xalgoz to do it, too, so that's kind of neat.<br />
<br />
11) I'm loathe to reccommend these, but Soldier's Armor quests and the Soldier's Longsword from Twilight Sea are technically supposed to be in your level range. They're maddening however, so unless you have a lot of fortitude or are great friends with a ranger/druid who's also doing the quests, it's really just an insane hassle.<br />
<br />
12) Speaking of armor quests ... There's always CRAFTED armor quests. :-)<br />
<br />
13) And finally I think there's some stuff to do in Ykesha zones. You may be a bit low to start the good Ykesha quests, but you're really starting to enter the levels that expansion was targeted for. So it may be a source of fun and questing for you.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You absolutely rock.  Thank you very much for all those great ideas.  I think I'll spend the next few weeks or so digging into them and learnign abou them.  I think it will add a lot to my gaming experience.<br />
<br />
WOOT!  It's almost like a gold mine of things to do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just start to work on your epic!<br />
I just started as well, first pieces are really easy to get.<br />
And being a warrior I just want my epic, whether I'll use them or not.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm definately going to start gathering the pieces for my epic that I can.  At what point in the warrior epic do you need a group?  And at what point do you need more than a group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depends when you do certain things. Some of it is just picking up things that spawn on the ground, so it's pretty easy.  There's a couple of pieces that can be done by one group, maybe a duo depending on level (giant monocle, rejesiam ore).   Everything else requires a raid force, or an extremely high level/powerful group to do.</div></div><hr />
