Haven't been into any of the early OOW zones yet (stuck working nights till this weekend) so no idea what the exp is like there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest PoP for faster exp than the LDoN route.  Since you dont need points (or loot at all for that matter, looking at your magelo), I'd suggest tier 1/2 zones.<br />
<br />
In PoD near the castle there are these beetle lookin things.  The group is called LC or RC on Tunare, but its in the corners beyond the bone wall on the sides of the castle.  Great experience for a solid group, you can tank them no problem with your gear.  I went from 53 to 60 there in maybe 2 weeks with guild groups.  (pre-LDON of course)  <br />
<br />
Also CoD is good if you can convince a solid group to head there, and PoV inner/outer (cave groups) are incredible experience camps up to 62 or so.  Usually full groups evenings and weekends.  I think PoTorment is a hot spot right now too, but its always empty on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, LDoN's are really bad experience at level 58 (MAYBE 8-10% for a collect 25 which will take 50 minutes plus travel and get adventure/buff time).  Unless you can get a reliable group to do hards, it's just not a very efficient way to go.  I say reliable group because while they are not THAT hard, one dumbass can ruin a whole lot in a hard LDoN at any level.  <br />
<br />
Definately hit PoP, PoI factory if you can get there is $$.  Mobs aren't that much more difficult than regular trash and XP is almost as good as PoV Inner Caves or even BoT.<br />
<br />
However, this all said, a month to gain a level no matter where you are is pretty bad.  Are you soloing?  Where and what are you fighting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jebar Deors</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well Im a seasoned player, but only had a cleric, which was easy to level because of the class. Now being a warrior, groups are non-exsistant, normally because a SK can do our job but better.<br />
<br />
Normally at this point im getting a group anywhere possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you shouldnt have such a terrible time getting a group, just put on LFG and go to PoD, or Valor, or PoI, and shout 56 war LFG a couple times.  Then move on to the next plane.  Or check out who else is LFG 55-60, and send tells to a cleric, shaman, chanter, etc. to form a group.  Its not that hard just gotta do a little bit of talking.. er typing.  Then make friends with those you group with and start hunting with them every day.  As a &quot;seasoned&quot; player you should know this kind of stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably a side effect of the aging EQ population.  These days I would expect that there are more lvl 65(-70) players and any other level, and that most people who have been playing for a while have a lvl65 main.  Alot of the lower level characters will be twinks that are either solo classes - a character they play when they can't get a group on their main - or characters they are getting levelled as quick as they can in PL groups.<br />
<br />
I thought the 50's were shitty when I did them, but I'd hate to be trying to level up my 1st character through them now.  PoP XP has made them alot faster in a good group, but those good groups are getting harder and harder to find.</div></div><hr />
