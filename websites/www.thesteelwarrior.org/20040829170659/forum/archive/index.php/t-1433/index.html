<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been working on these quests and so far have gotten to the 5th ring with just me (58 warrior) and a 60 wizard I have ben 2 boxing.<br />
<br />
I want to get 1-8 by myself, and since I basically have to wait till the 24th to continue (for Rodrick to spawn) I mind as well start strategising - so I have a few questions to ask.<br />
<br />
When doing the orc part of the 6th ring:<br />
Does Icefang aggro anything?<br />
How long does he take to get to the orc camp?<br />
When Icefang does get there, can Poxbreath be single pulled like Scarbrow Ha'Gruk can for the 5th ring? (on the 5th ring, they spawned and sat there for abot 30 seconds, I tagged Scarbrow w/ SoTempFlux and killed him easy.. he HTed my wiz which was completely absorbed by his epic shield)<br />
<br />
For the 7th ring:<br />
Does the pulling-from-the-other-side-of-the-wall-to-get-Warden-Bruke-solo work?<br />
After clearing the giants, when I give the key to Corbin and he starts walking, is there any way for me (war/wiz) to avoid fighting those 8 giants or will I have to recruit the help of an FDer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ring 6 Get Icefang moving then run over to the orc hut,Once Icefang gets close the orcs will pop if you come in behind the hut And sit/stand towards it you will aggro Poxbourne.<br />
<br />
IF you aggro more than him,I did,Then just have your wizzie AE them all they die fast...I myself got 2 adds and just killed em all <br />
<br />
Not to difficult.<br />
<br />
Ring 7 <br />
<br />
The side of the wall that is broken ,Pull him through there and yes it does work,works fine.He was difficult for me to solo at lvl 60 I remember,I ended up bow kiting him Near the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Corbin Walk.Simply have your Wizard Aggro corbin and run him away ,Then Have your wizzie root him,and camp out.Once root break corbin will head off to the hut and you can just follow him.<br />
<br />
I did this solo,I aggroed him myself ,Snared him with Ball of Yarn then used the Goo From HS to root him and cmap out.I came back in and had plenty of time to beat him to the hut ...<br />
<br />
Ring 8 <br />
<br />
Hand in the letter,Invise yourself,Run into giant fort and go left to where there is no mobs,Target Chief Pull him and kill him,You cna do this solo,make usre to snare cause he runs,Loot head and go outside fort to ridge and wait for the script to play out,When buddy yells Charge Hand him head and away you go...<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you get it down,Barring all spawns a Warrior can do 1-8th ring solo in about 5 hours...<br />
<br />
I used to sell the 8th ring MQ for 20k Which wasn't so bad for a few hours work..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Surlok said it good, just want to add one thing though.  On 7th while Corbin is walking he will say something about being almost there.  It's then when you aggro him and pull him north towards the water, and proceed to root.<br />
<br />
And one thing about the 8th ring, wait until the dwarves actually do charge, which is a few seconds after he says it.  If you turn in immediately after he says charge, the dwarves despawn and leave the giants up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does Icefang aggro anything?<br />
Yes he does, but he usually makes it to orc hut on his own<br />
<br />
How long does he take to get to the orc camp?<br />
depens what he agros or if a friendly druid decides to kill  NAMED<br />
<br />
When Icefang does get there, can Poxbreath be single pulled like Scarbrow Ha'Gruk can for the 5th ring?<br />
Pox spawns in hut you will not get him solo if you are less then 60. Ususally you get 2 mobs oracle and Pox the way to pull is to inch from behind of the hut his agro range is HUGE. I dunno if you can solo him. He would have kicked my ass without a druid. But then again it was a LONG time ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the 7th ring:<br />
Does the pulling-from-the-other-side-of-the-wall-to-get-Warden-Bruke-solo work?<br />
Yes. I use the root stone from HS to pull him or taunt. Target him from front go to back and cast your thing. Just pull him with wiz. You wont be able to mele his ass to death and he is immune to MR. I would get a healer for this but maybe wiz can solo him.<br />
<br />
After clearing the giants, when I give the key to Corbin and he starts walking, is there any way for me (war/wiz) to avoid fighting those 8 giants or will I have to recruit the help of an FDer?<br />
<br />
Have wiz agro the dude as in guide train him to shore root his ass and camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys :) Got the 7th ring now.<br />
<br />
I'm still a little fuzzy about the 8th ring, this is my understanding:<br />
<br />
First, go and clear the Ry'gorr fort of the normal spawn mobs. Hand Garadain my Adamantium Ring and get a Note, give Note to Gloradin. Cast invis and run back into Ry'Gorr Fort in the middle hut. Dwarves begin gathering and soon lots of orcs spawn outside the front wall, including the Cheif and Firbrand the Black. As soon as Chief spawns, pull and kill him. When Chief is dead, invis and run to dwarves. When Garadain says CHARGE! and the dwarves begin to move, give Garadain the Chief's head and reiceve 8th Ring.<br />
<br />
Is that right?<br />
<br />
Give Ring-&gt;Get Note-&gt;Invis-&gt;Kill Chief-&gt;Invis-&gt;Wait for Charge!-&gt;Hand in Head-&gt;Get 8th Ring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">pretty much... dont need to clear the fort before hand from memory, think it all despawns before the war mobs spawn.<br />
<br />
hard part used to be catching the dorf chick up, but hopefully its not as contested these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">pull chief do not kill any other mobs puller must be at least 60 or you will get all 3. MAKE SURE TO SNARE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Will be using 60wiz with Staff of Temp Flux to pull, then to snare.<br />
<br />
I have a Mantle of Stealth (2 charges of 0.5 sec Invis) to use after I turn in the note to Gloradin and start running back inside the Orc Fort and for when I have killed the Chief and am running to turn his head in after Garadain shouts charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Baadan,<br />
<br />
   Im in fear myself of doing ring 8.  Ive done ring 7 twice due to some errors (sucks).  Please post back on here what you did with some screenshots :p, and the script.  I think hardest part is waiting for the dorf chick to spawn (Gloradain?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I forgot to come back here for results on ring 8.<br />
<br />
I gave ring 7 to garadain, i gave the note that he gave me to Gloradain (female dorf in the other dorf hut next to Garadains).  I drank invis potion and ran to orc fort...<br />
<br />
what a surprise!  An army of orcs.  I was still invised, and ran inside the orc fort.  I broke out with my 200range bow, and already had 150range arrows on me.  Hit the Chief, and none of the other mobs agrod.  He ran for me like bat out of hell, and after about what seemed like ages (paladin dps suck) he got low health, and... took off!   I didnt have root up, i dont have snare proccing weapons, so i stunned his butt, but he already took off as he has SoW on him.  I just memmed root and kicked his butt... but because of his running around (he runs around in circles inside the orc fort) 2 other shaman orcs agrod me and were constantly casting, making my invis go.  I got enough distance and invised out of of the orc fort and ran out to the entrance... and behold, all the dorfs were dead, if not, dying.  I run around looking for Garadain and as i found him (directly in front of entrance, on a hill), i noticed i didnt have any more invis potions, and i was low health, AND i forgot to loot the chiefs head.  i run through the shamans, and other orcs, loot the head (i had Jboots on), i got to garadain and just as i was handing in chiefs head, i died (20-30mobs on me).<br />
<br />
1 patch later.  I had to redo the entire rings 1-7 again.  This time, instead of killing chief, i just stood outside with garadain and his troops (and so did the rest of the zone).  He then shouted charge!, and when he moved i gave him the chiefs head... and got ring 8.  Ring 9 makes rings 1-8 like newby quests from what ive read :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have my 8th Ring now.. sorry for not replying sooner.<br />
<br />
The 8th Ring war was pretty simple for me.<br />
<br />
First I parked my wiz (invis) in the hut in thr Ry'Gorr fort.<br />
<br />
 I turned in the note I got from Garadain to Gloradin and casted invis from Mantle of Stealth and ran back into the fort.<br />
<br />
 By the time I had got there, all the normal-spawn orcs had despawned. Soon after that, the Chief, Firbrand the Black and 2 orc shammies popped midway between the door of the hut (that wiz was parked in and that I ran back to invis) and the gate of the fort itself. All of the other orcs line up outside the fort, and will not aggro you. <br />
<br />
I shot the Chief with an arrow and Firbrand came to. I did this part before and got Chief single, so it IS possible to get him single (I was 58-59 at the time) I rooted Firbrand on the wiz, then went to work on the Chief. I slowed him with ToD, snared him with snare whip, then beat him down with my GSoT and a few wiz nukes.<br />
<br />
I looted the head and then went to kill Firbrand, I did a lot more nukes since I was worried about time and had about 40% HP. He dropped some Gaunts and a Dark Ember.<br />
<br />
I had the wiz invis me (2nd time I was invis.. Mantle of Stealth is the perfect item for this) and ran out of the gate of the fort and a little to the left to meet Garadain.<br />
<br />
Despite my hurry (and feeling quite exhilirated.. this was one of the best experiences in EQ in recent memory, much like the first time I saw Vox, really gets your blood going with so much riding on you not screwing up) I still had to wait on Garadain to talk. He talks alot :) <br />
<br />
Eventually he starts moving and tells you to follow and dont get hurt. He gets to the fort and shouts CHARGE! Hand over the head and get your 8th Ring.<br />
<br />
If ya want (I did) go help the dwarfies. The really don't seem to need the help though, there are a LOT of them and they came out on top the 3 times I saw this. Be careful and don't get killed by them (I did :() it's kind of embarrassing and you don't get to click your new clicky for a couple agonizing minutes waiting on the Cleric.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And for my original questions,<br />
<br />
When doing the orc part of the 6th ring:<br />
Does Icefang aggro anything?<br />
How long does he take to get to the orc camp?<br />
When Icefang does get there, can Poxbreath be single pulled like Scarbrow Ha'Gruk can for the 5th ring? (on the 5th ring, they spawned and sat there for abot 30 seconds, I tagged Scarbrow w/ SoTempFlux and killed him easy.. he HTed my wiz which was completely absorbed by his epic shield)Icefang didn't aggro anything either of the times I did this (for myself and a friend). I had plenty of time to get to the orc camp and get set up before he arrived. Single-pulling (or atleast not getting all 5) is tricky. Once Icefang gets there, he will die (doesnt matter) and Poxbreath and 4 shaman will spawn. Poxbreath is inside the hut. To pull him, be behind the hut before Icefang gets there, this isn't hard. Then sit and scoot your way towards the hut. Eventually Poxbreath and maybe 1 or 2 friends will come. I had my wiz snare the other 2 then go off on AutoRun kiting them down the shoreline while I killed Pox. ToD, snare, DPS is how I did it.For the 7th ring:<br />
Does the pulling-from-the-other-side-of-the-wall-to-get-Warden-Bruke-solo work?<br />
After clearing the giants, when I give the key to Corbin and he starts walking, is there any way for me (war/wiz) to avoid fighting those 8 giants or will I have to recruit the help of an FDer?Yes, he spawns in the southernmost building. It is in a pit, it is the same area as the &quot;jail&quot; that the guy for ring 2 (cant remember name.. the one you protect and kill the rabid kodiak for) goes to and where you have to kill an orc and a giant. Shoot an arrow over the broken wall just as the above has said. If a Kromrif Prison Gaurd is up, just train him to the dwarf camp where Dobbin Crossaxe is. The dwarf in the hut w/ Dobbin will CH you sometimes if you are ally faction.<br />
<br />
To do this yourself, do it as how Surlok mentioned. I did this with a monk and some of his friends who happened to be on the same part and were nice enough to do it again for me.</div></div><hr />
