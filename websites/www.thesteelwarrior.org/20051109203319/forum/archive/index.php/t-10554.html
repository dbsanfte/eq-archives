I hear warriors suck w/ daggers, not sure exatly how but /shrug.<br />
I was thinking its probably just the missrate hype and the low delay of daggers..<br />
I also got the 1haxe from her, so looking to offhand the dagger mostlikely.. <br />
Any insight?<br />

<br />
I use what ever the best possbile weapon is I can get my hands on no matter what the type is.  I'll bet there are gonna be mobs that take more damage from a daggar than a mace, or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the reason daggers &quot;suck&quot; (near as I can tell) is two fold: <br />
<br />
1) Their low speed makes their instant attacks reletively low damage compaired to the instant attacks from big slow weapons.<br />
<br />
2) Daggers generally have a lower DPS at their level vs other weapon types becuase rogues can get so much more DPS from them. <br />
<br />
Neither factor kept me from DW a pair of Glinting Steel Daggers when they were level appropriate and the best DPS I could find.</div></div><hr />

The low damage per hit is gimpifying to your instant attacks.  That being said, a fast dagger (or anything) makes a great offhand weapon to force more dodges.  If you don't have to apply instants into the forumla, dps is dps.</div></div><hr />

well tell me this then, do you think daggars suck?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, and besides tthat it is hard to find a better offhand weapon than some knives/daggers 90% of the time in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also need to consider warriors don't get any dagger specialization ie. 5% Crit or Chance to attack twice or 5% extra dmg. The low dmg instant attacks can be offset with weapon switch, but a high crit percentage is what makes fast attck speed weapons viable dps sources since they usually only hit for 30-60dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only &quot;instant&quot; attacks that factor in weapon damage are Heroic Strike and Mortal Strike.  (Slam also does bu that is hardly worth bringing up.)  Retaliation will perform better with the highest damage weapon you can find, regardless of speed, however choosing a weapon based on a 30-min ability is unwise.<br />
<br />
I used the princess dagger from maraudon for quite a while.  The argument that fast, light weapons generate less rage over time is flawed.  While it is true they generate less rage per single hit, they hit more often.  Over time I guarantee it's a wash.<br />
<br />
In any case, I like daggers, even thoguh I dont currently have one.  I dont think there is any kind of &quot;penalty&quot; for using one as a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm Heroic Strike is based on delay. Overpower, however, is instand + weapon damage (and can be a big part of DPS with the +crit talents).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heroic Strike's damage is not based on delay.  It is the next weapon hit + X damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Overpower, however, is instand + weapon damage&quot;<br />
<br />
Overpower is just a free swing, it does not include any additional damage like HS.<br />
<br />
Overpower is delay-less, though, so the weapon with the biggest base damage is superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong:<br />
<br />
Overpower (Rank 4)<br />
Instantly overpower the enemy, causing weapon damage plus 35. Only useable after the target dodges. The Overpower cannot be blocked, dodged or parried.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh good call.<br />
<br />
the additional damage of Overpower kinda makes faster weapons more viable, in that while each overpower will be for less, there will be more of them.  maybe.<br />
<br />
hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the additional damage of Overpower kinda makes faster weapons more viable, in that while each overpower will be for less, there will be more of them. maybe. <br />
<br />
Overpower negates the dodge, which should happen more the faster you swing (10% dodge rate on 10 attacks = 1 dodge, but it's 2 dodges on 20 attacks), but you also only get to overpower 1 dodge per 6 seconds or whatever the cooldown is, so there is an upper limit on it's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I think faster would be better, but only to a certain point.  A lot of times shit will dodge right after the overpower lands and then I can't get around to landing the second before it greys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An excellent point.  I have this happen all the time when I dual wield.<br />
<br />
Even though Overpower adds damage, I really don't think you're going to see 1handers beat out 2handers since it will take lots of +35 damages to equal the damage you're getting from that big 2hander hit.  <br />
<br />
For me (Prot spec), it really isn't worth bothering to dual wield and swap in a 2hander for Overpower unless my DW combo DRASTICALLY outshines my 2hander, which is only very rarely the case. <br />
