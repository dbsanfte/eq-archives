I recently hit 60 and am looking to replace my axe I have now.  I have a friend that can make an Annihilator for the mats.  Is there anything that can be dropped or quested?  I am working on my masterswordsmith quest so I can make my Frostguard.  Any idead would be wonderful!</div></div><hr />

If you're MS build, I would try and acquire an axe of the deep woods.</div></div><hr />

alternatively you could get the Bone Slicing Hatchet from Maleki the Pallid in strat... but tis kinda rare, and hunters cry when warriors win them =D... (though 2 dawns edge &gt; these, they still whine... well they are hunters, but still)</div></div><hr />

Hedgecutter; however, is the most easily obtained 1hand axe I can think of atm.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, I think there will be a mob directly infront of the hallway you enter in, go ahead and pull him.  Then I generally wait for the patrol that is coming from the left.  After the first mob and the patrol are gone go right and kill the first two mobs by the teepee looking thing.  Then you've got 2 more ogers as you go left on the rampart thingy and kill some bugs.  Keep going and you'll end up like exactly across the courtyard from where you entered at.  The guard that drops the hedgecutter is directly down there and is easily a single pull. <br />

Kinda rambled I know but I hope it was of some help, Aka</div></div><hr />
