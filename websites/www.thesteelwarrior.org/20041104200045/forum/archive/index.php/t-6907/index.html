<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rezzme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I don't have access to raid loot and I have about ~250k.  I box a 64(65 this weekend) cleric and duo with a 65 Monk boxxing a 63 shammy.<br />
<br />
I typically stay in BoT to get AA's and ornate drops and have relatively no problems keeping aggro.  Until last night a Time geared monk joined us and politely showed me how ineffective my set-up was.  My primary concern is my aggro, then building AC/HP's.  AA's will come along the way, I'm sure.  I have access to Tactics, but nothing else really.  <br />
<br />
So on with the questions... it was suggested that I get a BoC (which I'm working towards) and a SBoD, both auged with Anger III.  Problem is, I can't get either wep without purchasing, and it's going to be one or the other till I farm some more plat through ornate drops.  Which leaves me a bit empty on gear upgrades.  Actually, I can't even afford the BoC yet, 380 on my server.  For what I'm tanking now, I see my gear and weapons as acceptable, but I intend to move further and what to be prepared for what I move into.  I've always thought that my AC/HP needed more help than my Aggro after I got my augs, what do you think?  Also, what would you upgrade first (as in.. which weapons to upgrade to or which gear).  <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

I'd go for the weapons, altho i'd keep the CHoS and not get SBoD.  (maybe get one of those GoD smithed weapons, some are like 16/20 with 2 aug slots, saw one in bazaar for like 90k a couple days ago....)</div></div><hr />
