<br />
have any of you guys found other LDoN weapon augs that add both damage AND quick hate?<br />
<br />
i rarely am in xp groups. most of my EQ time is spent tanking in  EP raid encounters and due to many factors my guild is not having a lot of luck getting BoWs to drop.<br />
<br />
becuase i always seem to be working or raiding, i need to target my LDON time toward a particular aug. just looking for some advice, particularily for tanking PoA avatars with the goofy aggro.<br />
<br />
current 2handers are Darwhol's Cleaver (125 dd proc) and the General &quot;Gaysword&quot; Druav sword ...ornate great blade (procs boil blood).<br />
<br />
so any advice? stick with anger3 for these until i get my BoW or are there other options that have worked for you?</div></div><hr />

While a ykesha proc isn't going to stand up to anger 3, it is hella cheaper, and better dps.  I have the 100dd/stun ykesha (510 points!!!) on my GSo4W and it has replaced my GBoS/CHSD forever in exp groups.  I plan to put anger 3 in GBoS, and then upgrade my spike driver to something decent, and then slap in the next ykesha, because it does help DW dps.</div></div><hr />

I would estimate you get roughly 250ish hate per ykesha proc so its really not worth it if you are looking strictly for aggro.</div></div><hr />

It's not as great as Anger 3 for aggro, but somehow generate arounds 200-300 hate.</div></div><hr />

The anger on my emp sword would be lucky to proc maybe once per LDoN hard difficulty mob, while the ykesha on my BoW procs maybe 5+ times on average. (sketchy scenario, but it gets the idea across)<br />
<br />
I wanted a proc that I could rely on to go off before tash/slow hit, I found that with ykesha but lacking on anger3. Now the question that I have is whether the proc rate of the aug is coded to be independant of the weapon or the proc rate is effected by the weapon you put it on. (ie BoC vs BF)<br />

I really hope to get some parses out to support this in the future but I was extremely disappointed in anger 3, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panazule</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely that's because of the innate proc rate of the parent weapon.<br />
<br />
BoW and most EB weapons in general proc much more than normal proccing weapons for DD/Dot/Etc.<br />
<br />
Put the EB on the BoW and it will proc like mad.</div></div><hr />

I swear I had a fight last night clearing trash mobs where i proc'd rage every single round LOL.  There is no comparison for aggro.  Ykesha is still awesome, and better for exping/adventureing, but anger3 is easily more aggro.<br />
<br />
I have never heard of an aug'd proc rate being affected by what weapon it is placed upon.</div></div><hr />

I would highly doubt what you say about Ykesha proc'ing more is true. From my personal experience all augs (at least the half a dozen or so I have messed with) have a proc rate of right around 2 procs per minute. Proc rate for an augmentation is coded independently from the weapon itself, as evidenced by my 7 hour parsing with my Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled. Exiled blade  has a higher 3 proc per minute rate like the Bloodfrenzy, but the 75 cold DD spell I had on it was only at 2 procs per minute. <br />
<br />
I've never heard any evidence to suggest otherwise about the Ykesha aug. That's fine if you like the Ykesha proc, and I'm sure it works great with a BoWar, but I wouldn't claim it procs a lot more. I seem to remember other people's results finding that it procs around twice per minute as well on their long parses.<br />
<br />
And also, BoWar, and most other EB weapons do NOT have a higher proc rate than normal. The only exception that I've ever seen evidence to the contrary was for a Bloodfrenzy. Too many people are sharing incorrect info :(. Like Brutal says...  PARSE!</div></div><hr />

I really hope to get some parses out to support this in the future but I was extremely disappointed in anger 3, personally.  I seriously doubt that this is actually the case. Your opinion is contrary to every parse that has been posted. Parse it and post the results, you will no doubt be surprised.<br />
<br />
If you want better agro, get anger 3. If you want more DPS, get Ykesha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well, DBotW seems to have a higher proc rate according to the parses. ~2.6 per min or something, I don't recall exactly. Not an EB weapon exactly, but close enough for me to nitpick=P</div></div><hr />

Yeah I forgot about that one :D. I made a list of weapons with EB in my head when I made that post, which is why I neglected to mention it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a legitimate issue w/ snap aggro procs augs when anger 3 &lt; taunting blow, but now that anger 3 almost = EB, why ask the question? Anger 3 is the win.  It's the &quot;short term workaround to the class balance issue&quot; that's now in it's 3rd succesful year of being a workaround.  Accept that EB / Anger 3 is the only thing Verant will give us to fix our aggro issues, and save yourself the time from second guessing.<br />
<br />
p.s.  The biggest aggro-whoreing paladins on the server can't take aggro from me now.  Take that!</div></div><hr />
