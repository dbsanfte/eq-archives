<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's good to see you working all skills. don't forget 2hb &gt;&lt;<br />

buy crafted armor to replace cobalt. or deity armor if you can afford. try to find bracer of fortitude. has 15stamina. adds a lot of hitpoints, gets better as you level. nightmare wood bows are pretty cheap, get one of those if you have the money.<br />
<br />
very nice setup for L30-ish char. get cleric and shammy, go do echo caverns. taskmaster can be single pulled by pacifying skeletons. or if you have L50's friends, the can pull because they have high level<br />
<br />
anyways, other than those suggestions, take it a bit easy on gear for the moment. get to L50+ and maybe find a guild that is on CoV faction, and then get resist gear and go to HoT raids for better armor. You'll want some resist gear, get fire/cold/magic over 100 (unbuffed) for those. if your not MA, you'll be ok.<br />
<br />
Also when you get to L46, look up Cloak of Greater Pernicity quest, you can get most drops in tier 1 planes. Sometimes people let them rot.</div></div><hr />

Yeah 2h b is definately something you need to keep up. Great Staff of Thunder is one of the most accessable and best weapons you will be seeing (probably, assuming LDoN does not fix DW), good agro, good speed, fewer reposts and good proc. <br />
<br />
It may be worth getting now--but just remember, barring a nerf, the longer you wait to buy the cheaper it will get.</div></div><hr />
