That would be something Id look toward to upgrade to if the ratio was good (being PoTime, no doubt it would be). Im like Jysin, nothing has come close to the BoW yet, so a wep upgrade just isnt a viable option for me in my forseeable future. It just seems kinda warped that arguably one of the best warrior weapons comes from a mid tier pre-elemental boss, theres gotta be something else out there that can offer as much or more dps and maintain the aggro generation capabilities of a BoW.</div></div><hr />

Ripostes don't bother me too much while Defensive, I'd rather the massive taunt from dual EB proccers.</div></div><hr />

With the changes to ripostes this also isnt really a problem except on a few mobs with insane damage spikes (reparm and fennin mostly) and evasive down. When not MTing I use Agnarr main and hammer off.. and generally do 150+ dps on average. Ive more or less resigned myself to the fact Rallos isnt gonna drop any BOWs for us, and even if he did would likely go to a warrior without the collection of 1h weapons I have.</div></div><hr />

Well, I think Ainian smokes crack. Unfortunately outside of EXP groups, I stick with the BoW. Riposte is still incredibly painful DW MT. Especially on Time mobs with their already ridiculous DPS. <br />
<br />
And there are plenty of DW combos that come out over a BoW. Unfortunately those weapons are all in Time. I pull out equal to BoW damage with my current DW combo (Coir/Rathe) but with more streakiness.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the Blade of War is just too good of a weapon. I'd be interested to see our class 2hander from Time. We'll probably know soon enough and then the whining can begin that it doesn't do the job as well as a BoW.</div></div><hr />

Some Elemental+ warriors swears to not even using kick or bash cause of ripostes, OR even getting Punishing Blade.<br />

I currently d-wield a Hategiver/Obsidian scimmy combo (suprizingly good taunt weapon actually, esp. for off-hand). My guild's based on RPP. Our next mob kill will likely be Rallos. Blade of war, if it drops, will likely be at least 1500rpp, probably 1600 (thats our system). likely, elemental plate drops will be about 800-1200rpp per piece. Question is, which is the better value for rpp spent; the BoW or the 1.5 - 2 elemental plate pieces I can get instead?</div></div><hr />

I'm more interested to hear why TZ is doing such insane DPS to you. I parsed all last night and on my best parse of 588 seconds he was pulling 1364 dps. Seemed to average out around 1250-1350 with all the parses put together.</div></div><hr />

Only thing I can think of as to why you're taking such an insane amount of damage.<br />
<br />
His melee isn't SOOO bad if you negate his two bombs. Frankly I think he's easier than TT/Saryrn with the right group compositions. We just lack numbers so when one guild might have him near dead with 72 peeps at 588 seconds in, we're scratching 65%. We'll have him dead soon with 50 or so but it's definitely a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from the 2 fights where u lasted around 180 seconds there is a 6 percent increase in dps from dual wielding... given that its a small sample size (2 180ish second parses) it doesnt really say anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me this is the kind of thing you test in theory first, then you try to make the assumption fit with reality.<br />
<br />
Let's say you can determine the # of attack you get per second with a good dw combo vs a good 2-hander.  The % of riposte is constant in both case.  You know what is the number of riposte you get by round by multiplying #att by riposte %.  <br />
<br />
You then need to find the average hit and find a good average dps for that mob.  You then remove the riposte dps by removing from the total dps the dps related to riposte.  You have a riposte free dps.  This is a base you can then use to determine what would have been the dps if you were using different weapons.  You simply add to the base the dps associated to riposte from different weapons.  From that you determine % of difference.<br />
<br />
Let's see how this work out with a bunch of estimate : <br />
<br />
Assuming double attack of 62%, DW = 51.6%, haste = 105%, tripple attack of 0.07%, punish blade add another 0.05%, ambidextry add 0.04%.  Btw these number can and are probably wrong, feel free to correct me if you have proof, but I need to start somewhere.<br />
<br />
I also assume a mob can riposte even if you miss, so no need to calculate the hit%, but I'm not certain (I guess it work like enrage). <br />
<br />
Testing with a dw combo of both 19 dly vs a blade of war at 32 dly.<br />
<br />
This will get you 1.87 attack main hand + .97 attack off hand with DW for a total of 2.84 attack per second miss or hit.<br />
<br />
With the BOW it turn out to be 1.17 attack per second.<br />
<br />
Now the % of riposte.  It's 5% in your parse, but are you calculating the fact that with TM you get another 100% of riposte that you do not get a message for?  Let's say for now that the rate is 5%, but it could be upward to 10% with TM.<br />
<br />
DW Riposte = 0.142 (1 per 7 seconds on avg).<br />
2-hander Riposte = 0.0585 (1 per 17 seconds on avg).<br />
<br />
The mob is going to miss you some too.  Let's say mob hit% is 60%.  You get the following : <br />
DW Riposte with mob hit% : 0.0852<br />
2-h Riposte with mob hit% : 0.0351<br />
<br />
Btw this seem kinda low but let's continue with the example.<br />
<br />
Let's say you are fighting a mob with 1500dps with an average hit of hmm, 1000?  You did that parse using the DW combo.<br />
<br />
The dps that you get from the riposte is equal to 1000 * 0.0852 for the DW = 85.2<br />
<br />
So basically the non riposte base dps for that mob is 1500 - 85.2 = 1414.8.<br />
<br />
With DW = 1500.<br />
With 2-h (32dly) = 1414.8 + 35.1 = 1449.9.<br />
<br />
1449.9 vs 1500.  So by switching to a blade of war in this example you would get a reduction of 50.1 dps for a % of 3.3% dps.  This is with a riposte of 5% but I don't know but it seem kinda low.<br />
<br />
Let's say TM was not counted and real riposte rate is 10%.<br />
<br />
That mean that base dmg is 1500 - (85.2 * 2) = 1329.6<br />
2-h dmg is then equal to 1399.8 versus 1500 for DW.  The dmg reduction in that case from switching from DW to 2-hander is 100.2 or 6.68% (100 out of 1500).  This seem more possible.<br />
<br />
This does not take into account chance of burst dmg happening, but I'm not that good in statistics.  It's alot easier to calculate everything based on average hit %, average dps, etc.<br />
<br />
I hope this can be usefull to someone (heh) and feel free to correct me on some numbers.  Maybe I'll put that in excel so I can calculate it instantly, I already have a bunch of formula in a sheet somewhere.<br />

Assuming they fixed furious bash, this could be a viable combo. Seems like dps is sorta meaningless so long as I'm generating the agro required.

I single tank him from 100% to 0%. No spell, always pure melee. Still can't figure out why Furor's taking considerably less DPS.</div></div><hr />

These samples are all purely melee damage only, non melee (spells) are not included in the parse. I was defensive for the first 180 seconds of each parse.<br />
<br />
I am quite shy of your AC, but he still did 1500 to me defensive. 1500 in melee only....<br />
<br />
588 seconds? Shit, I'm lucky to see after defensive.</div></div><hr />

Sorry it's taken so long to reply. I keep meaning to and forgetting. Anyhow, the DPS numbers I brought up were melee only. Enchanters were in fact chain runing, which probably explains the disparity somewhat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more question. I know I asked something similar earlier, on whether I should get BoW for 1500rpp or save for 2 elemental armor pieces. Well, things have changed slightly. I got one of those BoT Greatstaffs for free; 41/31, 125hp, proc some 75dd. Oddly enough, this thing's pretty high agro; I'm still drawing agro fairly easily. So, I'm thinking, since I just got this weapon, which seems to draw decent agro, would it still be wize to spend another 1500, the equivalent of 2 elemental armor pieces, on a Bow or just forget it?<br />
<br />
In summary, is BoW really THAT much better than the greatstaff to warrant that kind of spending?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freller</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tallon Zek does about 1650ish DPS on our MTs. He's one tough mob, that's for sure. I've been recently pondering whether to go Duel Wield or 2hander. The important thing is the DPS of the mob. I don't see the need to complicate things with concerning about the percentage of riposte on DW versus 2handers. By examing the DPS, you can draw conclusions from that. So, I say parse 20 fights on TZ in all; 10 using DW combo and 10 using 2hander (BoW). Post your results and then we can draw our conclusions from the DPS alone. <br />
<br />
I say 10, 'cause that seems to be a good number for averaging things out. I'm saving up for an aggro weapon and this info might help me decide whether to go the DW or 2hander route.<br />
<br />
Here's some fights that was parsed on our MT tanking Tallon Zek (time):<br />
<br />
Example #1) MT using BoW 2hander:<br />
<br />
Time: 194 Seconds<br />
TZ DPS: 1793<br />
TZ damage: 348,020<br />
<br />
Example #2) MT Using BoW 2hander again:<br />
<br />
Time: 299 Seconds<br />
TZ DPS: 1950<br />
TZ damage: 583,243<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MT has more then 2100 AC buffed.</div></div><hr />

Watching him do 8600+ damage to you in the space of 1 second is sobering.  I'll keep using my BoW to give myself the small % greater chance of survivng a burst dps round.<br />
<br />
Additionally, with BoW and symbol, I lost one mage our first Tallon to overaggro at 50%.  (He had been chain nuking since 90%)  No one else died.  Aggro was very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a greatstaff and I think the aggro on it is subpar - but it makes a nice weapon to have when Im not the MT. I have a BF/FB IV sheild that is much better for solid aggro. <br />
<br />
If you want a 2HS weapon for aggro - I think BOW is what you want - despite the raid points or whatever.</div></div><hr />
