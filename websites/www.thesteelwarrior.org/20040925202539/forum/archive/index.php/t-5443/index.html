<br />
my main is a 65 ranger and i made the mistake of looting a great blade of storms.  i had to permanently switch to 2handers for my dps as i was constantly getting aggro after only a few procs.  after greatstaff of four winds with lifetap proc, tho, i would never go back to anything else.<br />
<br />
i'm currenly 58 on my warrior and wielding GSoT most of the time and CHoS and SoTBS when i find that i need slightly more procs to stay ahead of high dps melee classes on aggro.  it sucks to hell tho when rangers/rogs are using one or both of these weapons.  aggro can be a monster if they get a few lucky procs.  i'm constantly telling them to swap out weapons.  anyways, dont they know that there are MUCH better dps combos (both duel wield and 2hander for rangers) out there without such strong aggro??</div></div><hr />

I agree that any other class should not be using a stun weapon while at a raid.  In a group, they will just die more--some figure it out and others don't.   I don't tend to taunt as much when a ranger or monk steals my agro since I need to save those taunts for saving the casters.</div></div><hr />

Don't you have a skill that you can use that will put you ahead of them even when they proc?<br />
<br />
Don't they have spells or skills that will reduce their aggro even when they proc?<br />

<br />
Right. Cause it's not like all those great rogue piercers in Ssraa and beyond don't have high aggro procs! Noooooo.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I think this is less of an actual weapon proc issue and more of a player skill aggro management issue. At this stage of the game, rogues and rangers should know how to dump aggro. Hell I know quite a few monks who wield the copper hammer. Ones who do it successfully don't have aggro issues because they know how to evade with feign death. Ones who get pasted, keep getting killed because they simply refuse to manage their aggro at all and leave it entirely up to everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo!<br />
A LOT of people dont have a clue about aggro control, or what weapons are good for aggro and what are good for avoiding it.  Had to explain to one of my guild's rangers the other day that no, he really doesnt want a CHoS because of all the unwanted aggro despite the fact that it's a really good 1h dps weapon.  I see monks using CHoS all the time. Usually, I'll ask them to bag it, since I'm using one for aggro purposes.  Sometimes they switch to 2h blunt, others they just tell me they know they'll have to feign alot and they'll deal with it.  And I also tend to not be so quick to taunt off a melee.  As soon as I do a caster is bound to overnuke,dot,debuff and I wont be ready to save them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
taunt doesnt work 100% of the time, as i'm sure you know.  my buffed dexterity is capped off for my level, but procs can still be gamey.  some fights i just cant seem to even buy a proc while others i'll get 10 in under a minute.  its those proc-less fights (or low count of procs) that can cause problems if a non-tanking class is wielding one of these .. all the taunts in the worlds wont save them if they get lucky with procs and my taunt doesnt work every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure Superchum is referring to the Provoke line.  Which is often sufficient to stay ahead of another's aggro procs, but as has been pointed out here, is not aggro lock and it shouldn't be.  Me, I include weapon choices as part of the player skill issue - if you can't avoid unwanted aggro with your gear set-up, you blew it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't affect me much anymore, but I really wish people weren't such morons/loot whores when it comes to looting/buying weapons. Makes me wish each weapon was only useable by 1 specific class.......In my current guild, there is a healthy respect among melee classes in that regard, but I've been in guilds where the rangers wanted a BoC for the stats.......<br />
<br />
Hum, I did let my baby ranger use my BoC for fun tho, but I'll have to get him something else at some point :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
normally the only time i have any real agro problems is with 2 necros in the group or a slower who gets alot of resists (ie lvl 57 and under chanters in PoV at WW) hell i even can normally use my GSoT (aug 50 lifetap) or WMBS (aug 75dd cold) at WW or even in BoT at LE but with morons like that /sigh.<br />
<br />
if you're on vazaelle watchout for a iskar monk named kixx who 2boxes a cleric named drekken . i am pretty sure that's the ONLY reason he gets groups unless the groups is DESPERATE for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nah Superchum,<br />
<br />
Couple things.   First, the proc from Force Shock is *significantly* greater than even incite at the highest level.   It's greater than Enraging Blow, as the Great Blade of Storms is significantly better at gaining aggro than the BoC when either is main handed.    Second issue I have is that the rogue piercers from Ssra+ are not really high aggro at all, most actually have an aggro reducing component to them.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be that while there's things one can do to lower aggro for the most part (jolt/fd/evade, yadda yadda), that in order to safely use these weapons with a warrior tanking, you really would have to make good use of the aggro avoidance skills/spells.   If there's an aggro problem more than once, it would be wise to put them away for the remainder of the session, for one's own safety, and for the sanity of the group, the tank in particular.   The last time some moron with 2 high aggro proc weapons got into a DPS pissing contest with me over the use of said weapons, I kindly pointed out to him that in using the weapons, and not ensuring aggro, he was lowering the Damage Shield DPS the group was doing by a factor of 3 over any increase in DPS he thought he was getting with use of the weapons, as well as my tactical mastery based DPS, and that his use of them was lowering the DPS of the group significantly.    <br />
<br />
Uneducated &quot;dps types&quot; tend to be the worst players in EQ, as since they're labelled as &quot;DPS types&quot;, they feel that their DPS contribution is somehow either the sole source of group DPS or their tweaking of their DPS to maximize it is of such crucial importance that they miss out on many things.<br />
<br />
Damage Shield DPS is a large and important part of overall group DPS, with MoR + Mage/Druid DS + Self DS, a good chunk of DPS is added to a group, I tend to get individual damage shields cast on me as they tend to be for more damage per hit than group ones.   I also have 30ish points in self damage shield.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery:   When I'm tanking, my DPS increase over non-warriors is pretty insane because I can strike through mobs special defenses.   Giving that up costs the overall DPS of the group.</div></div><hr />

When Frodlin posts something, I know it's a goddamned fact.<br />

The way I test this is fairly simple.    I started this with the simple question of &quot;Which is better aggro, Norge`Tal or BBB?&quot;   The common thought was that rune was quite good aggro, so it stood to say that the BBB was really good.   The Norge`Tal is also quite good aggro, with a 3-fold effect:   A direct damage, a stun and a knockback.    <br />
<br />
To determine how well &quot;a weapon is at aggro&quot; one simply must run a series of tests with 2 people, one with each weapon you'd like to test, attack a mob, and record who is hit more often.    Over a fairly lengthy period of time, it will become clear which weapon assists in the generation of aggro moreso than the other.   Both dont' have to simultaneously proc in order to make this determination since the question is really an over time question, but short durations between procs is also helpful for a &quot;bang for the buck&quot; or &quot;bang for the proc&quot; perspective.<br />
<br />
We used a melee mob at the zone in to Halls of Honor, which was pulled by a 3rd party, both characters simply used attack, with no taunts or anything else.   The Norge`Tal was surprisingly good at generating aggro, as the mobs were beating on the Norge`Tal equipped toon 81% of the time over the BBB equipped mob.    Once this was changed to BoC/CHSD vs. Norge`Tal, it changed, as the Dual Wielder then had aggro 70.4% of the time.   We're unsure whether the increased rate of proc, the increased swing rate due to delay/Dual wielding, or whatnot was what was responsible, but it was adequate.<br />
<br />
The Great Blade of Storms turned out to be *surprisingly* better than the BoC, in that by mainhanding the one weapon without another equipped, the GBoS held aggro over 100 fights, a surprising 88% of the time.   What was particularly fascinating was that the GBoS when procced closely to the BoC in time would in every single instance draw aggro from the BoC.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the GBoS is WAY better of a weapon than a BoC for a warrior, and frankly the most underrated weapon in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All very interesting.<br />
<br />
I still stand by my point that especially in the case of monks ... any monk with half a brain can easily make use of the copper hammer of striking and not lose DPS and keep aggro where it belongs, on the tank. The class got by doing this the entire time Tranquil Staff was a great weapon (which spanned from Kunark to Luclin).<br />
<br />
Chowderhead monks who refuse to FD or evade deserve to die.<br />
<br />
But a monk can certainly make use of the DPS a copper hammer provides.<br />
<br />
That being said, Waning Light Katar and Entwood Mace are usually cheaper, superior DPS options. Or if you've got the bucks to toss around, Staff of Flowing Water, which draws really bad aggro (very slow weapon, I never had any aggro issues using it) or Hammer of Corrupted Enchantements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Can they use Dathor Great Hammer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Trying to gauge how much a proc is between two weapon is simply not reliable.  There are too many difference between weapons and possibly AAs that you just don't have a controlled sample.  I have many instances where my Vanazir outaggroed a Blade of War so does that mean Nightmares is better than Enraging Blow?  I can't prove it but the aggro from Nightmares never feels quite as much as an enraging blow.<br />
<br />
If Force Shock is better than Enraging Blow why do so many people use Anger 3 over Force of Ykesha (125/stun)?  I think Force Shock has a KB component but I don't think KB increases aggro significantly (i.e. AAed Dragon Punch sure doesn't have much aggro and it knocks back a good deal).  When I played around with a Force of Ykesha augment on my BoW the 125/stun proc surely do not feel like it gives me as much aggro as EB.<br />
<br />
Greatblade of Storms is 14/18 and it better ratio than BoC as well as being faster.  This alone is quite significant.  A better ratio weapon with lousy proc can often outaggro a worse ratio weapon with great proc because ratio is the most reliable aggro you can get.  You will never fail to swing at the enemy whereas you can get unlucky on procs.  I do not doubt GBoS can beat a BoC but I do not think this is because Force Shock has more aggro than Enraging Blow.</div></div><hr />

I find this hard to believe but your test sounds good.  I used a GBoS and a BoC for a long time and always tried to use the GBoS mainhand because of the superior DPS, but always wound up moving the BoC back to mainhand because I had aggro issues.  I'm the last one to put impressions while fighting over real testing, but I sure wouldn't have expected a test to come out like this.  I would be interested to see what the results would be if both chars had a primal sword or some other non-aggro weapon offhand.  It seems like there might be a chance that the lack of an offhand weapon exxagerates the dps advantage the GBoS has over the BoC.  <br />
<br />
I still use the GBoS when I'm 2-boxing with my cleric and as part of my low-aggro dps combo on raids.  It is certainly nowhere near the aggro of my Anger III auged bloodfrenzy, but I wouldn't expect it to be.</div></div><hr />

SoD doesn't proc at level 1, so the Copper hammer is actually superior to that for twinking purposes.<br />

It's still a decent weapon for the 50+ crowd, just too overpriced to be practical considering the other options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Frodlin, your tests don't really prove anything.  Just who had a better string of procs. We don't know if one of the warriors was taunt/inciting, had more offensive aa's, had an agro buff.  There are just too many variables for your test to be even close to reliable.  From my own experiences, enraging blow is much better for agro purposes, if it wasn't then the anger 3 procs would be pointless, since there is ykesha.  When raiding with a warrior who had a Ykesha auged BoW, I would constantly pull agro from him with Anger 3 auged BoC, and an unauged CHSD in offhand, without tauntin, and with attack moderation.  Anyway, I'm not going to say your stupid for thinking stun is more agro than enraging blow, but from what I've seen, EB &gt; Stun on all accounts. Another thing, I hope that you don't use that jagged shard of frozen flame for tanking, if you do, you've lost all credibiltiy :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I get the point, Frodlin has done some nice stuff for the &quot;community&quot;, sure, whatever. That has nothing to do with anything though. My point is that his reasoning for saying the stun is greater aggro then enraging blow is flawed. Just because he posts a lot of information, doesn't mean all of his information is correct. People are wrong sometimes, GET IT? Maybe you should take Frodlin's cock out of your mouth before you talk next time, ok?</div></div><hr />

Yep, sorry for not reading fully, but what about the atk of the warriors, haste, offhand weapon? Even after all that is equal, it's still up to the rng, if the GBoS warrior gets 3 procs in a row, it's going to take a while for the other warrior to catch up.  And it works the other way too.  I personally never had any problems holding aggro from rangers using GBoS, SotBS, CHoS. There was one time a warrior dual wielded CHoS and SotBS and took agro from me at the beginning of a BoT tower named fight, but he got a few lucky procs, and I took agro back np.</div></div><hr />

Even I don't fucking mess with Frodlin....trust me man, he knows his shit. If he says it, chances are it's right. No one's hopping the bandwagon here, we just trust him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Doing that test also completely ignores the fact that GBoS obviously has better aggro than BoC if neither procs, which is what will happen a good deal of the time, since this is an XP group mob.<br />
<br />
There's stuff to consider like what if the person with BoC didn't have Stalwart Endurance and get stunned more when he had aggro?  Did they really all start swinging at the same time?  Even one swing head start is quite considerable.  <br />
<br />
I can easily produce some results that has Vanazir aggroing over a Blade of War.  By this logic Nightmares beats Enraging Blow right?  <br />
<br />
People way overlook the ratio of weapons in aggro comparisons.  Even with Enraging Blow, the bulk of your aggro still comes from the ratio not the procs.  If you actually believe your aggro comes from your procs, get a Turgur on you sometime and see if you can keep aggro at all.  You still proc the same amount slowed (slow is normalized for attack speed) but you sure won't be able to keep anything on you even with a very small slow, let alone Turgur.  <br />
<br />
It is believed one swing of Vanazir is around 100 aggro (no real way to confirm this but doesn't seem unplausible).  At a speed of 3.8 seconds that means you generate a bit more than 3K of aggro from swinging the Vanazir alone (ignoring double attacks).  Compare to 750 hate EB at 2/minute, you can see a high end weapon generates nearly twice the aggro from just swinging (and not even factoring in doubles) than the 2nd best aggro proc.  So why shouldn't a weapon with superior ratio and slightly worse proc not beat a lower ratio weapon with better proc?</div></div><hr />

While I understand your frustration with the &quot;The evidence is because he said so&quot; line of reasoning, I am patently offended by many of your statements, particularly in relation to the location of my genetalia.   So knock it the fuck off, my gentalia should NEVER EVER EVER enter your thoughts in any way, shape or form, nor is my genetalia or any other body part of mine EVER a valid topic in debate amongst males.   <br />
<br />
Now, on to your other concerns with the validity of the testing.  It's one thing to question things such as &quot;I'd like to know some of the potential variables prior to making a determination of whether I accept this or not&quot;, such as say Brutul had done, it's entirely another, completely intellectually lazy action to simply dismiss a test as &quot;invalid&quot; without attempting to get those questions answered.    In the spirit of fairness, I'll try to answer some of your concerns.<br />
<br />
1. Neither warrior pressed the taunt button, as this would completely invalidate the test.<br />
<br />
2. Both Warriors had 41% haste (Emp boots on one, Flowing Moss Mantle on the other), neither had a haste spell up, as the expiration of haste buffs at different times would affect the results.<br />
<br />
3. Insofar as offensive AA's, both warriors have maxed offensive AA's.   <br />
<br />
4.  The &quot;lucky string of procs&quot;, or RNG argument, while valid for short term testing purposes, does not account for 60 minute+ tests, as enough time and opportunity has generally passed to even out any RNG irregularities.  <br />
<br />
5. My Jagged Shard is a good looking sword that looks nice in a screenshot, and I've had it for some time.   I use my Blade of War for tanking thank you very much.   I am amused that you'd look at a sig file without knowing anything else and attempt to discredit my tests based on the weapon I chose to wield in a photo-op.<br />
<br />
6. The atk of the warriors is both have near capped item atk.   Both wield a series of Vengeance/Aura of..../ + Atk items, it's within 100 points of the other.<br />
<br />
7. There was no offhand weapon used (as explained in the methodology earlier) so as not to cause issues with different offhand weapons (we could probably both use a similar non-proccing weapon in the offhand in future tests, but for this one, there was no offhand weapon used).<br />
<br />
8. I'd like to re-emphasize that your anecdotal stories about being in BoT with some dude who once got some lucky procs has nothing to do with whether weapon A. over the *long term* assists a warrior with aggro generation vs. weapon B. in a controlled environment.   Because of the duration of the tests, those &quot;lucky events&quot; even out, and happen on both sides.    <br />
<br />
Now, Brutul brought up an actually VALID question (without &quot;a priori&quot; dismissing the tests mind you), which is... with only a primary weapon wielded in the main hand and no offhand weapon wielded, does the GBoS still maintain the edge?   I'd say &quot;probably&quot;, the reason COULD be because of one of 3 things:<br />
<br />
1. Damage/Delay superiority<br />
<br />
2. Number of attempted hostile acts (i.e. low delay) having an effect on aggro<br />
<br />
3. Aggro generated by the force shock proc vs. Enraging Blow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Phantron raised another interesting question which is... If a stun proc is better than EB, why get anger 3 at all?    The answer to this is &quot;I don't know, but I think that's a question that should really be answered&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Other questions enter this also, such as &quot;Do different types of stuns or stun components generate different levels of aggro?&quot; This could answer why Anarchy, stun, and Force Shock seem to be so good, while Ykesha doesn't seem so good.   Many paladins that I've talked to seem to believe that there's different levels of aggro on their different stuns, perhaps there's something qualitatively different between different multi-part spells with stun components.   Perhaps a &quot;Ykesha Aug'd BoW vs. Anger 3 Auged BoW&quot; test would be in order so that warriors will have some definitive way of making an informed decision.  <br />
<br />
Myself, I auged my BoW with a simple DD aug, since I prefer to use it when not tanking as well as when tanking and prefer not to overaggro.   Perhaps I'll get an anger3 aug and test it against a friend who has a Ykesha Aug'd one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW if it winds up being proven that Stun+DD generates more hate than EB/Anger III I will be highly annoyed.<br />
<br />
Anyhow Frodlin's test should be a good comparison of those two weapons, but not necessarily good for a direct comparison of proc values because the GBoS is both faster and has a better ratio than the BoC.  A club of the mad reasearcher augmented with the top Ykesha proc would be perfect for comparison with the BoC since they are both 15/20 but I imagine those are pretty rare.<br />

I'd have to agree that 100 atk difference (if it was that) is fairly significant as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Superchum, we(paladins) KNOW that divine stun is much less aggro than our other stuns, and yet doesn't have a negative aggro modifier that is visible in lucy. That leads me to infer that stuns can have varying amounts of hate. That inference may be wrong, but I would need some pretty strong evidence to change my opinion.<br />
<br />
As far as why people use anger augs instead of FoY augs...as someone with stun spells available, I can't imagine someone actually preferring anger 3 over FoY. I always assumed it was a point cost issue. If someone is really looking for the best aggro proc available from LDoN, my gut feeling as a paladin is that the ykesha proc would blow the doors off of the anger proc. Anger 3 is what, 300 hate? I can't imagine ykesha being that low in added aggro on any mob we would actually care about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to test proc versus proc both characters need to be slowed, preferably by a Storm Comet so you don't have to refresh it constantly.  <br />
<br />
Staff of Transcendence will easily outaggro most warrior weapons.  This doesn't mean Time Rend is the biggest aggro proc in the game.  BoC don't have a chance of getting off a ratio 1.5 2Hander for example unless you do something like proc 3 times in a row and even then the 2 hander will still eventually catch up.  <br />
<br />
On Ykesha versus Anger 3, I have both procs.  Anger 3 feels like more aggro than Ykesha, but this is of course only empirical evidence.<br />
<br />
Attack does not seem to matter aggro significantly, if at all, so I wouldn't worry about that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">From earlier testing, Niafix, particularly that performed by Brael, it seems that aggro from melee DPS is based not on the 'real' dps, which is what gets adjusted by the addition of attack, but rather, upon the 'potential' DPS: Every swing you make generates aggro as if it was a hit for max. Meanwhile, the addition of vengeance, etc, does not increase that maximum hit, it merely skews the curve of an unbuffed character towards hitting for that maximum. Therefore, Vengeance should have little to no effect on the actual aggro generated, however, a superior maximum damage per delay unit will out aggro the inferior maximum damage per delay unit. It's likely that the modal damage per delay can also be used to judge this, though less accurate, it's much easier to calculate.<br />
<br />
Based on modal damage/delay, I'd expect the procless aggro of the GBoS to outperform the BoC, at 2.2777 repeating vs 2.15. Both Enraging Blow and Stuns are rather large chunks of aggro, still, given the choice, I think I'd lean towards the weapon which performs better under the circumstance of shitty RNG luck. Granted, the edge is small, but it's there, and it maintains itself out to a max damage multiplier of 6-7 times the weapon damage, which is out around where it is at 65, based on what scraps I can observe myself</div></div><hr />

Im pretty sure that within this test they also showed that agro per swing wasnt effected by higher atk as the atk effects average damage per hit as agro per swing is the same regardless of damage doing a higher average damage per swing didnt effect the amount of hate or whatever generated?<br />

I am also fairly sure that this thread showed agro per swing from the offhand was minimal compared to the main hand so what weapon they were offhanding should also be fairly irrelevant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I think it would be better to take a single warrior and leave him unchanged in the experiment, give him a decent agro wep like a GSoT which has agro somewhere around what you think the weapons being compared will have.  Call him the standard warrior (Warrior A).  Now take Warrior B with a non-procing weapon like a WMBS of around the same raitio as the GSoT and put him up against warrior A in three 60 minute runs.  Run 1 is with WMBS unauged.  Run 2 is with FoY aug on WMBS.  Run 3 is with Anger 3 on WMBS.  Now you are comparing the same warrior vs. himself by comparing his results vs. the standard warrior who has not changed.  Perhaps the weapon choice and minor details may be optomized but I think you can see what I am saying.  In order to be even more scientific, do multiple runs in each configuration and the RNG will be further smoothed out.<br />

edit:<br />
An approach that just occured to me is this:  Let warrior A fight the test mob for 5 minutes to get a huge amount of agro then have him turn off attack and let warrior B start attacking and time how long it takes warrior B to get agro from warrior A.  This will take multiple runs but should give lots of useful information by which you can compare the various augments.</div></div><hr />

You know, you are probably right. What it did prove (or at least heavily imply) is that a GBoS is better aggro than a BoC. Of course, the difference in the melee damage of those 2 weapons should be fairly small,  so it's not a huge leap so say that the proc is higher aggro, or at least very very close. But you can say that without coming off like an ass. See? I just did it. It's not so hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, all that aside this thread has some cool thoughts in it.  <br />
<br />
My subjective (not borne out by any evidence) hypothesis:<br />
<br />
That there is a codes table that has an agro modifier for all stuns...that different pallie stuns, the yak mods, the stun on GSoT, the stun  on GBoS are not at all equal...that the base line stun has been adjusted upwards/downward by a value in  this codes table (this would explain same/similar Lucy entries but different observed results).<br />
<br />
I think Frod has about as concrete a way of testing this as can be made given the lack of physical data to really observe (in lack of physical you have observed or a step up from that  &quot;implied&quot; experimentation).  <br />
<br />
Be interesting to see where this goes...it definately does not belong in the outhouse.<br />
<br />
 I still have the belief that Frodlin's tests are insufficient in proving that a stun proc is more agro than an enraging blow proc <br />

What's even more important, is that you come in here talking shit and basically providing nothing to the discussion, yet you're trying to exert some kind of fucking force on your opinion that Enraging blow can not possibly be outclassed by Force Shock without having any evidence to back it up.  Frodlin cites his evidence from the tests he did, and you still sit here and act like we're all just picking sides and nobody fucking likes you.  I'm sure you're gonna go on some ShaikYerBooty tyrade about how right you are without having any kind of proof whatsoever and how Haass is so mean to you, so how about you just go do that, and in the mean time, the big kids will have a discussion about how we can work on this Force Shock vs EB thing.</div></div><hr />

Dont' worry about &quot;defending yourself&quot;, it's ok.   Just to clarify, you'll notice that what I said was twofold:<br />
<br />
1. Force Shock is significantly greater aggro than Incite.   No one has challenged this statement, nor has anyone provided any evidence which contradicts this statement, although it could be easily tested, since you could get a 3rd party to pull a mob, have a 65 warrior use incite, then a 65 wizard to cast force shock and watch what happens.<br />
<br />
2. The GBoS is greater aggro than the BoC, which I have attempted to show, and firmly believe.<br />
<br />
The statement was made that Force Shock is greater aggro than EB, and this is the crux of your argument, which is fine, as it was a fairly &quot;dogmatic&quot; statement, which was evidenced by comparing two weapons and there could be other reasons for these weapons to have different levels of aggro (dps potential/delay primarily), and all that I've &quot;shown&quot; is that GBoS tends to be better aggro than BoC, but not necessarily that one proc of GBoS is greater necessarily than one proc of EB.   I believe that it is, dont' get me wrong, but you are corret in that it cannot be stated as &quot;factual&quot;, as it's a hypothesis more than anything else, but based on reasonably solid data.   If we were able to &quot;force proc&quot; weapons, we wouldn't be having this discussion, as we'd be able to tell instantly, but we are kind of forced to rely on testing, which introduces other variables, such as &quot;when one turns on attack&quot;, and weapon speed/potential, and so on and so forth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">here is a thought, have a SK cast the 63 terror of thule, and a wizzy to cast force shock. yes i know that terror of thule is 100 hate less then EB but you would get very close findings. wouldn't that show which has more hate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">It could, but there's a lot of suspicion that the SK Terror line of spells in it's current form has some issues.

The initial &quot;snap&quot; hate, or the grand total after Incite has worn off?  (Or has the Modify Hate per tick portion been shown to be irrelevant and I missed it?).  I assume for the moment that this means greater than the 400 initial Hate, and not the 1100 accrued over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Aye, there is some issues with the SK terror line. Some poeple say that it loses some hate at range but works right within melee range. Others say that it doesn't work right no matter the distance. Have heard tell that the bigest problem is that it doesn't scale well with mob lvl. Is one them things you have to take what you wish from it and form your own opinion. If it works right within melee range, then it is about as close as you can get to timing as you can get. Could even maybe test it against a pally or cleric stun. That is assuming that all stuns are the same. Is an idea at any rate.</div></div><hr />

Wow when someone mention this in channel, I just kinda laughed at them....Now I'm curious as to how well it actually works in groups...</div></div><hr />

Low damage. Streaky proc rate*. I've used em in groups (I still have a pair in my bank). I just don't think they'd be that good in a group setting, because you'd need a substantial head start or &quot;alone time&quot; with a mob to get it locked down.<br />
<br />
However, this was before incite.<br />
<br />
And,  you can now put Anger augments on them.<br />
<br />
So, who knows, Gnoll Hide Lariat Rennaissance? I'd love it. It's always been one of my favorite weapons in EQ. Splitpaw ... lotta good memories there.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
* NOTE: I don't dispute any of the findings regarding average proc rates. I do however have a lot of experience with that weapon. It has, in the past, gone three fights without a proc for me. Other times, it'll proc multiple times in a short span of attacks. Since the aggro from the proc is a key component of the weapon's aggro, it can sometimes spend a good portion of a fight being subpar (well as subpar as any other 3/20).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Playing a Shaman as a main, and grouping with (and stealing aggro from) every type of tank imaginable, I can say the following, anecdotally, of course:<br />
<br />
1) Stuns definately have different amounts of hate on different mobs.  I have been in groups where 1 stun of any sort locked aggro off even 3 slows/attempts, and I have been in groups where it took 3+ stuns to get aggro off me after just a malo and slow.<br />
<br />
2) +Hate spells/procs seem to be less aggro than stun, but it IS more reliable aggro.  Terror of thule is &gt; slow 99.9% of the time, barring proximity aggro issues.  1 Terror holds aggro over malo+slow on everything, every time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I wouldn't put all my apples in one basket with Stun-proc aggro weapons with the rumors flying around about spell aggro, and resisted spell/stun aggro possibly being 'tuned' at some point.  Might leave you with far sub-par weapons in that case, since stun-procs weren't designed for aggro, but EB was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Might leave you with far sub-par weapons in that case, since stun-procs weren't designed for aggro, but EB was. <br />
<br />
I don't think they're really in a position to remove Stun proc weapons without addressing EB.  EB was designed to generate hate, but it was designed to generate hate because the class was fucking broken.  If they ever fix the class to not need EB like they said they were going to, then I'd expect an EB removal.<br />
<br />
However, since they're not likely to spend anymore time on warriors when they can keep making expansions to fill their pockets, I wouldn't worry too much about a Stun nerf either, since that would either coincide with an EB &quot;adjustment&quot; or it would probably just be paladin spells themselves that get tweaked.  It's very obvious that weapons like the BBoTE, SoD, CHoS, SotB and hell, even the ol' sarnak battle hammer were all DESIGNED to generate aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Not gonna get into an argument here, but I think saying it's a &quot;huge&quot; knockback is objective.  If anything it's nice to be able to finally counter a push from a melee and a pet both hitting from the back of the mob (I always face pets to the rear and melees always move that way).  That being said, once again, even when it procs, I haven't seen much knockback.  Maybe if you chain proc it you might.  I use Xana hammer in main and don't have Ambidex or anything yet, so maybe I'm just not procing very often.  I haven't seen it causing any problems, myself, and I know alot of people who use it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">In regards to the gnoll hide lariats, and the fact that they rely pretty much entirely upon procs for agro, which can make tanking with them haphazard; if the new weapons affinity AA makes procs either A) somewhat consistent, or B) quite a bit more frequently, which would cover for the streakiness of the RNG, they might be very handy to use again, in situations where their lack of DPS isn't an issue.<br />
<br />
As for the BoC vs. GBoS argument...  That's really got me thinking now, as I mainhand a BoC, and am working towards getting GBoS, which I had planned to off-hand.  A possible comparison I'm thinking of is 2 warriors going to Kael, and doing a recreation of Frodlin's test by attacking that greenie mob just inside the EW entrance.  Both can use the exact same offhand weapon, and after a given amount of time, say an hour or so, switch the BoC and GBoS around, so tests are run with both warriors using both weapons in main.  This would hopefully make the test a bit more consistent.   And, as that mob would take a very long time to kill, if it was even at all possible by only 2 non-hasted tanks, it should be a fairly reliable test, I would think.  Hopefully I'll pick up a GBoS pretty quick here, so I can check this out with a friend of mine who is equipped very similarly.<br />
<br />
As for my own anecdotal evidence; my offhand is a CHoS.  I've tried it in main, with BoC in offhand, and kept switching back to BoC main, CHoS off.  This was in a variety of tanking situations, from Sebilis on up through BoT.  For myself, BoC was better agro than the CHoS.  As for the knockback of CHoS, I haven't noticed it.  This is most likely because I'm always grouped, and position mobs to face pets and the rest of the group.  If anything, I'd like more knockback to combat the push of the rest of the group :p</div></div><hr />

YMMV, but it seemed to me the aggro (whether from proc or DPS, i dunno) was more consistant on the GBoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I grouped with an sk last night that was using a CHoS and shield combo.

So I said &quot;Ok, I'm not the healer, it isnt my mana you'll be burning, so do what you like.&quot;  She then bagged it in favor of a 2hander.   All that aside, why on  earth would an SK actually use a 13/20 weapon.  The DPS increase from the proc isnt that great.  Every Pallly and SK I know (most of them in half decent gear at best) have weapons in their bags with ratios that I find sickening in a &quot;let me drool on that 21/20 1h slasher&quot; kind of way.  And while I know they're tanks, they don't actually need a proccing weapon with substandard dmg/dly to hold aggro.  I just don't understand what they're thinking.  Maybe it comes from my perspective of having a backpack full of weapons and therefor not wanting to take up space with one that is next to useless for me when I could have a better one in it's place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Beorn, that SK came to class on the Short Bus. The only reason for an SK to wield a CHoS or a SotBS (Can we? I don't even know.) is to pray to Innoruuk that the stun proc goes off while the mob is trying to cast gate or cheal. Why, for Hate's Sake, would you deliberately stab yourself in the foot?<br />
<br />
One handers are looked down on in general as self gimping, and for very good reason. Most knights choose to wield two handers because with our lesser attack ratings, even one handers like Soul Defiler just don't measure up to the damage output of a DN weapon. At one point, I went from wielding the 25/25 Gozzremm Ice Cream Cone of Death to wielding the 40/45 Innoruuk's Curse. At this transition, we measured my parsed melee DPS as more than doubling against the rather high AC for the era mobs in the new Cazic Thule, right before Luclin's release. Now, with two-hander specific multi-attack AA, the differential is even larger. The benefits of ending a fight that much faster far outweigh the minimal healing benefits of the AC/HP increase - if there even is one, thanks to AC on two handers. Those that -do- wield one handers generally come out of elemental guilds, having suffecient vengeance to offset their insuffecient natural attack ratings, as well as access to things like the Gem Encrusted Axe: At 33/22, it's got the punch it needs to weigh in at 75-80% of the comparable 2 hander drops for the level. That there's a severe lack of Luclin Era / Early Teir PoP quality 1 handers further serves to  discourage knights from 1 handers: The best one hander for a Shadow Knight before Earth/Sol Ro/Air weapons drops from /Yelinak/. <br />
<br />
The only logic I can think of that would lead to a knight wielding a CHoS is: &quot;Wow, that's a lot more expensive than a WMBS, it must be good.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">So it's kinda like a warrior using an unauged SBoD as part of an aggro setup. Gotcha. :)</div></div><hr />
