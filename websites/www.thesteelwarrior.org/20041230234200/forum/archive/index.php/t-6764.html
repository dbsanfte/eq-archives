Are these vestiges of the opening system or something else?  I apologize in advance is this has been raised in a previous thread.</div></div><hr />

These are live, there is just no way to get them, and will probably not be any way to get them anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that source date &quot;Live 04/14&quot; means that the information was gained from the spell dat file or whatever on that date, which was the last live patch where spells changed.  The best place to look for changes would be in the history of each spell/skill/item.  In this case, the item that grants the Flurry ability, Tome of Flurry, has only existed on the Test server.</div></div><hr />

The class is using a lot of our stuff and doesn't have it's own niche yet. Might be the start of getting that class its own unique role like the beastlord. Of course, I didn;t see the need for the berserker class in the first place. Sounds nice but they should have went with it in the beginning and drawn the lines of difference back then between warrior and zerker. Anyway, just food for thought.</div></div><hr />
