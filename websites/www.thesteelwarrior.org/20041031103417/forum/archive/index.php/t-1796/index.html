<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which one would you pick with my stats I currently have, I was originally leaning toward the Vindi BP but I think the SS BP would be alot better overall.  I wanted the Vindi BP originally because of the extra saves plus more hp, but I am lacking in AC and the STR, DEX, AGI on the SS BP is pretty appealing also.  Here are both BP's linked:<br />

Suggestions please:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shirmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id go with vindi not just ibecuase i wear one at 65 hehe but it gives me 206 hps plus resist are good yeah the ac is lower and as for stats on ss i am maxed in stats all the time but i play with a 65 sham an 63 clr everytime i am on so the stats dont mean much to me on the ss.</div></div><hr />

Allow me to make the decision simple, Str, Dex and Agi are useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Str, Dex and Agi are useless <br />
<br />
Not quite useless...maybe 'trivial' due to buffs?<br />
<br />
BTW, Still using Vindi at 65...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, even tho I have Avatar on constantly, I still would never EVER choose a piece of gear that had less AC/Hp/regen/saves because it has any of those stats.  Hell, up until this weekend when my Barbed Rubi Shoulders dropped, I was wearing Chokidai Hide Spauldors, which are -10 str, 5ac 15sta 55hp.  I constantly wear my fungi tunic which is -10 dex/agi, and I would wear those pieces even if the str/agi/dex penalty were doubled.<br />
<br />
In reality, the effect that stats have on your character is miniscule compared to even a few more AC or HP.  There is no argument here.  10 dex won't save your life.  10 hp might.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have an SS and wish we hadn't gone so far that I couldn't change to a Vindi BP...<br />
<br />
Aura of Battle +HPS and superior saves = teh win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tossup imo. depends on how you do loot too, is it officer decided, dkp, or what? vindi bp for tanks makes more sense, the HoT bps are way better for clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, if you can kill vindi and farm HoT, go vindi.  Its a classic tank bp.  It has a very nice package.  If you want to make up for lost stats, get a couple valorium rings of gallantry.  You'll make them back and more.<br />
<br />
The plate bps are much more useful to other classes than they are to warriors.  AoB &gt; 9 raw AC IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you're still struggling with stats SS looks like a pretty sweet option, but once you find all your stats are capped on raids you'll be missing those extra hps and saves from the Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Think long term and go Vindi~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haass is 100% correct.  The difference those stats make is so tiny that it's not worth caring about, or mentioning really.</div></div><hr />

Not quite as many saves but 10 more ac, 5 more sta, extra str/dex/agi, 10 charisma for DI, same hps.<br />
<br />
I could have ornate, vindi or SS but Eradication is my preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our guild (as in mine and Ragnarin's) uses raid points for loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;I could have ornate, vindi or SS but Eradication is my preference&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally I hung up my Vindi for Ornate; more ac, more raw hp, my sta caps anyway.. plus the effect gives 300 extra hp, 36 ac and 30mr which is pretty sweet when you dont have a shaman casting focus in your xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm one of the rare few that prefers my Vindi over the Eradication.  I'll trade the 5 AC difference for the AoB effect and 8 more to all saves.  Just my opinion though.  And I know what you're gonna say, don't forget the stamina......too late I already did.  My sta is capped now with buffs anyway (no planar power yet) and I've noticed that after 255 you get very little hp per sta anymore, some system of diminishing returns.  I've been passing on the Ornate Mold lately because it's not a giant upgrade for me like it is most of the clerics I work with.  However, that will be an upgrade for me in the future (after most everyone else gets one first).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">really it comes down to 10ac and 10hp - svs are practically worthless in this game(really a shame but its true), the 10attack from aob is nothing to jump up and down about, and stats just dont matter as ppl have said. tough call really since ac actually matters again, thus why i said its a tossup if there werent other classes to consider. SS bp is really an exceptional cleric bp, if you have access to vindicator, i wouldnt give it a second thought. should ultimately cost fewer raid points if you do him regularily, and you should! <br />
<br />
there isnt a better risk v reward mob in the game and good bps arent easy to come by unless you have access to tactics. the troll mini drops the ornate bp good bit, but its still not as common as the vindi bp even. the boots are excellent too, considering the mob, only bad drop is that stupid earring lol. you will probably even get a few ST keys out of the deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">eradication bp is better than vindi imo. HPs are the same, but u get 10 more raw ac out eradication, most ppl killing vindicator havent maxed sta either. i cant remeber the last time resists mattered and 10attack is nothing. ac actually matters now, but its not easy to farm statue for bps unless you are the only guild killing him and i really doubt thats the case. id take the first one that came up, which would probably be the vindi bp. of course you should kill statue every chance ya get though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It depends how often you kill Vindi and farm Halls of Testing.  If you do HoT more, grab that bp as soon as it drops.  (Hell, do plate breastplates even drop in HoT?!  I've yet to see one on my raids. /pout) If you do Vindi more, leave the plate BPs for the clerics.<br />
Vindi is a great bp for any class that can equip it, except for clerics.  I'd hedge on the side of getting the vindi bp and being less competition to the clerics.  <br />
Myself, I'm quite content with my thurg til we can take on the statue... /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ss bp = cleric item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I took Vindi over both Helanic Tundra and SS, Rag. I think I'll keep it over the Eradication too, if we ever get a shot at kiling that stupid mob (Verant should give up and relax the seven day waits on these mobs everyone contests, IMO, especially mobs from 3-4 expansions ago!!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
part of the reason you prolly never see statue is cause he is 5 day spawn, not 7 :p</div></div><hr />
