<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>squatter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious, i havent augmented any of my weapons as yet, and just looking for others experience with them.<br />
<br />
  When putting a proc augment on a weapon that procs already what are peoples experience with this? Does it throw in an extra proc akin to when you got boon, tricksters etc on? Does it double proc when it does, does the augment over ride the current proc? Over all does it proc twice as often as it used to, or does it just proc with one or the other at the same rate? <br />
<br />
  Anyone got any experience with this, just interested cause this info would effect a great deal the value of the augments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can currently state 3 procs on a single weapon:<br />
<br />
1: Weapon's natural proc - eg: Enraging Blow<br />
Proc rate hardcoded to the weapon <br />
<br />
2: Additional buff proc - eg: Call of Fire<br />
Proc rate hardcoded to the spell<br />
<br />
3: LDoN Augment proc - eg: Force of Ykesha<br />
Proc rate hardcoded to the augment<br />
<br />
Testing has shown these procs work simultaneously and independantly. Although noone has provided evidence of multiple procs off the same single swing, there have been parses showing that all additional procs have the same proc-per-minute rate irrespective of weapon type or delay. If it procs ~100 times in an hour on a wieghted axe, it'll proc ~100 times per hour on a bloodfrenzy or a FS short sword too.</div></div><hr />

Actually, that's not quite true. According to Sony if your weapon has a natural proc and an augment, the augment can only go off if the natural proc doesn't. It checks for the natural proc first, then the augment.<br />
<br />
Below is a repost from a recent thread about this.:<br />
<br />
(borrowed from Monkly Business)<br />
<br />
A few quotes from Absor re proc's:<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Yes each proc gets its own proc check. Although only 1 proc may go off per swing. So you won't double proc but you can single proc with either proc.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
so, adding say, a dmg proc to a primal weapon, you'd end up with Effect: Avatar and EFFECT: Vampire Kiss (for example) and, depending on the RNG, you'd get either Avatar OR VK as a proc, but never both. Is that correct?<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Yes thats correct. The primary proc will be the one to go off before the secondary added proc. So if you had a primal / Vampire and primal checked ok it wouldn't even bother checking vampire.<br />
