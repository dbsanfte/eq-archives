<br />
Cool, and its even dropable :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no problem I don't have much to do else ... maybe flam abit on the knights vs warrior threads but it isn't fun anymore ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ToD sucks i bought it, and it get resisted quite often even blue con mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well they are all resist vs Magic (except the first which is a cold spell) without resist adjustment, so they will all have the same pb... try to tash them next time. and if noboby is around to do it, you still got Howling Werewolf Claws (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5230), Journeyman's Walking Stick (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6618) and Howling Orb (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28913) (ordered list). well actually I doubt the VT orb exist, because it looks quite powerfull (14/18 +2 + TAE debuff !!!!) so it should be more known... must have been either a mined link or a heavy nerfed item (looks like noboby got it since january 2003)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ToD sucks <br />
ToD most definitely does not suck, sir.  It's a MR based proc, I assume you're soloing or duoing with a non-slowing class when you're useing it.  If this is the case, you should tailor the mobs you fight to be light on the MR side with either debuffs or smart pulling (for instance, in Velketor's the golems seem to be more magic resistant than spiders).  <br />
<br />
I've used the ToD in PoP in places like PoI, PoN, BoT and PoJ and I have found it to work well when needed.  It's always fun to tell the group to keep pulling after the slower leaves and whip out ye olde truncheon so you can hit your &quot;%t slowed by warrior!!! 8)&quot; macro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use my ToD all the time, sure it's resisted occasionally, but when it lands it makes life easy.<br />
<br />
My hotkey says '%T ghetto slowed (50%)' :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It really is too bad the Orb no longer drops, sweet aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I &lt;3 ToD.  I even have a pocket chanter, and I still say that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Enjoy my spare time at work ... :)<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
LOL, thanks for the dedication :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got my ToD for 22k week and half ago.<br />
<br />
If for nothing else, i can kill gaolers in PoJ and actually see noticeable movement in aaxp. (~1.5% per kill)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone who bad-mouths the ToD is a fool, imo.  Nothing will replace a dedicated slower, but the Truncheon of Doom is like having a little bit of that versatility in your bag.  If they suddenly stopped dropping in Seb, I wouldn't trade mine for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my tod will never ever leave my bag, i do get resists sometimes, but i got  a jstick for tash and that procs a lot so its not a problem really<br />
<br />
its not a replacement for a slower, but if your slower dies or goes LD it can keep the group going til they get back easily<br />
and its great for 2 boxing a cleric or druid and grinding some solo aa (i dont want to hear teh slow makes a damage shield useless bullshit. i use WEAPONS to kill the mob, the DS is purely bonus damage so i dont care if mob is slowed, i prefer it since it saves my cleric mana and i have less downtime)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I bought one 2 days ago for 10k.  I am very impressed with the efeect it has on my 2 boxing with my cleric.  In PoN I went from 4 CH a fight to 2 and sometimes only 1! The thing usually procs in the first few rounds, occaisonal resist (1 in 10 mobs maybe) and rarely the bugger doesn't proc for almost the whole fight (maybe 1 in 10).  Sure helped my DPS by letting the cleric Nuke more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Been looking for one in the bazaar...none for sale :) I'll keep checking though, might have to end up camping it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">have the trident and its not work the effore to get, its only a 10% slow from the fish lookin dragon from ToV, i got it because it was a rot item, the dot on it is decent but not worth the time to get, also since there is always a slower in the group then it does not work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Who drops this weapon in Seb ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Who drops this weapon in Seb ?<br />
<br />
the frog armsman does</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i love my ToD...even put an anger2 aug on it so when i duo with my druid, he can nuke/dot more while i wait for slow to land(which doesnt take long with wa5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have had my ToD for 8 months nowand it will NEVER leave my little utility bag. I three box my warrior, cleric and Druid when farming and rarely have a slower. It does get resisted but NOT enough to be a problem. I would say its like 80 % success rate. I am using it now in Natimbi farming for the Shell inlaid collar. Got the FT1 Neck last week.  <br />
<br />
GorfinML, I was under the impression Weapon Affinity only affected one handers. The ToD is 2HB. For anyone that reads this that knows.. Does WA affect 1handers only or both 1 handers and 2 handers or 2 handers only?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">WA afect weapon proc and augment proc in both hands and whatever the type of weapon you wield (Slashing, Bashing, Piercer, one hander, two hander).<br />
<br />
Your feeling may can than 2Her unauged proc at 2ppm at WA0 to 3ppm at WA5. thus 1 proc every 20s aproximatly.<br />
while a DW combo unauged proc at 3ppm at WA0 to 4.5ppm at WA5 (2+1 to 3+1.5).thus 1 proc every 13s aproximatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">kewl.. Thanks for the info. Really appreciate it..</div></div><hr />
