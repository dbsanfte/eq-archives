<br />
on any given weapon with a proc you already have that one proc, and when you put another proc on it, lets say in this case anger 3 for warrior sakes, and lets say the original proc was tuanting blow *i think thats the 700 one i get them mixed up all the forkin time* now, are you going to proc twice as much? or are you going to proc the same, with a chance of procing either or?<br />
<br />
The way they work down there and sony and verant i would think it would be the later, and if thats the case, putting a 600 aggro proc on a 700 aggro proc weapon, would be detrimental to the warrior in question. in having that chance to proc 100 less aggro than he would have.<br />
<br />
BUT i dont know if thats how it works? is that how it works? or do you get twice the procs?</div></div><hr />

The short answer though, is the procs are independant, and you will get a lot more procs from a 2-proc weapon than you did before it was augmented.</div></div><hr />

Try a search, there's lots of threads on this topic.  The short answer though, is the procs are independant, and you will get a lot more procs from a 2-proc weapon than you did before it was augmented.  <br />
<br />
Actually, that's a little misleading.  The procs on a two-proc weapons aren't independent - it's not a 50/50 chance which proc you get.<br />
<br />
Instead what happens when you swing is:<br />
<br />
1) The game checks to see if the weapon's main proc goes off.<br />
<br />
2) IF the main proc doesn't go off, then it checks to see if the augment proc goes off.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the augment proc only goes off if your main proc missed.  Therefore the augment proc only goes off a fraction of the time the main proc does.  And the main proc itself is totally unaffected by whether or not you put an augment proc on.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but a little simple testing with the Katta bankers shows this as not the case:<br />
<br />
First run<br />
Time: 1 hour<br />
Primary: Blade of Strategy (no augments)<br />
Secondary: Basalt Bulwark<br />
# of procs, Rage of Vallon = 108<br />
<br />
Second run<br />
Time: 1 hour<br />
Primary: Blade of Strategy, Augmented with Cold Slimestone Fragment<br />
Secondary: Basalt Bulwark<br />
# of procs, Rage of Vallon = 101<br />
# of procs, Blast of Frost = 107<br />
<br />
No buffs on me other than Focus, which put my Dex at 294.  I think this pretty clearly shows that the procs are independant and equal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 And I think he chose poor phrasing. What he probably means is augment procs will go off a fraction *less* than innate weapon procs. This has been parsed a lot. Over time the innate proc always pulls ahead a bit, but it's not a lot. Also it seems buff based procs come in third, after Innates and Augs have both made their check.<br />
<br />
 I can dig up some posts from other boards if you really want, or you can. Check ranger, SK, and monk boards.</div></div><hr />

But I would say that even a &quot;short&quot; test like mine would refute the notion that the aug proc is substantially less than the regular one.  Had I been looking to verify a statement involving marginal differences, I would have run the test for 8 hours.</div></div><hr />

I agree there's no huge difference in proc rate of aug compared to innate. I said aug procs a tiny bit less than an innate proc.</div></div><hr />
