<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after putting this off forever I've finally decided to do this quest again (yes again, I screwed the pooch on the mq at the end of the quest the first time...warrior having bad faction with Nathyn and all :p ).  A 50 ac back item is just too appealing as I need the ac bad (My guilds ramping up for VT and Elementals at the moment).  My problem/question is this, has anyone been able to get Heratius Grolden to spawn recently?  <br />
<br />
I've helped 3 or 4 of my guildmates do this fight back in the spring and it seemed to us that after about 4 hours of clearing everything in the castle we were able to get Heratius Grolden to spawn...thus getting Valdanov.  <br />
<br />
My problem is last night and during the day time earlier in the week I've put in about 12-13 hours in the castle killing any thing that walked and have yet to see this guy up. <br />
<br />
What I'd like to know from you all is if I'm doing something wrong, or are there any tricks to get him to spawn, or anything of that sort.  I'd rather not waste any of my guildmates time up there sitting with me slaughtering greenies hoping that we get a pop the next 50 min cycle.<br />
<br />
Any help or tips would be appreciated :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roanne Lefaye</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no &quot;trick&quot; to getting Heratius to spawn except that he is the named on the top floor. You only have to kill the PH there and keep rechecking when it repops (I dont remember the timer there).<br />
<br />
Valdanov pops out on the balancony when Heratius dies, but invis's himself shortly after he pops so make sure you can see invis.<br />
<br />
I spawned him 3 times in a day when I did the quest (wiped twice and called in reinforcements the third), which is just to say it's not that difficult to spawn him if you know what to kill but you can't just walk up and do it necessarily. Of course, you may get lucky and just catch Heratius up sometime by planting a tracker to look for him while you do other stuff.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Guess its back to mass slaughter of the castle inhabitants next time I get really bored.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trick is vampyres are scared of ughre smellz thus you must bathe!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heratius Grolden has no placeholder.  He just pops when he wants to pop on the right side of the balcony just in front of the centurion if you're looking at it from the mountain behind the castle.  Sometimes you may get lucky and see him twice in one day, while other times you may actually go several days without seeing him.  When I did the quest, I recorded his spawntimes for just over a week and noticed his chance to pop seems to come every three hours and it's a 1/20 shot in doing so.  However, I can probably link you to countless posts where people mentioned he popped almost immedietly upon death.  Goes to show why small sample sizes truly do suck, eh? ;)<br />
<br />
However, after using the small sample size that I had, I was actually one interval off when I predicted his spawn time, which really me raise an eyebrow.  I predicted he would spawn on a Saturday at 7:10pm and he showed up promptly at 10:10pm. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, keep at it!  The shield is an amazing backslot item and chances are you won't be replacing it until Plane of Time.  50ac 15str 15wis 75hp in a backslot?  Oh hell yeah.  Too bad it's not 50ac 15sta 15dex 75hp though.  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW....who let that damn barb in here? lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also drop the 10ac aug on it, but note that if you do it becomes back-only.  60 raw AC = about 100ish AC equipped, not so bad...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xppen Nnelty</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note.  I went to the trainer and put my 21 points into pottery and first attempted made the shade summoning figurine.  So it is possible that you may not have to tradeskill for a few hours to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you don't even need any pottery to do this quest.  The unfinished product is not no drop, so you can hire or get a guildy make it for you.  That person then gives the unfired product back and you take it to the oven and fire it yourself, which is zero skill check.  Only the actual finished product is no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heratius Grolden seems to be a random spawn, in my experience.  When originally camping him, I had sessions of anywhere from an hour up to 11 hours, for a total of over 35 hours.  Included in this was one 7 hour guild raid session, where we killed anything and everything.  We tried killing mobs in different orders, killing only particular mobs while leaving others up, etc.  If we could think of it, we tried it.  He never showed.  I finally got my ashes when on a random trip to Katta to check the merchants for acrylia with a druid friend, he was up and nobody else was in the zone.</div></div><hr />
