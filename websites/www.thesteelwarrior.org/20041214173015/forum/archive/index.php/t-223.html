But my question is about damage how much damage agro does it take to have the same taunt as a blow proc/spell of 700 points of agro give or any version of it. <br />
Also how much would you think hitting, missing and such gives in agro.  Dunno if anyone actualy has any information like this, but I hope that some of you do. Couse I have tried and failed to gain such knowagle so far sadly :/<br />
<br />
In advance thank you :)</div></div><hr />

Why do you say that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Compare Monks to Rogues and this becomes kind of clear.<br />
<br />
Monks get pull aggro, and so are instantly high on the hate list. But even with that, they have a helluva time getting a mob off a caster because they don't have burst damage or taunt.<br />
<br />
A Rogue can sometimes evade till his heart's content and still not drop the hate from that ONE backstab.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's dependant on weapons. Monks, rogues. Wizards and Shamans have all told me that my Windblade holds aggro better than my Frosty/Red Epic combo - Especially if the RNG's being stingy with the procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faster weapons seem to hold aggro much better than slower - My guess is there is a &quot;fading&quot; effect to aggro - you get x amount of aggro for doing X, and then this aggro amount immediately starts to fade. Faster weapons with lower damage refresh this aggro more frequently so the mob sticks to the warrior (or rogue/ranger) better.<br />
<br />
Just a theory - Aggro is kind of a &quot;black box&quot; - I wish we could test it other than &quot;feel&quot; - I'd kind of like to know if FB works and how much better it is than regular Bash. Bash is kind of a nice aggro holder - it seems to build aggro better than having a non-procing offhand.<br />
<br />
Hell, my stormrider carapace seems to hold aggro better than an sod in my offhand - although the SoD proc seems to grab aggro back better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There definitely seems to be 2 types of aggro - Getting it, and holding it.<br />
<br />
I find that fast weapons with good procs *get* aggro faster.. But slower harder hitting 2-handers hold onto it...  it's almost like the insta-aggro you get from a proc, or from a fast quad with your DW combo is transient aggro...<br />
<br />
If that makes sense.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudorm</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Windblade can get and hold agro better then my fleshgrinder/lammy combo. <br />
<br />
I also double box a shaman....<br />
<br />
I noticed in PoD (while trying to see what it takes) if my initial  round of attacks was over 500 damage + kick and taunt, I could slow right away and not worry about getting agro. <br />
<br />
Also, if I got a critical in the time from I engauge to the time the shaman casts slow, that also seems to help if I dont get the hits off (misses or or just low). <br />
<br />
just my observations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only use my windblade when I DONT want aggro, its nice DPS and great for those situations when I am not main tank.<br />
<br />
I heard all the people saying how great the windblade was for holding aggro and perhaps its a function of level.. but at 62-64 or so when I played with it... I went back to the red/blue blade combo (didn't have my BoC then) since they were much more reliable at holding and grabbing aggro....  at 65 dw beats out 2handers hand down for gaining aggro fast (cept maybe the blade of war and a few elemental plane weapons I dont have).<br />
<br />
Also... well... a lammy/fleshgrinder setup isnt an aggro setup anyway.. hell... rangers use that setup!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cartolis</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a frostbringer/club of the cie ocean at the moment with a narandis lance for my 2hander.<br />
<br />
I have problems keeping agro unless the procs go off.<br />
<br />
the standard situation that comes up is that everything will be going fine right up until the ranger in the group tries to snare a mob, which usually happens when the mob hits about 30%.<br />
<br />
the mob turns and whacks on the ranger till it starts to run, and nothing short of a proc will break it loose. we have tried everything i can think of, waiting longer, doing it real early not snarring at all and letting the druid root as it starts to run. nothing is working. he shouldnt be getting as nuch hate as he is, unless lammy and defiance are suddenly uber agro weps.<br />
<br />
taunt seems to be usless, thought I still spam the key along with kick.<br />
<br />
It makes my life harder because having the mob beat on the ranger slows us down. with only a druid to heal in my regular group this means that we have to rest after every other kill.<br />
<br />
any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not much you can do about that sort of thing - Best to get your ranger to wait and snare it just as it starts to run, and not before.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the room for that, then tell the ranger to jolt a few times before and after snaring (if he isn't doing it already)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What if they get mad not only for the hits, but just for the swings?<br />
<br />
Wasn't this the idea 2 years ago?<br />
<br />
So the plan was to get the fastest, bestest damage (in that order) that you could get and then hold taunt like a madman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;any advice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Let the mob turn to run THEN snare it?<br />
<br />
That way it won't be turning back to aggro the ranger as it's already decided to flee.<br />
<br />
To do this you need people paying attention, however. So many of my friends will be doing this awesome, and then, like an hour into the camp, they watch as mob flees and goes walking past some friends and are like &quot;Oh, was I supposed to snare him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speed is not that important in the grand scheme of things.  If there are ratio 1/2 weapons out there that might be true but there are not.  Almost all good ratio weapons have nearly identical speed.  Yes aggro does decay with inactivity, but even a fairly slow 2H (say 4 seconds) doesn't swing so slow that your aggro will fade in between swings.  Ignoring procs, the best ratio weapon is almost always the best aggro weapon as well.<br />
<br />
Monks pull plenty of aggro if given a good weapon, as do any other melee.  Backstab is not a high aggro in light of evade.  Sure if the rogue isn't evading then yeah that will get aggro, but that's also silly.</div></div><hr />
