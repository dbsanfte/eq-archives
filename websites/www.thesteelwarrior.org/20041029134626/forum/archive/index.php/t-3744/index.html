<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to decide what weapon to go for next:-<br />
<br />
Currently use BoC/CHSD for 1 hand setup<br />
<br />
2 handers are prismatic/GSoT.<br />
<br />
We can kill everything up to RZTW, we dont do emp ssra or VT tho. Any suggestions? I'm normally 3rd/4th tank on our raids so dps is as important as aggro to me.<br />
<br />
Currently my wishlists looks like this<br />
<br />
1handers<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy<br />
Double Edged Stormblade<br />
Jagged Shard of Frozen Flame<br />
<br />
2handers<br />
<br />
Bloodied Beserkers Blade<br />
Obsidian Greatsword (or whatever the one dropping in sol ro's tower is called)<br />
<br />
Anything worth adding/removing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you say you don't do emp srsra or VT, does that include Cursed?<br />
<br />
If so, I'd probably remove Bloodfrenzy from the wishlist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty sure he meant just no emp so no emp 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Correct Bulbog. We are well capable of killing emp, just we decided to avoid the emp/VT route as our alliance is fairly casual and not well suited to the keying process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BoC with anger 3 in it is enough aggro to tank. Bloodfrenzy and BoC, especially with anger 3 on each(or anger3/ykesha) would be very very good aggro and if you just put attack on you would be getting aggro from the MT all the time ;) However, BBB with anger 3 will give you sufficient aggro, rune3 will add some to that too. And it will be good DPS for groups, and less riposte on raids. Almost as good as a BoW without augments. So...i'd say it's either dual EB weapons or BBB for you, whichever one you prefer.<br />
Just my opinion. My opinions usually stink.</div></div><hr />
