When is the best time to start doin' AA's ?<br />
<br />
When I ask friends some say 54 some 57 some  59 some 60, it gets a tadge confusin :confused: <br />
<br />

Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60 or 65, depending on your situation. One you may wanna squeeze out before 60 is Run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After run 3 I recommend getting 65 before any more AA. If you get to 62 and find that mobs in BoT and HoH are beating the hell out of you, you might switch and get some defensive AA's while your gear catches up but overall getting 65 makes AA come easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loredena</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends.  If you're raiding, levels outweigh aa's, and you'll be getting the gear you need.  If you don't raid, you're better off getting aa's by 60 to offset not having the high end gear.    That gives you a chance to get your ac and hitpoints up, and time to acquire the gear before you find yourself a level 65 paper tank.  <br />
<br />
Then too, you want to take into account who you group with -- if you're always grouped with the same people, and you want to do LDoN with them, you'll need to stay within a few levels of each other.  So, if you play more, get AA's to keep near them in level.  If you're doing pickups, that's less of an issue.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd at least get Run 3 now, simply because it's such a help when pulling in dungeons, and regen 3 isn't a bad choice either.  Past that, I would go for Natural Durability by 60 at least.<br />
<br />
As always, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Is Guts</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But is there an optimune (SP) lvl for getting AA's ?<br />
<br />
Was talk of 54 to get the low ones (misssed that window) or is this just more confusion ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 65 aas come easier imo.  One of the big reasons is you get groups faster.  But like was mentioned, it depends on what you do.  People have stated some great things to follow, Loredena is dead on especially.  Just make sure to get run3 as soon as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have good enough gear to go straight to 65, then AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Is Guts</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice guys this is my last warrior and hopefully best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">run 3 is even questionable now since you can spirit of the shrew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do 'em when YOU want. Even at 65, with no aa's, you won't be MT for your guild, or if you are now, you'll still be that MT with bonus abilities that you don't get with the ding.<br />
<br />
 To each his own, man.</div></div><hr />
