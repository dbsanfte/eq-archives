<br />
I got him to 30 by using a druid DS, which worked quite well, but now he can't take a beating from more than one mob, so I need another tactic.<br />
<br />
Any idea what I should do now? I've been grouping the 42 bst with the 30 cleric letting the cleric get xp but its super slow.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any replies.</div></div><hr />

The Enchanter was able to nuke it a couple times and get solo experience.  With a 65 Shm to buff/heal/slow, your monk should be able to tank and beat down everything that you'd want to exp your cleric off of, including all white, yellow and red mobs.<br />
<br />
If the FD tactic doesn't work any longer, you might also consider the zoning technique, depending on your setup and zone times.  With a monk and a warrior, however, you can camp everyone near a zoneout with high level (compared to the cleric) mobs nearby, pull with the warrior and beat it down to nearly dead, Root it with the shaman, zone the Warrior, and then finish it with your Cleric for full experience.  While the Warrior is zoning in and out, the Monk can be beating on his mob to do the same thing - rotating them should provide constant experience.  A real pain in the ass, certainly, but it's an option.<br />
<br />
You can also use Atone tactic, once your cleric hits 34, by beating it down and atoning until agro is clear.  However, this can be both unreliable and very slow depending on your luck.  Remember to use /assist on the mob to check it's agro and make sure it's clear before finishing it off with your Cleric.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
just watch out for ripostes that'll KS your cleric, either duck and face them (so you still get parries/dodges/etc) or just turn your back on them so they hit your more often (and take more ds damage)</div></div><hr />

<br />
DS both the cle and druid, pull 4 or 5 mobs to the cleirc, and have him cast his PBAE(word of shadow? spirit?) and have the druid heal the cleric...eventlly the druid will take aggro to, so you'll have to heal both</div></div><hr />

If it does work it will be perfect, if not I may try the FD monk method, although I heard that was nerfed also on any mob over 35.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Last I checked DS damage wasn't actually assigned to anyone, so whoever does the most damage to the mob other than the DS gets the exp. If you pull with your bow and do 100 damage and your Cleric PBAEs for 80 damage, and then DS on the Warrior does 1820 damage, the Warrior will get the exp. But if you pull with Incite (doing no damage) and the Cleric PBAEs for 80 damage and the DS does 1920 damage the Cleric will get exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely continue the damage shield route.  Even when you are restricted to single mobs at a time, there really is no faster way.  I suggest Kaesora library area, the mobs there will be mostly yellow-white at 30, and it's an XP hotspot.  If you need higher level mobs, the Xalgoz area is a few levels higher.  As soon as Kaesora's not good enough, go to City of Mist.<br />
<br />
At level 40, group the cleric with the beastlord instead, sit the cleric in a corner, and go mow through easy mobs with the beastlord - City of Mist will probably suffice for that.<br />
<br />
Atone is great for aggro tricks, but it's too often resisted and too slow recast to use as a powerlevelling tool.</div></div><hr />

SoE's engine follows basic math, .5 is rounded up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcast12</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got him to 43, I put every damage shield I could think of on the warrior, ran to CoM and pulled huge trains. Cleric AEd and made 13 levels in 4 hours.<br />

Can anyone say fizzle?</div></div><hr />
