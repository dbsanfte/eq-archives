<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why has the plight of the 6 hour disc warrior been ignored? For all intents and purposes, we are officially USELESS until this has been fixed. 6 HOURS for incite? 6 HOURS for Stonewall? This is bull. Why hasn't SOE said anything yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">6 hours? huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A lot of warriors are getting their disciplines 'bugged', where they won't refresh for 6 hours, and nothing will fix it. Any warrior with this now is fucked until SOE wakes the fuck up and DOES SOMETHING</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A few Warriors on Zeb have had the problem with timers being off. They reset their internal clock to the correct time/date and it fixed the problem. It's something small that can be overlooked, but hope it fixes your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, there was someone with 3800 hours refresh on his timer. :p<br />
Then he tried on another machine and it worked fine there.<br />
<br />
Seems to happen mostly on AMD based machines (possible even exclusively).<br />
<br />
Have to admit I only skimmed the thread I read about it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That sucks.  I have heard that the discs and AA abilities are running off the cloak on your machine.  So you could disc.. set the clock on your machine ahead and it would be gtg again.  Haven't tried it though.  Seems like they have a lot of things to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had a timer of over 2000 hours since the first day. I think it could be because i /q'ed instead of camping, that screwed them up. Or could be something else, i didn't play on saturday and i heard they had alot of crashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AMD running here, no timer bugs *shrugs*<br />
But I've seen some threads talking about it, it doesnt seem a common bug but definetely its there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, it's NOT all AMD users that have the bug, obviously - But haven't heard of anyone with an Intel based machine have the problem .. so .. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Set your computers clock to the correct time that will solve it.</div></div><hr />
