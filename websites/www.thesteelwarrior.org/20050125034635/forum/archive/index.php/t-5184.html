<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen it posted anywhere, but about 2 weeks ago SoE (or Ubisoft, I'm not entirely sure) closed the Korean Everquest server and moved everyone there to Maelin. Sony has been totally silent the entire time; the only way people on Maelin found out about this was from the Koreans themselves. One night people started appearing on the server with boxes for surnames, like so:<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Most of the new xfers with the surname boxes have since changed those surnames, and with Sony's total silence on the matter, word hasn't spread much at all. Many people on Maelin still don't know. Maelin is a unique server (nearly everyone, including myself, transfered here with a raiding guild when the server opened), which is very quiet - we don't have a server board, and unguilded people are pretty rare - with a population that, even with the new xfers, we're still the lowest population blue server (though we have 3 guilds in time and another due soon).<br />
<br />
Considering their situation, the Koreans have been great. They're *extremely* polite to the locals, and a lot of them are still fairly low level since the Korean server only had Kunark/Velious/LoY enabled. Most of them are a little angry at Sony, since they claim they were told they'd be moved to whatever server they chose, and they're learning fast that GM's don't exist on small servers - my own horror story being the time I waited 38 DAYS before my petition was ninja-deleted without an answer (&lt;3 /viewpetition command).<br />
<br />
What I wanted to highlight, though, by posting this thread, is that if EQ's customer base does take a huge dive, from WoW, Sigil or otherwise... don't expect much of a warning when servers get merged.<br />
<br />
And of course, there's certainly significance in the fact that SoE actually closed a server.</div></div><hr />

My guess (and it's just a guess) is that NCSoft decided to end that little co-management agreement and dumped the people back onto SOE's lap.<br />
<br />
Again, just guessing.</div></div><hr />

It is possible that one of the forign servers that are managed by another company got merged to a US or European based server, but I find it unlikely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've had a lot of new xfers coming in lately, but when we got hundreds of new xfers in one night, obviously something was up. Maelin is a US blue server; it just has a low population because it's only about a year old and transfers were allowed from day 1. Prior to this, our server population was about equal to SZ. Now it's consistently past the PvP servers, so there's definitely been plenty of new people coming in.<br />
<br />
Luclin was opened on their server just before they were told about the closing. They have PoP now that they're on Maelin, but I know most of them don't have LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that, like someone else mentioned, the server was owned and maintained by another company that decided to end it's ownership and Maelin, being the smallest server, received the ones that were on it.<br />
<br />
I would think it more significant if they were both completely and totally owned, operated and maintained by SOE though.</div></div><hr />
