<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there, folks!  Newbie poster here (on this board, anyway).  I figured this would be a good place to post a question, amidst all you parse-happy smart melee types!  :)  (FYI, my main is a 65 shaman, and we're about done with Inktuta as far as content)<br />
<br />
Anyway, to the question!  I posted this in a couple of places and no one seemed to know the answer.  I'm trying to figure out if SoE has programmed the experience penalty correctly, or if we're facing significant experience 'bleed' by having partial experience go to regular and partial experience go to AA experience.  I'll copy and past my original post (from another site) below.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyone parsed the experience gained for races with a penalty?  I know AA do not have a penalty if the AA bar is set at 100.  Regular experience does still have a penalty, however.  <br />
 <br />
Anyway, here's the hypothetical:  <br />
 <br />
Player is a Troll SK.  They have a 20% penalty.  They are level 65, and aside from a few raid deaths, don't need much regular exp.  Player puts his experience bar on 90% experience to AA, and 10% experience to regular experience<br />
 <br />
Question 1:<br />
Is the 20% racial experience penalty:<br />
 <br />
A) applied to the whole pool of experience, which is then divided into AA and regular experience?<br />
B) applied only to the 10% experience applied to regular experience?<br />
 <br />
Please, only confirmed responses!<br />
 <br />
Question 2:<br />
Now, let's add in leadership.  Our troll SK is a group leader, and has his group leadership on.  As before, we have 90% going to AA.<br />
 <br />
Which is correct:<br />
 <br />
A) 20% leadership chunk is taken off the pool of experience.  Then racial experience is applied (per the answer to question 1).<br />
B) 20% leadership chunk is taken ONLY off of the regular experience.  (20% of 10% = 2% experience applied to leadership).<br />
C) Racial penalty is applied (per the answer for question 1 to the pool or to the regular exp) BEFORE 20% leadership chunk is taken off regular experience.<br />
 <br />
In short, can anyone confirm or deny (through parses they've made, or read from people they trust) that racial penalties are not applied to leadership, and also not applied to AA in the situation where experience is not set to 100% AA?<br />
 <br />
Thanks, guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Something to start with ( corrections will indeed follow ):<br />
<br />
Imagine you kill a mob and get 10'000 exp<br />
Being a troll SK, you only earn 8'000.<br />
Of that, 20% is going to leadership aa = ( 1600 to l.aa )<br />
Leaving you with 6'400 to split for regular aa/exp.<br />
<br />
so you finally get 5760 regular exp, 640 aa exp and 1600 leadership exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note 1: the bug that was losing you some exp when not going full aa or full exp has been corrected long ago.<br />
Note 2: see that, in this case, the player is almost getting only half the regulard exp of someone else going 100% ( 10'000 vs 5'760 ), scary isn't it !<br />
Note 3: sharing exp between aa and normal isn't very efficient. Chose one and stick to it till ping or ding at least...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At LEAST this part has to be incorrect in some way, since my level 9 enchanter already has 5 leader aa points. Conversely, I made thousands of &quot;xp points&quot; to get my first 5 leader points on my 65 warrior. <br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe leader aa is given out per # of kills, or at least on some sort of sliding scale based on your level.<br />
<br />
WRT the initial question, I don't have any verification as to how penalties stack, however I run 10% to regular xp and it doesn't seem to cramp my style too much. flip-flopping is the easy way to avoid the possibility, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought they removed the xp penalty ages ago.  I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They removed it for classes, not for races.<br />
<br />
Warriors and rogues still get 5% bonus though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On the monk board, a person claimed that putting ANY xp into AA's (even 10%) disables the entire racial penalty.  I have no idea if it is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I noticed that my leadership AAs seems to be based more on # of kills more so then EXP.  In a LDoN my Leadership exp shoots up, where as in a BoT group I get more EXP per kill, but my Leadserhip AA hardly moves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you happen to raid a bit, and have the choice, only turn leader aa on during raids. The kill rate is high enough that you can get substantially faster leader AA, without loosing much if any normal exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agree Curdlex...  Not sure if it is the amount of kills or if they have tailored the ldon/expedition zones for better leaderxp.  My leadership moves extreamly fast on LDoN or in Sewers but slows way down in BoT for example...  <br />
Even normal LDoNs are not good AA but great leader xp for me.<br />
<br />
Darkeeper 65 Overlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, I think you get far more leadership XP in a full group than in a partial group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On the monk board, a person claimed that putting ANY xp into AA's (even 10%) disables the entire racial penalty.  I have no idea if it is true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its quite the opposite.  Putting ANY into REGULAR gets the racial penalty applied to AAEXP as well as regular.<br />
<br />
If you have a racial penalty, you are far better off doing full AA when doing AA, and full regular when doing regular.<br />
<br />
Racial Penatly is applied to ALL exp gained first, unless its 100% into AA.<br />
<br />
Doing 50/50 on an Iksar Beastlord gets BOTH slower AA and slower Reg.<br />
<br />
Doing 100/0 to Reg puts Iksar at ~18% penatly...80/20 on Woodelf Druid does NOT match 100/0 on Iksar.  Iksar racial penalty is ~18%, doing 80/20 for 4 yellows, and 90/10 for the other matches it closer.<br />
<br />
Doing 0/100 to AA on Iksar is EXACTLY the same as 0/100 on Woodelf Druid.</div></div><hr />
