<br />
I don't give a shit if it'll make some content too easy. That's the way EQ's done. Remember back when Trak was a fairly high end raid during Kunark? Yeah, he's duoable now. So really, content is already trivial, so fuck it.<br />
<br />
I want snap aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doh.<br />

Sounds like you're one step away from rolling up a knight twink to see how the other half lives.<br />
<br />
:-(</div></div><hr />

&quot;Tired of having your newb toon kicked around by rats and beetles?Come back to EQ and kill GODS with ease!Every return customer will instantly be given GM gear and instanced God encounters.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Those words bring a tear to mine eye. <br />
Dont roll up a knight,Screw knights and their goat raping ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was being serious too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Togr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ever been to Dick's Tavern?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, they put these huge dunce hats on your head with rude sayings.<br />
<br />
Last time I went there I saw a Knight with a hat that read &quot;I rape sheep&quot;.  Next to him was another Knight, his hat read &quot;Baaaaa&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wait I been there before the one in Boston  Dicks' Last Resort I think is the name of the joint.  Pretty cool place and decent food too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've never seen anybody duo trak, his port makes him pretty difficult with two people. Pally/Mage might work, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">do trak just like Seru Mini's.. They dont banish Pets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Trak can also be pulled to the Banish point, if you're /really/ nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">do trak just like Seru Mini's.. They dont banish Pets... <br />
<br />
So sticking with the duo thing: a pet class and a cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SK/Monk/Maybe Bard + any healer, given sufficent MR. <br />
<br />
During my last encounter with Trakanon, in which an SK/ranger/ranger/Shaman/Druid group lost, over 2/3rds of Trak's damage on me came from the lifetap proc- I died to a damage spike from a lucky string of procs, and the shaman couldn't tank well enough to put Trak in the dirt. <br />
<br />
Solo, of course, negates the banish: You will not evade me! You're then left with pulling Trak's lair. This is the tricksiest part, Trak is a beast to split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm pretty sure enchanter/cleric could duo Trak with ease.  I don't think the split would be particularly problematical.<br />
<br />
That sounds like a fun thing to experiment with, in fact.  I wonder which of the critters near Trak's lair are flagged immune to charm, and which are flagged immune to pacification?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Protector can't be charmed from what i hear.<br />
<br />
Trak is a beast to split.<br />
can pull all of his lair to single him out without even using FD if you've been there, given how aggro works.<br />
<br />
anyway, to not derail the thread further. I'm all for giving Thaak snap aggro :D</div></div><hr />

&quot;You will not escape me (insert mob here)!&quot;</div></div><hr />
