I know we all have busy schedules and have to budget our time, but if someone has a few minutes to spare I would much appreciate a favor.<br />
<br />
I am a 62 warrior at the moment and have Epics that I use almost exclusively. I am at the point where I am thinking of trying to upgrade weapons. I came to this section to find out info on upgrades, and I do see some valuable info here. HOWEVER....:)<br />
<br />
I really don't know what some of the weapons you guys are talking about are, or where I might get them. I see a lot of acronyms, and I am apparently out of touch on a lot of them. I do understand a few of them, CHoS = Copper Hammer of Striking, <br />
BoC = Blade of Carnage, but there are several weapons that you guys talk about that sound tasty, but I have no way of knowing what they are or where they come from.<br />
<br />
If anyone has the time and inclination, would you please post in whole words what some of the more preferred weapons are and where they might be found. This would sure help on my search, and might help others who see it too.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time and effort :)</div></div><hr />

Other than that if something isn't listed just ask what it is.</div></div><hr />

Good luck to you and be safe</div></div><hr />
