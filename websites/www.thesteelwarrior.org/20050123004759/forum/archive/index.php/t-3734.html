And the stuff warriors have already is sweet. Not only do we actually GET something, but it's actually nice.<br />

We won't get dual wield though, it seems... but we can get shield bash in a game where stuns actually mean something.<br />
And we get shouts, yay!<br />

Dont know why some people hate the WoW models..<br />
not only are they not even in beta yet... but they already look damn sweet.<br />
Low polygons ya... but they manage to do amazing stuff with low polygons...<br />
oh no! low polygons, gasp! That means I might actually be able to keep spell effects and farclip plane on full, and not lag?? wow. (no pun intended)</div></div><hr />

Aye, me and my buddys talk about WoW just about everyday. And many hardcore people i know in game seem pretty excited about it also.<br />

: Many of the MMORPGs (&quot;Massively-Multiplayer-Online-RPGs&quot;) currently on the market target hardcore game players and are characterized by complicated game mechanics and somewhat monotonous &quot;level grinding.&quot; Our goal from the start has been to create a streamlined interface that allows players to delve into the world quickly&quot;<br />

<br />
 I would be VERY surprised if they neglected the hard core gamers - most of the programmers designing the game are hardcore gamers themselves.<br />
<br />
As to how well the game will work given their design philosophy we'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore gamers are what make the game what it is. <br />

love it or hate it, look at fires of heaven, legacy of steel and the others who were top of the game back then when EQ was young. As vocal as they were, they helped shape EQ. The casual gamer isn't what pays the bills. It's the people who play all day everyday.<br />
<br />
I believe that Tigole is helping develop the high end game for WoW, so you know that it will be interesting. And i believe Furor has friends there so i'm sure he's putting in his input or at least throwing subliminal messages to his friends that work there :)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm still enjoying EQ and will play that until WoW comes out. I really like the &quot;cartoony&quot; graphics they have and it (to me) helps bring out the fantasy setting. As for what class? i'm not sure yet. I'm leaning to the undead rogue, but not sure yet. I'd like to take a break from the warrior fascade after playing it for 3+ years, hehe. although the dwarf rogue looks pretty bad ass on the site.<br />
<br />
Definately looking forward to it and i hope it's as good as a fraction of the hype it's been getting.</div></div><hr />

 While FoH and such may have helped shape EQ into what it's become, they don't pay the bills nearly as well as the other 350,000 account holders who will never see Time do. :) <br />
<br />
 And, just a FYI, a guy who uses something 100 hours a month versus a guy who uses something 500 hours a month is actually paying a bigger share.....his upkeep costs are lower, you see. Fact is, folks like me are providing EQ Welfare for the high end guilds. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, it is a HELL of a lot easier to have nice character models that are cartoony than the fake horrid looking character models that are trying to be &quot;realistic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not to mention (personally) it is a LOT easier to be pulled into a fantasy world of demons and goblins when you are surrounded by fantasy figures.<br />
<br />
And lastly... have you see the towns and cities? WOW. They are awesome and FAR more character than any eq cities. What I LOVE about a game is when you explore and you are suddenly HIT with the most amazing of sights!<br />

This is so true  for example Maru Seru on the moon when Norrath is visible it is truley breath taking.   Sanctus Seru one of the most beautiful cities in EQ when I seen it for the first time I was speechless.  There is more examples I just cant remember them now.</div></div><hr />

Nice race/class combo...<br />
<br />
Side bar.  If I read correctly they have dungeons that you crawl through.  Once you get to the end, there will be a choice of instance dungeons to go through.  Sounds good.  Instead of PoP'in down to Butcherblock.  Some will actually have to survive some before getting handed an adventure.  Might be a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Brings in the nice aspects of instanced dungeons.. without bringing in the &quot;Hi there, you look like you could use a Assassinsation adventure!&quot;<br />
<br />
The zoning is also seamingless, except for certain things like instanced dungeons.<br />
<br />
And high end WILL be present, you can bet on that.<br />
Probably won't be that much high end at the start, won't be much use for it till about 3months later anyhow....<br />
but Blizzard know very well what &quot;hardcore&quot; means.<br />
And having Tigole work on the project was no coincidence.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying it is going to suck or going to be great until I personally sit down for a couple of weeks and play the game actually play it.

<br />
Yah alot of the hype is hype, imagine that.  <br />
<br />
But alot of the hype from those of us who have played alot of blizzard games is founded upon a long standing quality we have observed in their games.  They dont release unfiinished product like other companies we know /caugh SOE caugh caugh, they dont typically have blatent balance issues (if they do, they are quickly recognized and addressed), they also listen to their customers unlike other companies we know.  <br />
<br />
SO yes, the hype is just that hype, imagine that.  But some of us are surmising that Blizzard will turn out their usual quality product, in which case, WoW could very well be god.  Did you read the 10 page article in the magizine where they introed the undead for hte first time?  The two guys who did that review do not like mmorpgs at all.  They were very skeptical, but at the end of their two days of PLAYING the game they had to be ripped from the computers, they liked it that much.  <br />
Granted, 2 writers opinions dont mean a whole lot at this point, especially when so much can change between now and release, but it does add to the support for all the hype.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah two writers that have no knowledge about mmorpgs have the authority to tell me that this game is going to be great.  They probably means that they were enthralled by the pretty pictures.  That article means shit to me.   Blizzard has in the past put out alot of great games and this may not be any differant but I not going to say so until I played it.   Customer Support how can you comment on that now when the game is not even live yet.  CS might have been good in the past,  but all they had to deal with was Technical Support.  This is a brand new ball game for them so lets wait and see how they will deal with the problems that go along with this many people playing at one time.     <br />
<br />
<br />
Listen like I said before I am not going to say that this game will be good or this game is going to suck until I play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If warriors got an innate ranged nuke that'd be outside the concept, how do you define an ability? Call it a spell, call it a /disc, call it Wang fu -  I'll worry about the effect itself rather than the 'classification' as far as that goes. Warriors teleport via external means throughout EQ are they getting an inate ability? I've not read about that?<br />
<br />
As you say though Gnomers, whilst it 'looks promising' the real proof of the pudding is in the eating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Valersis when I wrote that I was reading the class description and for the most part I was wrong each &quot;skill&quot; has casting time.  I took it as a spell since if it was an innate skill then it should be instantious not having a to wait ten seconds to perform it,  the duration part of it I do not have a problem with just the casting part.  My biggest gripe is the teleportation ability that they get<br />
<br />
World of Recall - We've seen the teleport skill demonstrated by the warrior but it doesn't comfortably fit in any of the other categories, it's more a spell than skill/ability anyhow.  We'll keep it here for now.  It allows the Warrior to teleport across a distance {more than from one side of the screen to the other}.<br />

no duh we dont know how it's REALLY going to be...<br />
but take what they show, what they promise and their reputation...<br />
compare it with.. oh say... EQ2... and you get a pretty good idea of which is going to be better.<br />
<br />
As for warrior spells... what spells? That town teleport thing is a mistake, there will be scrolls that allow you to port to cities, but warriors wont get that as an ability.<br />
And the other &quot;spells&quot; are shouts, bashes, and rampages...<br />
HOW do you see those as spells?... I'm sick of people who think the mere fact of DOING something is casting a spell...<br />
OMG, Kick is a DD nuke! we get spells, wtf!?$<br />
<br />
EQ has hurt the warriors so deeply, seems it has become a blasphemy to do anything else then Kick and Taunt :/</div></div><hr />

I stated that I was wrong, let me spell it out for you so that you can comprehand it better. I was W-R-O-N-G as I stated before hand.  It is the casting part I do not get and I have a problem with it.  OK my little rant was misinformed and I was wrong.<br />
<br />
So you are saying that IT will ROCK just from word of mouth.  Hmmm just like SWG now look at how that turned out.  How the FUCK can you say it is going to ROCK when no one knows what the final product is.  This is Blizzard's first attempt at a MMORPG if it was RTS then we assume it would from their past products but it so I am being a little skeptical about the game and will not listen to the hype and make up mind when I sit down and play it</div></div><hr />

so no, I didnt have any chance of reading it.<br />
<br />
And erm... read my post... I'm not saying it will ROCK... and I don't want to explain it all again, when I've already explained myself 1 post up.<br />
<br />
And making a first attempt at a MMORPG does little...<br />
actually, imo, having experience in MMORPGs can hurt a lot, sort of a like a double edged sword.<br />
Look at Asheron's Call 2...<br />
then look at first attempts (DAoC, EQ, Ultima..)<br />
<br />
It's what is also known as begginer's luck.<br />
When doing something the first time, you're freaked out on failing, so you do your best to bring out a good GAME.<br />
But when you got experience, sometimes you think it's enough, and you can concentrate on other stuff like graphics... and the game will come together on it's own, thanks to your experience.</div></div><hr />

I played ACII it had potential it really did but the problem with it had so little content that all you did was run around and hack and slash.  They had problems with LAG OMG the rubberband effect was in full force in that game if they concentrated more on content than graphics then it would of been one hell of a game.   I am a little skeptical that is all.  When I do paly the game and I like it I will be sure to post a thread saying it ROCKS until then I will have my doubts</div></div><hr />

I'm liking the look of what i see there - particularly the much more realistic cooldown periods on 'disciplines' :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just poked around a bit on that link and I gotta say, Blizzard is actually making a warrior that looks like a lot of fun to play.  We'll see if they can actually make a good mmog, but given their reputation, I'd expect it to be good.  Certainly looking over the list of what options WoW warriors have, it really hammers home the point of just how little EQ warriors have.  Blizzard is certainly far closer to what I woule perceive warriors to be than SoE is.<br />
<br />
I swore I'd never do another mmog after I leave EQ, but if WoW is what it promises, I'll ditch EQ and jump to WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are still weeks away from Alpha.  So yeah ranking it as great and all is premature... But this thread isn't meant to be an attack session on those thoughts but more for creative and analytical comments from the warrior community on a new game.  So those &quot;great&quot; comments are not out of line.  <br />
<br />
Remember this is the site that most games use to measure the &quot;state of the warrior&quot; in the mmporg community regardless if all we talk about is EQ.  My thought is someone at Blizzard is already aware of this thread and taking our comments to heart.<br />
<br />
Side note.  Did Diable originate the &quot;Yell&quot; skill?  If so I think that would be a great addition to a warrior's taunting ability.  That being the case and Blizzard having fine tuned their Yell in Diablo, I think (remember I'm saying I THINK) they have a great access to balancing the warrior class if it ever a need came for that.  &quot;Hmmm... class unbalanced?  Let's think of another Yell that would equate them&quot;..<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, from what i remember about the warrior &quot;yell&quot; skill :D i think it was called &quot;warcry&quot; and it increased group attack and defense + nudged the hit points up a bit ( i'll get the specifics about it later when i go look at home ).<br />
<br />
overall thoughi'll scream praises about WoW and whatnot ( pick on gnomers' day :D )....because as a refrence Blizzard has almost always put out a quality product and I personally felt that they have listened to their playerbase and made changes accoridngly after feedbacks. <br />
<br />
SoE has left me hung, drawn, and quartered with this day and age' subsequent dismissal of their interest in ever fixing my class I personally have invested years into..so if the grass is greener on the other side or not isn't really the arguement; it's more of &quot;i'm tired of my dirt laden field of broken toys&quot; and going to play elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been following the development of WoW for awhile now.  Obviously you can't say if a game is good or bad until you see the finished product.  However, from playing MMORPGs, from just watching a lot of games go through devekopment, from knowing Blizzard's track record, and from what I've seen/know about the game, WoW has the potential to blow away everything else that has come before it.<br />
<br />
I think that Warriors can duel wield.  I remember seeing Warriors as one of the classes under the skill.  I was also under the impression that all dungeons would be instanced.  Some would be geared towards one group type crawls, and some would be raid type.  Outdoor zones would mainly be for soloing and the monsters in dungeons won't necessarily be different than outdoor mobs, just harder.  Take a look at the link to a pretty good article about WoW.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'll definitely play a Warrior in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game looks interesting to me. And to some others.<br />
<br />
It looks like it's worth giving a try.<br />
<br />
That's the bottom line. Why all the hate for people who are interested in trying something new because it looks fun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the link to such an informative article. It further strengthens my belief that WoW is going to be a great MMOG. The screenshots are beautiful. I would also like to add to this discussion the following:<br />
<br />
FUCK CASTERQUEST !! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Im playing SWG at the moment and I too am waiting for WoW to come out.  Its too bad its taking so long, else I'd be playing it now.<br />
<br />
Look at all the hardcore players on battlenet.  Hell I still play War 3 from time to time, even Diablo 2.  You've got all the lvl 99 characters out there waiting for a chance to compete against other hardcore players.  <br />
<br />
WoW is the next stage for a lot of Battlenet folks.  I think they will love it once they make the transition over to MMORPG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilwee Beasty</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW's graphics really appeal to me, and I personally can't wait till they open beta and release it so I can try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are still weeks away from Alpha <br />
<br />
Actually, they're starting Beta soon, I'm betting on december, but might be November.<br />
<br />
www.worldofwar.com also has some very nice unofficial movies.<br />
You see quite a few interesting things in em.. like monsters having the ability to become immune to certain spells.... root a mob too many times, and he'll become immune :p.<br />
<br />
The only thing I see that could drive certain people away, is the PvP...<br />
but details on that havent been revealed yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally will continue to play EQ and give EQ2 a try.I might give WoW a try once ,but just based off the graphics,I prefer the current EQ graphics. I prefer realism over a looney tunes cartoons.But of course content is more importent than any graphic concerns.<br />
 Not to mention,I hope they find some way to list abilites as something other than spells.The point of a warrior is the ability to kill WITHOUT spells.A &quot;warrior&quot; with spells is something totally different.<br />
<br />
And as far as breathtaking/feeling,IMHO Sony has never surpassed Antonica.I still get this weird feeling going through the zones in that part of EQ.Theres a character to those zones that Luclin and newer zones lack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that there will be PvP in WoW, but nothing like you saw in Diablo 2.  It will be limited, probably more like DAoC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alpha hasn't even started yet so Beta won't happen until at least January or Early February.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW and Lineage both look promising... I also suggest you keep up here: www.sigilgames.com  on the next game from Brad Mcquaid and company. If you don't know who he is, I suggest again you go check out that website. Their game is yet to be announced publicly.</div></div><hr />
