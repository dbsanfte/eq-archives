<br />
I was hunting tonight in the new Charasis.  Me and a group that I hunt with regularly had gotten our keys to HS recently and with the new patch, we decided the time was right to check out this zone.  Incidentally, our group was a 54 warrior, rogue, shaman and 55 cleric.  We decided to head south, since our shaman needed skulls on that side for a quest he was working on.  We had success crawling deep into the south end.  After about an hour we had cleared up to room 11 on the EQatlas map, and proceeded to head to room 10.  We cleared room 10 and decided to come back to room 11, which now had 2 repops at the northernmost end of the room.  I (the warrior) pulled these 2 mobs and our shammy slowed, but about this time, our group was SWARMED with about 10 mobs coming from the hidden passage heading north from room 11.  It seemed to be a train from nowhere.  Our group wiped of course, and we spent the next hour and a half in a messy corpse recovery that dampened my group's experience with Charasis.  We were all befuddled by what could have caused that to happen, and none of us have any clue why that could have happened.  None of our mobs ever ran away, we had no aggro that we knew of.  The only thing I can think of is that the mobs that I pulled somehow aggro'd the unnumbered room at -575, 0 and pulled an entire wing of the south side on us.   <br />
<br />
I guess I'm really here to find out if anyone that has been in the south wing of Charasis has experienced anything like this before.  My group wants to do more Charasis, but I think we have all lost confidence in the pathing of this zone, and we are gun shy about hunting in a zone that will kill unfairly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is good for AE, bad for the single mob in camp group :/<br />
<br />
There is a basement below 1/2 of the top zone, the out most tips of each wing does not cover the basement.  Now, AE spells have been changed so they don't effect the Z-Axis ... but, anything is still possible I guess.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question.  Back when I hunted (2 years ago) there if you AE'd over the basement mobs then yes you could easily get a full train of the entire basement back to your camp.</div></div><hr />

IIRC there is a mob close to the room that takes a d-tour and gathers all his friends to attack you from behind.</div></div><hr />
