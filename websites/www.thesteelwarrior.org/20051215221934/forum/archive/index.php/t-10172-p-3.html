thottbot is a rather amazing resource. finding instances isn't the easiest but usually you can ghetto search for em by looking at the comments in quests that deal with instances. or again like Haass hinted by knowing or being a class that deals with those instances directly. no way I would've found Razorfen Kraul before a few days ago if I had not been a warrior.</div></div><hr />

I don't get why people bitch so much about saving money for a mount. If you do most of your city's quests, you can probably be the level after honored by the time you hit 40, which I assume gets your mount to about, let's say 90 gold. That's still not a terribly large amount of money to raise if you farm humanoids, or you're smart and picked a tradeskill that makes megabucks, like mining/skinning!</div></div><hr />

I made 5 in 3 days as I recall.  Then, as we had a couple people with mounts, they started to contribute funds to get non-warlocks mounts. <br />
<br />
As a smith I have made very little on my trade. And with mith going for 6-12g a stack I am not likely to make a lot of gold on it soon either. I am able to do some nice work in unarmoring our guild warriors. (It seems that leather working gets mail at high levels, so don't count on hunters buying much of anything from you other than, mabe a Green Iron BP and a Mithril Scale Coif.)</div></div><hr />

Shoulda read up first =p<br />
<br />
Mining is so rediculously easy to skill up, you'd have to be pretty dumb not to take it if you want/need cash lying around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ninja..you skipped a line...<br />
<br />
It's due to you not having a paladin or a warrior I'm guessing, since you definitely would have found both quests if you did.  <br />
<br />
Next, we have...<br />

I don't get why people bitch so much about saving money for a mount. If you do most of your city's quests, you can probably be the level after honored by the time you hit 40 <br />
<br />
Lemme guess, you're alliance, aren't you?<br />
<br />
First things first.  Humanoids =/= more money.  Just because you click on a little coin icon every kill doesn't mean you make more when things like the soft tails off tigers that you get every 4th kill sell for 8s6c.  Secondly, level up a horde character.  I'm not complaining or anything, but Horde quest rewards have A LOT less pure cash involved than alliance.  You basically need to do quests for Ratchet or Booty Bay or Gadgetzan if you want money on the Horde side, cuz you ain't getting dick for doing quests.  It was fairly easy for me to see on my level 5 warlock on a PvP server that he had roughly double the cash on hand as my warlock on Horde on Hellscream.<br />
<br />
And with mith going for 6-12g a stack I am not likely to make a lot of gold on it soon either <br />
<br />
Someone needs to learn where to mine mithril  :) ...shit is all over the place.  Had like 60 bars in the bank just waiting for me to have things to do with it a few days ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?q=920<br />
<br />
Talk to a dude in stormwind, and he tells you to head out there to kill Roogug.<br />
<br />
You also have a duplicate of the quest given by Auld Stonespire to kill Charla Razorflank given by an NPC in Feralas.<br />
<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?q=742<br />
<br />
Paladin quest requiring you to go to Shadowfang keep.<br />
<br />
So, lets try this again.  Did you miss them?  Yes. <br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly is this responsive to?  I posted, to be clear, &quot;I can fucking confirm that I didn't miss any quest for Shadowfang or Kraul.&quot;  Your research only confirms it further.  As you pointed out, those quests are for classes that, um, I am not.  So I didn't miss those quests.  There is no possible fucking way in the world that I, alone, could ever have gotten those quests (furthermore, there is no way I could ever complete those quests, even with questshare with the right classes). <br />
<br />
I'm not being insulting.  The game does indeed spell out places for you to go, you just need to keep your eyes open and you'll find them.<br />
<br />
You were being insulting, just not to me.  You came waltzing into this thread telling everyone there was no point in discussing it because the game tells us where to go.  The point of the two examples I used was that, no, the game doesn't spell out places for ME to go.   My only chance would be to rely on other people, of other classes, who may or may not get quests to go out to these locations...Give me a break.  <br />
<br />
If I'm going to rely on other people, or &quot;keep my eyes open&quot; as you suggest, why do it in game?  Why not also, oh, I dunno, not be condescending in this thread and listen to folks' suggestions here instead of randomly coming across the right class in the game who happens to have picked up this quest on their own?  Whether I listen to people gabbing about their individual quests in game or I listen to it here, there is zero difference.  The bottom line is that the game would never have led me to certain places and I learn about them from others.<br />
<br />
If you do quests in Selpucher you will get quests for Shadowfang. For the Kraul, I'm sure some guy on the Barrens somewhere wants you to do something in it. <br />
<br />
Phan, you must have me confused with someone in the horde.  If you think an alliance would be wandering around Selpucher or the Barrens in the 20s actually doing quests that the game led them to, you clearly aren't playing an alliance character.  The only reason I ever saw the Barrens in my 20s is because Raaj recommended during Beta that Wailing Caverns was a lower-level instance than Deadmines that I might try...so I did research on Thotbott for how to get my ass over there (traversing a 30+ Dustwallow Marsh zone) and tried it.  I think hearing suggestions from others on this thread and others are invaluable for enriching our gaming experiences.  The game may be great, but it doesn't handhold everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass, you can stop with the &quot;Horde have it so hard&quot; shit right now, because it's simply not true anymore. Sure, they had it difficult because of the absolute shit sucking or lack of quests early in beta, but both leveling trees are about as even as they can get. <br />
<br />
And it's pretty common knowledge that it's not just the cash on humanoids that's good. They happen to drop those little things called weapons that sell for a decent chunk of change, plus cloth that you can dump in the AH, PLUS they have schematics that can sell well also. So that little 6 silver you get about every 4th kill &lt; the average of 1 silver, 15 copper, plus pickpocket items (if you're a rogue), plus the cloth I get 3/4ths of the time, plus either a grey weapon that sells for about 10 silver or a green item that sells for about 20-25 silver, plus the food so I don't have to buy food at an inn. The only reason to really farm beasts is if you're a skinner, and the raptors in STV, because they drop medium leather. That's honestly the only time I'd say that farming beast &gt; farming humanoids.<br />
<br />
(For reference, I can dump a stack of Wool Cloth in the AH for about 40-50 silver, silk cloth for 50-60 silver, and linen for about 20-30. Medium Leather goes for about 10-15 silver for 10.)<br />
<br />
Money's not terribly hard to come by, it's just learning how to spend it wisely is all that matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say anything about the leveling tree, I'm talking about cash from quest rewards, which is clearly different.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, I've gotten more green drops off animals than I have off humanoids, so your theory goes out the window.  Cloth also doesn't contribute to my cash flow, because it goes directly to my tailor, and then to bandages after that.  I'm happy you sell everything you get, but some of us have friends who use the shit we loot :p<br />
<br />
Vig, seriously, chill the fuck out.  What are you doing in an instance without a group? Jack fucking shit.  Does there need to be a quest for every class in the game taking you to every instance?  No...because if you have a guild or a group of friends spread out amongst some classes, one of you is going to get a quest to go somewhere and you don't all need to have it to know the dungeon exists.  The point is that a group of Alliance (Which is likely Paladin, Paladin, Warrior, Druid, Warlock, from what I've fuckin seen), WOULD have found their way to RFK and SFK just fucking fine.   If you disagree, fine, but it's not like there's not a goddamned glowing yellow exclamation point leading your faction to these zones or anything.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your only chance in these locations is to rely on people of other classes.  You don't solo instances....at least not for any meaningful progress of your character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is besides the point, at least if I understand what your point originally was.  I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of:  You don't have to conduct research on areas to go or even discuss it because the game does all of that for you and leads you exactly where you want to go via quests.  Im pretty sure you've already conceded somewhere in all this argument that, in fact, we often need to listen to other people, if for nothing else than to hear about zones you otherwise wouldn't know of because they have quests there.  I add to that maybe read some threads on boards, and take a look at sites like Ally and Thotbott if we want to see all the content during the level in which we could best experience it. <br />
<br />
Now if that wasn't your point, then this entire discussion is rather useless as I simply pitched in purely out of exasperation when I read your post.  <br />
<br />
And in terms of answering the original question:<br />
<br />
I  am alliance and my leveling worked much like this:<br />
<br />
1-11 NE &amp; Darkshore<br />
12-20 Westfall, Redridge, Loch Modan, Deadmines, Wailing Caverns<br />
21-30 Redridge, Darkshire, Wetlands, Barrens, Razorfen Kraul, Stockades<br />
31-40 Stranglethorn Vale, Wetlands, Shimmering Flats, Gadgetzan, Desolace, Badlands, That-Area-North-of-Wetlands, Dustwallow Swamp, Gnomergan, SM, Uldaman<br />
<br />
I'm now 42 and finishing up the SV quests.  I plan to head to Arathi Highlands next and then probably back to Gadgetzan.</div></div><hr />

Green items are neat, but most still end up on the vendor for me, along with the grey weapons and armor I tend to loot too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vig, this is my point.<br />
<br />
I have a group of friends playing WoW, as you do.<br />
<br />
In my group, when we're all on, we sit down and say &quot;Okay, what are we gonna do today?&quot;  In our various travels, we compare quest logs and see what we have that looks interesting.  Invariably we come up with something like &quot;Well, I've gotta go to this Razorfen Kraul place...uhh, somewhere in the south barrens, wanna go there?&quot;  The reply is usually &quot;Sure, can you share the quest?&quot;  &quot;Uhh, nah, looks like XXXXXX only, but I should still finish it up because it looks like a phat reward.&quot;  And off to the Kraul we go.  <br />
<br />
Does everyone in my group need to have the quest in order to alert us to a zone that is probably appropriate for our level?  Absolutely not.  If we gotta head there for the warrior, or the shaman or whatever, we fuckin take a trip on down there.  This game clearly isn't meant to be played alone.  If you want to do that, then poking around places will net you directions to a few places that you can play alone.  If you have friends, they'll find even more places than you due to their class/quest status, and you'll ALL be able to go there, at least if you're any kind of friends at all.  Do you personally need to have a blinking sign telling you to go somewhere for you to go?  I don't...one of my friends blinking signs is good enough for me, and THAT is my point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only quest that any one of my friends ever had that I couldn't pick up was the Pally weapon.  No one in my guild plays a warrior.  No one in my level-range plays a priest or a mage or a warlock.  And obviously we don't have any shamans (instead we have 3830103184548504040340 hunters).  Not a single person ever would have actually randomly obtained a quest in Kraul or Wailing Caverns without having done research on it first.   And we didn't go there to complete quests.  We went there just to SEE it.  We did WC without having obtained any quests because we just wanted to experience it.  I suspect the same thing for the Horde and Deadmines or Blackfathom Deep or Gnomergan. <br />
<br />
But, you know what?  You can experience content solely that you or your friends figure out by traversing the world.  I and others will talk about locations and do research outside the game.  At the end we'll compare notes.  ;)</div></div><hr />
