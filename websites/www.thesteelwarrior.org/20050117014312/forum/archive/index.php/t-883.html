AC: +45 Str: +12 Sta: +12 Dex: +12 HP: +50 <br />
<br />
Champion BreastPlate<br />
AC: +47 Str: +14 Sta: +10 Agi: +5 Dex: +7 Magic Resist: +4 Poison Resist: +10 HP: +90 <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess Champion's it a slight bit better?  Less Dex and little less Sta but more HP and couple more Str.<br />
<br />
Basically do I raise faction and even try for an MQ or just get Cobalt?<br />
<br />
Or since the faction is the same, is there a chance I can get MQ for Myrmidon's?<br />
<br />
Again, I have some cash from an alternate life (old character).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would  try to get a vindi BP after that though, if you have a guild capable of doing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would get the cob bp.  The snorf bp is so close that I dont see the point to raising that faction.  I would go for kael bp and pass the cob bp onto someone else if your guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction isn't the same on myrmidon and champs.  Need Ally CoV for myrmidon (a lot of work if you've done nothing to work on it), and Kindly Coldain for Thurg (some report doing it at amiable, some report it getting eaten even though they got the quest at amiable, so kindly is for safety).<br />
<br />
If you plan on wearing the BP for a long time, I would say champs for the hps.  But, if you plan on upgrading anytime soon, get the cobalt so you can sell back.  If the price is higher on the champs though, I'd stick with cobalt too.  Resellability is very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want a GREAT BP :<br />
- Contact the local &quot;high lvl guilds&quot; ask them if they do AoW<br />
- Ask them if they would sell the Vindi BP (dkp guilds probably will)<br />
- Buy &amp; Go loot Vindicator BP  (try statue too you never know)<br />
<br />
Nothing even comes close to Vindi BP outside SoL/PoP highend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like they idea of buying loot rights to a Vindi BP. Unfortunately I think you will find this is easier said than done. Until every war, bard, shammy, pali, and SK in a guild has one, they have no need to sell the loot rights. My guild is in the plane of Time and we still do an occassional Vindi kill for people who joined after the AoW killing stopped.<br />
<br />
So between the Champ's and Cobalt there is only one thing to consider - how long before you get an upgrade? If you think you have a chance at scoring a Vindi BP some time in the near future, then get the Cobalt so you can sell it when you do get the upgrade. If a BP upgrade is not in your future, just get the Champs (or Myrmidon/Warlord MQ).</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm slack on the lingo, but:<br />
<br />

     .......... I hate acronyms so I tend not to rememeber them....AoW?...........<br />
- Ask them if they would sell the Vindi BP (dkp guilds probably will)<br />
     .......... what is dkp ............... ??<br />
- Buy &amp; Go loot Vindicator BP (try statue too you never know)<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoW = Avatar of War in Kael<br />
<br />
DKP = dragon kill points, it's a system of awarding loot in a guild, basically you get points for attending raids then use the points to buy loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">chestplate of vindication.<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5509<br />
note the ac is 45 with stats.<br />
<br />
AoW is for factions?<br />
<br />
Culatural armor is 53 with lesser stats for an ogre.<br />

Depending on your race, it may be hard to come by certain culatural armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, AoW probably gives the single best CoV faction hit (positive).<br />
After doing Northern Temple of Veeshan i had my CoV faction bottomed out and after 2 AoW runs I was back to max ally after 2nd statue fell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry :)<br />
<br />
AoW = Avatar of War (the BIG  BOSS in kael Drakkel).<br />
Killing him usually involves pulling Vindicator &amp; Statue.<br />
Thus you may get a shot at a good &amp; easy BP if you are lucky<br />
<br />
DKP = Dragon Kill Points. For every raid you attend you get points.<br />
Items cost you points. Just like real life money &amp; work.<br />
Thus you dont spend you points/money on alts/twinks.<br />
Which means Vindi/Statue has decent chances of decaying.</div></div><hr />
