<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yari</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awhile back i got the epic sword for my warrior, And i had saw a post about turning them into a quest npc near the final epic turn in person to receive back augmentable epics.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on who to turn in the swords to? I dont want my swords to get eaten, being gm support takes days to get any help if i did run into a problem. So would just appreciate some help on the matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the quest info:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2645<br />
<br />
Note:  If you want to get 2 red and 2 blue blades you can get a mage summoned sword (sword of runes?  not sure the name) and put it in your scabard and combine to make 2 new 1h epics and then you turn in the 2h + scabbard and get the other ones.  I like having the 2 blue blades for doing fletching skill ups since they give me a huge dex boost.</div></div><hr />

only time i saw him moved was when someone was talking to him and had errantly trained a guard there and that someone ended up hitting him ( /whistles innocently ) and all of them ran to WFP zone</div></div><hr />
