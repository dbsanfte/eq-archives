<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danoorn</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have recently seen, on a few boards, questions about targeting. It really disappoints me when I see warriors answer that question with something as inert as &quot;F8&quot;. If, as MA, that is your only tool, you’re screwed. The &quot;mouse and click&quot; method ranks a close second on how NOT to target quickly and efficiently.<br />
<br />
First, is there already a post on the boards that I’m missing that describes the preferred methods?<br />
<br />
If not, then maybe these notes will help some of the up and coming…<br />
<br />
The following only apply to the MA…<br />
<br />
MA = Main ASSIST. By definition, you are the primary /assist. This is not to be confused with MT (i.e. Main Tank). These are two different functions that warriors can (and usually) perform.<br />
<br />
As MA, your raid is looking to you for their target. If you are late, they have a tendancy to target ad hoc, and kill off mezzers. Not to mention they may grumble, escalating to full blown screams over time. If you are early, those that /ass often will be on the wrong target. Timing is everything.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the techniques I use to get the correct target quickly.<br />
<br />
1.	Target your puller. When they call a mob, start /assist’ing them. If you have multiple pullers, set up hot keys. I like to keep those on about bank 8. <br />
2.	When you see multiple mobs incoming, make your decision quickly. Either stay with the one you received from “ /ass [puller]”, or switch…but do it before they get any where near camp. Your mezzers are probably /ass’ing you to see what the MA target will be then start trying to mezz the adds.  Try to be consistent, it helps your mezzers as you gain more MA time. And they may even learn to like you. <br />
3.	Once the first target is low on health (10-15%), I’ll turn off attack, and start “looking” for the next target, without changing my target. This gives me the chance to decide what is next without releasing my target and causing confusion to those still on the “correct” mob.<br />
4.	If I do NOT have agro, I may even go stand next to the mezzed mob that will be next. Chanters love that! Gives them a clue as to the next mob before your call.<br />
5.	Once I see the “You have gained raid XP” message, or the kill shot message, IMMEDIATELY grab your next target and engage, breaking mez. The breaking mez part is important here. It allows everyone around to know the next target, that’s its loose, and to /ass you. The mezzer knows not to re-mez, which can cause serious agro issues, and allows the tanks that should be taunting an easier time.<br />
6.	Rinse, Lather, Repeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice at no time did I mention “F8”. &quot;F8&quot; is OK in XP groups, in raids, it will fail you given enough time. So how do I get the next target? During the &quot;looking&quot; phase, look to see where your least experienced mezzer is pointing. Thats where I start &quot;looking&quot;. <br />
<br />
Have fun ripping me up, as I know some of you don’t believe as I do. That’s OK. But please don’t answer targeting questions with some blanket “F8” stupidity.</div></div><hr />

Assist, F8, and mouse click are all valuable tools for a main assist and during the course of a VT clearing or a Bertox ring for example, I will use all 3 many times.<br />
<br />
Also, my guild doesn't assist until I tell them too (or whoever the MA is for the night).  This makes the MA's life much easier, since you can switch targets before you are ready to have people assisting you, and you can get your new target before the old mob dies without worrying about mezz being broken by the wrong person.  It also allows you to switch targets if you wind up on the wrong mob for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and I agree that F8 is AN option... but not THE option. Too many posts reflect that F8 is the primary tool of some MA's. I hope now they realize the choices available, and use the best option for the circumstance, not just the easiest to reach.<br />
<br />
I was really hoping that this had been disussed before and I just missed it the Library.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Targeting with the keyboard is always faster than using a mouse. After using F8 for a while its not exactly difficult to learn how close and which way to face to target the mob you want. And during fast paced trash clearings, where target selection isnt an issue, F8 works great. If I need to be careful with my targets, then sure bust ou the mouse, or if you want to be real slick, make a hotkey to /tar an_unmezzable_mob and push that if you see him in a pack of other mobs to avoid hassles with the mouse.<br />
<br />
My guild as well will not touch a mob untill the MT calls in for an assist, so that makes life nice.</div></div><hr />

LOL, well maybe I should have said &quot;My guild is not supposed to assist until I tell them to&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It at least made me realize I was doing a lot of things RIGHT.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
Though for me the only time I end up having fast/instant access to the right proper targeted mob, these days, tends to be when I pull. Heh.<br />
<br />
Raid lag's being a pisser lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use f8 basically all the time.<br />
<br />
Once you get used to it you can basically chose what you want to target by using it even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I raid frequently, and as long as you aquire a target fast and stick with it, the method you use in aquiring the target really doesn't matter... wheter you assist puller, F8 or mouse click, as long as it gives you a target, and allows the rest of the raid to assist off you, it's ok. when clearing to mobs you use multi tanking anyway ( I seriously hope so) and then it's not that difficult to see if you target the proper mob, if by accident you target the same mob as another tank, just grab another one. Worsed thing that can happen is that some caster types get smacked, builds character and does them a world of good.<br />
<br />
In case of multi inc mobs, its always handy to have the tanks staggered a bit in front of the raid force.. that way mt1 can grab a mob. other MT's engage, after a few seconds all MT's walk a different direction and it's suddenly very clear who's on who :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">F8's ok if you get in the mob's face first and it works fine for those mobs. If you're doing Bertox or some other event with a buttload of mobs in camp at any one time (VT anyone?) -- then random F8 is ass. Why? Answer this simple question:<br />
<br />
Three mobs are in camp. One is bard slowed and mezzed. Another is Chanter mezzed, but not debuffed yet. A third is beating on a chanter after they had a mez resist.  Which mob should the raid kill next?<br />
<br />
As MA, even when we have multiple MA's and I only have 20 people following my target, I feel like my job is to pick the best possible mob to kill next. I'm keeping track of the puller channel, mez and debuff spell messages, the healing channel so I can tell when someone is getting bashed on that shouldn't, etc. <br />
<br />
Just hitting F8 once a mob dies will often get a mob BEHIND me, not the one I'm facing. In some zones, F8 simply doesn't work. So really, if you rely on it, you will be hosed at some point.<br />
<br />
And yeah, train your raid force not to assist until you call it. Something I do to &quot;help&quot; them learn: every now and then I click on something, wait 1s, switch to another mob, and call attack. When I see mez drop on the wrong mob, I know exactly who wasn't following instructions and get a chance to publically humiliate them. ;) Of course I don't do this in critical situations, but it's proven to be very effective at getting folks to stop spamming their assist key.<br />
<br />
Something I found really useful to teach myself fast targetting was to make a chanter alt. I played a chanter to 56 and lemme tell you, raid CCers deserver a lot of credit when they manage to lock a pull down fast. It can be super hard just xping, especially with mobs who have super tiny &quot;to click&quot; areas (skeletons!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
F8 works oddly, for me ... some times it targets the MOB nearest the center of my screen, even if it's waay off in the distance.<br />
<br />
And when I'm in an overhead cam mode (which is often ... spell particles are a nice heads up when I'm with casters who like to notify me *after* they cast a spell ...) F8 doesn't work at all.<br />
<br />
Funniest thing about mousing onto mobs tho, is I often have a weapon on the cursor for fast switches ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use f8 alot...  The mouse not as much, especially on large raid situations in a close area. <br />
<br />
Too many time I have had the mouse ON a mob, clicked.. and got the Player standing just inches in front of me and just out of my vision. There are also mobs that I swear Defy mouse targeting.. Sol Ro Guards, you can click all day, but unless you click their burning spear, you will likely get nothing.<br />
<br />
If we are clearing trash, I always use F8 and call assist immediately. If this is a little rougher mobs, Like multiple pulls on FRo script where adds hit for 1k or so it depends. if we are mezzing, I target, taunt, etc, then break mez and wait for mob to hit me at least 1 time, then call assist. If on the other hand we are split tanking or the mob is off tanked, As soon as I see experience, I f8 check target and call assist. <br />
<br />
The new targeting ring is So useful in this situation, I just wish the radius of the ring was a little more consistent for mobs. Trees in PoE are such small rings, u can bareley see them under the edges of their roots, yest a mudslinger has a cirrcle that you can fit 3 identicle mobs all in the center area of it.. Besides that, the targeting ring is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find F8 to be wholly unreliable.  Sometimes it works, sometimes no mob gets targeted, somestimes it almost seems to target a random mob.  I create an ASSIST hotkey for the MA, and use it.<br />
<br />
I use the mouse sometimes also.<br />
<br />
If I am MA, usually I click on the mob's HEAD and that seems to do the trick - I get the mob targeted on the first attempt.  Good thing I played a sniper in Team Fortress!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't see the purpose of such posts.  Good MA's will have their own system and method worked out after years of raiding.  Bad ones won't, and posts like this won't make them play any differently. <br />
<br />
Basically, choose the correct target instantly and engage it instantly.  How you do it doesn't really matter.  I like to assist the pullers lots too, but it can often screw you up badly.</div></div><hr />

I find F8 to be wholly unreliable.  Sometimes it works, sometimes no mob gets targeted, somestimes it almost seems to target a random mob.    <br />
<br />
I also have a lot of problems with F8.  Half the time it won't even find a target even though there are 5 mobs right in front of me.  I always try it first, but I'm also ready with the mouse in case F8 fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chonn Kelvar</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have seen problems with F8, so I use the assist button religiously.   During a raid or major group, minimal communications are desired.   I only want to hear from the puller, mez and mana reports.   All else should have been worked out before.<br />
<br />
On long pulls or bad visability, the assist button gains addition importance.  When the puller is inbound, I will begin clicking the assist until I trigger on his mob.  He is now close to being in range.  In this situation, I will hail the target as an alert/wakeup for the casters.<br />
<br />
In breaking mez - if time permits - and based on things I learned here, I will taunt the mezed target 3-4 times, hail it and break it.  That way, I have the target in hand and don't have to do the target/Enchanter/Tank relay race...<br />
<br />
If we have mulitple mezed mobs, I have the puller break off the fight at about 10%, locate and target the next most dangerous mob.  Then when the main target goes down, I can use the assist key again (turning off attack- or not depending on time and circumstance) and begin taunting.  This way, I don't have to be trying to make future decisions while trying to fight.<br />
<br />
It's good practice to be prepared for the worse - you may get it, and then is too late to change tactics or discuss the problem.<br />

<br />
I am one of the two people in my guild that MA's, both of us choose targets slightly differently, but we both break off of our current target at aroudn 50% health.  We then move on to the next target and break mez, waiting to call attack when the xp message happens, or other sign of mob no longer existing.  The only real time we don't do this is if the mob is a splitter (VT, armors in PoA, etc).<br />
<br />
This is what works for our guild, it helps us to clear a bit quicker, and keeps people assisting when the target is called instead of when the mob is almost dead.<br />
<br />
I tend to use F8 alot with targeting, while the other MA usually uses mouse clicking.  The only time that I use assist is if their are no mobs in camp and the puller is inc with some.<br />
