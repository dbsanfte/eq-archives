<br />
iam a bit confused about the faction i need for this quest (Myrnidons, Skyshrine, Unadorned plate)<br />
<br />
Allakazahm says <br />
<br />
Faction Required -Lord Yelinak <br />
<br />
most people i asked say - required Coldain <br />
<br />
<br />
diffrent is <br />
for Yeli faction i have to go to kael with a groupe <br />
for Coldain faction i can kill mobs in GReate Divide without any problems. <br />
<br />
<br />
and 2nd part of this question <br />
a friend have 2 parts of this armour he dont need and i want to mq it. Does it work like any outher MQ ?<br />
<br />
First person hand in the unadorned plate <br />
second person need the correct faction and hand in the jewels and get the armour ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raivene</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Champions Armor - Farmed in Arena - Requires coldain faction<br />
<br />
Myrm Armor - Farmed in HoT - Requires Skyshrine (NOT Lord yel faction)<br />
<br />
Warlords Armor - Farmed in ToV anywhere BUT HoT - Requires Kael Faction <br />
<br />
Coldain Faction is Raised by Killing Kromriff giants (mostly).  Arena doesn't help a lot for that.<br />
<br />
Skyshrine faction is raised by killing Kromzek giants (Arena is the best spot)<br />
<br />
Kael Faction is raised by killing dorfs or dragons.<br />
<br />
There are quests to help with faction in all 3 cities as well.<br />
<br />
You can MQ any of the armors the way you said, though I think both may have to have the required faction.  (not sure on that last part)</div></div><hr />

<br />
so i can take this list http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=191<br />
and starting killing mobs ;)</div></div><hr />

You can check CoV easily by getting a port to Cobalt Scar and /conning any of the drakes or wyverns. When you get to ally, you're good to go.  Both people doing the MQ must be ally. And be sure to take along someone who knows the zone, Skyshrine is a damn maze.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has been said a few times in this thread, but I wanted to re-itterate and add to it.<br />
<br />
1)  Yes, kill in the Arena area of Kael.  You will get the biggest faction hits here, it seems like clearing the higher end mobs nets faction faster, at least to me anyways.<br />
<br />
2)  You can do the MQ so long as everyone handing in the items is Ally (max is not necessary).  You can also hand the items in any order, the person to hand in the last necessary item gets the armor.  I've done this many many times between all my toons and I normally have one toon loot all the armor drops in HoT.  The one and only time I tried with a non max-ally MQ'er we failed and I haven't tried it since then.  It is possible it would work, but I'm highly doubtful and would say do not risk it.<br />
<br />
3)  If you want myrmidon's armor, then you're going to Halls of Testing (HoT) in Temple of Veeshan.  It is much easier to get there and hunt there if you're not KOS with Claws of Veeshan faction.<br />
<br />
4)  One of the safest spots to test claws of veeshan faction is to zone into Skyshrine and walk in until you see the golem guards there and con them.  They shouldn't aggro and if they do it is very easy to run back out of the zone.  Entering from Wakening Lands is the area I'm speaking of.<br />
<br />
Gl and enjoy!</div></div><hr />

man iam iam happy that i dont need max-ally faction <br />
its a damm pain to get this faction :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between ally and max ally is about 20 minutes of work.  You're stoked about nothing really, it's no appreciable amount of time, especially compared to the time it takes to go from scowl to ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on how fast you kill if you are in Arena should be able to get from Scowl to Ally in about 12 hours or so.</div></div><hr />

Maze had me confused first time but got it down now(although never gonna go there again for this toon anyway).Bring a porter with you for turn in though just because its a long boring run out</div></div><hr />

The run out takes 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timrum</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok one more question :)<br />
<br />
with my last kill i got my faction to &quot;looks upon you warmly&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
i have a mix of 22 frost and storm Giant toes and 12 Giant warr helmets in bank - u think this are enough to get my ass to ally faction ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I recall correctly it goes warmly-kindly-ally, so you have two levels of faction to go through, I think that's about 400 points or so.<br />
<br />
You probably get anywhere from 5-20 points per turn in, so I'm thinking that if that doesn't get you to ally, then you will be extremely close.<br />
<br />
Someone else may know the exact numbers....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timrum</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok one more question about the exactyl way for the MQ. <br />
<br />
Person A (the one with the unadorned Plate item) hand in the item. Does he have to hit the give Button or just place it in trade window ? Is it importent which one of the 4 slots ? Must i open the trade window at same time or can i hand in the jewels after the unadorned plate was given to jendavuud.<br />
<br />
And anyone know the way to Jendavuud ? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Person A hands in the unadorned piece and hits give, which slot doesn't matter. Then you hand in the gems UNSTACKED and hit give. You should then recieve the Myrmidon armor piece in question.<br />
<br />
You will have to be ally, and I am fairly sure the person with the unadorned piece has to be ally as well, or else he will eat the unadorned piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, isn't there a pair of large banners hanging on the wall up there somewhere that ports you as well? I seem to recall a red one and a blue one, with one taking you to the bottom of the steps, and the other to the zone in. Last time I was up there was on my cleric before SoL, so it may have changed since then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, run around aimlessly for 4 hours like the rest of us did :D<br />
<br />
( seriously i can't remember the way tho :( )</div></div><hr />
