<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm posting this from EQLive for those that may be unaware that SoE has determined how they will address issues in GoD. Please forgive me for posting it again, but it is relevent information about a topic that has generated a lot of posting activity on TSW.<br />
<br />
Brenlo stated:<br />
Conor is correct, much of what is asked for by Paladins and SKs is specific to warriors and that will not be changing. Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. The fact that warriors can tank the harder content in Gates, while the knight classes cannot, does not mean Pallys and SKs are broken, rather that warriors are better tanks and that the content is too challenging. There is supposed to be a disparity between the tanking abilities of warriors and knights. Paladins and SKs want to be able to tank in the single group encounters, and they are right, they should be able to, but not at the expense of other classes. <br />
<br />
So now a plan is in place to adjust the content so it will still be tough for warriors, while also being achievable for the knight classes. Currently this is our solution. We will not be adding defensive discs or abilities to the knight classes. We will be tuning the content so that it is a challenge for everyone and excludes no one. We want a group to be able to succeed with a warrior, shadow knight or paladin as a tank. <br />
<br />
We do realize that you have other concerns as well, and the team is looking into them. I hope to have some news for you soon. <br />
<br />
later, he further clarifies by posting:<br />
We do view you as a viable tank class, just not as good as warriors.  That is why we are adjusting the content, so you CAN tank.  If we did not want you to tank, why would be adjusting the content to allow you to do so?<br />
 <br />
I believe that even warriors think the current content is too difficult.  It was not intended that only the best tanks of the three tanking classes could do it, and even then, only with the assistance of multiple healers.  You should not have to have 2 clerics and a warrior to complete any of the trials. But the problem extends beyond the trials.   Warriors should not be the only viable tank in Gates and that is what we are trying to fix through the content because it is a content problem. <br />
 <br />
Now as to all of the other concerns I have seen tossed about, as I have said, the team is considering them.  Things that are broken or don't make sense will still be fixed.  All I am attempting to clarify for Knight classes, is that we will not make changes at the expense of warriors and their unique abilities.  So keep the suggestions and comments coming and I will continue to pass them along and let's see if we can get through this together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
basically what this amounts to is a knight group will work better than a melee group because the only changing factor is who is ment to tank it and the mobs, the cleric will still have the same mana, the buffers will still buff the same, and the damage classes will still damage.<br />
<br />
all this does is make a baby mode<br />
<br />
bottom line is we should get the same gimp version knights get, not a harder one, all they are doing from what i can tell is saying &quot;pick a knight and it gets that much easyer&quot;<br />
<br />
or &quot;pick a warrior and everyone but him can be one rounded&quot;<br />

sounds like i would take the knight</div></div><hr />

From my understanding the namers will hit knights lower but everyone else the same as if a warrior was tanking.<br />
<br />
Again not what anyone wanted but NOW YOU CAN TANK IN GOD.<br />
<br />
I think knights have a hardon for tanking like a warrior. <br />
<br />
 I predict months from now the PoN crew will be still trying for defensive and the PoN admins will be still banning those with differing opinions.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ill admit it, i was wrong, they seem to have lost the defensive bug but go check out the PoN boards, theyre crying more than a river, its flood season.<br />
<br />
No one denies that the warrior whine over agro was bad, however warranted, but the crying there is rediculous. Bunch of babies. If it was the other way around id be pissed to but  suck it up and move on and get through it. At least you get to tank now.</div></div><hr />

AFAIK, there will not be two separate versions. In order to insure Paladins and SKs will be able to tank in the single group encounters content will be adjusted so it will still be tough for warriors, while also being achievable for the knight classes. He doesn't even really say that adjustments will be restricted to the trials.<br />
<br />
Knights are not upset because there will be &quot;kiddie versions&quot;, but because Brenlo said, Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. and aparantly there will be content in GoD where that matters.<br />

<br />
Forget defensive/upgrades and all else that was mentionned. I just want a true honest answer from you about something.<br />
<br />
Every 3rd post you were hinting that it bothered you that if knights had a mitigating ability that they'd be able to do content that they were not capable of doing before. This lead to lower tier knights possibly getting close to PoTime level gear. How exactly do you view the toning down of content as not doing the same thing except this time using warriors and every other class and at a MUCH greater percentage.<br />
<br />
Remember, this isn't 2 difficulty level instances here they're talking about. They're talking about the 1 and only version being tuned down to allow knights to have some reliability.<br />
<br />
Doesn't it bother you that guilds that aren't even at the EP level will now be able to get further into GoD possibly even skipping all of EP and PoTime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now a plan is in place to adjust the content so it will still be tough for warriors, while also being achievable for the knight classes.<br />
<br />
Taragor, they are saying that it will still be tough for Warriors.  Not lower tier Warriors.  Not Warriors in bazaar gear.  The Warriors that are tackling it now, today, with PoTime gear.  It won't suddenly become a walk in the park where every Warrior in the game gets a free freaking pass to GoD.<br />
<br />
Envision for just a moment that SoE has half a clue.  Yes, at times that can be a tad hard to do, but take the leap of faith.  It just might be possible that they in fact know what they're doing and will make changes that bump the melee DPS down just enough to allow Knights who are properly geared to succeed while still making it tough for Warriors who are properly geared.   Before saying absolutely they can't do it, how about you wait to see what they do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Liked the first part.  Not sure whether I like the second part, will have to see just how much it's tuned down for Knights.  If it's still really hard for Knights, just more doable now, then it won't cause as many problems perhaps.<br />
<br />
The statement they're making that I like is that Warriors are better tanks, and to the anger of the vocal knights, they made that difference actually worth a damn for once instead of just having it slightly easier.<br />
<br />
One thing you can be sure, the obvious tanking difference, while acknowledged, is going away.  If they're designing content to be tuned around Knights being able to tank it, then what was the point in the first place for the harder version?  All they're doing with this is removing the &quot;easier&quot; part from the warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't see how this can be possible, <br />
i mean any mob tankable by a knight will be very trivial for a warrior under defensive.<br />
<br />
so we are just going to get easier single group trials /shrug .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they're designing content to be tuned around Knights being able to tank it, then what was the point in the first place for the harder version?

<br />
What should happen is this.  Two characters are lfg, one a Knight, the other a Warrior.  A group should say, hmm well if we take the Knight we'll probably be fine for tanking but he'll also bring along some other stuff that could be handy.  While if we take the Warrior, we're pretty much sure we'll be fine for tanking, but he doesn't bring along much else to go with it.  Which do we want?  And how they decide should be a pretty close call.  If doing something like trials, they may very well lean in favor of the Warrior.  While in other situations they may lean in favor of the Knight.  Regardless of which they choose though, the situation should be realistically doable by both.<br />
<br />
It isn't reasonable that one of the three tank classes should be hands down, far and away, the best choice bar none for trials.  The fact that the boss mobs hit so hard made that true.  Now rather than just having the boss mobs hit like a ton of bricks so that survival is greatly enhanced if you have defensive, they'll have to come up with other ways of making it difficult beyond just dumping lots of pure DPS onto the mob.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about what I mean.  If it was true that a 25% defensive would have allowed Knights a reasonable rate of success and survival, then lowering mob DPS by something less than 25% will also have the same result.  Since mob DPS is a combination of DB+DI, and defensive only works against the DI, it shouldn't require a straight 25% DPS drop, but probably more in the 15% to 20% range.  If on top of that you shift the DB and the DI around a bit, so more of the damage comes from DB and a bit less from DI, you can reduce the effectiveness of defensive.  Which would mean that while Warriors would still benefit from defensive, it wouldn't be as dramatic a benefit because less of the overall DPS is DI based, but because you've dropped the overall DPS, the result is very similar.<br />
<br />
So you'd end up with a scenario where Knights can tank it, Warriors will still tank it at least a bit better, and the overall tier of Warrior able to tank it hasn't dropped significantly.<br />
<br />
It's going to be a balancing act.  They're going to have to tweak how high the DPS is while also tweaking how the DPS is generated.  And they even have the option of making additional changes like instead of one boss mob, have there be two boss mobs, one right after the other, but both having DPS a Knight could survive.  If both mobs take about 3 minutes to kill, the Warrior could use defensive on the first and would be without it on the second.  And there are still more things they can play with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seldom disagree with you. What should happen is a normal experiance group is as you've descrbed. What should happen in a hunting group going after loot from a red named mob is different.<br />
<br />
The group should say hmmm We better take a Cleric and another healer. Lessee, this particular red named mob is tougher than most, let's get a Warrior (or not), we need DPS and a puller - let's get a monk, etc.<br />
<br />
Make the trials needed flags and you must make them doable by all. That may well mean designing them to be doable by all. But Warriors are still entitled to some few mobs outside of raid situations where their greater survivability means something. Just as Knights are entitled to have ocassion to use a spell gem.<br />

<br />
Glatius what part of *knights aren't getting any upgrades* do you not understand in this equation? The *MINUTE* you lower the difficulty of the content to make it knight *TANKABLE* is the minute you open it up to lower tier warriors. It's basic math.<br />
<br />
<br />
Envision for just a moment that SoE has half a clue.  Yes, at times that can be a tad hard to do, but take the leap of faith.  It just might be possible that they in fact know what they're doing and will make changes that bump the melee DPS down just enough to allow Knights who are properly geared to succeed while still making it tough for Warriors who are properly geared.   Before saying absolutely they can't do it, how about you wait to see what they do?<br />
<br />
Again, it's not a question of having no faith. What is the current success rate of knights in these trials? 5%? 10%? What will they deem *acceptable* level of success? 40%<br />
<br />
How much toning down will have to happen to increased the success rate by a minimum of 400%? The minute you do this you lower the lvl needed for warriors. It's common sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
What should happen is this. Two characters are lfg, one a Knight, the other a Warrior. A group should say, hmm well if we take the Knight we'll probably be fine for tanking but he'll also bring along some other stuff that could be handy.

Regardless of which they choose though, the situation should be realistically doable by both.<br />
<br />
Close call in picking means relatively close level of success. That's not doable without trivializing the encounters for warriors. Something else you need to remember is that even though lower tier warriors COULD have tanked better vs named mobs in EP they didn't have ACCESS to the zone so the disparity wasn't an issue. This is progression content that is SOLELY locked by trials. This means your guild has little to do with it for a good portion of the progression. You don't need the week/month/etc of your guild camping/farming/waiting to progress. <br />
<br />
This is the fundamental part that proved to me that BB was an egomaniac in regards to the warrior class and has a built in hatred for knights. Because he really wouldn't give a shit if a warrior in VT gear became capable of tanking trials and getting loot of time level by bypassing the LONGEST progressional phases of pop. But he DOES care if a knight in full PoTime gear could have all of a sudden been an option to 1 group rumblecrush. It's pathetic to the extreme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I believe the solution mentioned before by SOE staff was that the trials would be dependent on whether you have a knight or a warrior. This would mean that IF you had a warrior, it'd be the same difficulty as now. IF you had a knight, the mobs would be easier in some way (less DPS, less max hit or something).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone can see what they are doing is giving knight Def against named mobs in GoD. How gimp is that? <br />
<br />
The SoE Dev team is being so shortsighted about what is going on in GoD that they are only putting a band-aid on the issue. Everyone know that Rangers/monks/beastlords can tank anything a Knight can due to itemization. The real issue that should be addressed is the tanking difference between War--&gt;Knights and then Knights --&gt; &quot;Light tanks&quot;</div></div><hr />

Are you sure that's what they're doing?  Per the latest Brenlo post, it just sounded to me like they're shifting the level of difficulty down a bit for EVERYONE, warriors included, to a point where a knight with appropriate gear can survive.  Not the kiddie-versions anymore specific to knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you have an expandsion where the content is being consumed at an alarming rate with the right classes.

<br />
There solution: dumb it down!<br />
<br />
It sounds like defensive to all to me.  Color it anyway you want its the kiddie ride for all.  Price of admition is include a Paladin.  Take a Ranger, a Monk and a Paladin in to what was a difficult trial for a Warrior and its now a pushover.<br />
<br />
This is systemic of SOE's design thinking.  The reason why these trials are hard for Paladins to get thorugh is because of the event design features a monster with a silly amount of DPS.  Paladins and SKs have no way to negate thousands of points of damage.  There solution to this disparity?  Make the monsters do less damage in general.  Freaking brilliant don't you say?  Not only have they not addressed the issue they make those who have the disciplines even more effective.</div></div><hr />

I haven't read where Brenlo has said there will be two different versions. On the contrary, he said:<br />
So now a plan is in place to adjust the content so it will still be tough for warriors, while also being achievable for the knight classes.<br />
That sounds like one version to me.<br />

They say it's going to be hard people!  Hard for everyone!  Hard for Knights!  Hard for Warriors!  It's not going to be suddenly a walk in the park for Warriors while being doable for Knights.  You're assuming that if Knights can do it then using defensive will make it a breeze for Warriors, but you're not taking into account that SoE can do all sorts of things to make it difficult even with defensive.<br />
<br />
Defensive:<br />
<br />
1.  Lasts 3 minutes and then can't be used for 7 more minutes<br />
<br />
2.  Only reduces the DI of the mob's melee damage.<br />
<br />
3.  Only impacts melee damage.<br />
<br />
So, the have all sorts of freaking room to lower the mob's melee DI DPS while keeping the melee damage high enough that Knights will struggle and Warriors using defensive will struggle.  They can do all sorts of things to make you burn up defensive on one encounter and then make you fight another encounter right afterwards.  They can generate damage in ways that completely bypass defensive altogether.<br />
<br />
Stop assuming it will be &quot;easier&quot; for Warriors just because it will be &quot;doable&quot; by Knights, that's not necessarily true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something *you* need to remember Glatius is that they can't start putting in 15 gazillion gizmos in there because the group is limited to 6 ppl. On raids and such sure you can have 15 different mobs doing different things, you have the ppl to deal with it. That's not the case in a 1 group setting. <br />
<br />

<br />
In other words make these like minis in PoFire?<br />
<br />
Let's be honest. How much can you lower the dmg output of the mobs NOT to make them trivial to warriors in FULL PoTime gear. Warrior gained as much if not more hp/ac avoidance/shielding than knights gearing up in PoTime. That means that mobs had to be raised proportionally to this in power. NOT based on knights but based on WARRIORS. And WARRIORS have defensive DISCS whereas knights do not. This is where the prevailing problem comes from. You don't want to trivialize the content because it's PROGRESSIONAL content, yet you're dumbing it down because you can't come up with a fucking solution to make the 2nd best tanks in the game tank better than everyone else (warriors excluded). <br />
<br />
<br />
Stop assuming it will be &quot;easier&quot; for Warriors just because it will be &quot;doable&quot; by Knights, that's not necessarily true.<br />

No Glatius. I'm a realist. How fucking hard is it to understand.<br />
<br />
warrior 45% defensive capable of tanking mob_x BECAUSE of defensive 90% of the time<br />
<br />
knight with 0% defensive capable of tanking mob_x BECAUSE OF A LACK of defensive only 5% of the time<br />

Changing the content so a knight with 0% defensive is capable of tanking mob_x 50% (just a #) of the time GUARANTEES BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF DOUBT, that it will make it <br />

<br />
Okay Mr. Rocket Scientist, let me spell it out for you using small words.<br />
<br />
Warriors have had defensive available for almost 4 years now.  Four years and 5 expansions.  One group content has managed to be challenging anyway.  Challenging for Knights.  Challenging for Warriors.  There is no reason that can't continue if they design the content correctly.  Saying it's impossible because Warriors have defensive and Knights don't flies in the face of the reality of 4 expansions.  They've managed to maintain challenging content for four years, one more expansion more or less shouldn't be that much more difficult.<br />
<br />
And you're making the same assumption that you always make, that defensive is always available.  It isn't.  If you set up a single high DI hard hitting mob within a 10 minute period that can be taken on all by itself and dies in less than 3 minutes, then yes Warriors are going to have the hands down advantage.  So you don't design the trials to work like that.  How hard is that to figure out?  This isn't rocket science after all.</div></div><hr />

They've managed to maintain challenging content for four years, one more expansion more or less shouldn't be that much more difficult.<br />
<br />
Glatius, until PoP with the PoJ trials there's never been a forced 1 group content encounter. That is why the issue has never occured. When PoP first came out, could knights tank PoJ? Yes. PoJ was a forced 6 man content where the game wasn't designed for defensive.<br />
<br />
It's not that I think SoE is completely incapable of doing things. It's that the trials are two sided. Progression and loot/xp.<br />
<br />
Because they are for progression they must be difficult. Thus entered their design based on warriors requiring defensive. This of course proved to be a major game flaw that they now need to address. The fact that the trials also yield loot and xp meant they groups are repeatedly doing them over and over again. Eliminate the need for x amount of classes and you have a lack of balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you're making the same assumption that you always make, that defensive is always available.  It isn't.  If you set up a single high DI hard hitting mob within a 10 minute period that can be taken on all by itself and dies in less than 3 minutes, then yes Warriors are going to have the hands down advantage.  So you don't design the trials to work like that.  How hard is that to figure out?  This isn't rocket science after all.<br />
<br />
For the content to be somewhat reliably possible for a knight means that a warrior must now be able to tank them without defensive. If a warrior in PoTime gear can tank them without denfensive, don't you think a warrior in lesser gear will be able to tank them with defensive?</div></div><hr />

You never did answer the question which in the end is the same I asked of him. How can an encounter that used to require a warrior to use defensive be tuned down to where a warrior doesn't need defensive anymore, yet not make it possible for a warrior of lesser lvl to do it with defensive.<br />

<br />
I've answered that question numerous times in numerous ways, but you keep refusing to listen.  Go back and read what I've already said.  Just because right now the trials have a boss mob at either end which require defensive to survive doesn't mean it has to stay that way.  SoE is the design team, they can do whatever they want.  If they say it's going to be challenging for both Warriors and Knights, take them at their word until they prove otherwise.  I mean come on, they are saying they're going to do it.  Arguing it's impossible when they've said it will be done is kind of ignorant.  And I don't have to be a fortune teller and predict for you how they will do it to know it can be done.</div></div><hr />

You are behind the times.  The newest comment is that they will lower the difficulty of the trials.  They will not issue DIFFERENT trials based on group members.  So if you have a warrior, you get the SAME trial with the SAME mobs as if you try with only a Paladin.  These mobs WILL hit for less (we can only assume) or will have more Stunnable mobs.  The method of allowing Paladins was not disclosed, only the fact that Paladins/Sk would be able to tank these trials.  The primary issue they are now trying to fix is the requirement for two healers.  They evidently never intended to have two healers a requirement.  Now does this mean you would be able to do the trial with 1 Cleric (via war or pal/sk), yes.  With two healers (dru/shm, dru/dru, shm/shm/pal) maybe?</div></div><hr />

The *MINUTE* you lower the difficulty of the content to make it knight *TANKABLE* is the minute you open it up to lower tier warriors. It's basic math.  <br />
<br />

Let's be honest. How much can you lower the dmg output of the mobs NOT to make them trivial to warriors in FULL PoTime gear.

<br />
<br />
You obviously have no clue how the damage system works, no clue how defensive works and no clue about game mechanics in general. Its pretty fucking easy to grasp, defensive cuts the DAMAGE INTERVAL of the mob by 45%. It doesnt touch the DAMAGE BASE which is added to every hit sustained. Nothing touches DB except shielding. By dropping the gap between max and min damage, you reduce the effectiveness of defensive. By raising the minimum hit you raise the effectiveness of shieling (you know GEAR based mitigation thats availible to all 3 classes). The third part of the equation is to up the mobs accuracy so that evasive isnt very viable (see Hexxt Sightsilverer where evasive does basically nothing). Once you have balanced those 3, you adjust hit speed and attack score so that the monster does around the same dps as before (well less because you want knights tanking and defensive is alot less effective). This keeps warrior survivability the same and means knights success rate raises. This also has the advantage of minimizing damage spikes as the dps is more evenly distributed due to the higher accuracy and lower highpoint.<br />
<br />
Again, you're not stupid, and this is not fucking rocket science. <br />
<br />
Apparently it might aswell be for you, the whole thing has gone over your head. If you use your brain and dont just parrot the same bullshit in every single uninformed post you make, you would realize that there is solutions apart from your &quot;knight defensive&quot; crusade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is funny. You will that warriors get nerfed ?<br />
<br />
If they keep the dps the same the effect on warriors will be that they take more damage because defensiv take away less damage. If they keep the same dps warriors get fucked when they do this. They can neutralize the effect of defensiv but this mean directly a nerf to warriors because you will take more damage then on this trials in futur (Same dps + defensiv neutralized = warrior take more damage). Even when they lower the dps warriros will make a bad deal with this and in futur content. You just openend the door for monk/ranger tanking. If a knight can tank a monk/ranger can tank to if you dont touch the classes. So the deal that you keep your defensiv is that they make a 2. LDoN where the difference between tankclasses and nontankclasses not really exist. I am sure you will not like it when they make this because you gone from have to fight against 2 other classes for your spot to fight against 4 other classes for the spot and ranger/monk support the groupe with something very usefull like we see in LDoN.   <br />

I very much intended to let Brenlo's posts and the Class Descriptions speak for themselves. But, you have managed to reach me. I'm going to answer you 1 time.<br />
<br />
Since Kunark, and in your case probably since level 1, you have NEVER been able to tank anything that was not trivial as well as I except a few selected mobs. IMO these few mobs include Grieg Venificus, and CT/Inny from PoTime and not a heck of a lot else.<br />
<br />
Being the Primary Tank is NOT your role and never has been your role. Did you just start playing the game yesterday that you don't know this?<br />
<br />
Read Brenlo's posts and the Class descriptions again please. Your class is entitled to tank. It's even entitled to tank challanging content. It is NOT entitled to Defensive or to see Defensive removed from the game. It is not entitled to see Warriors only MT using Defensive vs. a dozen mobs on raid day and work on tradeskills at all other times.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, I've seen a couple of Knights state they were leaving the game. Thus far it has NOT been Top High Level Knights. It's been wannabe Warriors. You don't like your class description? You don't like tanking and casting clerical spells? Then roll another freaking character. If there's no class that is appealing to you then by all means leave the game. Try FFXI and a Paladin with a Warrior sub-job. If you do, don't whine that a Warrior with a Monk sub-job can tank nearly as well as you and do more damage.<br />
<br />
SoE is addressing the tanking issues. That's not good enough for you though. Defensiv is ruining teh balanc!! IF you had even a little insight, you'd see that Brenlo also said they would look into other issues. Do you think that just perhaps the size of your heals vs. how hard GoD mobs hit might be an issue Paladins could raise? How about stuns being ineffective vs. normal adds including yellow ones? How about the gap between Knights and non-tanks? Ohhhh Noz, Defensiv is teh ebil!!<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the opprotunity to let you know my feelings about you and your fellow wannabe Warriors with Spellbooks.<br />

Zero DI mobs will be tankable by anyone that cant be One Dounded.<br />
Zero DI mobs dont have damage spikes. (Even if they can Double Quad)<br />
Zero DI mobs will have the same DPS on a war/pal/sk as on a mnk/rng/bst.<br />
Zero DI mobs will still make us overpowered (hail evasive).<br />

I was able to tank the frogok king. I was able to tank the hand in kunark. I was able to tank the nameds in velious. I was able to tank the named in PoP. I was able to tank the named in LDoN. All this nameds was single targets and i had no problem to tank them in a groupe. I am in GoD and i can not tank nameds. I play since 5 years and never was this game as broken as to this moment in the highendgame. I have one question for you. You seriously think that a knight will ever tank the raidnameds we have now. You think we will be able to tank mobs which hit for 5000 with the tools knights have now. I dont think it and everyone which play this game know that knights will never tank this nameds. So you have the maintank role and knights will never get this. That are raidmobs this days and not 2000hitters in ikkniz and trashmobs which hit for 2000 in kodaz etc. Raidmobs hit for 5000+ and this mobs are RAIDMOBS. We speak about trash and adds which eat us and warriors are able to offtank them a lot easier because defensiv. Even ranger are better tanks for this with ripost disciplines. Everyone here which speak about raidmobs and come up with bullshit ikkniz mobs is an idiot. It is like you say the hand in karnors castle was a raidmob in kunark. Well you dont have to be smart to find out taht defensiv which will get stronger and stronger as stronger mobs will get will create a larger and larger gap between the tankclasses. Not a single warrior was able to explain to this moment how they will balance the effect of defnesiv in futur. Not a single warrior was able to explain how they will make that knights get the same ugprade without doing anything as warriors get when a mob hit for 500 more. If you think that if a mob hit for 500 more so we say in next zone trash hit for 2500. How you will balance it that knights get the same upgrade without doing anything which the warrior just got because defensiv now take away again more hps. Ah you dont know why. So isnt it right that the it create a gap and now the knight need to get an gear upgrade to get the same upgrage. But when we can get a gear upgrade warriors will get it to because yuo will allways have more hps. So as harder mobs hit as stronger the warrior get and as bigger the gap get between knights and paladins. Btw. i was able to tank terris thule on our first time kill when i tanked here from 30% to 3% hps. This days i will not be able to survive 5 secs. against a real raidnamed. <br />

Oh and From Your post Arbosch I can only understand you want the mobs that do INSANE damage say 4-5K a hit need a warrior to tank it.  Personally I thought a viable solution would be to make a knight have use of there shield give them a disc that allows them to block all incoming hits with there shield if they where facing the mob for 15-20 seconds, But hey guess what if you wanted to use a 2 hander it wouldn't work, But then there has to be a tradeoff to tanking doesnt there<br />

as much as even i can't stand aborsch, he did make 1 point, that in every single place in the game, we've been able to tank 1 group named. im pretty sure even you warriors are starting to get that, but what you guys seem to miss is, once you get past the trials, there is an entire expansion(when it opens up) where we are unable to perform our raid role.<br />
<br />
it would be like telling rogues they can't backstab, telling warriors you have to be DPS and can't tank....telling wizards all they can cast is spellshield, telling beasts they can only heal....get it yet?<br />
<br />
<br />
unless they retune the entire expansion, this won't change a single thing.<br />
<br />
i would like for you guys to point out where in the game defensive hasn't made it easier for a warrior to tank than a knight. i don't mean this as a flame, i am honestly sincerely curious. the only ones i can think of are inny and CT, and that was only because of fearless, if they didn't fear, they would still be tanked by warriors because, while knight certainly CAN tank both of those mobs, a defensive warrior would be an infinitly superior tank, given the mobs didn't fear.<br />
<br />
every hybrid has some sort of &quot;oh shit&quot; ability. when avoidance discs were added, thats what they were. ranger pulled too much agro, he could WS to save his life. if a bard looked to ghey and pulled agro, or charm breaks..whatever...they could hit deftdance to save thier life.<br />
<br />
they gave SK's harmshield for this very purpose, because paladins had DA as our &quot;oh shit&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
now you have those same classes using thier &quot;oh shit&quot; ability to tank and succeed in GoD....honestly, i don't see why we can't have a DA/HS we can attack and cast through. increase the duration a little bit if needed, and remove the hatelist drop. wouldnt' affect clerics in the least, because soon as DA wears off, your back on the same place in the hate list.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo said:<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. The fact that warriors can tank the harder content in Gates, while the knight classes cannot, does not mean Pallys and SKs are broken, rather that warriors are better tanks and that the content is too challenging.<br />
You just don't get it. Paladins are not Warriors.<br />
<br />
And you are dead wrong about the scaling ability of Defensive. Here's an easy exerciese for you:<br />
<br />
DB 100, DI 1500, mob hit rate=1 hit/10 seconds<br />
The first hit for max and any player in the game dies (leaving out the possible effect of Runes and/or Vie).<br />
<br />
Defensive reduces the DI portion of the damage produced by a mob. The higher the DI the more damage a Warrior doesn't take. But as DI increases so does the damage that the Warrior takes even under Defensive.<br />
<br />
Yes Arbosch, there is a gap between Warriors and Knights. Frankly, I'm glad to see it be used in game and not just on paper. It's the &quot;You aren't Warriors&quot; Gap or as I shall call it henceforth the Arbosch Gap in honor of it's discoverer.<br />
<br />
But Arbosch Knights should not be measured against Warriors and never should have been. They should be measured against the environment in their role.<br />
<br />
We are all Tanks. But one of us is a very heavy tank for three minutes and another calls down the blessing of his god upon nearby troops in addition to being a very capable tank against all but a handful of mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
SoE is even modifying the game to reduce the number of mobs in that handful that Knights can not tank. I'd think you'd be well satisfied.<br />
<br />
But no, all you can focus on is Defensive and the fact that Knights are not Warriors. You are correct Arbosch, Knights are not Warriors.<br />
<br />
Ariakkas,<br />
Bullwash. Elsewhere there is a list of former raid mobs that may now be one groupable. Want to embarass youself and go hunting? Only because SoE didn't push the envelop have Knights been able to tank like Warriors.<br />
<br />
In forced one group content *choke* you unfortunately are entitled to tank like Warriors. The content is being changed to reflect this fact. I sincerely hope they sprinkle a few one groupable HARD mobs in the open parts of the expansion so Warriors can use their abilities outside raids. Oh, Knights will be able to tank those since they are in open zones - you can bring two groups instead of one.<br />

Reducing DI and raising DB is probably the worst possible content fix that I can imagine happenning.   Here's the results of doing this:<br />
<br />
You turn beastlords into the tank of choice, followed very closely by monks.   The block skill in conjunction with a significantly larger amount of + avoidance available to those two classes negates any benefit derived from + shielding.<br />
<br />
Beastlords with their aggro generation + block + avoidance immediately move into the #1 tank position.   <br />
<br />
You obliterate the value of AC as a meaningful stat, which is truly unfortunate, since the fact that AC now matters is one of the best parts of GoD.<br />
<br />
You make healing FAR too predictable and boring<br />
<br />
Knights don't get helped any since they'd now be overtaken by BL's and monks, and because mitigation and AC values are decreased, the value of the hitpoint pool is raised again, heavily favoring warriors.</div></div><hr />

When a mob hit you 50% of the time for min damage, it does not really matter wheter you are in defensive or not, and it will also increase the importance of gear. Tuning them for 1000 dps on non defensive tank with 2200 AC should be ok. 1900 AC tank should be obliterated in those trials, defensive or not. 1300 dps on non defensive tank with 1900 AC should be enough to prevent even a defensive war to do it, unless he has some damn nice geared clerics to heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wondering, is there some way that the game or mobs could be coded, to &quot;notice&quot; AC?  Or, to ask it another way, could AC be coded to be more effective?  For example, a mob hitting against 1800 AC hits for DI * 16-20 most of the time, where as the same mob hitting against an AC of say 2200 (which is plate-class area only I think ??) would be hitting for DI * 6-12, for example.  However, this would then screw up the whole &quot;make DI unimportant by making DB the main part of each hit&quot; fix.  Could THAT possibly be worked around by having the higher AC mitigate a decent number of the hits into misses or zero hits, such as what happens when a low green mob tries to hit you?  In essence, higher AC having the end result of a noticeable amount of avoidance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a big difference between lowering the DI value and eliminating it.  The DI value can be reduced without it going away completely so that there is still value retained in using defensive, just not as much.  After all, are Beastlords the best tank for the trash on the way to the boss mobs?  If not, why not?  And why can't that damage model be used as a template on the boss mobs except that you increase the DPS at step or two?  Or throw in other factors to make it interesting.<br />
<br />
The game worked before GoD, why is it that now that GoD is out there is no acceptable solution except defensive to making Knights a viable tank in the trials?  It's too boring, or it will make BLs the better tank, or what have you.  Some compromises are going to have to be made.  If it becomes a bit more boring as a result, thems the breaks.  I guess folks will just have to live with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mobs with high DI is the reason why you NEED a plate tank and not some enchanter with 9khp to tank. If there is no DI there is nothing to mitigate. <br />
<br />
Lowering DI would do the exact opposite of what you are asking, and then indeed rangers, monk, BL will tank just as well as a knight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High DI is also why Knights are having problems with the trials.  And why they're screaming they need defensive.  If you just lower the DB, then you do nothing about the effectiveness of defensive and you make it far easier for a lower geared Warrior to tank the mob, since his defensive would have a far higher effectiveness.  If you lower the DI, then AC becomes somewhat less effective, yes, but you've done away with much of the huge damage spikes that are the Knight killers.<br />
<br />
Trade offs.  Lower does not mean eliminate.  There is a lot of room left for manuvering.</div></div><hr />

Now that pretty much everyone has over 10khp, hps are mostly meaningless. Mobs need to spike on non plate wearers. What you are suggesting is to REDUCE the effect of AC on tanking. The point is that knight have much higher mitigation AC than everyone else (even slightly better than War usually due to shield &amp; self only buffs).<br />
 <br />
Balance in GoD can be achieved by slight tuning of ATK, and maybe change a bit mitigation table for plate wearer. <br />
<br />
It is not impossible at all for knight to tank in GoD at the moment, they can tank ikkinz 1 group trial with 2 clerics, they can tank Uqua trash (and are arguably better than war for trap mobs). I'm pretty sure that if all GoD mobs get there atk reduced by 100-200 knight would tank them easily, and they would still eat any 1800 AC 'I can tank' ranger.</div></div><hr />

Since Kunark, and in your case probably since level 1, you have NEVER been able to tank anything that was not trivial as well as I except a few selected mobs. IMO these few mobs include Grieg Venificus, and CT/Inny from PoTime and not a heck of a lot else.<br />
***<br />
<br />
I was able to tank the frogok king. I was able to tank the hand in kunark. I was able to tank the nameds in velious. I was able to tank the named in PoP. I was able to tank the named in LDoN. All this nameds was single targets and i had no problem to tank them in a groupe. I am in GoD and i can not tank nameds. I play since 5 years and never was this game as broken as to this moment in the highendgame. I have one question for you. You seriously think that a knight will ever tank the raidnameds we have now. You think we will be able to tank mobs which hit for 5000 with the tools knights have now. I dont think it and everyone which play this game know that knights will never tank this nameds. So you have the maintank role and knights will never get this. That are raidmobs this days and not 2000hitters in ikkniz and trashmobs which hit for 2000 in kodaz etc. Raidmobs hit for 5000+ and this mobs are RAIDMOBS. We speak about trash and adds which eat us and warriors are able to offtank them a lot easier because defensiv. Even ranger are better tanks for this with ripost disciplines. Everyone here which speak about raidmobs and come up with bullshit ikkniz mobs is an idiot. It is like you say the hand in karnors castle was a raidmob in kunark. Well you dont have to be smart to find out taht defensiv which will get stronger and stronger as stronger mobs will get will create a larger and larger gap between the tankclasses. Not a single warrior was able to explain to this moment how they will balance the effect of defnesiv in futur. Not a single warrior was able to explain how they will make that knights get the same ugprade without doing anything as warriors get when a mob hit for 500 more. If you think that if a mob hit for 500 more so we say in next zone trash hit for 2500. How you will balance it that knights get the same upgrade without doing anything which the warrior just got because defensiv now take away again more hps. Ah you dont know why. So isnt it right that the it create a gap and now the knight need to get an gear upgrade to get the same upgrage. But when we can get a gear upgrade warriors will get it to because yuo will allways have more hps. So as harder mobs hit as stronger the warrior get and as bigger the gap get between knights and paladins. Btw. i was able to tank terris thule on our first time kill when i tanked here from 30% to 3% hps. This days i will not be able to survive 5 secs. against a real raidnamed. <br />

Number one, even if there were such mythical mobs, NO ONE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM. Don't on the one hand act like defensive is no big deal and then on the other hand fall all over yourself to make sure no one else gets it. Defensive IS powerful and you know it. The mobs in question are HIGH DI, so your argument is irrellevant (BTW, you obviously don't understand how Vie works). Just admit it. Defensive is damn nice and you want to make sure knights never get it, because you like being on top. Don't try to pull this &quot;but it doesn't really scale&quot; garbage, it just makes you look either dumb or dishonest, or probably both.<br />

One thing I've learned over the last 2 years while duking it out on class balance boards is that there's a VERY select few, and I'd include you in the number who actually seek this mythical thing called &quot;class balance&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Sadly, I've been forced to see that what I used to accuse the knights of, siezing and holding fast on their little feifdom of power, my own class is just as capable of.   The difference being that I would've expected warriors to be a little more sensitive to it since it is still burned into our brains and the memory is still painful.<br />

<br />
Yes, defensive scales in that the harder hitting the mobs are overall, the more damage that defensive mitigates. In other words, the glass is half full.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the harder hitting the mob is, the more damage the warrior is going to take, defensive or not. In other words, the glass is half empty.<br />

All defensive does is to delay the point in the encounters where warriors simply can no longer take the beating and survive. Those without defensive reach that point quicker, but it STILL happens for warriors.</div></div><hr />

I mean, even when Paladins weren't the ideal tank, they still had value in group heals, one shot stunts like LoH, and such. All Warriors offer raids is subpar DPS if you make their mitigation differential meaningless.<br />
<br />
 (And for those of you who say that mitigation differential is never meaningless, I'd like you to revisit PoP before Melee Revamp v1.)<br />
<br />
 I've stated my objections quite clearly - give Knights defensive, and at some point it is a guarantee that spell/foci upgrades will create a synergy with defensive to make Knights as attractive as or more attractive than Warriors. Then Warriors will be the ones making noises about being 'abandoned' by SOE and quitting in droves from topend guilds. Some posters may not be concerned about it, but as you can tell from the responses to the idea of Knights getting Defensive from the Warriors who posted about it, it is an area of GREAT concern to a large body of Warriors. (I would almost say vast majority would there not then be nitpicking about terminology to smoke up the argument)<br />
<br />
 AO set out to prove that Vie (a 10% defensive-lite spell) was too powerful, and in so doing, got Knights to tank every raid mob in PoP. Now we're told that to continue equality into GoD (Because that is the ONLY place all 3 tanks are not equally desireable in groups and raids), we have to give Knights a version of it 250% better. Sorry, I don't agree, and I sincerely doubt more than a small fraction of Warriors do, either.</div></div><hr />

Give Warirors LoH and HT and balance might not be disturbed. While Knights may think that would be a great deal in exchange for a Wariror defining ability, it's a &quot;deal&quot; that will not be made.<br />
<br />
In reading PoN postings you will see players explaining Ikkinz flags and Glyphed Prayer Rings by saying 'Oh, I was dragged through - I was dead weight.&quot; So sorry, I've done some Ikkinz trials. They are difficult enough that you can not have a player sit at the zone in, die, get dragged to the dead end mob, get ressed back in so they can loot. Translation, they were performing their secondary role or in fact they did MT it.<br />
<br />
I do raid adds without using Defensive. So can a Knight.<br />
<br />
SoE CAN seperate the BS from actual difficulties in appropriate class roles. Can't tank like a Warrior? So sorry, as Brenlo pointed out (and not for the first time by a Verant/SoE spokesman):<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. <br />
Adjustments are being made. But Warriors will still tank better than Knights (as they always have). THAT'S why some Knights are still complaining - they thought GoD content problems were their big chance.<br />
<br />
Paladins in particular have a whole lot of things they do very much better than a Warrior. If they wanted a class focused on tanking and to be the best at it, they picked the wrong one.<br />

Then sir, if the content is being adjusted so Knights can tank the trials and addtank, why are they STILL complaining about Defensive, a Warrior ability that will not be shared and Warrior tanking superiority?<br />
<br />
Want to pull in some choice quotes from PoN, EQLive, and even here since Brenlo's announcement? SoE having to lock threads due to responces by these level headed Paladins who only want to do their job speaks volumes.<br />
<br />
The BS meter is pegged at an extreme - by Knights that claim one thing, but when SoE promices to deliver it, they freak out when they are told Warriors will always tank better than Pallys and SK's.<br />
<br />
Who's BSing who?<br />
<br />
BTW, I enjoyed your post on EQLive where you pointed out that Warirors have been superior offtanks for a very long time. I did disaggree somewhat with your conclusions. Despite the fact that Warriors are superior offtanks, the reason to continue having Knights in your guild and not just add more Warriors is because Knights can offtank normal adds AND do things other than base level DPS should they not be assigned these duties.<br />
<br />
Wave heals, GRC, spot healing, HTing, all do count for something, especially in smaller 54 person raids where beyond the MT lists, you still need add tanks.<br />

One thing I've learned over the last 2 years while duking it out on class balance boards is that there's a VERY select few, and I'd include you in the number who actually seek this mythical thing called &quot;class balance&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Sadly, I've been forced to see that what I used to accuse the knights of, siezing and holding fast on their little feifdom of power, my own class is just as capable of.   The difference being that I would've expected warriors to be a little more sensitive to it since it is still burned into our brains and the memory is still painful.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the experience didn't result in increased empathy with others going through it, but instead bitterness and resentment, and a desire to protect that which they have, whether justified or not.<br />
<br />
frod, we have a right to, we are the pure class, i can understand it if we multitasked, yes we are fighting tooth and nail to keep out advantage in FUCKING GoD content, excuse my rage in this, but honestly, to get were we are today we had to have a DAMNED strike, not a petition, not a whine session on the boards, we lined up, showed we didnt care if we got banned and put out message out about our plight, i am sorry if i dont want that to go to nothing so fast, since i personally spent many hours telling dumbshits to get of the portal steps and line up.<br />
<br />
class balance doesnt mean everyone is as good as everyone else, it means there is a equilbrum of compnent classes, knights are not left out of much aside from a few damn trials, and now they are going ape shit, at least they can get AA XP like we could NOT half the time prior to the changes(unless it was like cheers in BoT and everyone knew you)<br />
<br />
not giving up defensive, not giving up incite, not giving up my bonus mitigation, i gave up berserk and crits and a crap load of other things, ive had ENOUGH with loosing ground, gaining it, and then going back to steps.<br />
<br />
the real problem is to many classes and small group size, they should have had the forsight to stop adding classes sooner.</div></div><hr />

In addition it doesnt address single group content outside  instanced zones, Finally, Many knights dont want the content to be gimped down, and it says right in their that they think its *too challenging.* The content isnt too challenging, the problem was class compsoisiton to win, and the price of failure. <br />
<br />
We also see in raids that yes we can offtank, but really we're just not as good at it anymore, mobs hit hard enough that while its definatly possible to do it as a knight, its just flat out a lot more dangerous, WS/Furious/AE taunt generally make it a lot safer, we're beginging to see our niches in raid disapear. With the short duration of fights, offensive/defensive (Ie nimble ws etc) are much much more powerful then previously, because of the burst nature of the fights. <br />

It may be really easy to pass off our concerns as &quot;stfu hybrid your supposed to be not as good&quot; but well as I said its easy to pass off concerns like that, walk a mile in our shoes, and if you dont agree, well at least we're a mile away and you have our shoes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My observation is that by the time you finish an expansion you are geared well enough that you can handle most things in that expansion fairly well (and I mean all tanks here).  The next expansion ups the ante a bit and now you seem to lose some survivability ground because the mobs are just a bit tougher.  And so it goes, from expansion to expansion.  You're tough at the end of expansion A, but kind of weak at the beginning of expansion B.  The thing is, if the next expansion is properly tuned, you're weaker but not slaughtered outright.<br />
<br />
The first several zones into Deeper GoD should be survivable for all three plate tanks, if in elemental/PoTime gear, without constant reliance on defensive.  The fact that defensive is called upon so much proves that they goofed up on the tuning.  I would have expected the intial mobs past the trials to hit like elemental/PoTime mobs.  I would have expected the trials to be survivable for an elemental geared Warrior or a PoTime geared Knight without having to take extreme measures.  A good tough fight, sure.  A slaughter where the Knight is most times turned into pudding, no.<br />
<br />
If defensive is the only thing allowing Warriors to survive one group trials, then the trials are not properly tuned.  Fixing them won't be postponing anything.  If they made the one group trials require you have Paladin group heals or Lay of Hands to succeed, or Shadow Knight fear or harm touch to succeed, then the trials would be incorrectly tuned and would need to be fixed, right?  Same deal with defensive.  It's a Warrior only ability.  Paladins and Shadow Knights don't get it just like Warriors don't get group heals, LoH, fear, or HT.  Ergo the content MUST be mistuned. <br />
<br />
Let me give you an example of what I mean.  Here is one people may remember.  In the Dreadlands there is a mountain giant fort.  At this fort spawns mountain giants that vary from around levels 34-39.   Except occassionally the mountain gaint patriarche spawns.  And he's level 44-45 or so.  A group of mid to upper 30s taking on the fort would be doing quite well against the normal giants.  But they'd run a very good chance of having their asses handed to them by the MGP.  It seems like that's the case in the trials in GoD.  They have a few ringer mobs that are really too tough for where they are and who you would expect to be going up against them.  Defensive makes it possible for the Warriors to tank them none the less.  But that's more an indication of the power of defensive than that the content is properly tuned.         <br />
<br />
Could the problem come up again done the road?  Sure, if SoE doesn't very carefully watch how they tune things, it will.   And if it does, they'll have to do exactly what they're doing this time.  Fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zero DI mobs will be tankable by anyone that cant be One Dounded.<br />
Zero DI mobs dont have damage spikes. (Even if they can Double Quad)<br />
Zero DI mobs will have the same DPS on a war/pal/sk as on a mnk/rng/bst.<br />
Zero DI mobs will still make us overpowered (hail evasive).<br />
Zero DI mobs with insane hit ratio (Archers) will indeed make evasive useless.<br />
<br />
Zero DI mobs will indeed make shielding important (that i totally agree).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultra 900 : A mob that hits for 900, every single time, and never misses&quot; <br />
<br />
I am sorry, i really dont like that idea. Even if its the logical solution.<br />
<br />
I didnt advocate 0 di, but there is alot of room to reduce it from being 400-2200 or whatever it is now, to something more sensible where defensive is less effective. <br />
<br />
As to damage spikes, that was the PRIMARY thing that Brael was complaining about. As he has been just about the few knights posting about this with some idea about what was actually going on it was something my &quot;suggestion&quot; sought to minimize.<br />
<br />
Evasive is one sticking point I guess, I dont know exactly how it works or the mechanics they have used to neuter it vs Hexxt in trial3. The whole POINT of my post was to describe how we can make the trials stay difficult, but reduce (but not eliminate) the difference between having a knight or warrior tanking. Im sure there is some middle ground for evasive to be less effective but not useless (in between Hexxt accuracy and a trash mob accuracy). <br />
<br />
There is also alot of middle ground between 100di and 0di. Your whole argument relies on absolutes, not allowing for anything between how it is now and mobs which hit for 4x900 every time they swing. Im sure that thinking supports your point of view, but it doesnt help in discussing how to fix the problem. I offered a possible solution, from which you took 1 or 2 points out of context to twist into a critique without offering anything back yourself. Saying that &quot;reducing the DI at all is a bad idea&quot; is counterproductive at best, because that removes all other possible fixes other then improving knight mitigation (through discs or whatever).</div></div><hr />

I honestly feel some of the content is mistuned and fundamentally agree with Glatius. The Sewers and Vxed aren't a problem. <br />
<br />
Vxed is a slaughter 100. I don't think anyone has suggested that it is unfair to Knights. If more HP's and &quot;-1 DI&quot; is a Warrior advantage, then runners, gaters, and mob difficulty could be tuned to make it fairer.<br />
<br />
Tipt however is a problem. An Assassinate mission that &quot;needs&quot; a Warrior and two healers (one of whom must be a Ceric) is not a fair one group challange.<br />
<br />
Warriors being better tanks than Knights is not an accident. It's intended design. It imposes contraints on content design. When SoE does not take into account constraints then we end up with &quot;broken&quot; content.<br />
<br />
I agree, that if SoE made 3 totally equal tank classes, then there would be no design constraints based on tank class. That's not going to happen. Nor should it.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to design within the constraints, this is like coloring within the lines - pretty fundamental stuff. When it doesn't do so in order to make thing fun, interesting, and challanging (something it does a LOT in GoD) it has to insure the result is fair and balanced. If it's not fair and balanced, the solution is to fix the content, not to blur the classes even if that would be advantagous to Knights (or Druids and Shaman).<br />
<br />
Given the number of classes, 6 person trials really is not a good idea in the first place.<br />

Brenlo is quite competent at what he does, at a level that Absor was completely unable or unwilling to step to.    Brenlo has stepped into the Lion's Den where people are literally angry with him as the representative of SoE, and has asked for suggestions, has forwarded them, has interacted with the angry mobs and even gave them some news that he knew full well was going to be rather difficult for them to bear.   <br />

Absor's quote was ganked from the Safehouse, he spent a good 2 years pretty much ignoring us, then made the famous statement which every melee person adopted, yet ganking quotes fromt he Safehouse was the extent of our interaction with Absor.   Absor didn't come here or create a board and tell us any bad news.  I think the situations are completely different.  Brenlo is keeping a VERY high level of communication, and while Knights don't like the message, it's not as though he's pulling an &quot;absor&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't think that warriors can be faulted for going &quot;Gee, at least you have an SoE rep that says that 1. You guys deserve the job  2. We're working on a solution  3. Here's what our solution is.   We had 2 years of silence followed up with &quot;classes are not that out of balance&quot; showing up on a completely unrelated board by a guy who admittedly plays a low level bard.</div></div><hr />

What I'm saying is that human nature is constant, whether paladin or warrior, and for most, self interest trumps all.

<br />
And while I'm glad that Brenlo is actually saying something, he's doing it in a remarkably clumsy way. His only substantive reply on the SOE pally forum (the one quoted at the beginning of this thread) was made in reply to a warrior post, and now he has deleted his posts. Smooth.</div></div><hr />

Warrior aggro problems caused them to be /lfg in LDoN for goodness sake - NOT a content issue. The effectiveness of Warrior taunt was clearly at odds with our Class Description.<br />
<br />
*** Absor's comments were primarily true and probably would have been accepted had they been accompianied by an announced fix. ***<br />
<br />
Brenlo's comments were spot on. He acknowledged a content issue, said it would be fixed, and let Knights know that they were not Warriors and the fix would not be narrowing the Warrior tanking advantages.<br />
<br />
Some Knights have always hoped for &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook superiority). They counted on obviously out of tune GoD content to require &quot;Tank Parity&quot;. Since their hopes are dashed by changing content, of course they revile Brenlo and his insistance that Warriors are intended to tank better than Knights.<br />
<br />
*** Brenlo's comments are primarily true and are not being accepted by some Knights even though they were accompianied by an announced fix. ***<br />

Warriors wanted fairness and were satisfied by getting it. (Me excluded, since I wasn't convinced initially the Phase 1 Melee Update would be fair).<br />
<br />
Some Knights want unfairness and will aggitate until they get it.<br />

There is a difference.<br />

Thanks. Having seen the responces on PoN to reasonable posts like -<br />
Gimmel stated:<br />
Class imbalances exist BECAUSE of content. Sometimes a content fix is just as tenable as a class fix. I think a 25% defensive for knights MIGHT do the trick without a great deal of content changes, it would be the easy fix, but not the only one. There are other ways to make content challenging than to simply make things hit for stupid amounts of damage, which is evidently what SOE is going to try. Let's wait and see how they do.<br />
It pretty easy to conclude there are some extremist Knights.<br />
<br />
At the same time, things ARE settling done. As one thread's title states &quot;Looks as official as it can get.&quot; It is official. SoE has taken positions. Action is being taken based on those positions.<br />
<br />
Like a wise player with 120% of the priestly abilities of a Paladin and 20% of a Paladin's melee capability once said, &quot;Let's wait and see how they do.&quot;<br />
<br />
After this is over, I'm going to be quite amused when Paladins again focus on the unfair healing gap  :) <br />

BB, as I said in the post you quoted, a content based solution may solve the problem. I'm curious to see how it works out. I'm not married to the idea of a mini defensive. I just think it actually opens far fewer cans of worms than content based solotions have the potential to. My main interest has always been to try to cut through the smokescreens both sides put up. The paladins used to do the same thing in PoP, and now the warriors are doing it now. I don't know how this fix will work out. But one thin I do know, which is the reason I jumped into this thread to begin with, defensive does scale across the vast majority of fights, and any warrior that says different is lying or ignorant, or both.<br />
<br />
As to how the rest of this works out we'll see, but the fact that so many warriors want to see themselves as morally superior to the paladins just cracks me up. The responses are entirely predictable, and exactly the same. Clerics say, &quot;We need enhancements!&quot; Paladins say, &quot;sure!&quot; Clerics get hammers, paladins say, &quot;Hey, that steps on our toes! (even though it really doesn't in all but very rare circumstances) You should get spell based enhancements, you are a caster!&quot; Clerics say, &quot;But if we got spell based enhancement, the other caster classes would whine instead of you.&quot; Paladins say, &quot;So? That's their problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now replace cleric with knight, paladin with warrior, and hammer with mini-defensive, and you have the exact same controversy. Every class acts exactly the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gimmel, you're essentially correct.  People will be people.  Paladins and Shadow Knights don't appear to be any worse as a group than any other group of people.  It does seem like there is a more systematic attempt to censor those who disagree with them, but then  that may just be very zealous &quot;moderation&quot; in their minds.<br />
<br />
Knights want their role in the game, Warriors want their role in the game.  Knights want to perform adequately on the group and on the raid level, as do Warriors.  The only real difference I see is that Knights have systematically angled for Warrior abilities for years, not just the ability to do their jobs, but they've specifically called for defensive.   Granted it was a small group of Knights prior to GoD, but they were there none the less and they were very vocal.  Warriors, even at their worst point, just called for something, anything, that let them play on an fairly level playing field.<br />
<br />
Knights are supposed to be receiving a relatively level playing field in GoD via content changes.  And rather than sitting back and seeing if what is done is enough, they are screaming bloody murder.  That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.  <br />
<br />
It seems like because Warriors got some changes, the first real set of changes just for Warriors since Kunark, changes that have allowed them to play and be effective as a class, Knights feel like they deserve something in return.  They have a right, a solid justification, for defensive.  Yeah, they're struggling in GoD, but that isn't the point as much as they deserve to be given the fix they want.  And that just isn't true.  What they deserve is to be allowed reasonable play.  Just like Warriors should be allowed reasonable play.  And if that means no to their demands for a Warrior only ability and another form of fix instead, they really should take that with some small measure of grace.<br />
<br />
Incite wasn't every Warrior's ideal approach to an aggro fix, but it seems like for the most part Warriors have accepted the bone that was thrown to them.  It still means that in the low end and mid level game that Knights own aggro control head and shoulders over Warriors.  But Warriors have accepted that because they have regained a measure of reasonable playability.  Knights should cool their jets, let the changes be made, and see if they also regain a measure of reasonable playability.   You don't always get what you want.  But sometimes you get what you need.</div></div><hr />

Nope, not terribly reasonable, but not terribly surpising. It would be the same as if during PoP, SOE said that their solution is to lower spell aggro by half on all PoP mobs. I think warriors might have been pretty pissed, even though it might have worked. But you say, what about LDoN, the problem continued into LDoN! Then maybe you will start to see why knights are suspicious about a content based solution. It only works for that content.<br />
<br />
I think that really what has happened is that people simply don't trust SOE to be able to really pull off what it is that they say they are going to do. Making the content challenging but doable for all without gimping it for warriors is a tightrope that I don't think many people have the faith that SOE can pull off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Winning Vxed itself is not much harder for Knights then it is for Warriors, with a charmed pet it might even be easier with a Knight, the main problems come from people wanting to farm loot/spells from the named, and unless your considerably past the content level, like I am, you have a very low chance of suceeding with a Paladin tank. (Vxed/Tipt being Elemental Level content imo)<br />
<br />
Some warriors may see it as their &quot;right&quot; to beable to tank 1 group named for loot/progression almost to the exclusion of Knight at current content levels,  I dont agree there, if you disagree there, therse not much to argue about, because we simply disagree to a point that debating it is frutiless.<br />
<br />
Why many Knights (not all)  feel a defensive type abilitie is a good solution is because in each exspantion pack, both tanking abilities, and healing power is signicently higher then it was in the previous. (Healing spells themself arnt much more powerful, I mean Mana pool/focus/aa/etc from the previous exspation) to counteract this, mob DPS must account for *both* of these, and it simply reached a point, that guartended damage mitgation abilities were pratically needed to tank reliably, because combat got down to so few rounds. They might have went a little overboard in GoD, but it still exists, and more then likely will show up again, a content based fix, to a problem that many Knights see as a problem that came the combat system, and drastically inflating geared people, only address's the issues in what they physically change, it will more then likely mess up balance elsewhere (which yes is a similar concern Warriors have about defensive like abilities to Knights) IE making the content too easy overall for Warriors, or enabling light tanks to beable to do it. Are these concerns any less or more valid then warriors? I dont exactly see how you can tell us to have faith in SoE, when many of the people who said that, would have NOT had faith, if the solution was to give Paladins an damage mitigation ability.<br />
<br />
Nor does it address our raid concerns, which is as previously stated, our biggest niche, offtanking, is imo, better done with warriors, due to the damage they put out, the short term duration of offtanking, which make burst abilities much much more powerful, which we lack, and or the impact of death of the offtank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are these concerns any less or more valid then warriors?<br />
<br />
While neither more nor less valid, the concerns still don't justify putting balance in peril.  Did Knights tank acceptably in PoP?  Yes.  Did Knights tank acceptably in LDoN?  Yes.  Do Knights tank acceptably against most GoD trash?  Yes.  So where exactly is the problem?  It's restricted to some named GoD mobs and perhaps the trash mobs in one zone.  This does not smack of a &quot;system&quot; wide problem.   If most of the trash is Knight tankable, but suddenly common named mobs aren't, what does that seem to indicate?<br />
<br />
And if the crux of your arguement is, SoE is incompetent and won't be able to fix the problem by content changes, therefore Knights must be given defensive, on what do you base your faith that whatever defensive they gave you would do the job?  It seems an interesting arguement to say, Knights don't trust SoE enough to believe they'll fix the mobs, but Knights trust SoE enough to accept a free enhancement.  Yeah, I don't trust SoE enough to accept any changes that don't include a Warrior enhancement either!  Every patch, I don't care what they're doing, fixing doors, fixing quests, what have you, slap an enhancement on Warriors everytime because we really don't trust SoE!<br />
<br />
As far as your raid offtanking concerns go, I don't really see your arguement.  Offtanking is a short term duration function.  Is it because Warriors pack so much DPS that the mobs crumble before them?  Or is it because as the power of the raid is focused on each mob individually, they pratically disintergrate?  Who really does the majority of the DPS?  Warriors?  *laugh*  Hardly.  It's the Wizards, Druids, Mages, Rogues, Monks, Beastlords, and so forth of the raid.  Does it really make one iota of difference to the raid as a whole who is offtanking as long as the mobs are locked down and not cutting a swath through the casters?  I'd say no, the raid really doesn't care.  If the Warrior does 20% more damage, it doesn't really make one bit of difference in that case because as soon as the real damage dealers get ahold of it, poof, the mob is gone.</div></div><hr />

Or if its one mob, ability to pop defensive makes it signcetly easier to heal/tank, Have 5 or so warriors on a raid and the timer isnt as much of an issue at all.<br />

I dont trust SoE to get it right because content changes only work in the said content, and not only makes effects the people its supposed to effect, but it effects everyone, class based changes while effects more content, works on future content, and doesnt make it the content is easier for everyone, which is what they are doing.

Well, snap aggro is what made you da man on add tanking in PoP, it was never that you had better mitigation.  That was bound to slip at least a little when Warriors got a reasonable amount of aggro control.  All the same, I have seen people saying that an auto-riposte discipline might be in order for Knights.  I don't see any major problems with that, given that so many other classes already have one.  It might help some with your problem.  And AE taunt is nice and all, but just let one caster sit or anyone do anything that changes the aggro list, and you can quickly lose a mob or mobs attention.  It's powerful, I grant, when used exactly right.  Which isn't always that easy to do.  It sounds good on paper, but in reality it doesn't always work the way you'd like it to.</div></div><hr />

This argument is completely invalid.  Paladins didn't start bitching about their viability until GoD came out, thus even by the standards of your fellow paladins the problem is the content, not the class balance.  You are right on one point, class based changes affect ALL content, often breaking previous content to an absurd extent, which is why anything drastic of this nature should be avoided.  The effect of all the pure melee changes made lately wouldn't hold a candle to the effects a &quot;paladin defensive&quot; would have on all existing content, especially PoP.  As for working on future content, thats just inane, future content is designed around current class balance(at least theoretically), any current changes would be factored into future content, as would a lack of changeds, this statement is just pointless.  Finally, you are passing judgement on content changes that haven't even been succinctly described, much less implemented.</div></div><hr />

I'm really curious. People keep saying this, but I just don't see it. I'm really trying to figure out what effect this would have. Let's say that knights were given a half defensive disc.<br />
In single group content: Outside of GoD, how useful is defensive in this content? In my experience, not very. Would a half defensive with a 40min reuse timer really affect the balance here? I just don't see it as getting used enough to make a big difference in this situation.<br />
MTing raiding content: Which would you rather have, a warrior with 500-1000 more hps and 25% additonal mitigation under disc, as well as the ability to lead off with furious, or the knight that might be able to generate slightly more aggro in the first few seconds of the fight? <br />
I really can't see swtiching to use a knight all of a sudden here, unless there is a major gear disparity. <br />
<br />
I'm really trying to figure out which pre-GoD situations this would actually affect. I haven't really progressed much in PoP, anyone have any examples? If I really thought it would have a cascading effect, I wouldn't think it was a good idea. I can certainly be convinced otherwise, but I just haven't seen anyone really make a case.<br />
<br />
Paladins didn't start bitching about their viability until GoD came out, thus even by the standards of your fellow paladins the problem is the content, not the class balance.<br />
Paladins were saying the EXACT same thing about warrior aggro during PoP. Making a PoP only change would have solved the problem....in PoP, but it still would have been a problem in LDoN and forward. The same applies. <br />
<br />
No one is arguing that warriors shouldn't be the sturdier tank, just that there should be the same kind of distance between knights and non-tanks as there is between warriors and knights. Making a content only change is only postponing the inevitable. And the chances of a wholesale revamp of GoD content going smoothly is.....slim. It might be a wonderful fix, it just seems like a LOT more work than is needed.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see a ranger tanking an ikkinz named. Several paladin did. I have no tried with and I can't see this happen at the moment with PoTime gear. As far as I know the biggest thing a ranger ever tanked was Fro and anyway AO had about every class tank this shit. We see paladin tanking PoTime GoD every clean, CT Innoruk namely. I have yet to hear about a ranger tanking PoTime god.<br />
<br />
Go, get a ranger tank in Kod Taz in your xp group, you'll see if 'non tank' can tank as well as a knight.<br />
<br />
But you are right, the day people will take a ranger or beast lord over a paladin to tank in their group, then we will have a problem.  Warrior complained because in early PoP people would get a knight over a warrior in an xp group. Now unless you are doing really easy content a warrior is better in a group to tank. As far as I know, people still get a knight over a 'non tank' for their group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People keep saying this, but I just don't see it. I'm really trying to figure out what effect this would have. Let's say that knights were given a half defensive disc.<br />
In single group content: Outside of GoD, how useful is defensive in this content? In my experience, not very. Would a half defensive with a 40min reuse timer really affect the balance here? I just don't see it as getting used enough to make a big difference in this situation.<br />
MTing raiding content: Which would you rather have, a warrior with 500-1000 more hps and 25% additonal mitigation under disc, as well as the ability to lead off with furious, or the knight that might be able to generate slightly more aggro in the first few seconds of the fight? <br />
I really can't see swtiching to use a knight all of a sudden here, unless there is a major gear disparity. <br />
<br />
You know what Gimmel, part of it comes down to trust, just like it does with Knights.  Do Warriors trust SoE to give Knights just enough defensive to do the job now, without throwing things into an up roar down the road when they inevitably improve Knights spells?  Do Warriors trust SoE not to keep giving Knights more and more defensive each expansion, once the precident is set, until such time as the difference between the two is negligible?  If SoE starts designing content around the concept that all three plate classes have defensive, they will do just like they did this expansion, and design some encounters a bit too tough.  So again out go the cries for increased Knight mitigation, and having crumbled on the topic once, why not a second time?  So Knights get 30% defensive, or 35%.  And that gives SoE the chance to up the ante even more until there comes a time no one can even breath without having a defensive plate tank standing infront of them.<br />
<br />
And if they do, which I expect they will eventually, make upgrades to Knights spells, what happens to Warriors?  Their trademark ability has been whored out, so they don't stand out in that way.  And they sure as shit aren't getting any spells.  So Knights go up another notch, and Warriors stand still, again.  We've seen it happen, we know it can again.   There is no reason to help it along by bending over for it now.<br />
<br />
I have a lot more trust in SoE correcting content now than in them holding the line on defensive for Knights down the road.  Frodlin will argue that the &quot;slippery slope&quot; isn't a valid arguement.  Human nature tells me it is.  People will always grab at the quick and easy solution every time.  The path of least resistance.  If things don't work quite right next expansion and Knights have defensive this expansion, the no brainer solution will be increase Knight defensive just a tad more.  And arguing against it will be that much harder.<br />
<br />
Warriors as a class need and deserve some class distinctiveness.  And they need and deserve a solid raid role.  If it comes down to sharing MT raid tanking all the time and a Knight will do just as well as a Warrior, then Warriors cease to have much in the way of raid desirability.  And in the end, Knights don't have to tank &quot;the same&quot; as a Warrior.  All they have to do is tank well enough to survive just about as often.   <br />
<br />
Paladins were saying the EXACT same thing about warrior aggro during PoP. Making a PoP only change would have solved the problem....in PoP, but it still would have been a problem in LDoN and forward. The same applies. <br />
<br />
Wrong.  Warrior aggro was always a problem.  Smart players worked around it, prior to PoP, dumb players died a lot.  In PoP the smart players realized that working around it had become more of a burden than it was worth, and stopped.  Because even if they worked around it, they could still very easily end up with an avoidable death or two due to a bad run on the Warrior's random number generator.   This was a problem across the board, in every zone in PoP.  In every zone in the game actually, except PoP was were it became unacceptable.  SoE had attempted to fix it numerous times, except their fix always seemed to require a drop off a boss mob that only dropped it once a quarter, if the moon was full, and if your guild could kill that boss mob and 15 more just like it.  Yet the problem was for every Warrior in the game, not just the uber Warriors.  So their fix kept falling short, again and again and again.  Sure, they gave uber Warriors decent aggro, but every other Warrior sucked.  This was a system wide problem.  It needed a system wide fix.<br />
<br />
In GoD it's not every zone and every mob Knights are struggling with.  Therefore it's not a system wide problem and doesn't warrant an across the board class fix.</div></div><hr />

I know my guild has used a ranger tank in Vxed with a charmed pet - ranger would WS tank the named, pet would tank everything else, dont think its been done in Tipt yet, though have definitely gone through with a single healer.<br />

I think an auto block disc - 12 sec's must have a shield equiped, and a self only BoV type buff that mitigates 20% DI both from Kod'Taz runes would be the best way to balance both Ikkinz trials, and offtanking in later GoD raids as well as preparing to maintain tank balance in future expansions.</div></div><hr />

No, it was a class weakness that was countebalanced by corresponding strengths. Then the environment changed such that the weakness was accentuated to unacceptable levels and the strengths were not needed. That is exactly what is happening with knights.</div></div><hr />

I don't think giving more class a riposte like ability would be that cool, when sometimes you already have mobs riposte tanked for close to 1 mn in raid, it's not tanking really. Self BoV could be a possible way to increase GoD tankability by paladin, just a BoV but self only with a shorter casting time. It would not increase in anyway the ability of a paladin to tank raid named, but would definitely increase their survavibility in single group content &amp; raid offtanking. A regular BoV that absorb 10% of melee damage.</div></div><hr />

Knight are still the best choice for PoP &amp; LDoN single group content. Back in PoP warrior were really inferior to knight everywhere. There is no 'knight problem' at all outside kod taz+, they can still tank PoTime god, and still have better aggro than a war and tank about as well in xp group.</div></div><hr />

The aggro control myth is convenient, but manifestly untrue. Statements by Verant/SoE puts responsibility on the group to control aggro. When groups were no longer willing to do so, and didn't have to with a Knight tanking, then SoE was compelled to give Warriors adequate aggro control.<br />
<br />
IF someone unfamiliar with the facts wants to make the case you present, they should complete it. Knight superior aggro control was appropriate MAYBE in a mana poor environment where their inferior survivability, an intended class weakness, made it an insuperable advantage. Please note that Rangers too have ranged snap aggro, a taunt button, and are Warrior based hybrids.<br />
<br />
Then the environment changed such that the weakness was accentuated to unacceptable levels and the strengths were not needed.No, Knight weaknesses were eliminated. There was NO cost to having a spellbook other than Defensive basicly. The had all of the meaningful major melee survival AA abilities. They were very close in total HP's and AC.<br />
<br />
Not needing a Warrior's superior survivability, groups opted for Knight versatility. Slowing and debuffing on incoming sped up the experiance flow. Players no longer had to be responsible for controling aggro with a Knight tanking and therefore Warriors were /lfg.<br />
That is exactly what is happening with knights.<br />
This is exactly what is NOT happening with Knights. Rather than a change in playstyle that affected Warriors everywhere, a single expansion and no where else contains mobs that give Warriors an advantage in forced one group content. Even in LDoN Hard Assassinate a well equipped Knight can tank the boss mob with Warrior reliability. Unfortunately, the Warrior advantage is evident in flag one-group content. Put it in two group content and Knights can only complain adds are too hard. Put it in 2 trials only without flags and it's not all that different from LDoN undead zones until they had their content changed.<br />
<br />
However, this is only one the many reasons Warriors do not want to see Knights put on near even footing with requard to survivability. When survivability is not an issue, groups opt for the tank with a spellbook.<br />
<br />
Another reason of couse is that Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that should not be shared.<br />

<br />
Knights basic arguement was that GoD content is challenging enough to expose the huge gap in tanking ability between warriors and everyone else, and the small to gap between knights and all the other non-warriors.<br />
<br />
The response from SoE was, oh, well we will make the content easier, so you do not see the gap so much.<br />
<br />
I dont know how anyone could reasonably think that this would make any knight happy to hear.<br />
<br />
I am a knight with time+ gear in nearly every slot, full of augments, 2765 AC fully buffed and I tank regular 1 group mobs (such as a yellow kyv in kodtaz) worse than a 2100 AC non-defensive warrior in mostly elemental gear with no augments.<br />
<br />
I see this as a serious problem. Most of the warriors posting on this thread see this as a good thing. I am disappointed beyond words that the SOE folks agree with the warriors.<br />
<br />
The reality is that almost all knights out there see themselves as a tank. That is what they think of themselves to be. It is all very cute to say, oh, well if you wanted to be a warrior, you should not have played a knight, but if that is the case, what is a knight supposed to be? Why would anyone choose to be one if they are not a tank?<br />
<br />
I dont want to be a warrior. I am willing to conceed to them tanking superiority. What I am not willing to do is to be so much an inferior tank that I am not even in the ballpark. If my gear is vastly superior to a warrior's gear, I believe I should tank better, not vastly worse. <br />
<br />
I want to be able to do my job and have fun. Doing my job means tanking. When every single yellow con and above in kodtaz or ikkinz is a near death experience even with 2 clerics healing fulltime, and they have to go oom healing me, and I constantly have to hear, &quot;maybe we should just quit until we can get a warrior&quot;, how am I supposed to feel?<br />
<br />
Get this, knights are no different than warriors when they are told not to tank. You know how you feel as a warrior when you join a group and they tell you not to tank, someone else is going to do it? Well knights feel the exact same way. Useless. You may feel like you do no dps, but I can guarantee you as a paladin I feel the same way. If I cant tank for the group, then there is no point in bringing me along.<br />
<br />
I do not want to be a warrior with spells. I want to be a tank with spells. I dont care what warriors have or can do as long as I can do my job (as a tank) well enough to be able to do my job and competative enough that I am not hurting my group.<br />
<br />
The reason defensive for knights is such a good idea is precisely because it is so easy to class balance. As long as it works the same as warrior defensive, then you can make it a lower percentage and it will be 100% certain that knights will tank every mob worse than a warrior (baring special abilities like fearless). Any other solution that addresses the same problem with be a lot harder to balance, because there will not be 100% overlap in abilities, so in some future encounters the knight way of reducing damage (whatever is decided) may be more effective than defensive for warriors. If knights get the same ability, at reduced effectiveness, then you will know that it will always be less effective for knights into the future.<br />
<br />
But even more than defensive, more than a riposte discipline, what I think knights need is a parity in the value of AC. A knight at 2500 AC should spike in damage just as much as a 2500 non-defensive warrior. Right now, a 2500 AC knight spikes as much as a 2500 AC enchanter, which is a ton more than a 2500 warrior. By spiking, we are talking about the percentage chance to get hit for each DI multiplier, at the same AC, on the same mob, knights currently get hit toward the max value a lot more, and the min value a lot less. Knights already have lower AC, they do not also need for their AC to be less valuble. And certainly not at the hypothsized value of about a 500 AC advantage to warriors.<br />

<br />
My point is no one on the dev team seems to look at the consequences.<br />
<br />
You dont achieve balance by giving one class better everything, in fact it is that much harder to keep balance when you have some many variables of change.<br />
<br />
If you want to make the difference be the better mitigation for the same AC, then dont give warriors innate higher AC. Dont give warriors a 5% all the time advantage.  Dont put more avoidance and shielding on warrior items than on knight items.<br />
<br />
These problems arise from the complexity of the problem, which is not helped by 'hidden' things like this. The guy designing armor doesnt know about this mitigation difference, so he makes sure the warrior mask has more AC than the knight mask, etc. <br />
<br />
The end result is the huge gap that we have today, because each thing on its own is not so bad, but they are stacking up and stacking up with each other, sometimes multiplying each others effectiveness, and the end result is a very huge gap.<br />
<br />
GoD mobs were specifically designed with a huge DI in order to make AC be effective. Well guess what, this vastly increased the advantage of warriors because their AC means more than knights. This is an example of how class balance needs to be reexamined constantly. Something which was fine in the past, may not work now, because of changes that were not anticipated.<br />

<br />
It seems it's a very reasonable request. Is there such a difference ? do you have any kind of parse backing this ? <br />
<br />
I have been in ikkinz trial with a pal, but she had not log on, I think it would be easier to make a point with : see a warrior is taking  850 dps and I am taking 1300, it's just silly than like a few paladin did, say : see this named 2 rounded me ... <br />
<br />
Anyway, if you give paladin defensive, riposte and the same mitigation table, then what is left to warriors ?  yeah nothing. Problem is that before GoD in single group content named were not that much harder than trash. If you go as far as lower guk, named were not really special. Trash is fully slowable and named are immune, or you can slow them 'slightly' (ie you'd better be mending or runing than wasting your time on a slow) Paladin can tank, I was about to say just fine, but in fact they tank trash significantly better than a war,but on named that's another story.  <br />
<br />
There is not such a huge problem that would require a so radical change, ie giving the class defining ability of warriors to knight. <br />
<br />
Knight make it sound like they can't do anything in GoD from my personnal experience it's just plain wrong, they do offtank in Uqua, and no, it's not just my guild, and it's not because we don't have enough war, there are still some advantage in letting a knight offtank is some situation, especialy like in uqua's trap where you need a tank to aggro right now. We still use indifferently war and pal to MA in ikkinz / KT / Yxtta raids. Knight can tank Vxed Tipt just fine. And I've only been once in ikkinz single trial with a pal tanking, and it went smoothly, maybe was just luck but well, and she was nowhere near 2800 AC, more like 2k3 or 2k4. 2 clerics &amp; knight is overkill for KT named, even yellow archer.<br />
<br />
Warrior shoud tank better than knight, everyone agree on this (except the most fundamentalist PoN retard). Therefore theoricaly there should be mobs that can't be tanked by a war and can be tanked by a knight. It is not a bad thing that, in fact for the very first time, these mobs exist, yet those mobs in content restricted to 6 people is not a very good idea, because knight are the best at tanking and when you get a knight in your group it's usualy to tank. (well SK are ok damage dealer on 100 seconds fights)<br />
<br />
From my point of view, it's not a bad thing to gimp a bit Ikkinz single group trials (if and only if everyone need them, if just one group need them, it would be RETARD to gimp it, if anything it should be made harder then) but unlike knight would like us to believe the gap between war and paladin is not so big, and there is not much margin between war can tank, pal can't and both can tank easily.<br />
<br />
Again it would be really cool to have some decently long parse of ikkinz named on a paladin, I've seen a ton of warrior parse, roughly from 750 dps to 1k1 dps in Ikkinz over 60 to 120 seconds, I wonder how bad is their dps on a knight. If I can get a few hours to bring back a knight in ikkinz i'll parse.</div></div><hr />

I believe the Warrior/Paladin healing/buffing/ress'ing gap is greater than the tanking difference. Was this hyperboyle?<br />
<br />
How very generous of you to acknowledge Warrior tanking superiority. But then you quibble:<br />
What I am not willing to do is to be so much an inferior tank that I am not even in the ballpark.<br />
Paladins are very quick to toss out the word balance, they do so because it implies equality. There is no equality except for the assurance that Knights will be equally accepted in groups - ergo SoE will be changing the trials - and each class wil have a raid role, but not necessarily the same raid role.<br />
<br />
I am a relatively gimp Warrior, barely breaking 12k HP's buffed, with only modest AC and shielding.<br />
<br />
While I note that I have a few more HP's, you have much more AC, and an astounding 6901 more mana.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, having decided to be a 100% Tank, I'm comparatively unmatched in surviving the most brutal battles. I am so sorry if being a powerful Tank/priest and not a Tank/Tank disheartens you. You do have a few more spells than I and that impressive 6901 mana.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact you are only partially a Tank, you are able to tank a Kyvv Heartstriker. This makes your later claim that every yellow yardtrash mob in Kod'Taz almost causes you to visit your bindpoint sound a bit like exageration. Have you obtained some flags? Are you a valued member in the raids you attend. I do note that you do not mention your flag staus.<br />
<br />
Having one Paladin guildmate who on several ocassions managed to talk a group into letting me join them during the dark times, I'm not unaware that Paladins were very sympathetic when Warrior spent most of their time /lfg. I am very glad SoE is fixing the content so you don't experiance this difficulty for much longer and can finally farm a Glyphed Prayer Ring, Dusty Mudstone, and obtain those other impossible to get GoD trial upgrades. Oh, my mistake, you have better.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of the Paladin posters on this issue are either not capable of MTing RZ much less advanced GoD red named mobs OR in fact have achieved that which other Paladins find it convenient to claim is unachievable. Why would someone do such a thing?<br />
If my gear is vastly superior to a warrior's gear, I believe I should tank better, not vastly worse. <br />
Ah, thanks for providing the answer. You arguably have better gear than I - even perhaps even vastly superior. Thank goodness I have defensive and &quot;-1 DI&quot; else in your presence.....<br />
<br />
(or for many Warirors unlucky enough to join guilds where Paladins have vastly superior equipment and insurmountable DKP balances<br />
<br />
or member of guilds willing to accept a Knight applicant that is stepping down from PoTime to EP)<br />
<br />
....on a raid I would never do my primary raid function - MT and would in fact be doing pathetic general melee without the ability to cast anything more powerful than Health and Serpent Sight to effect the outcome of the battle.<br />
<br />
I have no problem in the fact that a naked level 60 Paladin can out heal, buff, res, Root, and remove curses better than I. I chose not to have these abilities just as he chose not to have some of mine.<br />
<br />
We have two different roles Iustus. Mine is Primary Tank. Yours is Tank/priest. I understand that if you could co-opt my role it would make your class more fun to play. But, that would be at my expense and fortunately, SoE understands this.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Please take into account almost all Warriors want Knights to be able to perform their role in GoD. Since GoD content is substantialy more difficult than PoTime and there are no equipment upgrades that make it reasonable, it's pretty obvious it needs retuning. That's what SoE is doing.<br />

Yet under what circumstances will a Warrior, given an infinite amount of AA and gear, ever cast spells as effectively as you do?  You already surpass most Warriors in the game with your ability to tank, but that's not enough, you want to equal those that are a step or two behind you and only be &quot;slightly&quot; behind those on par with you.<br />
<br />
There is a gap between Warrior and Knight tanking.  It has always been there.  Defensive has been in the game for four years.  GoD is no different in that regard than LDoN, PoP, or any of the expansions before.  The only difference is Knights, when confronted suddenly with mobs they really have no right or reason to be expected to be able to tank, rather than saying damn, didn't you make the mobs a little over tough SoE, instead use it as a justification to close the &quot;tanking gap&quot;.  The very same tanking gap that has been the center piece of Warrior functionality for years. <br />
<br />
You weren't broken for tanking in LDoN nor PoP.  You're not broken in GoD.  The content needs to be adjusted.  It really is that easy.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Role&quot; is a player convention. In fact Tank/priest translates to several functions performed at raids. Add tank vs. Sayrn, MT for CT, Rampage Tank for RZ, Wave healer/GRC for Quarm, etc. Paladins opted for versatility, not Primary MT.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, GoD doesn't give Paladins much scope for their versatility. Hopefully SoE wil address this. However, design oversight limiting their versatility in an expansion does not entitle them to co-opt Warrior defining abilities or our role.<br />

Warrior narrowness is a blessing and a curse. Having accepted the curse for many years, we are entitled to the blessing.<br />

You're almost completely wrong here. And totally wrong on the bolded line.<br />
<br />
Recent parses... hard, solid evidence... have shown that the different classes spike damage much differently. Other than the obvious impossibility for a chanter to even REACH 2500AC, that chanter spikes wayyyyy more damage than a paladin. A paladin doesn't spike all that much more than a warrior. The deference is DEFENITELY not &quot;a lot more max&quot; and a &quot;lot less min&quot; when you compare them to the chain, leather, and especially the silk classes.<br />

If anyone gets to 2500 AC, they should be rewarded for it (including enchanters).  If SOE doesn't think a chanter or a knight  should tank as well as a warrior, they shouldn't put that type of gear in the game or just take it out or nerf the equipment.  Having separate scales for all classes is confusing.  There's  too much hidden crap in the game and the unnecessary complexity is frustrating.<br />
<br />
Iustus said that he is willing to concede to warriors being better tanks, cool huh?  Especially since they can stun, loh, rezz, heal, etc...  Warriors also have abilities, they have more dps and defensive.  I'm pretty sure that we all knew this when we chose our classes.  I would be suprised and PO'd to see my class not being able to perform a defining function as well as someone with the same AC (like a watered down cleric).<br />
<br />
The main issue IMO is whether knights should be able to tank the same content as warriors.<br />

BTW, SOE should be providing the parses and the documented rationale for making any changes/nerfs.</div></div><hr />

You mistakenly put 500 ac over 500 hp, Of which you forgot to mention the 60 aa for 500 hp.  Warriors do not have a innate 500 ac advantage over plate hybrids. or else every level 1 warrior would start with a base of 540 ac @@<br />

We do have diffrent mitigation tables and thats good because warriors Mitigate damage better, Deal damage better, and just about do everything in melee combat better then plate hybrids.  Why because its what we get for not taking a spellbook.<br />

Yeah maybe in discord your spells are &quot;worthless&quot; in trials but in other places there worth while I bet, so go cry a fucking river somewhere else.

Yep, and you won't anytime soon.  A lot of paladins lately are living on some strange fantasyland where they actually believe that beastlords, monks, and rangers tank about the same as they do.  It's completely false, easily proven so by parses.  But they can't seem to be bothered with parsing.  It would get in the way of demanding upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am a knight with time+ gear in nearly every slot, full of augments, 2765 AC fully buffed and I tank regular 1 group mobs (such as a yellow kyv in kodtaz) worse than a 2100 AC non-defensive warrior in mostly elemental gear with no augments.<br />
<br />
I call BS on this one.  There's absolutely no way.  Without defensive, the warrior will take about 4% less dmg than the knight with the same stats.  With mostly elemental gear though, his stats won't be near what your's are.  His AC will be way below you for one.  You may even have more hit points.  You're just pulling this comparison out of your bum.<br />
<br />
Right now, a 2500 AC knight spikes as much as a 2500 AC enchanter, which is a ton more than a 2500 warrior.<br />
<br />
Already commented on by several others... this line is just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
As for gear, I'm not at the level of the game you are, but most knights I encounter with about the same gear level as me can easily surpass me on AC.  /wave shields and self buffs.<br />
SKs in particular can blow me away on AC thanks to the self buffing.  Maybe warriors catch back up at Time+ level gear, but to say they're way ahead is once again, wrong.  I guess we shouldn't be surprised though.  Your whole post is nothing but incorrect assumptions and exaggerations you've made with no real defense.  <br />
<br />
Steelwarriors has long been full of parse monkeys.  By that I mean people who parse the data and demand proof.  Is there some deficiency on other class boards that prevents some of them from being able to do the same thing?  :P Not every issue of balance is something that's parseable, but when you're spouting off AC and claiming you tank worse than such and such a class, well... prove it.</div></div><hr />

I know that because I made fake magelo profiles and then simulated it using my GI Joe dolls (I made sure the armor and weapons matched the fake magelo profiles I made, too).  The Warrior GI Joe took an M-80 down to half health before it blew up on him and he didn't even flinch.

I think the knight leadership has hurt the cause of all knights by demanding stuff they are not gonna get, instead of asking for more reasonable fixes. <br />

Some issues that I think knights should focus on are the following:<br />

1. A physical enhancement 2 aa that is only available to War, Pal, and SK. This would help distance knight tanking from other non tank classes, while keeping the balance within tank classes.<br />

Now I agree with you on the point that its getting kinda ridiculous to have warrior armour with more AC, the -1DI change and then have a table behind it all that makes that extra AC worth more... too many variables and all that.  Now I'm not up on the latest stuff from GoD, but as you should be well aware regarding time loot (cos you are apparently wearing so much of it) there isnt a warrior mask with more AC, infact I think the only warrior only item in PoT is the Darkblade.  The best gear for warriors is the same best gear for knights so seeing as itemisation at that level is so pooched someone must have said &quot;hey the guy designing the warrior mask didnt put more AC on it cos he was too busy smoking crack out the back with the chick we hired dress up like Firiona Vie and make the nerd herd drool at the fanfaire so we'd better put warriors on their own mitigation table.&quot;</div></div><hr />

What AC advantage?  The highest (real) AC warrior on eqrankings is at 2601 AC.  You yourself have 2538.  Considering the shield he has equipped is 25 raw AC higher than yours (augmented) and paladin useable, I see no warrior AC advantage.  Warrior class armor has higher AC than knights, but at the end of every expansion we're all wearing the same gear, and a warrior has to give up a large amount of aggro (30%) to equip a shield where a knight does not.<br />

Check it out. You'll see that the knights are closer to the rangers and rogues than they are to the undisced warrior. And that the monk took about the same damage as the knights. A lot of variables involved, but the basic pattern isn't too hard to see.</div></div><hr />

That's huge and if anything looks more like a mistake in itemization with certain Time level gear.  Why did they go so crazy with monk avoidance gear at that point?  How about an elemental level monk vs. a similar level knight?  Of course monks often wouldn't be able to tank effectively anyway due to lack of aggro control.  The parses shown do not take into account hit points either.  That's very relevent to how well any of those classes can tank.  <br />
<br />
There's also a warrior with 15 shielding and nothing on the paladin.   The shielding is clearly having an impact.  I don't know what, if anything, is available to knights to provide shielding.  I do know that the warriors outside of Time don't have it.<br />
<br />
So while the data is interesting, I don't think it's especially useful for class balancing decisions.  There are too many variances.  It shows mostly what one would expect it to show.  The 1380 AC warrior was a bit better than expected.  That's about it.  Though there may be some diminishing returns coming into play there.  The mob being tanked was a trash mob from HoH and most of those tanking it were way beyond that level in the game.  It's ATK isn't going to be terribly high.  As AC increases relative to that mob's ATK, the returns will diminish.</div></div><hr />

The nice thing about shielding is that its effects are predictable and consistant. Add 7-8 dps to the warrior to get his DPS taken with 0 shielding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very telling, my arse.  No.  One, they are already outdistancing the ranger.  You have a warrior who's results are skewed low thanks to shielding.  The knights and warrior would be closer together.  The ranger also has 2% shielding and 10 avoidance while the paladin has nothing, which isn't a lot of shielding/avoidance, but it's there.  <br />
<br />
You again are avoiding any mention of hit points.  That parse isn't even really showing us tanking effectiveness.  It's showing how much damage per swing each character is taking.  That is all.<br />
<br />
The diminishing returns of AC are also important.  If the test mob is going to be a guard from HoH, then I would suggest using appropriate gear level characters rather than 2k AC characters.  <br />
<br />
The nice thing about shielding is that its effects are predictable and consistant. Add 7-8 dps to the warrior to get his DPS taken with 0 shielding.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that parse isn't showing us dps.<br />
<br />
Stop ignoring the problems with the parse.  It is interesting information, but by no means an accurate representation of tanking abilities due to the many variances in gear level, shielding and avoidance effects on that gear, the lack of hit point information, and the low difficulty of the mob relative to most of the characters tested.  A few classes were tested at a more realistic AC level for that stage of the game, but neither of the knight classes was one of them.  So you can say roughly jack and sh** about how well they'd tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately that parse isn't showing us dps.<br />
Technically, that is true, it shows the average damage per swing by the mob. This is functionally the same as DPS for comparison purposes, it only needs to be multiplied by the average number of swings/sec to give DPS. Please mentally replace &quot;dps&quot; with &quot;damage per swing&quot; in my previous post. The point still stands. As I said, the affects of shielding are entirely predictable and can be factored out. The affect of avoidance is most likely also faily predicatble if you compare the differences between the monk with 60 avoidance and 0, it results in a 4.8% difference in hit percentage. I think that we can pretty safely say that the 10 avoidance mods won't result in a difference that is parseable.<br />
<br />
Sure, the parse isn't as controlled as it could be, but that doesn't mean that there is nothing we can glean from it. But, since you have said the following:<br />

<br />
If we ignore that the warriors has 200 more ac than the paladin. <br />
DB for warrior = 87, without shielding it would be 102 that's 15 dmg / swing difference, 48.9% of hit, means 7.5 dmg / swing <br />
<br />
so warrior with 2271 AC 0% shielding dmg / swing = 116.9<br />
Paladin with 2066 AC 130.4 / swing<br />
Rangers 1728 AC  10 avoidance : 142.7 dmg / swing<br />
<br />
<br />
What does this show ?  there is the same gap between warrior and paladin than between paladin and ranger <br />
<br />
I won't even comment on beastlords that were supposed to tank just as well as a paladin. Monk mitigate very well, but can't tank due to lack of aggroing tools, and therefore does not qualify as offtanker or maintanker.<br />
Thanks for proving with this link that indeed, paladin are living in a dreamworld where rangers tank better than them and not are not playing the same everquest as I do.<br />

<br />
If you compare what should be compared, ie paladin &amp; warrior with 15% shielding :<br />
Warrior 109.2<br />
Paladin 123<br />
Ranger 140.7<br />
<br />
The paladin is taking 12% more damage than the warrior (again should be less due to 200 AC difference)<br />
The ranger is taking 14% more damage than the paladin (should be more 1728 AC for a ranger is not in line with 2000 AC for a paladin).<br />
<br />
And my usual disclaimer this is without factoring that paladin can heal in fight while a ranger can't really do it.</div></div><hr />

this parses do not take the paladin heal into account, granted it does not make it for defensive, but still the paladin mitigate better than a warrior without defensive, and fortunately, the warrior mitigate better when it comes to mobs hitting over 1k dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay.  So the differences in damage taken across many classes is so small as to be detectable only through parsing.  Lets set aside all the claims by many Knights to know that Warriors are far better tanks without defensive because they see it.  You know and I know that difference in damage taken between the two wouldn't be visible to the naked eye unless the Warrior fired off defensive.  That's one of the reasons Warriors recently got -1 DI, isn't it?  And the difference is still only evident through parsing.  But, and this is an important but, there is a difference.  It does exist.  Claims that Rangers and Beastlords are out tanking Knights is blantantly false, given similar gear.  At most Knights might be able to claim that the gap of tanking advantage granted to Knights over the other melee classes is too narrow.<br />
<br />
Even if that's true, that's an arguement that might justify bumping Knights to -1 DI and Warriors to -2 DI.  That would create a wider gap between Knights and other melee and maintain the gap between Knights and Warriors.  And still the difference wouldn't be evident to the naked eye.<br />
<br />
Basically what I see is you're arguing that Knights don't have a wide enough tanking gap with other melee as a reason to justify defensive.  That doesn't really make a good arguement.  Just because you don't have a large enough gap between Knights and other melee doesn't justify removing half the &quot;special&quot; tanking gap between Knights and Warriors.  That would just be giving Knights a huge &quot;bonus&quot; while maintaining the status quo whenever defensive isn't being used.  It wouldn't address your issue about the tanking gap under the majority of circumstances at all.  It would be much like Warriors claiming that they didn't have enough of a HP advantage over Knights which is why they needed fast cast heals.  Fast cast heals would effectively give Warriors more HP, but it wouldn't address the &quot;real&quot; issue and it would be totally inappropriate for the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Statements like this really irk me, because while Possible, they simply arnt realistic, and show a lack of understanding about how a Paladin works in a tanking enviroment<br />
<br />
The Biggest Fallacy about counting heals in as part of our tanking, is that it usually gets put too much to the extreme.<br />
<br />
A) Fizzles/Interupts/Stuns, All Three of these happen, and do reduce thh amount of spell casting, or healing in particular that cane be done - espcially on 1 group boss's where the named are unslowable<br />
<br />
B) It assumes the Paladin has Light of Order, and Light of Nife. GoD spells are redicusously rare, I know of maybe 3 LoO's on my server, while this will probably become less of a factor over time, its defiantly a factor in the present.<br />
<br />
C) If we are chain healing, we arnt casting aggro spells, if we arnt casting aggro spells we dont have aggro, and we dont need healing, because our entire group is dead. While its nice to isolate certain parts of how a paladin works in a group, and showing if they dedicate all their energy to something, they are decent, its simply not realistic. Tanking, Holding Aggro, and Healing *is* possible, I'm not saying its not, just rather not at the degree that many posters beleive.<br />
<br />
D) While Minor, we do loose some of our DPS, however ptiful it is, yes I'm aware of spell casting Bonus Hybrid thing. But espcially with a 1hder + Shield, we loose melee by doing it. Use a high delay 2H like a VBB or Primal Peircer you say? OK But then we loose HP/AC and loose our &quot;Shield Bonus&quot;<br />
<br />
That said I do use heals when I can when tanking, and dont think they are &quot;useless&quot; just I think their importance/use espcailly in higher end single group content is overstated.</div></div><hr />

The bold statement is the key to the whole discussion.  If, over time, the problem will become less of a factor, then there is no need to add abilities to paladins now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gurgeh already answered quite well for me, Gimmel.  I will say that you can't point to what you say yourself is a small difference in mitigation and then claim the avoidance/shielding aren't enough of a difference to matter in that comparison.  Of course they matter.  Gurgeh supplied some adjusted numbers assuming more reasonable shielding values between the classes and your claim that knights were closer to rangers in tanking than they were to warriors evaporates.  I'd rather see parses where no one has any shielding or avoidance since that's Time level stuff, but that's just me. :) My estimate would be that if they have about the same AC, you'll only see a few percent difference in tanking that's accounted for by the warrior DI bonus, and that wouldn't factor in the effect of knights stunning/healing/lifetapping.  But it would be neat to see a parse.<br />
<br />
Yes, margin of error on a test should be taken into account as well.  For instance the parse you linked showed some minor and somewhat odd differences when comparing all the numbers between the ranger and the paladin, like the ranger riposting more (don't they have the same riposte skill?), but it's within a reasonable margin of error.<br />
<br />
As was pointed out MULTIPLE times during PoP, often by myself, the difference in damage taken across many classes is so small as to be detectable only through parsing. <br />
<br />
Tell the ranger that after he dies.  Again.  :)  The differences ARE significant and then when you combine it with the hit point differences, it's very significant.  Of course if we're talking mobs that the paladin can stun and the SK can significantly lifetap, the difference becomes even bigger.  I hadn't even realized until recently that this was even up for debate.  It's so obvious if you actually try to have a ranger, or one of the others mentioned, tank for you.   <br />
<br />
Then you are 14% better but i am sure you will not win more then 1 out of 5 trys. You will not tank good enough to tank the nameds there<br />
<br />
Reinforcing the point that if there's any problem right now, it's the design of a few zones in GoD, not a class balance problem...<br />
<br />
Speaking more generally, realize that they just recently gave warriors some upgrades to bring them more in line with where Sony felt they should be in regards to tanking and aggro control.  Do you really expect them to now go back and give knights a tanking boost?  Hey, then after that maybe we can give warriors another boost.  And then, we can give knights another boost.  And then... :P  Don't count on it.  Expect them to handle it, in this case the way it should be done, by tweaking the content.</div></div><hr />

I'll readily agree that against boss mobs that hit as hard as we're talking that Paladin heals are like much like throwing a snowball into a firestorm.  Which leads to two possible conclusions.  1) The mobs hit too hard and should be adjusted or, 2) The heals are too underpowered which leads to the further conclusion that probably most heals are too underpowered or verge on being too underpowered.<br />

Either arguement has merit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well at least you're not saying they are useless.  Heh... speaking for myself I haven't tried to state them as huge, though in easier exp content, they can be pretty damn big.  In GoD I realize they are less significant than say, an easy LDoN.  I just bring them up in my posts to say, hey, these shouldn't be discounted.</div></div><hr />

I think you misinterprted what I said. What I mean is that to really obtain 200 HP/S in semi realstic enviroment, forgoeing all the other points I brought up you need Light of Order, which is a GoD spell drop, so you can cycle it with Light of Nife, be cuase both have a 5 second cool down. If you have Light of Orrer its not a cure all to our problems, its not even close.<br />

<br />
Heh, Give us too much more powerful heals, and then clerics or shamans or druids scream at threading too much on their toes. Although I dislike the term hybrid, because it implies a bastardized son wated down class, we are much closer to warriors, then we are to clerics, so to me its a lot more realistic, to get help on tanking side, rather then healing side, that said, I do think we need help healing side, and to the person who says if you get both healing and tanking help your become a viable super class and throw warriors back to PoP and Clerics back to Luclin: Never said balancing is easy, every upgrade to a class, even if needed, must be weighted against their competition, and the enivorment, or situations such as Clerics in Luclin, Warriors in PoP, or Knights in GoD come up. (Lets not debate who had the most severe of problems, and just agree we all had/have different types of problems to different degrees)<br />
<br />
The content is definatly a big part of the problem, buts its hard to gauge if you should change the content (which effects all class's) or change/supplement the class, which affects all content. <br />
<br />
Once again the reason why many paladins are loath to the Content changed based solutions, is because its the general theme of the exspantion pack, thus far that is the problem, and content/itemization based solutions often have their problems pop up at a later date, because EQ works in a certain way, and problems, unless fixxed, dont completly go away.<br />
<br />
While this is a short list, this is what I beleive the biggest content based problems for Knights, I dont nesicallarily think all of these are bad, but rather they are factors<br />
<br />
A) A change from where the rewards are based on either camping something, or relativly based on each kill, IE in XP based situations, if you fail sometime, and another class would not have failed, you arnt at a complete loss for what you have done previosuly, you still have most of that XP. In GoD, if you fail something, you've pretty much wasted all that time. (Yes I know you gain XP but its both pathetic, nor the point of the expedition) In camping mobs, much of the challenge is actually getting the mob to spawn, Hence, the mob isnt exceptioanlly more powerful then yard trash around it, In GoD, the named mob is both nesicarily to win, and its guarteenteed to be up, so its signicenly harder then yard trash around it.<br />
<br />
B) Tanking (Outside of aggro) is relativly based on two things, The tanks ability to take damage, and the healers ability to heal, both of these are on the rise, and because of the healing part, the damage increase of the mobs cannot be directly parrell to the tanks ability, because of course teh healer has gotten more powerful too, WHat has happened in GOD, is that tanking has gotten down to so few rounds, that abilities that increase the amount of rounds you can take reliably, are much, much more powerful, becuase they drastically reduce both the spike, and the chance of the spike. If you make the mobs hit for less, this problem will come up again, any time that tanking is reduced to lower then 2-4 rounds, defensive type abilities are the norm to tank them, not the exception. <br />
<br />
C) Short Duration of fights have made burst abilities sigicently more powerful, Outside of HT for SK's, knights have no real signicent burst abilities, the relative power of these abilities have grown to be such that they must be factored into the balancing of the fight, because the fights are so short that they last much much longer percentage wise then before.  As a paladin, the two greatest burst abilties I have are HoP, and LH, which due to the na ture of the fights, and abilities, while useful, cannot really be depended on to a great degree.<br />
<br />
We dont have an short term Offensive ability so our role as DPS is sigcently decreased, even though it was already pathetic. (Warriors have Furious, Offensive class's haev offensive discs)<br />
<br />
We dont have a short term Defensive (Defensive as opposite of offensive, not nesicairy Defensive, the DI Mitigationg ability) abiliity, none at all, even non tanking class's have these.<br />
<br />
We dont have signicent burst healing abiliies, a cleric and to lesser degree druid shaman, can chain a high HPS heal for near the entire duration of the fight, we dont have any of these either.. (Since Healing msut be done for near duration of the fight, when I say burst abilitie I dont mean a single heal or two I mean being able to heal for a short amount of time and have a signcent impact of negating the DPS and spike of the mob)<br />
<br />
Once again let me remdind the reader I am not asking for all of these things, nor am I saying they are inherently bad, rather I am outlining the reasons that our power has been weakened in GoD content.<br />
<br />
Basically what I'm saying, is the problem with Knights for GoD single group boss based content, is the entire concept of it. <br />
<br />
These problems, to a lesser degree shift over to raids also, I hate to give strategy out, so I'll try to minimize it and keep it sorta vague, but then again to understand it you have to sorta know the encounter.<br />
<br />
There are many encounters where 6+ Mobs spawn, they either have relativly low HP, are mezzable, or despawn in about 15 seconds, (Different Encounters)  Knights Premier Role in Raids have been dealing with adds, having a warrior Fort/Furious and then AE taunt, basically is the easiest and most reliable way to deal with these, a Knight has to try to get AE Hate/Aggro, which is hard, althogu possible for a Knight just not as relaibly as Fort/Furious/AE taunt, and then LIVE until the mobs are mezzed/despawned/killed. a paladin, if he even lives the aggro, msut rely on both the enchanter/dps/debuffers to do their job, AND the healers to keep them alive (Which is hard because msot are healing MT or the enchanters etc), while a warrior needs to only depend on the enchanters/dps/debuffers) In short, not only does a warrior do the job better, but he requires less assisance from the rest of the raid.</div></div><hr />

Whew, glad one thing I learned from this debate is that heals have no agro.  Especially when you throw ~1000 healing in a second.  Thanks for the news, I'll get back to figuring out how I'm pulling agro off both knights and warriors, because obviously my quick heals aren't doing it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, how hard is it to tab to yourself, cast the heal, and tab back?  A 3 year old could do it, I wager.  Could even do it between casts of your stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to disagree that many Paladins have given it that much thought.  I think many, perhaps the majority who believe defensive is the way to go, just see themselves getting the beat down in GoD and are grasping at what not only seems to them to be the obvious fix, but also will open up more &quot;raid tanking&quot; opportunities for them at the same time.  It's a double win from their perspective and they perceive Warrior unwillingness to allow them the easy way out as selfish on the part of Warriors.  Of course they're disregarding all the impacts to the Warrior class their quick and easy fix is likely to have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spells have cool downs, around 2.5 Seconds, I cant cast a heal and then immediatly a stun, or vice versa. (Outside of Divine stun, which both has a semi long refresh timer (9 seconds maximum AA, and is low aggro for a stun) <br />
<br />
What many people either refuse to acknoledge, or fail to realize about Paladins is, we can only do so much at once, we cant be going full aggro and full healing, we must give up some of one for another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To those who would like us to believe paladin's heal are shitty, here are some revelant number in ikkinz trial condition (ie assuming time gear, AA, focus and so on). 1st column is the class, second HP healed in a 60 sec fight, 2nd in a 90 sec fight and 3rd in a 120 sec fight, notice that all the class are not limited by the same thing, IE paladin are limited by mana all the time, and cleric are limited by time mostly, paladin1 is a healer, paladin2 is tanking (ie casting 1 heal every 8 sec). This is assuming the use of LH ( 8k on a paladin, 9k on a war) and HoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric       52400  78600 104800<br />
Druid       33600  50400   67200<br />
Shaman  24800  37200   49600<br />
Paladin1 37800  43060   44540<br />
Paladin2 21500  25700   25700<br />
<br />
So what ?<br />
<br />
First of all, even if the fight last 120 sec, the paladin is still about as good as a shaman, 120 sec is very long though, 90 sec is more realistic, and in this case paladin can do the back heal job just ok with a cleric main healer, if there is a war tanking. (potential heal = 120k, expected damage 75k) note that there is no way in hell a cleric alone would have kept the warrior, while it's pretty easy for cleric + pal.<br />
<br />
Second point, when the paladin is tanking he is STILL a decent healer, on a 90 sec fight, paladin's heal mitigate about 250 dps, know what ? it's about the same as defensive on those 1k dps mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off,  read my post about why its unrealstic to exspect a paladin to heal at full capacity and tank<br />
<br />
Second off, defensive reduces both the spike, and the DPS of the mob, Healing only reduces the DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another way to put those numbers : in a 90 second fight, a paladin tanking will take (90*1100)  99000 damage, roughly and heal 25000 of them IE healers of the group will have to heal 74000 damage. <br />
<br />
If a war is tanking he will take ( 90 * 850) = 76500 damage, that healers in his group will have to heal fully.<br />
<br />
Still the mob will spike more on the paladin, but on the other hand that's what HoP and LoH are here for, to reduce the risk of 3, 4 bad round in a raw to kill you.<br />
<br />
Lastly it's a bit harder for a paladin to tank than a war, you need to cast your spells at the right time to minimize interrupt, you need to not waste LoH and HoP, you need to balance healing vs higher aggro spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course you don't expect to be just as efficient and secure as a warrior !<br />

If you can't get off 1 heal (ONE second casting time) every 8 seconds, you might want to reconsider your way of playing you character. Did you notice the HUGE difference between paladin1 and paladin2 this has been factored read the post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 1 Healing every 9 Seconds.<br />
<br />
1 Second Cast STun. 2.5 Cooldown 1.5 Second Stun. 2.5 Cooldown, 1 Second Heal 2.5 Cooldown.<br />
<br />
7.5 Seconds of Cooldown, 3.5 Seconds of Casting Time 11 Seconds Total, Assuming No Fizzles/Interupts/Me Being Stunned, assuming Light of Order which Most paladins at this content level done have is a theoretical maximum of around <br />
<br />
126 HP/S. This not factoring in the fact that I will get stunned, interupted, and fizzle, and also factors in my crit percent, which in reality is very very streaky at best.<br />

Finally I never stated that I should tank as well as a warrior, you made a comparisio nbetween my healing abilities at theoertical maximum, and defensive, and I responded abot how it wasnt a great comparision, both because of what defensive does, and because Paladins cant focus 100% on healing, and tank at same time</div></div><hr />

126hps is forgetting HoP and LoH, and for those you won't have any problem to focus or cast them, and these 2 does reduce the risk of killer spike.</div></div><hr />
