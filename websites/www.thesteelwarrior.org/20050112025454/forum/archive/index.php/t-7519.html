<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys, I just dinged 63 and I'm looking for some ideas on gear.  Here is my magelo:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1039235<br />
<br />
I recently acquired the spirit wracked cord (took a while, but the quest was mostly fun and it is a decent item), and I noticed how weak my stamina is compared to others who post.  I looked into it more deeply and I think I mistakenly put my starting points into str and not sta :eek: (I know better than this, I probably just wasn't paying close attention).  I know everyone says &quot;stat issues can be corrected with gear and buffs&quot;.  Well, my regular group does not include a shaman and I'd really like to get that stam number around 220 unbuffed.  Do you have any suggestions?   I think my weak spots are waist, collar and possibly face.  I have about 150k, so I could probably afford something like a black plated collar (~90k on solro).<br />
<br />
Also, when can I start tanking in higher tier planes such as BoT?  My girlfriend (65 druid) has no trouble grouping as main healer there but I am nervous when I read posts about krigers hitting in the 900s  ;)   I realise I need to aug my weapons.<br />
<br />
My guild is very small, and doesn't raid outside of epic fights; so mostly I'm looking at 1 groupable things unless I decide to move up in the EQ guild pecking order.<br />
<br />
Thanks for suggestions/flames/etc.<br />
<br />

PS: sorry for the same old boring FH + CHoS and SotB ... I blame SoE  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvak</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as getting up your stamina goes, id aim for some augments for one.  Its hard to tell you which slots to change out for more +sta, because most of your slots have alot of good stats on them.  I am not sure what they go for on your server, but look into the costs of Helmet of Rallos Zek - very good all around helm.  Usually at 65 by the time you get a few raid drops sta/str will cap themselves, ie its not something your going to have to worry about.  Agi/Dex/Cha are usually the harder stats to get up while retaining the best possible hp/ac, and of those only cha really goes up &quot;slowly&quot;.  Until you have enough aa to throw some into planar power, your stat cap is 280 anyhow - the shaman sta buff adds 60 - so 220 is your &quot;soft cap&quot; with raid buffs.  With an upgrade or two and an aug or two you will easily hit that - and by the time you have enough aa to train planar power and up your cap, you will most likely have gotten raid drop upgrades that will have added sta anyhow.  All in all, i wouldnt lose sleep over it - think of it as room to grow, not as coming up short.<br />
<br />
As far as BoT goes - fully buffed you can already tank BoT.  I would bring alon a good cleric with kei, and a 65 shm so slows land fast - but you can do it without much trouble.  I however would problably not use a druid as main healer in BoT until you are at least 65, but thats really just choice.  Krigers will not be your friend in bot for awhile, its not so much the 900dmg hits, but rather the 1500 dmg procs that will spike your hp down fast.  Try hunting in areas like DS or the camps at top of stairs - you wont encounter krigers in these camps and it will make for nice exp.  If you end up in a situation where you will be tanking krigers, try to recruit a wizard into your group and have him spellshield you - althought its something normally saved for raids, it could give you that extra advantage on the procs to make up for your lower hp for now.</div></div><hr />

I'm a Dark elf warrioress as well and put into str and only the last 5 into stamina because I didnt know better back than, and currently have over 400 stamina total .</div></div><hr />

/nod this is what I was gonna suggest.  Also curious, if you just finished SWC quest why aren't you wearing your Ring?</div></div><hr />

Ring is a seperate quest I thought, I did it but it was along while ago ^.^ hehe - Was pretty sure the Ring was the DrogA , warslikwoods quest of chardok and the SWC was the Drusila and Seb Golem part Queen chardok side of the quest :D</div></div><hr />

It only nets me about 2hp more than a valorium ring of gallantry  ;)   It's in a bag for the dmg shield though (I think the extra stats on the VRoG make up for the miniscule loss in hp)<br />
<br />
All good suggestions, I know the HoRZ is fantastic- &quot;like a level 35 warrior on your head&quot;.  Ornate leggings sound like a winner too, and can be had for &lt; 100k on my server.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys :D</div></div><hr />

Nope, the ring is part of the quest.  You need to turn the ring in along with teh cord and urn to get the final item (you get the ring back).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were able to get another haste item, I'd suggest looking into doing that, and putting a cloak of greater pernicity in your back slot (12ac 50hp 10sta 25cha) -- but that would require finding another haste item</div></div><hr />

The problem with Kizrak's is they are very minor upgrades over the fierce heraldic I'm already wearing, so the main reason to buy is for the click effect.  100k for an ornate greaves mold is pretty expensive, so I'll have to think about it.<br />
<br />
I'd like to switch to belt haste if possible, and I have a soulscream belt laying around- but losing 5% haste would hurt too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
50hp, decent stats, and 36% haste belt slot is pretty nice, although I'm sure you could find some decent belt slot with stamina/hp on it (I just cant think of any at the moment...I've had a belt of the destroyer for as long as I can remember)</div></div><hr />
