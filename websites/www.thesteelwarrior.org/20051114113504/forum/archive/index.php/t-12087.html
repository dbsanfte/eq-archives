On my first two warriors I used the /equip /unequip from Cosmos, but I'm not using Cosmos anymore(using some of CTMod and alot of individual mods) and I'm looking for a good weapon swapping mod.  <br />
<br />
Few things, I'm looking for something that allows me to make weapon setups and then bind them to keys, whether through the mod's binds or making macros I don't care.  Not really into these mods that switch weapons based on stances as I think thats a little clunky but I'd love to hear some thoughts on that system.<br />
<br />
Finally I'd love to see a little discussion on what situations you swap weapons in battle and why?  I'm a little rusty but I seem to remember swapping weapons in battle alot with my previous warriors but the only reason that comes to mind was swapping in a shield to shield bash casters if I was using a dps weapon setup.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">06-28-2005, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend Capn Bry's AddOns (http://capnbry.net/wow/) <br />
<br />
Specifically, Weapon Quick Swap and Stance Sets.<br />
<br />
WQS basically lets you create macros by using the item name, so you don't have to worry about bag slots.  Very flexible but simple.  <br />
<br />
Stance Sets is click and drag, where you can associate weapons to specific stances.  If you want to streamline things, this is the way to go.  With my current macros, If something dodges me  while i'm sword and board in defensive stance, I can hit one button to switch to battle stance (stance sets automatically switches me to my big 2hander), and tapping the same button again uses the overpower skill.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't use stance sets anymore, I like the control of manually switching between shield-1h and 2hander, cause sometimes I don't want to change weapons when I change stances.  But for others it can be very useful.</div></div><hr />
