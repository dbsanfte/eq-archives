<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warchief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay here is my general understanding of the tiers.....You lvl/raid in a plane until you get to a lvl to complete to plane and then you can move on to a higher lvl plane/tier.  What I dont get is what do you have to do to &quot;complete&quot; the plane/tier that you are on. Do you have to get to a certain area or something??  Kill a big baddie, or what?? Also how do the plane tiers go in order from lowest to highest.....What plane is tier one and how high do they go?  Also is each set of tiers limited to one plane per tier (is there only one &quot;tier 1 plane&quot;).  Of course I assume that the higher the tier number/plane you are leveling in I assume they get harder and harder.  Also are there any high lvl planes that are actually like meant to be played in and lvled at?  Also is there like &quot;runs&quot; (not raids) on a certain plane (anyone who has played Diablo 2 LOD will know what a run is lol)<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To advance in PoP, you have to get flags.  These flags come from killing raid mobs (often the gods/goddesses of eq) in their own environment.  Once you get the flags from these mobs (or combination of mobs), you can move on to the next plane in that line of flag progression.  Generally accepted tiers are as follows:<br />
<br />
Tier 1<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
Plane of Disease<br />
Plane of Justice<br />
<br />
Tier 2<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
Tier 2.5<br />
Plane of Tactics (it doesn't really fit into tier 2 or 3...it's as hard as a tier 3 zone, but only takes a mob from a tier 1 zone to get in)<br />
<br />
Tier 3<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Tower of Solusek Ro<br />
<br />
Tier 4<br />
Plane of Fire<br />
Plane of Earth<br />
Plane of Air<br />
Plane of Water<br />
<br />
Tier 5<br />
Plane of Time<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that about covers it.</div></div><hr />

That is only because they scrapped the Plane of War, which would have been tier 2. =/  <br />
<br />
If you're ever bored, download an offline zone viewer and go explore the Plane of War that is in your EQ folder.  It looks like it would have been fun.</div></div><hr />
