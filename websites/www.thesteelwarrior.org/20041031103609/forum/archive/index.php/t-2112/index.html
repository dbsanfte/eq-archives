<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I am posting this for a Couple Questioning Reasons<br />
<br />
I currently use the Epic as my Main Weapons, I am the MA for my Guild, yesterday afternoon my Cleric Brother won a GSoT, I have noticed in the Bazaar that the GSoT has Drasitically lowered in Price, saw one for 14500 last night.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering is has something changed on this, I had read all the posts here about how great this weapon was, and now seeing the Price Drop I am wondering what is going on.<br />
<br />
So now I wonder which is Better for a Guild MA GSoT or Stick with my Epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mudflation is why the GSoT prices are dropping like prom dresses...See Windblade. There's just 'too' many of them out and about to hold any kind of market value and the people who can obtain them basically all have one.<br />
<br />
Also, as a proud owner of the JBoW....I can tell ya as soon as you try a GSoT you'll be finding some dead space in your bank vault to let your JBoW rot along with your painbringer :D.<br />
<br />
it's that much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is what I was thinking for the price Drop, I think my Brother said while he was in the Camp, 4 of them Dropped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kilamthorngage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would use the 2hand version of the epic over the GoT any day. I've used it to tank elemental named with success (due to lack of a better 2 hand aggro, namely a blade of war)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OMG use a JBoW over a GSoT, I just cant see it.  First off the staff does about 15 dps more damage and 2nd the JBoW is fire based and is resisted a lot and it just does not argo the same when resisted.  How long did everyone have to wait for you to call atk?  If you were to test both procs rates over 20 hrs each you would also find they have the same proc rate.<br />

ps yes I have epics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilamthorngage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First off, I'm not the usual MA in our guild. I'm a backup tank usually lower in the list. When I do get called into duty it is to be the back up tank for the mob. I've hardly ever had to go more than 15 seconds without having solid aggro before calling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shik? You're kidding me! I have both and I would use the epic over the GSoT. YMMV - as Shiks does.<br />
<br />
For MAing I would use red epic and something cool - imho the 400 hate proc on a 24 dly weapon has got to be more use than the GSoT - thats my take and I got both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason Greatstaff is dropping in price is because the camp where it drops is an extremely popular XP camp now.<br />
<br />
&quot;is fire based and is resisted a lot and it just does not argo the same when resisted. &quot;<br />
<br />
Does not aggro the same as what though? The same as a non-resisted proc? Well yes. That is true. But does it aggro more than a NON-resisted GSoT proc would be the more appropriate question here.<br />
<br />
IMO, yes, it does. It's still treated like a resisted debuff when it procs, and those get nasty aggro, resist or no resist.<br />
<br />
But that's just me and my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Well, you tell me what has more potential aggro and better DPS than a 3 expansion old easily resisted proc off a weapon that situationally can be easily replaced with a 500-1000 pp weapon or hell; a quested Piece of sh*t out of Sanctus Seru that can easily hold aggro. i won't even go into the 2Her because; well; yeah it's okay but surround yourself with pallies and sk's who cast more spells and own 10x better weapons at 4 or 5 levels lower than me? Hit the normal grinds. Hit the exp groups with fucktards who can't even put fucking vowels in most words they type and love to tell you how much you suck and what the hell is that weapon that glows red and blue?<br />
<br />
YMMV; but of course I'm tellin ya square the GSoT blows the Epics out of the freakin water. Do the math. Leave the cushy guildmates/raid enviroments and see just how good that red and blue set of marshmallow roasters really are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The epic sucked when it came out, and it sucks now.  The difference is that now there is an alternative to it pre-NToV.  Time to wake up and smell the coffee here.<br />
<br />
There is NO reason at all to get or use the warrior epic now.  It's a complete pain in the ass, for a weapon with a worse ratio and a worse proc than 2 weapons you can get with a buddy in droga.  If you like the 2h variety, march on up to BoT and grab yourself a superior alternative there.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned...here's your new Warrior epic --<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
<br />
You don't get to combine them all in a nifty scabbard, but do get something you've always wanted -- AGGRO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A couple of days ago, I borrowed a friend's BoC while we were messing around in Droga. I was using red epic offhand. I was expecting this to be the shiz.......and it is once one of em procs, but before then even this combo lacks any kind of snap aggro whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Switched back to GsoT. Was like it allways had been.....you whack the mob so hard that taunt actually does something after a slow, even without a proc. <br />
<br />
Being MA on raids I have no doubt EB weapons&gt;all as they build aggro like nothing else over time.<br />
<br />
But in exp groups I have yet to fault the GSoT. Sure 2h is streaky, but 30 delay provides you with a lot more regular hits than something like a windblade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kilamthorngage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my experience, the GSoT hardly generates proc aggro at all. Most of the aggro is created by DPS. This is not a suitable means of maintaining aggro when you HAVE to keep the mobs attention.<br />
<br />
When tanking with GSoT I had to constantly mash the taunt button to regain aggro from rogues or rangers. Heaven forbid the slower cast too soon and gank aggro only to die or almost die (thanks to a cleric wasting a ton of mana). <br />
<br />
With the 2hand epic, I've never had these problems. The only time I taunt when using it is when I see the slower's message telling me the mob is about to be or is slowed. The rest of the time I pound my kick/slam button.<br />
<br />
/shrug I suppose if you can't get some friends to go camp the shimmering sea spirit for the wavecrasher, or you want a 2hand aggro weapon the GSoT is for you. But a fair warning, you're gonna have to work to keep aggro... It is definitely  not the aggro solving miracle weapon some people on this forum seem to think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I MA'd with the JBoW for quite a long time, and now tank with the GoT most of the time.  I've pretty much found that given sufficient time, the JBoW will generate more agro, but the GoT is significantly more pre-proc, which means you can get up to speed and get people damaging without things turning faster.  Either one does just fine after the initial rampup on a fight, unless you've got a great disparity in the weapons people involved are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aratus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From my own experience, in a group situation, the Greatstaff of Thunder is good for quick aggro off the start, but I find it doesn't generate long-term aggro very well.<br />
<br />
The best aggro combo I've found is Bone-Bladed Battlehammer/Red Epic. When mobs aren't fire resistant, that is. Works well enough in Droga and such. If Rage of Vallon is being resisted too much I'll swap out the epic with Bloodsworn or Copper Hammer. I mainly use the Greatstaff now when I wanna cut down on riposte using a 2hander but still hold aggro in a quick fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just got the GSoT last week, I really do love it, but I do NOT use it for aggro.  Purely for DPS, and also, when im ST, I can stay reasonably high on the aggro list, enough that AT use keeps them stuck on me if the MA dies.  Want aggro on 2HS, this can work, but if you are in with someone using Great staff of the four winds(as I hope to get soon), be prepared to mash the hell out of taunt.<br />
<br />
For aggro, crack out the CHSD and GBoS.<br />
<br />
I will admit though, GSoT has got way more dps than a pair of 14/18 weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for alls Comments, I gave it its first Try in an EXP Group Last night in PoV fighting at DG<br />
<br />
Noticed I agree with what alot said for it being good for fast agro, it would pop the mob back on me really fast if I happened to lose agro, and the Proc with almost always resisted.<br />
<br />
I figure I will keep ahold of Both, and use them for the Situations they best suite.<br />
<br />
DPS from the GSOT for some Reason didnt seem to be Much higher then the DPS I got from 2hs Epic, fighting in PoV at EW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">GSoT holds agro fine in exp situations, and the DPS is better than any 1h combo I got.  But when I MA for a raid I use Willsapper and red epic.. Never have any trouble with agro using gsot unless theres 15 other people beatin on a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;Chum how can you comment on this you dont have a GSoT or at least if you do you have 5 lvls till it will proc.&quot;<br />
<br />
True I do not own one. I have wielded one before. Was not impressed.<br />
<br />
Its proc is just a stun spell. (And that's the type of proc that as a monk, I've run into once or twice ... I'm kind of biased against stun proccing weapons because of that probably).<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh also the epic does not have a DEBUFF with in any why what so ever so how can the resisted proc act like a debuff please explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
The epic proc ORIGINALLY was a debuff spell. The SPELL still acts like it in the mechanic (Have you ever noticed that the spell will eventually WEAR off? How's that happen? Because the icon that was up and flashing on the mob has finally wore off).<br />
<br />
This is the mechanic that makes the the RESISTED Rage of Vallon and Rage of Zek still very useful aggro for a warrior. It's acting like a resisted debuff. Which can and does piss a mob off. IMO, it pisses a mob off more than a stun proc on the Greatstaff, but I don't have any hard data to support it (hence why I said it was just my opinion).<br />
<br />
Ah well ... to each their own. I've just not been impressed with the Greatstaff of Thunder. <br />
<br />
I'm obviously a fan of the epic because I went and did the quest ... but I will freely admit it's a VERY limited weapon.<br />
<br />
Its DPS is not able to keep up with the game, and it is now far outclassed by many other weapons in the DPS area.<br />
<br />
Which means it's a marginal improvement for a lot of warriors because even though the proc is good at getting aggro, it still has trouble locking aggro because everyone ELSE is cranking out such great DPS these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Stun components are very very nice aggro indeed. I used a Blasphemous Blade of the Exile for quite some time. It grabs me aggro on a proc quite frequently if I'm not watching myself. Even unhasted (due to forgetting to ask) I was able to steal aggro from the MT closer to the end of the fight with it. Stun is good. Even resisted, it is good. Hell, even immune, it is good. (Vova may wish to discount this post, it is anectdotal evidence. And we all know experience is no substitute for parses, right?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I had a gsot and i sold it becasue i have my epic. In exp groups i could see the diffrence.<br />
<br />
the proc rate on the gsot is more than the jbow yes.. but when the jbow procs i can start watching tv. the gsot reqires more taunting when the shammy throws 2 posion dots on the mob.<br />
<br />
In a 6 hour exp run i realized that the gsot is about the same as the epic. diffrence is the epic i own the gsot i can sell.<br />
<br />
as for resists the epic gets reisisted at times but its still seems to snap them to me. <br />
<br />
yes its dps sucks<br />
yes its slow<br />
<br />
but the 2hs epic's proc rate seems high enough (2-3 procs a fight) to make it hold aggro on the tier mobs we killing (ntov/aow)<br />
<br />
when i get a boc ill probably replace the 2hs with redblade and that. but untill a bow drops thats my 2hs aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />
