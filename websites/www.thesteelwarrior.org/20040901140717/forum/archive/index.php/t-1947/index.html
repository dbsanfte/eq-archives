<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">it usually does nothing right? so why not make it even if it fails it still does something.<br />
<br />
on the ideas proposed so far there was Aggregate Hate on taunt but not sure if thats the same: so idea<br />
at level 1 you get 10 hate per a time taunt fails. when it works. same as always<br />
level 10 100hate<br />
20 200<br />
30 300<br />
40 400<br />
50 500 <br />
60 600<br />
65 650 maybe this might be too overpowering so half of the level X 10 would be good to. add your input to what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lvl 1-20 - 50<br />
Lvl 21-40 - 75<br />
Lvl 40-55 - 100<br />
Lvl 56-65 - 150<br />
<br />
Since we don't know actual numbers on most this is totally off the wall figuring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i am too but might as well give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spoke with a Lead GM recently:  &quot;Taunt works as intended, hybrids are working as designed.&quot;  Got zero traction with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gazze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well sure it's working as intended...yah..uh huh.  We thought so to all this time.  I think if the warrior community is really serious about doing something then we need to collectively post /bugreports as well as bringing the issue up in the &quot;official&quot; forums at eqlive.  I am not familiar with the process, that is just my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't expect anything more than a &quot;Everything is fine here, move along, move along.&quot; answer from a GM anyway.  The issues we have really need to be brought up to devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's because the GMs don't give a shit anymore. Ever wonder why half of them don't show up ever? I remember this from somewhere, but...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that the devs would be angry if they went to McDonalds and they said, &quot;We're sorry, but you can't have any fries today since none of our volunteers showed up for work today.&quot;</div></div><hr />
