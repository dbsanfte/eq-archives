<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after reading this link in the library (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1679&amp;highlight=rampage+guide) I'm genuinely confused.<br />
<br />
<br />
Often when we're fighting smaller mobs (paffa etc.) the 2 tanks run in and attack, and rampage seems to remain locked.<br />
<br />
Last night we fought Brynju (sp) - chain BoT boss, and the rampage list changed without death.<br />
<br />
We started with 2 warriors on the mob (I know, I was one of them) and rampage seemed stable.  About 40 seconds into the fight, one of our CH chain clerics then got onto the rampage list and died fairly sharpish.  Our rampage tank hadn't died, so it would appear that some other factor came into play to put the cleric on rampage.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also had the experience with Arch Lich some time ago.  We used the pally range stun method - our pally was successfully MTing (well, at range), and we sent in a plate tank early to get rampage.<br />
<br />
Nobody had done anything else - cast any spells or anything, and the warrior was on rampage for about a minute.  Once AL was down a bit in health and started summoning, the heals started and again, a druid (who was on RGC duty) got onto the rampage list and died, after the warrior had previously been on it and hadn't yet died.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are these just 'quirks' where the rules of rampage have broken for some reason, or are there other factors that alter the single target rampage list?<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated.<br />

Could have been oor for ramp until later.  I've killed him many times, and never had problems with his rampage being odd.<br />
<br />
As for AL, he's just plain annoying.  His knockback proc can launch people out of range of rampage, thus him hitting someone else for that time.  Since it's also a stun, that can be a while.  There's been times when we had the tank, and 3 people in order get aggro for ramp setting, and sometimes the proc happened often enough that all 4 were oor for normal melee or ramp.</div></div><hr />

cleric prolly did something to shoot him/her to the top of the hate list.  Yup, this is pretty likely. Particularly because Brynju doesn't rampage all that much so if the cleric died quickly, it wasn't to a single round of rampage, it was to a couple rounds of melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed a change to rampage on IV in Akheva.  he's perma rooted so ramp tank shoots arrows at him, then MT shoots arrows to build up more hate than RT.  we debuff him before engaging so enc tashes, shm malos, etc.  MT and Ramp tank engages.  IV blinds so we have some folks on RGC duty.  Again mob is permarooted so ramp tank is constantly in range for rampage and takes rampage for the first 30 seconds of the fight.  Then for some odd reason I'm on rampage, a beastlord.  I didn't cast any of the initial debuffs and was one of the last to engage after the MT, so i've got to be like 15th or so on the initial hate list.  I take a few rounds of rampage (mob never turned so it was not me getting aggro and turning him. then the enc who tashed takes a few rounds of ramp ( he backs up out of range), then its a couple of the RGC's on rampage.  then its back to the Ramp tank.  again nobody is moving out of ramp range or anything (except enc), it just worked its way around.</div></div><hr />

IV probably knock-backed the RT out of range and that's why the other people took rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely in each case here, someone was on the rampage list but was oor, thus the next person on the list got ramped until the first person got in range.<br />
<br />
With perma rooted mobs like IV and AL, it's very easy to get on the rampage list long before you even see the mob.   Mem blur can usualy fix that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shabba</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just happend upon this older post and wanted to comment.  I have also had the same problems people above listed, but the folks that answered didn't seem to read what they were saying:<br />
<br />
Here are the points I got that tubthumba and sylas are saying:<br />
<br />
1.  The preset rampage tanks did NOT get hit OOR<br />
<br />
2.  They did not buff, heal, cure, or anything while setting rampage.<br />
<br />
3.  They followed the 'rules' of rampage perfectly and the list STILL seemed to get messed up.<br />
<br />
I have never had this problem until AL.  We have done IV and understood his knockback would take someone off the rampage list so we just set 3 rampage tanks and at all times one of those 3 were getting hit.  From lots of discussion and experimenting I have decided that those 'rules' of rampage are not as set in stone as I once thought and what many others think.  AL is a good example of this because his rampage range is HUGE.  I think it may even be larger than the size of his room.  So the rampage tank getting knocked back OOR should not be an issue...maybe if the RT gets hit into one of the corners or something, but every where else I am positive is still in range for ALs rampage.  I am not 100% sure what EXACTLY can cause your rampage list to change unexpectedly but here are some ideas that were given to me:<br />
<br />
1. buffing, curing, or healing RTs even AFTER rampage is set and before engage can mess up the list...<br />
<br />
2. If the MT loses agro the list can get messed up...especially if a RT picks up agro.  And yes I understand that no 1 on hate list can't be RT but after the MT regains agro if you follow the rules exactly the RT should resume his place.<br />
<br />
This being said, from now on we make sure to engage IMMEDIATELY after rampage is set.  Also on knockback/perma rooted mobs like AL we are going to opt for a knight to tank with a TON of pre-agro to insure the MT never loses agro during the fight because of stuns or whatever.<br />
<br />
I would really like to here from other guilds that are doing mobs like AL if they have ran into this also.  We will be going after AL again soon and hopefully our 'updated' knowledge on rampage will work.  I also suggest everyone has a button to claim they have rampage so the Rampage Healers can switch to them in-case your list gets...well screwy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many of us have killed AL many, many times.  He has normal rampage.  I've never had the issues you are mentioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shabba</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not trying to be rude, but simply someone has messed up if ramp doesn't work normal.<br />
<br />
Many of us have killed AL many, many times. He has normal rampage. I've never had the issues you are mentioning.<br />
<br />
Hussar I thought so at first too...but I am not sure anymore.  Let me explain exactly how we did it:<br />
<br />
1. Cleared the trapped room before AL.  His guards were not up so we did not have to clear them.<br />
<br />
2. We finished up a few buffs let clerics med and then had 2 enchanters go mem blurr AL 4 times each.<br />
<br />
3. Had RT1, RT2, &amp; RT3 go shoot an arrow until it hit.<br />
<br />
4. Everyone was JUST inside the trapped room before AL...so way out of his agro range.<br />
<br />
From what I understood about rampage...our list should of been set in stone RT1, RT2, RT3 should of been taking rampage unless dead, main agro, or OOR.  Also, following what I understood, not even death can remove you from the list.  Only a mem blurr can.  If this is the case one of our RTS should of been taking rampage at all times...and if by chance they all got knocked back and stunned OOR at the same time, they would of resumed their place on the list when they got back in range.  This was not the case.  We ended up with a ranger being ramp tank and he did NOTHING to AL until engage was called.  He did not buff, heal or anything while rampage was being set.  The only thing he did was give one of the RTs an ATK buff AFTER the list was already set...we also had a warrior MTing AL so it is possible that he lost agro when he got knocked back and stunned (he was getting summoned by AL so I think he had agro most the time)...but the Ranger was taking rampage not agro because he was out of melee range and was not being summoned.<br />
<br />
I don't take your comment as being rude either!  If I am missing something or doing something wrong I would love to know.</div></div><hr />

We've killed AL more times then I can remember, and we've found that this seems to be true.</div></div><hr />

The aggro list is set when your RTs plink their arrows.  The RAMPAGE list is set the first time the mob actually rampages.  At that time, everybody on the aggro list goes on the rampage list, in the order they got aggro.  Keep your healers from healing until the mob rampages for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shabba</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomos that makes complete sense! So if you do anything before the mob rampages for the rist time it can change...thank you...I think that is the answer.  Will have to play with this on a mob that don't rampage as much lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried AL for the first time tonight and got creamed.  He rampaged everywhere. Our experience matched the original poster's.<br />
<br />
A clarification, please, Gnomos.  If toons are inserted into the Rampage list in the order they acquired aggro, then what does it matter if the clerics heal or not, as long as all the Tanks have previously shot an arrow?<br />
<br />
Did you mean that when AL rampages, the Rampage List is set from the current aggro list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Gnomos <br />

At that time, everybody on the aggro list goes on the rampage list, in the order they got aggro.  Keep your healers from healing until the mob rampages for the first time.  This doesn't make sense. If the rampage list is set off the agro list in the order that people got agro, then when the rampage list is set is irrelevant because it is still done in order that people go agro. <br />
<br />
Not only that, but the rampage list is absolutely set BEFORE the mob rampages. You can easily prove this on a rooted rampaging mob. Have someone run up to IV and get killed. Drag that person out of agro range, then set rampage and engage IV. I can say with 100% certainty that you can rez the dead guy and he will be on rampage as soon as he is in range, even though he wasn't even in the zone the first time rampage went off.<br />
<br />
Don't just take my word for it, go try it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a related thread: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1359&amp;highlight=rampage+arch+lich<br />
<br />
The next time we go for AL, how about this:<br />
1) We gain access to room. And re-buff ourselves, CoH stragglers, etc. Basically, set up.<br />
2) If there is any chance that anyone has AL aggro, we camp the raid, or blur the mob, whatever it takes. Hosing this up would explain the seemingly random Rampages. <br />
3) RTs (plural) shoot arrows, etc in the order that we want them to have Rampage. We want a real individual RT, but all tanks should be on the RT list ahead of all casters. <br />
4) Debuffers do their thing <br />
5) MT engages, gets good aggro, and calls for attack. I'd probably give the other tanks a little time (10 or 15 more seconds?) to establish their aggro. RT #1 should keep aggro low-ish. <br />
6) Now it is business as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually we did AL this morning, everything went normal.  Moved everyone in behind pillar, and set ramp.  No issues.  One thing about your list, forget debuffers, he completely dispells / cures disease himself.<br />
<br />
Another example.  We were going to kill a named in barindu.  Our bard was bringing him to group, when an sk pulled the named off of him.  The sk pulled the named to a different group, who then engaged.  The sk was not the tank.  Our bard had done nothing other than initial aggro, yet he was taking ramp.  Had bard fade though (completely mem wipe, even ramp), and ramp ended up killing the group, and we got him heh.</div></div><hr />

Since someone has reported getting Rampage via a previously-cast HoT spell, some contradictory evidence is required to rebut them.  Just saying &quot;the only way to get on the Rampage list is to get aggro&quot; does not make it so, particularly since someone has reported an experience of getting on the Rampage list without getting aggro (via having previously cast an HoT on the MT).<br />
<br />
Please provide something beyond a mere assertion (like, for example, a test with an active HoT spell when the mob is first aggro'd) before you speak so definitely about how Rampage works.<br />

Mobs do NOT KNOW WHAT BUFFS ARE ON YOU.  If having a HoT on you put the caster on the rampage list, then every fucking buff would also, thus every buffer in your raid would be on the list earlier.  Even if HoT were dealt with differently than regular buffs, the fact is I've dealt with rampage for a long time now, I get a HoT on every single boss fight, and yet that has never happened.  I think I've provided a lot of evidence, since I've been doing this for as long as I have and it's always worked the same, without HoT's putting the caster on ramp early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not fact and hasn't been repeted only two of us kept logs at the time and it was elimanated to that. weither it was that or not was never proven. except for us to no longer heal pullers at anytime unless they have died or mobs dead or during the fight after ramp is establised. we can skip their dps a few seconds to not blow ramp, and the have to stay down anyway to get off list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small clarification on HOT heals and aggro....<br />
<br />
Assuming both instances that the HOT was casted Before you aggroed the mob.<br />
<br />
1. You are at 100% hp. HOT does nothing until you engage mob.<br />
<br />
2. You are NOT at 100% hp. HOT is healing you when you engage mob.<br />
<br />
In case 1, the mob simply does not go for the healer, cos they are not healing anything. Set the healer in between the mob and you, so if the healer was on the aggro-list, the mob should go for the healer first. In this case, it doesn't.<br />
<br />
In case 2, because the HOT actually did heal you when the mob was aggroed, the healer is now on the aggro-list. Similarly, place the healer in between the mob and yourself. Unless you pulled using a high aggro method, the healer will get whacked by the mob before it reaches you.<br />
<br />
I've been duo'ing with my wife's cleric for like forever, and have found this to be always true for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hussar is right. HoT agro's when it lands. If you get a HoT cast on you, go agro a mob, the agro will not transfer to who ever cast the heal. This is very simple to test. Get a HoT cast on you, go agro a mob, then zone out. The mob will not go after the healer once you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea!  Now someone actually go do it, and make sure that the HoT actually heals you at least once before you zone.  That is, make sure the mob damages you, then wait at least seven seconds to make sure the HoT has restored some health, then zone.  Let us know if the cleric gets spanked.<br />
