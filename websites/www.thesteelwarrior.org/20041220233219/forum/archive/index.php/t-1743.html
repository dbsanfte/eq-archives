Where should I put my points?  I was thinking about 15 in Sta and 10 in Agi or the other way around...  Which is the better option or should I do something completely different? <br />

Thanks,<br />

I do remember though I put my points into Str and Sta ended up with a 105 Str and 110 Sta :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that STm is actaully easier to raise than you are giving credit for. My warrior as a 110 base stm and runs around with a 199 unbuffed. And that will go to 208 when I finally do the 9th ring quest. And I have not been to Ssra. No warlords either. <br />
<br />
Bah I may finally attach my sig. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OgreOverlord</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with Sta and Agi .......Sta = HP's Agi = AC the 2 most important Stats for a Warrior are HP's and AC .... Max out Sta then put the rest on AGI. The Sta Effect's will give you an added Bonus once you get into HP's AA's like ND and PE and PD.<br />
<br />
Dont bother with Str it is one of the easiest Stats to get up. <br />
Dex is a little tuffer but not as important as AGI=AC .<br />
<br />
thats what I would do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well probably part of my frustration was that being a RPer first i started with 85 Stam :) I was 50 or so prior to luclin so perhaps the itemisation throughout the game from SoL plus helps in that regard... /shrug Depends on how uber your guilds access was as well, I missed most NToV content and there's some nice stuff there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">put everything in AGL. stm is great but its easy to come by later on in the game, and by that time you will have alot of stm items. only put stm if you have like a gnome or something that start with like realy low stm.<br />
<br />
my stats<br />
<br />
STR 472(305max)(starting 120)(STR from Equipment 352)<br />
STM 460(205max)(starting 120)(STM from Equipment 340)<br />
AGL 280(205max)(starting 110)(AGL from Equipment 170)<br />
DEX 307(305max)(starting 075)(DEX from Equipment 232)<br />
<br />
IMO putting points into STM on a character that starts with decent STM is a waste. just my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agi is one of the most worthless stats heh.  It does give ac, but at such a minimal return that it isn't worth getting (if you don't believe me, go to the shaman boards and ask them, they did tests to prove it was pointless).  I'd put 5 in, just to make sure you are above 75 so you don't get hit with the penalty for being below it.  The rest I'd put into sta.  Once you are maxing sta, you are maxing (or at least close to) str and dex also, and sta will help more for when you haven't gotten to max yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah but once you get to like lvl 50 you have it maxed unless you refused to get armor upgrades and are running around with cloth armor. str and stm max easy even if you dont have the armor str and stm max easy with buffs for warriors. <br />
<br />
maxing stm is like demanding to be allowed to buy a bus pass after the state has said all bus rides are free from now on. <br />
<br />
dorfs trolls barbs and ogers dont need to put anything in stm its a waste. unless you plan on taking it easy and not get to lvl 50. if you just plan to play casual and mess around and play like 2hours a week, ok put it in stm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you're maxing sta, you're maxing str and dex.  Agi isn't even worth taking a buff slot.  Something like 7 agi for 1 ac isn't it?  Thats all agi does.  Once you start maxing sta, it doesn't matter where your starting stats were at, because the important stats are being maxed also.  Really, the only worthwhile stat that isn't maxed easy once you're higher is cha =p (for DI).  While sta is useless higher, agi is useless always =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also a dwarf warrior...I put ALL my starting points into strength / dex...I regret not putting them into stamina, even though I do have fairly high stamina now.  You can check my magelo if ya want...stamina is fairly easy to come by, but all the other stats (except agility) are easy as hell to come by.  Go for stamina first, then whatever you want later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put 10 in str, 10 sta, and 5agi.  I do pretty well now.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you dump as many into sta, then do what you want with your 5 remaining point.  5 more str to help the n00b out?  Cool.  5 more agi for that 1AC?  5 more cha for DI later on, way useful.  5 more dex to help with procs, don't matter.<br />
<br />
On guild raids, I buff up to 7400hps (nothing uber now), and with Ferine Avatar, I max all stats at 280.  So max your sta, and then play with your other point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even at the lower levels a lot of warrior gear has stamina on it.<br />
<br />
Crustacean Shell armor from the Othimirs in Cobalt Scar is pretty cheap on most older servers these days. And it's got STA out the whazoo.<br />
<br />
It seems almost every warrior armor set has an item or two that has good stamina on it at the very least (even Indicolite).<br />
<br />
Warriors stats are pretty easy to do, and the developers sort of reflect that in their itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sad that I went dwarf. I can't wear RZ of tribunal cultural armor. The fact that most of it is better then my current armor  (mostly no drop SS armor) and is buyable saddends me. If I could change races, I would in a heartbeat. Guess it all depends on what you plan on doing with your warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qris</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can pretty much put them in whatever you want because you're going to be maxing most stats out anyways.  I have a base stamina of 85 + 6 sta from Innate Stamina 3 so completely unequipped I have 91 stamina.  I'm about 30 stamina over my max (305) when I'm raid buffed.  I also max my str and dex at 305.<br />
<br />
The only stat I can't max out is agility unfortunately.  So I would probably go pretty heavy on agility.  It's very hard for warriors to come by.  In fact, I made a fake magelo, my warrior has 8818 hp unbuffed, 305 str, sta, dex, int, wis... and only 227 agi.  This is with the best gear available so far.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I'm a human warrior started out with most or all of my points in str (had no idea what I was doing).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ILLINI</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I have actually decided to go with a Barbarian so I can choose Rallos Zek as my Diety.<br />
<br />
Barbarians Start With<br />
<br />
Str 113<br />
Sta 105<br />
Agi 87<br />
Dex 70<br />
Wis 70<br />
Int 60<br />
Chr 55<br />
<br />
I was wondering why I would want to put points in Charisma?  Is there something down the road that calls for its use?  Was going to put 5 in Dex and split the rest between Agi and Sta.  I should be starting this character in about 2 weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHA helps DA.<br />
<br />
It's been said many freaking times. Look around. <br />
<br />
STA if you don't plan on raiding much<br />
CHA if you plan on raiding lots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DI(not DA Ninja), is Divine Intervention.  It is a cleric spell used in high level raiding that provides a chance to be healed if your hp's drop to zero.  The charisma of the target affects the chance that it will work, hense people saying if you plan to do high end raiding, CHA is a good choice.  If you do go high end raiding, CHA will be the hardest stat for you to raise, while STA will be easy.<br />
<br />
5 in Dex is not a bad idea, keeping all 4 melee stats above 75 is a good thing.  The way you are looking at going should work well for you.  <br />
<br />
Ninja, let's try and be a little patient with people who may not know what all the abbreviations and terms we use are, and what they mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with Redhenna.  5 in Dex so you are at 75, like you said.  Then, if you plan on raiding a lot in the high end, I'd do the rest into cha.  If you plan on casual playing, then sta would be the best bet.<br />
<br />
And ninja, they are asking about starting stats, do you think they would know about DI, and how it is always used at the high end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoops my bad...I was thinking Divine Aura</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seneder</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I made Seneder, I put all on Sta and remainder on Dex. A Tribunal Barbarian. At lvl 38 i have 1978 hp, by the time i hit lvl 45 I should be sitting at 2300 hp. Lvl 60, Who knows? As far as Cha, It'll come in buff form as needed later on. Reading the hundreds of magelo's Cha isn't very prevalent in any of them. I find Sta is. mostly through AA's and equipment. With my dex at 150 my weapons have no problem proccing the way there supposed to and with my Helanic tundra armor, AC isn't an issue...<br />
My vote is all STA and DEX, HP and Procs......</div></div><hr />
