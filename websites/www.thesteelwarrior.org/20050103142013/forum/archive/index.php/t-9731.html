<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 2 questions actually.<br />
<br />
Firsy, my gf is having a *huge* problem with EQ2. She's zoning very slow, and after zoning about 10 times her lag becomes so bad that she can't take 2 steps without getting a huge lag spike. Even if she sets the game at extreme performance it makes no difference. Any clue what's causing this?<br />
Note: her computer isn't that great, only 512 ddr ram and geforce fx 5500. <br />
<br />
And the other question is...how do you deal with battle lag? It seems like the laggiest thing there is in the whole game is other players. The spells look fine with minimal particle effects, but i don't know what else i could change that won't make the game look like *crap*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its the ram mostly, she needs more ram, and probably a faster processor.  I only have an FX 5200, but i have 768mb of pc2700 ddr ram and an Athlon 64 3000+.  The graphics card doesnt affect the load times, its definitely her ram and processor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Battle lag is video card driven.  The choices are:<br />
<br />
Cheap - turn off most, if not all, spell effects.<br />
Expensive - upgrade video card<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you can throw hardware at a problem but it dooesn't fix the &quot;problem&quot;.  Too many times through beta some problems would be greater then others and then other problems would immerge, zone loading times used to be fast, battle combat used to be slower, zone lag used to be nominal.  It seemed that they would tweak one issue and another would evolve.  Anyways, the biggest impact that beta testers saw for hardware was bumping to 1gig of ram.  Video card only helped bump up the textures, nothing else really takes a bump in performance like amount of texture detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was also thinking it's probably the RAM. I had this problem in EQ1 back when i had 128 ram. bumping it up to 512 did the trick. When later up to 1 gig. So looks like i gotta get her another stick of 512 ram.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grailknight</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ram will fix a majority of the issues but remember lag is also caused by other palyers in the game and the number of people on a server. Most servers are running hard (they had about 40+ listed in beta though thry only used 4) and they need to open more and allow transfers to newer servers to eliviate some of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pet peeve here, but...<br />
<br />
Lag is caused by slow/latent connection. Objects don't update properly due to lack of information from the servers. This is not a local effect, others on the same connection will experience the same problems.<br />
<br />
Framerate problems are different. They are caused by local problems with your machine. The screen will stutter or lockup when a lot of graphical effects are going on in-game.<br />
<br />
First, up your memory to 1 Gig. Todays OSes and games will run much better when you give them room to breath. 512 is the minimum, expect it to perform as such. Not sure how much memory is on the 5500, but 128 is the minimum you want to be playing at. Games take up huge huge ammounts of memory on high quality textures.<br />
<br />
TURN OFF SHADOWS if you really need a preformance boost.<br />
Turn off vsync if you dont mind a little tearing.<br />
<br />
I'm running &quot;high performance&quot; setting on an ATI 6800, AMD 1900+ MP, and a 1 GB DDR. The only changes I made were enabling 2x AF to fix a driver bug with ati cars and eq2 and enabling vsync. I could run at &quot;balanced&quot;, but I like the added framerate buffer for smoother graphics. I very rarely have framerate problems except in the most extreme conditions.<br />
<br />
I don't run EAX, its a resource hog with my audigy. I use miles, which works good with my headphones.<br />
<br />
If you are really having problems check your drivers (agp, video, sound, etc..) and make sure they aren't having issues. The most updated drivers don't always have the best performance. I ran 44.03 drivers on eq for a long time with my old NV 4600 because of preformance issues with the latest drivers. If your really concerned about performance, then I suggest you look into the best drivers for EQ2 for your hardware.<br />
<br />
Last thing of note that can't be stated enough. disable all other running programs. This included tray applications. Typical resource hogs are anti virus programs, quickstart applications (real player, quick time, etc..) and file sharing. Basicaly, every program running is less cpu and memory for EQ2.<br />
<br />
If you share a connection with other computers, understand that if anyone is doing a lots of downloading, expecially kazaa/shareaza/etc type programs, they are eating HUGE ammounts of bandwith. Disable those applications while you are running eq2.<br />
<br />
On my comcast cable connection I can handle 5 or 6 (thats as many as I've every had) eq/eq2 clients running with absolutely no lag. One file sharing program, and the lagfest begins.<br />
<br />
Hope all works out well for you and your GF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curdlex</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that also over time the computer gets slower like there is a &quot;memory leak&quot;. Not sure if I am even using the correct term, just heard it tossed about on other games (The longer you play the more lag you see)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few things from a friend that plays EQ2.  <br />
<br />
Defrag your hard drive.  I know some people say that no matter what your problem is, but playing EQ2 with only 512 meg of ram you will be accessing your hard drive a *lot*.  Look at the light, it is almost always on.  If your drive is nearly full or significantly fragmented, that is going to slow down your HD swapping considerably.  My friend got a considerably performance boost from this, and he was only about 30% fragmented.<br />
<br />
Get more RAM.  The more memory you have, the less you have to access the HD, the faster things will go.<br />
<br />
Have also heard others say that performance gets worse the longer you play, so log out and back in once every couple hours maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and use the windows defrag program, i HATE the third party ones, they never have worked as well for me well as the windows one.  come to think of it, none of em have worked, even norton (it froze cause norton is retarded)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even norton (it froze cause norton is retarded)<br />
<br />
Having Norton on your computer is worse than a virus :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i only use the antivirus for the autoprotect (it isnt using too much resources atm) and the manual virus scan.  i also use stinger to help with viruses and pest patrol for spybots.<br />
<br />
PS you could also have a severe spybot problem, they can slow down your computer a bunch.  i reccomend either adaware or spybot S&amp;D unless you can get your hands on pest patrol somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I upgraded from 512 to 1 gig of ram, the difference is night and day. Almost zero choppiness in cities, my zone times went from like 2 minutes to 30 seconds or less.<br />
With 512 megs, after about 5 times zoning, most zones I could barely move, EQ2 has a huge memory leak problem, which I hope gets corrected soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolsdar</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good thing is to patition your hard drive, and install eq2 on the secondary partition seperate from your OS. (or get a 2nd hard drive and install there).<br />
<br />
I am running the following system :-<br />
<br />
Axthlon xp 2600<br />
1.5gb ddr400 ram<br />
ati radeon 9600xt 256 mb gfx card<br />
EQ2 installed on 2nd hard drive.<br />
<br />
When i log into eq for the 1st time i have no lag problems at all. after 2 to 3 hours of playing, i begin to lag like hell, the game has a massive memory leak at the moment, the longer you play the worse it gets. <br />
<br />
The only way i have found  to reslove this at the moment is to reboot when it starts getting laggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only issue ive seen with running EQ2 so far has been after a long session of play the vertices on some objects in game start to spike out in all directions.  It looks like the mob grows giant spiky thorns or something, then they go away and come back, randomly.  Only some objects do it, mostly nearby mobs that are moving around a lot.<br />
<br />
I run a laptop with an AMD 3000+ 1gig ram with an ATI 9700 mobility 128mb vid card, and my guess is the vid card just gets too hot after several hours of constant heavy work, and starts to spaz out.   <br />
<br />
Other than that my lag seems pretty even across even the longest of play times, no real leaking evident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vangurian</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may have already gone through this but there is a great post on Complete Guide to Display Settings (http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=tech_support&amp;message.id=3265) that should help with getting the graphics adjusted to suit you. <br />
<br />
And more ram would help as well as defraging the machine. You may also want to setup your virtual memory to get the best performance out of it.<br />
<br />
Also, nvidia has said that tweaking the water environment cube map to where it uses Fastest: One Time update helps with the stuttering in cities and some dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the issues, I've seen with EQ2 (I have a lot of rl friends that play on varied setups) are related to heat build up. I have friend that kept having a problem of performance degrading over an hour or 2 and he'd have to reboot to get his performance back. I sugested that he take his case off and put an fan blowing onto the MB and video card. Problem solved, he's looking into a better heat solution now.<br />
<br />
I've also seen artifacts and wierd stuff going on with a few other computers. These were heat related, the case off test works wonders. its important that you put a desk fan or something blowing into the case and not just take the case off. your trying to runle out heat and the best way to do that is to remove as much of it as you can.<br />
<br />
I've also seen the game stutter every few seconds, read the boards ans you'll see a lot of people with this issue that are completely certain its a video card issue. While some people may be having the nvidia stutter issue, I suspect that most are experiencing hard drive problems. In my case, I had a scsi controller on the verge of going out (raid controller = pain in the pocketbook) that was causing randomly slow zone loads, and poor performance from the client while playing, especially while traveling.<br />
<br />
I put in a ide hard drive as a temporary solution, and problem solved. I noticed a similar issues, though less appearant, on another friends computer. He had a stock OEM, cheapo, drive that replaced with a newer, faster drive, and problem soved.<br />
<br />
The game loves memory, and even at 1GB (not that much now days, i know) I still get a lot of hard drive accesses. An disk issues will be found by the game client and slow your preformance. Check your page file activity, and check event manager for hard drive errors (read or write) and chances are you are having disk problems. Either the controller, or more likely, the cheap drive that came with your &quot;value&quot; computer. OEMs like to slap in lasts years hard drives in an effort to save money fro thier value line of computers. I suspect that a large portions fo peoples problem with the game  stem from latent hard drive solutions. In my case, I bought a $30 hard drive (only 7200 RPM, 40GB) from circuit cityand now I'm gtg.<br />
<br />
Check your case temperature, check your disk activity, if either seems high, chances are that that is your problem. Wel, except if your justing seeing wierd geometry or corrupted graphics, then its almost definitely a video card issues and you should definitely be checking heat.</div></div><hr />
