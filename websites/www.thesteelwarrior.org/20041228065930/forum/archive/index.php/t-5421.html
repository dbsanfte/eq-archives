I went with lots of 20hp/mana myself, but I'd have went for the AC augments if I played a warrior as my main, instead of a rogue.</div></div><hr />

the fact that its only half the price puts it beyond doubt imo</div></div><hr />

Ac impact is rather erratical in order to avoid those damage bursts by itself. Add to this the usual Ae or proc many bosses will land on you.<br />

I would go hp.<br />

<br />
Earrings = 20hp/mana (Guk T7, Takish T8)<br />
<br />
Wrists/Hands = 12hp or 15hp or LDoN raid drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 12/15HP augs are insanely rare.   I can't justify the time requirements to myself to save up and spend 1150pts on a 20HP/Mana augment. A pure melee class gets only half the benefit that any other class does from the item for the same points.  If they'd add 20 HP War/Rog/Mnk/(BER?)  augs for 510 then we'd be talking something worth the effort, or even a 20HP/5AC aug for 1150 for those same classes.<br />
<br />
edit: not slamming the idea if anyone else chooses to go this route, just my thoughts on it.   Itemisation (is that a word?) in EQ is the suck.</div></div><hr />

But yeah it SUCKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The notion that AC effect is somehow not as reliable as having HP is silly.  Why do people use Evasive instead of Defensive?  Defensive is certainly more reliable at reducing spikes than Evasive because while it is still possible to get hit 4 times for max while evasive it is not possible to hit 4 times for max with defensive (since it's reduced).  When you're tanking longer than a disc's duration, the only thing that really matters is how much damage you're taking on average.  Don't forget that a mob's potential max round is still well ahead of today warrior's HPs, even when PoTime is trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oakinbier</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would definately go for the AC augs. For one thing they are way less points and if your already time geared. Think of the gear you may be getting to replace it with in GoD. Then ask yourself. Was all the time spent getting HP augs worth it to just toss them away with gear upgrades? This is of course thinking the GoD gear will be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Augments not being reuseable is a problem I think.  They are no drop and  I don't understand the logic behind making them not reuseable.   When Gates gear drops and it is marginally beter than your current gear it is a huge pain to decide if you want to blow a droped or purchaced augment on it.  <br />
<br />
I'd really like to see a portable augment device(bird feeder looking thing) and reuseable augments.  We could change augments on weapons in the field and would add a little to warriors and other pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
As for the 5 slots, ac vs 20/20,  I'd not buy anything for another month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too complicated Brutall :)<br />
<br />
- Make a special augment removing cleansing agent. <br />
<br />
- Have it work for Type1 Type2 Type3.<br />
<br />
- Have it RETURN an &quot;USED Augment&quot; <br />
(much like failed tradeskill combine checks)<br />
<br />
- Have the Gnome in SRo accept bought augments and &quot;USED Augments&quot;<br />
(should take like 3-4h to write the code, since he already<br />
accepts augments bought by mistake)<br />
<br />
- Have the Gnome in SRo give you a :<br />
50% refund on &quot;USED augments&quot;<br />
100% refund on bought augments (thats how it works atm)<br />
Item refund on &quot;Dropped Augments&quot;<br />
<br />
Simple easy &amp; efficient. And will make LDoN even more interesting.<br />
Since ultra rare dropped augments are reusable, and bought ones<br />
get a 50% point refund.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulflayer</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 AC augs &gt; 20hp/20 mana augs ----- Any Day<br />
<br />
People that are taking the 20hp augs in those x5 slots that could hold the 10 AC augs is just padding their magelo stats. AC will serve you much better then those 20hp, until a AC cap is found.<br />
<br />
If you are doing LDoN raids then you may wish to hold off on the other slots that aren't being used for the 10 AC or the 40hp augs. Challenge enters the scene when you choose a 30 AC or a 70 hp or a 2%/3% Shielding augs for a slot. Though after some discussion with my guild tanks it would be Shielding then AC then HP.<br />
<br />
Now if you have points banked and nothing to do with them then by all means 20hp aug the rest of your equipment ( thats isnt a 40hp aug or 10 AC aug slot ).</div></div><hr />
