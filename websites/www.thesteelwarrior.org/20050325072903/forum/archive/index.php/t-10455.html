I learned how to make alot of money working the AH.... similar to my experiece in EQ working the bazaar. I play a warrior (Totally Gear dependant to be any good) and I buy expensive upgrades Blue or Epic quality items. So at lvl 44 I have spent several hundred gold on my mount and some high quality weapons. Is it wrong of me to spend lavishly to make my warrior a stonger guild member/ group tank? I recently left my guild because the guild leader didnt approve of me buying lavish weapons when so many other guild members don't make as much gold and can't figure out how I do it . She made a few insulting comments calling my actions shady and even insinuating that I take guild items to make gold since she's &quot;Lvl 60 and has 300 mining and can't make as much gold as I do&quot; .... So is it wrong of me to make money to upgrade my gear to the best possible gear for my lvl... even if that gold could be funding every guild members mount.. I never asked for anything from the guild that wasnt gonna be vendored off, and I offered countless times to help with mounts and gear, if it was a large amount of gold I did ask to be repaid at the players convenience and never asked for it again. The guild leader never tried to get to know me just wanted to know how I made my money, and why I didn't give it all to other higher lvl guildies instead of buying epics.</div></div><hr />

looks like a rant to me, . A rant against your former guild leader. Well if you told the truth, seams you were right and she was wrong, and that you were right to leave them all.<br />
But still I think you should have posted in the next forum (you know, the one that begines with a R and finish with ants :D)</div></div><hr />

Taken at face-value...<br />

Your money, your business.  I would have left too.  No need to be disrespected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its probably not worth the effort to stay in blue and epic (though now that levels are a might slower to blaze though the are more justifted). <br />
<br />
If you are using your own moeny and time, then no she has no right to insuate that you are using guild drops. I think you were probably right to leave.</div></div><hr />

Where your purchase of big upgrades (maybe a little lavish, but it makes you that much stronger then warriors the same lvl) has caused a problem with a guild leader because other guild members need assistance with gear.</div></div><hr />

I haven't had a problem like that, no.  But if I did I would tell them to stick it in their ear.  As long as you're making your money ethically and aren't scamming people or anything like that, then it's none of your guild leader's business.  It might be a nice gesture to share if you were so inclinded, but if you didn't want to, that's nobody's business but your own.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to share items guild groups gain through adventuring together.  It's another to honestly earn your money through your own efforts and time investment and then be expected to share it.   It sounds to me, taking everything you've said at face value, like your guild leader is on some kind of a power trip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've basically got a group of 4 right now...smith/miner, tailor/skinner, leatherworker/skinner and alch/herbalist, and we don't have to buy shit.  That's with 4 of us.  Need leather?  No problem, we got the shit coming out our ears.  Potions?  Harass that one dude with the bank full of greater heals.  I make weapons/chains/armor for everyone, and everyone has the best bags we can make with the cloth we can find.  If you don't know 4 people, or haven't joined one of the retarded guilds in this game yet, then okay...maybe you have to occasionally buy a stack of leather or a potion or some shit.<br />
<br />
The green drops I see in the world are 99% of the time, absolute shit compared to what I'm wearing.  I honestly have no idea why anyone actually pays fucking money for this crap.  Every single piece of my gear is either tradeskilled, quest reward, or instance dropped, and I'm wearing FAR better shit than the AH whores I see running around (they're easy to spot too...they're the ones wearing XXXX of the Random Animal in EVERY single spot).<br />
<br />
I guess I don't understand, how if you play the game the way it's meant to be played, and maybe do an instance once in awhile, you need to buy any gear from anyone else.  Congrats on exploiting the system I guess...if everyone were smarter, I doubt anyone would use the Auctionhouse for anything other than tradeskill components when they're feeling lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once this is realized, why your guildleader got annoyed with you is no longer really any big surprise.  If you were relatively quiet and didn't advertise, then you would have a point; but since i'm sure you let everyone in /gu know that you got your second flurry axe, I really can't feel very sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

Boy has a good point.  No one apperciates a braggart.  And no one apperciates having their nose rubbed in the fact that their gear might not be as good.  So if that's what you were doing, the issue wasn't that you were making money and buying better gear.  The issue was you were being a jerk about it.</div></div><hr />

Seems like a double standard. I don't have to brag about what I have in guild chat... any random player runs by and says it all for me... Thats what started the Guild leader on my case in the first place. Guildmate says &quot;Yea Blood's 1337 he owns two flurries and such and such&quot; As far as my two Flurry posts I wasn't braggin I was trying to get advice on what the best implementation of Fast hitting axes was for a warrior and whether my talent build was making the best use of them. I've seen hundreds of posts on TSW about people excited they got DBoTW or BoW and wanting to share it with other Warriors how was this so different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
*shrug* Much of it depends on the presentation.  And it's one thing to show off something once in a great while.  It's another if you make it a habit.  I don't know what you did, but if you're consistantly wanting people to be aware of your &quot;uber&quot; gear, then that could have been the issue.  If you weren't doing that then the point is moot.</div></div><hr />

Well I think Warrior actually needs more than 2 stats (even though agility isn't as important) whereas a lot of classes need exactly 2 stats so a whatever of the animal is actually the best gear for these classes.  Generally speaking I've found tradeskill items to be comparable to your whatever of the animal and it has an added bonus of most pieces actually having stats that make sense as opposed to hoping your combination of animal shows up at the AH.  <br />
<br />
Of course a blue drop in an instance will be better, but instances can be annoying to do if you don't have a regular group, and then there's just the good old random number generator.<br />
<br />
I don't use the AH much, but whenever I drop by I do check out if anything interesting is up.  Of course they tend to be horribly overpriced and I don't know what can compel people to stay there for 2 or whatever hours to try to win an auction.</div></div><hr />

That's what I'm saying.  Normal people might be wearing 1 or 2 green drops that they got in the normal course of XP (uhhh, something like Tigerbane comes to mind), but overall, green drops come off mobs 5 levels higher than the recommended level.  I just can't see anyone willing to pay 5g or more for an item that they're probably going to get in a couple levels anyway.  That just doesn't make sense outright.</div></div><hr />

Past about 45, I've been using the hell out of the AH for armor upgrades.  Granted, I don't spend more than about 2-5g a piece, and can usually get the piece for the low bid.  Usually it's minor stuff, but adds up overal.</div></div><hr />

Donno where exactly in the game you're at, but once you get to the 50s you upgrade your gear much less often, and many of your upgrades end up being of the ~20ac, 1sta type from greens.  Especially when the 'good' drops of the instance bosses becomes more rare .  At this point it does come worth it to shop for greens, especially since there's certain slots that are rather difficult to find good items for (plate bracer, silk gloves, plate pants, bp).  <br />
<br />
Obviously this problem is lessened when set eq comes into play, but it's not like you're going to kill Baron while wearing Chausess of Westfall -- since princess decided to drop 500thousand daggers instead of plate pants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see even level 60's all the time wearing shit inferior to that.  Way less AC, and a little less stamina. Maybe a couple more strength points.<br />
<br />
Only piece I can really complain about right now is my bracer, which is only 116 ac, but it'll come with time.  Every time I've checked the AH for shit my level, none of the stuff is even worth the time to upgrade, especially not for the prices that day traders like Kermit up here are charging.</div></div><hr />
