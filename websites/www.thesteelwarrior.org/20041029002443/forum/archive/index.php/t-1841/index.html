I'm the main tank for the guild. As standard, I engage mob first to build up aggro then call in the troops. Problem is that they move the mob all over the place. I realise that this will be a VERY big problem in the future when we have AE mobs and have to keep the casters out of range and using ER3 items to hit the mob.<br />
<br />
I have the standard more left, more back, more front more right commands hotkeyed to spam raidchannel. Problem is everyone shifts that way then mobs is still getting moved around.<br />
<br />
How do you handle this? I've got a few guys that get the concept, but dammit there's just a few dumb brutes out there that consistently can't handle that idea.<br />
<br />
Do I assign ppl that move?<br />
<br />
Then there's the ppl that jump in front of you, blocking your line of sight, and eventually you can't hit the mob due to the rat pack surrounding him.<br />

very...very...very...frustrating</div></div><hr />

You need to make it very clear to people that the mob needs to be surrounded so that it doesn't get pushed into casters, too far out of camp, up trees/walls etc. Try things like &quot;a few go to the right&quot;. If too many go, say &quot;too many&quot; etc. It does take other people a little practice to learn how many chars on one side is too many.<br />
<br />
If too many people are behind the mob, after it gets pushed a certain distance you can switch sides with all the people behind it and push it back the other way... when it goes back too far, switch sides again, etc. We call this walk tanking.<br />
<br />
People really need to cooperate on raids. If you're explaining what to do and everything over raidchat and some people still aren't getting it, start calling out offenders by name over raid channel or send them tells and tell them what they're doing wrong.  <br />
<br />
Make it a very strong point that absolutely nobody steps in front of the MT either. Call out people who do this immediately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is no way to keep a mob stationary if you have 2 or more people attacking. Sure, in theory you COULD keep a mob very near a single points, but the chances of that are slim. No matter what you tell your guild, you will always have idiots attacking on the front side, pets pushing from the wrong direction, and casters who don't understand how to control the direction their spells push.<br />
<br />
Pick any 10 uber guild web sites and look for corpse shots of mobs that do not have a handy corner. You'll find 9/10 mobs on top of pillars, walls, fire pots, trees, or just about any other game geometry you can think of. I think every guild has a running joke about their l33t mob positioning abilities. I know my guild has 250 skill in getting a mob to a retarded place.<br />
<br />
Pet swarms are also uber positioning tools. Nothing like 60 mini pets pushing the mob all over the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It takes alot of bitching and complaining to get a mob to basically stay put.  The real secret is all or your melee have to pay attention and when they notice a mob moving in one way, some of them move opposite to push him back.  So really it's just a matter of every melee in your guild paying attention to mob positioning.  Now we all know what the odds of this are (kewl, this one will take a while to do, I'm gonna hit auto-attack and go take a piss, and grab another beer).  However, when at least a majority of people are paying attention you will find that movement will decrease to acceptable levels.  Also, a lack of knockback procs and weapons will help this cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i let my guild know that kick bash is only for positioning =D and i have some private paladins who stun push the mobs back into place when it gets too far. This happens a lot with CoD pets and just plain pets. Deducting points works also as an incentive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valhalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pet casters are always a big problem here. They need to remember that the pets cause the push too and reposition. Its a team job and people need to notice when the push is happening and adjust. <br />
<br />
Just keep drilling it in to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make a macro for MELEE SWITCH<br />
<br />
This works real well for keeping the mob somewhat in the same spot.  Good practice is in a tunnel area like HoT.  Engage the mob and call in troops behind it.  They will push the mob toward you and you should keep backing up.  Try to stay in the center of the hallway.<br />
<br />
Once youre a lil bit down, call the switch and all melee should go on the other side of the mob.  That wil push it back the other way.  <br />
<br />
If its against a wall, just tell em to push off the wall.  Once its inthe center, tell them to even up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This problem got so badly on my nerves I wrote a post for our guild tactics forum. Its been stickied ever since, hope it of use to you:-<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
This is not a rant. It is a 'How to' guide on mob positioning and aggro management. Newer members with less raiding experience may not be aware of some of the points raised here, I urge them to read and digest what I have written. There may also be some points raised that even our more experienced members were not aware of. Similarly if you can see I have missed something or made an error, please let me know and I will add/amend where appropriate. <br />
<br />
<br />
We seem to be having some problems with these areas at the moment, and since as we progress through PoP they will become more and more important I thought it was time we broke it down and worked out exactly what everyone's responsibility in these 2 areas is. As a Main Tank, I get to experience the problems with these two areas every day, and they are the 2 things that give me the biggest headaches and cause me to rant in raid channel. We must start improving our raid discipline or we will face severe problems later on. This article relates to boss mob encounters, not exp groups or trash clearing although there are area of discipline that cross over. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Mob Positioning <br />
<br />
What are the types of positioning required? <br />
<br />
i) Pin/Cornering - Vindi style fight. Everyone on the mobs back, MT in the corner. You can disregard everything said below if we are cornering as positioning is fixed. <br />
<br />
ii) Wall pin - Aaryonar style fight. Mob body is in the wall, head sticking outwards. Melee balance on either side to pin it in place. Positioning very important, melee must be constantly aware of mob drift. <br />
<br />
iii) Wall Walk - Dagarn style fight. Everyone on the mobs back and sides. MT walks the mob up and down a wall, calling swithces. Positioning not too important here, although all melee directly on the mobs back means more switches, which means a reduction in dps. Attacking from the back left/right quarter allows you to still avoid the mobs defensive skills whilst helping to reduce the speed of push. <br />
<br />
iv) Standard Walk - Eashen style fight. Everyone on the mobs back. Positioning quite important to avoid lateral drift. Melee must spread evenly across the mobs back, allowing the MT to walk in a straight line back and forth calling switches when needed. If you see the mob drifting laterally, attack off, reposition yourself to counter, carry on. <br />
<br />
v) Circle Walk - BoT Fire Tower style fight. Everyone on the mobs back. MT will spin/walk in a circle, positioning fairly important to avoid drift into walls or caster area. Pets especially need to be managed carefully. <br />
<br />
vi) Mob in place, non-rooted - Auliffe/Cursed style fight. Mob must be kept static. positioning is VITAL in these fights. Melee and pets must constantly reposition themselves to ensure the mob is not drifting. MT can reposition slightly but generally this tactic is used where space is at a premium and drift cannot be allowed to happen. <br />
<br />
Why is mob positioning important? <br />
<br />
i) To avoid harmful AE <br />
ii) To allow line of sight damage dealers to do their job (Mage, Ranger) <br />
iii) To allow rogues to Backstab <br />
iv) To keep main tank/raid in range of healing classes and nukers. <br />
v) To allow melee to maximise their dps. <br />
vi) To prevent corpse being unreachable to loot <br />
<br />
What are the limits on a MT's ability to control positioning? <br />
<br />
Your MT can control the direction the mob faces, thats all. He has no control over lateral push(strafe), speed of vertical push and to a lesser extent wheeling of the mob (ie where it seems to be pushed around in a circle). Also his level of aggro limits the amount of re-positioning he can do by summon/back up or straight moving. <br />
<br />
What factors effect mob position? <br />
<br />
i) Pets - Pet push is one of the biggest factors in positioning. In order from most push to least my experience shows that pets push in this order - Beastlord, Mage, Shaman, Necro, Enc Charmed pet. Others do not do enough damage to warrant mentioning. It is the pet caster's responsibility to ensure their pet is providing a balanced push on the mob. Be proactive about this, if you can see a mob drifting and your pet is contributing to that drift then back it off and move it to counter the push. Ideally before the fight starts, pets should be positioned evenly around the mob to minimize their push. The only exception to this is where we pin (or corner) a mob, in which case stick em all on its back. On a mob where we do not corner it NEVER EVER USE YOUR SWARM PETS. Seriously, the dps increase from it is not worth the insane push these pets can generate. <br />
<br />
ii) Melee - Melee damage contributes to mob push. It does it in a couple of ways - straight melee and special attacks. Straight melee weapons push in this order, most to least push - Blunt, Slashing Piercing. Blunt weapons can push a lot. Piercing weapons hardly push at all. Special attacks such as kick, bash, slam and monk flying kick all push more than normal melee. This can be used to your advantage in 'counter-push' situations. It is melee's responsibility to balance themselves around the mob they are attacking. Do not all stand in a clump, arrange yourselves so push is spread as evenly as possible. This will help prevent wheeling and lateral drift. MAX MELEE RANGE. There is a reason this gets screamed every raid. The further away from the mob you are, the less effect your melee has on push. It also helps with aggro management but I will discuss that later on. Finally max melee range will allow you to avoid some AE effects that you would otherwise catch, and if(when) we get to the elemental planes there are mobs who AE RAMPAGE for quad 2-3k damage. You need to be at max melee range to avoid it, so now is a good time to start practising. <br />
<br />
iii) Spells - Direct Damage and stun spells probably contribute the least to mob push due to virtually all bosses being immune to stun. However, spells with a knockback component can still move a mob. Again, try to not bunch up and all cast along the same axis, as this will just push the mob along faster. <br />
<br />
What do I do when positioning starts to break down? <br />
<br />
STOP ATTACKING <br />
BACK PETS OFF <br />
<br />
These 2 things should be done immediately it becomes apparent mob positioning has broken down. This will give your MT a chance to re-align himself. Now get back into position and start attacking again on the MTs call, arranged logically to push the mob in the desired direction using the suggestions raised above. <br />
<br />
Listen to your MT. He is controlling the direction of the fight, if he needs melee to move then do it. If he needs pets moving then do it. If he asks you to stop attacking then for gods sake DO IT. We dont shout and scream for our own amusement, it is to ensure mob slaying goes as smoothly and efficiently as possibl <br />
<br />
If in this situation you have aggro, try to move as close to the MT's position as you can. <br />
<br />
Can I help 'counter-push'? <br />
<br />
Be aware during fights. Experienced players will know roughly where a mob should be positioned during that fight. If you can see it start to drift then by all means move to counter it. On cursed for example, melee are constantly moving to balance the mob in an area roughly 5 foot square. The same tactic we use there will work on a larger scale if you think intelligently about the direction the mob is moving, and what you can do to counter this. <br />
<br />
2) Aggro Management <br />
<br />
What is aggro management, and why do i need it? <br />
<br />
Aggro management is the process by which you ensure aggro remains on the main tank, and away from you. It is necessary in raid situations to allow the healing power to focus on 1 person, and keep the mob pointing in 1 direction. This allows the rest of the raid to do maximum dps with the minimum of risk. <br />
<br />
Warriors generally tank boss mobs due to 1 discipline, defensive. This allows us to cut melee damage taken to as much as half, but has the side effect of reducing our own damage output by 35%. This makes us increasingly reliant on procs for aggro, and also the 'hit and hope' taunt button. Additionally some warriors will have the area taunt skill which has a side effect of being a 100% successful taunt button. Unfortunately it is on a 15 minute timer, so normally is not available more than once a fight. <br />
<br />
These are the limits imposed on warriors, it is your job to work within the confines of them. If the warrior loses aggro once its established, its not his fault, its yours. <br />
<br />
How do I manage my aggro? <br />
<br />
All - <br />
<br />
WAIT FOR ASSIST. The main tank waits to call assist for a reason. It is to give the debuffers time to debuff, heal chain to settle and to ensure he has sufficient aggro to keep the mob on him for as long as possible. I dont care if you have a method for reducing your aggro, there is absolutely NO excuse for attacking a mob before the MT calls assist. You arent helping him, and potentially you will screw his aggro generation up. <br />
<br />
Do NOT sit on inc, or for the first few seconds of the fight. You are asking to get splattered. <br />
<br />
Keep above frenzy HP levels. Nothing a warrior can do including AE taunt will override frenzy aggro due to low HP. It is your responsibility to get out of AE range, get a heal, or both. <br />
<br />
On a tank switch - STOP ATTACK, CALL PETS OFF. Let the new tank regain aggro, he will call assist again when ready. Treat a tank switch as effectively the start of a new fight and you shouldnt go wrong. <br />
<br />
Melee - <br />
<br />
Cycle attacks. Your dps will massively overhaul the main tanks via pure melee. Just turning attack off for 1 round every 15 seconds or so will help him. <br />
<br />
Put your aggro proc weapons away. Any weapon proccing slow, root, stun, knockback, rune or pure aggro should be bagged or at the very least off-handed. <br />
<br />
MAX MELEE RANGE. A lot of mobs aggro is based at least partially on proximity. The further you are away from the mob, the less chance you have of getting unwanted aggro. <br />
<br />
Use your aggro reducing skills. Monks and SKs should FD, it has a fixed aggro reducing component (go to monkly-business and check if you dont believe me). Rogues evade, rangers jolt if it can stick. <br />
<br />
Hybrids, dont use aggro spells such as stun, snare, slow, ranger imbues with stun component. There is 1 situation this is acceptable and thats where you are the puller. In that case, go to town and transfer the aggro to warrior via AE taunt. <br />
<br />
Casters - <br />
<br />
Time your nukes/dots. Dont start chain casting your biggest DD from the word go. Start slow, and build it up towards the end. There is no way any Damage caster should be getting aggro from a warrior on a raid. <br />
<br />
Use your aggro reducers. Boggle, Concussion, Spell casting Subtlety, the tash aggro reducing thing from PoI. All are gonna help. <br />
<br />
<br />
If we can all start to use a bit of common sense and discipline, raid targets will be a lot easier to handle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Not so great on mobs with 100 range targetted AE's when yer clerics are using ER items to stay out of it=P Thank Jebus for corners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The way we do in in my guild is:<br />
<br />
-Easy named's/Regular mobs:MT alone in front, rogues in back rest spraid on the sides<br />
Mobs dont move much that way.<br />
<br />
-Long hard named's everone in the back and MT walks back then calls the turn and everyone turns around and push mob back the other way.<br />
<br />
Another good way to help MT keep mob relatively stedy is to put the pets in front of mob with MT. They sure might die and do less dmg but they push a lot too so mob will stay more in one spot.<br />
<br />
It all depends on the situation though. Cornering the mob is probably the best way to tank it. But yet again you cannot corner them all, sadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sometimes you have to keep the mob in the center of the room, when the room itself is pretty small.  Good example is Chardok fighting into the Royals.<br />
<br />
If you get em close to the walls and if there something near that wall, they tend to jump on up to the ceiling.  So you have to fight them away from the walls and there's no way to corner them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm with Wandor and Grimmlook on this one.  I hate to hear a MT screaming at the raid because they are not pushing right, because in my experience, there has rarely been a mob that was &quot;pushed right&quot; in the history of everquest.  Make sure everybody knows where you want the mob, say something if it's going the wrong direction and hope most of your people are paying attention, try to herd it around any way you can as the MT, and if all of that fails, usually the GMs will summon that dead dragon off of that 75 foot high towel rack in ToV for you if that's where he ends up.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, I have seen only one mob in PoP perfectly balanced, never moved after we engaged... well sorta.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule, We engaged.. ONLY 3 warriors, kept her perfectly balanced untill she was at 50% and did her dispell, then the ranger/monk/rogue/pet/pally/sk crew joined the melee fight.. and she procedded to dance all around her Lair...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">haha we knock TT all over hell when we fight her, total miracle that mt hasnt gone oor of heals yet (although tt hits like a pansy so maybe the mt has gone oor a bunch &amp; it just never mattered hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm...thought here. Instead of having everyone moving and shifting around. Is it perhaps only have 2 or 3 ppl designated as &quot;shifters&quot;, that keep the mob in roughly the same place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">2 or 3 people isn't enough to push back an entire raid.<br />
<br />
The melees need to recognize that the mob will move the way the majority of the group is facing, and that if too many face in one direction, some need to move to the opposite side to combat the pushback. It's up to the melees to decide whether or not they should do the switching. The good ones will move immediately, the up-and-comers will follow them, and the slackers will stay on the same side. There is usually enough of each to make it work.<br />
<br />
Casters also need to know that mobs get pushed the way the caster is facing. It does not matter where the caster is, it matters which way they are looking. If a mob is about to hit a wall, the casters can all look away from the wall and cast, that will knock the mob away from the wall because that is the way the caster is looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bollix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">dance:<br />
sk on the right<br />
rangers pallys on the left<br />
rogues at the back.<br />
<br />
any variation of this can help.  it helps to spread people out to reduce movement.  you can then, as MA, call for a few extra people to move around a bit more.<br />
with attention by your mellees, it does work.  we have kept mobs posititioning in the middle of rooms with dance calling techniques.  only problem is, it requires alot of micro managing by your dance leader / MA<br />
<br />
the zone geomety thing is a real pain.  as troll double shrunk, i haven't been able to corner aow in a long time.  last time i even went illusion elf.  next time, will try illussion gnome and see if that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Different mobs have different things you can do with them. You'd be surprised at how little it takes to corner a mob for instance, you don't really need a corner at all, and you don't have to be in the corner necessarily. Dagarn for instance I always locked in one spot very easily. Any situation that has the mob locked on a wall will make it really easy for most folks and keep your rangers from doing nearly as much DPS as they otherwise could.<br />
<br />
For mobs that you can't pin/corner, it really varies. Burrower Beast I just walk around and let people move with me. The clerics all know to do this. Sontalak was always a tough one because of the frontal dispell, and the fact that it's outdoors so you can't pin him.  I died a lot on him until the clerics realized that they need to move up with the fight pretty agressively there.<br />
<br />
Terris is an easy one, you can circle walk her in a very tight circle with no problem. The melee in my guild are all trained to get on the back of the mob. If I move the back, they move with it. So all I have to do to get the mob where I want it is to face my back that way. If I want to keep it in one place roughly I just keep spiralling. Pets are the real problem, the pets won't adjust with the rest of the melee. You just have to make sure they understand that their push is really important to the success of the raid. Also keep in mind that pets push WAY more than players. Like 10x more.<br />
<br />
We haven't done Cursed yet, I'm not looking forward to that if you really have to keep the mob in one spot. I agree with everyone else, you just can't do that. You can keep it in a nice averaged out center point, but you can't lock a mob on that center point without a piece of geometry helping you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mightyberge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am MA for my guild and i find what works good is several things. first i have a hotkey that basically say something to the effect of <br />
<br />
/rs MAX MELEE <br />
/rs surround the mob. watch the pushing<br />
<br />
seems trivails but we are now in vex thal  and seems to help alot of people to remember to watch positioning.<br />
<br />
also, and this is what i do when i am tanking them is  i pick the spot, try to use a wall or corner to help with if available.  but if its a open room , like terris thule  then i just rotate the mob, if push going one way  i turn her the way i want her to go and melee and rogues have to adjust to keep at her back. now  that does open some of the toons for a riposte or two but trust me after dying once to that  they be more attentive. you can make a hotkey saying rotating the mob and that way there is no excuse since they should be adjusting as you turn it, if not you notice who pays attention and who doesnt.<br />
<br />
note, if you got a high number of rangers with EQ and AM3  try the rotating thing if argo not a issue, being in open allows more DPS from ranger=shorter fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heyas-<br />
<br />
LOTS of DD spells have knockback and/or knock up on them, and anywhere the floor is FLAT (i.e. no changes in height at all) the mobs will move around a bunch because of them.  Even arrows have a small amount of pushback when they hit.  Some zones (tov, tactics, sol ro temple, etc.) have perfectly flat floors which make pushing stuff there quite easy.  I'd also guess that different zones could have different &quot;friction&quot; modifiers, which would make mobs more (or less) pushable.<br />
<br />
All the above can be useful tho, if you know how pushback works.  Spell knockback is in the exact direction vector the caster is facing when the spell goes off, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the direction the *mob* is facing.  Unless a spell has a knock up component tho, they generally cannot move a mob up even a slight incline, but will move them down one quickly.  Having a few observant casters with moderate knockback spells memmed can do a lot to help keep things in place.  Having your casters who are nuking w/ knockback spells (chanters nowdays for instance) face in &quot;safe&quot; directions is also a big win.<br />
<br />
If there's room and I've got a good aggro lock, and there isn't a nasty AE to worry about (rampage or spell or proc), I tend to &quot;circle&quot; the mob to keep them in place.  The Melee Horde tends to push them in one direction or the other, and you can adjust your location, using the mob's aggro lock to keep it close to you, to keep it in a safe general location.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">LOTS of DD spells have knockback and/or knock up on them<br />
