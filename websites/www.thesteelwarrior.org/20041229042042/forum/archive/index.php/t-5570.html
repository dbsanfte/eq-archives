<br />
In this thread (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19192)<br />
<br />
 Basically, go here (http://eqemulator.net/search.php). Find the weapon you're curious about. In the right hand column is a field for &quot;unknown070&quot;. The number after that is the proc rate modifier. 0 is default, 2 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
 For example.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy (http://eqemulator.net/item.php?id=OTI3ODguNDAzOTgzMTU=). We all know it procs around 3 times per minute. It's unknown70 value is 55. It procs roughly 55% more than default.<br />
<br />
Furious Hammer of Zek (http://eqemulator.net/item.php?id=NzM2NjEuNTQ4MDg2NzE=). Cleric hammer from VZ(tactics). Is 530.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, there's a full list of all 38 items in game with modified rates in the SK thread. Looks 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
 Warrior-centric ones are...<br />

A couple notes...somewhere in the middle, I lost some dex somehow (not quite sure...I don't think I had any dex buffs when I started) and dropped to 271.  That'll skew the rate a little lower, but it should be within acceptable limits still.  41% haste, 12something atk, but that's not important.  The listed proc rate for the scim seems to be spot on.<br />
<br />
Also, notice the a3 proc rate.  Looks like augs aren't dependant on the rate of the weapon they're put on, but on their own independant rate.  Kinda what I thought from the beginning, but good to know for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Augs definitely proc at their own rate. My Furious Hammer gets about 12.5PPM (which supports the data in that SK thread), and my augmented Guard I proc doesn't get anywhere near that. 2PPM is likely - I've never parsed my Guard I proc - but the difference between 12.5PPM and 2 is large enough to be eyeballed.</div></div><hr />

LDoN augments should have their own value.  The original weapon proc should proc more often than the LDoN augment.  I've parsed this on my rogue and beastlord and I've also seen parses on the ranger forum.  Here's what I parsed on my rogue:<br />

305 dex unbuffed, zero buffs, 41% worn haste:<br />
39,181 seconds ( almost 11 hours )<br />

<br />
Take the BF one makes it 2.55 procs, the other makes it 3.1 procs per minute. <br />
<br />
The 530 mods would make those weapons proc 7.3 or 12.6 per minute. 12.6 seems too high to me so I reckon its 2 procs per minute + This_Mod/100.</div></div><hr />

530-mod weapons get 12.6 PPM.<br />

<br />
Logic would agree with the other couple posts about it already, http://eqemulator.net/item.php?id=MTM1MTAwLjMwMjA4MDg5 has a 070 number of 0, I did not check every aug, though. Why would they have a number of their own otherwise is the logic?<br />
<br />
However the best way would be for someone to take a Bloodfrenzy and aug it with whatever (the one above is a cheap 40pt aug from Tak) then parse it... if you are getting as many procs as the main BF proc, then you know it IS dependent on the weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, read my post on the first page. Clerics have already done this - Furious Hammer of Zek = 12.6PPM, any aug proc = 2PPM. Augmented procs are independent of a weapon's innate proc, and use the standard 2PPM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also have a Anger III augment on the sword from Maestro (15/19 with the 160dd poison proc) and from using that sword in primary it appears, no parse info to prove this, but it the naked eye that that the rage proc somehow coincides with the proc rate of the items innate effect.<br />
<br />
I have anger III on my HG/BoC and my Anathema and while there is no way to tell them apart log wise since they seem to have identical messages, the items seem to have easily doubled the twists in fury messages.<br />
<br />
Before I had anger III on my BoC, I had the ykesha proc on my BoC and I must say that Ykesha proc went off like MAD, again leading me to believe that it somehow was tied into the proc rate of the parent effect.<br />
<br />
Just speculation, If I get some free time I'll actually try to parse some things although it will be more difficult to now since the dd proc is now off of my BoC since they upped the hate on the Anger III.<br />

<br />
Yea, it is called random number generator.  EQ's RNG is designed to defeat our brains.  It is designed to make us trigger the pattern matching part and make false conclusions.<br />
<br />
Go to eqtraders, it is weekly that someone will post &quot;OMG THEY NERFED THE DROP RATE ON &lt;insert item&gt;!!!!!!!&quot;  But you will then find 10 to 20 people saying, no, I got a stack yesterday.  Just because you THINK ES procs more, doesn't mean it is so.</div></div><hr />

What it could be I guess is that the because Eartshaker is so slow it's more prone to streakiness (is that a word?).</div></div><hr />

When you're using Earthshaker, the ONLY reason is for the procs. You're waiting on every swing, hoping for a proc. With your gem axe, you aren't. You just look up and notice it's proced a few times in your chat window. Without a parse decrediting the assumption, I'll go with the extensively parsed common assumption.</div></div><hr />

Obsidian Shatter procs (surrounded by flickering flames): 1280<br />
Proc damage: 38,400<br />
Proc DPS: 1.233<br />
Procs per minute: 2.467<br />

Anger 3 Procs (contorts with rage): 942<br />

Ifir augment ...... 1167, 1.78 / min<br />
GRMK................ 660, 1.01 / min<br />
GRMK augment.... 608, 0.93 / min<br />
<br />
At the very least the aug proc rate is not the standard 2PPM as some think.  Notice the GRMK has less then 1PPM on its aug, which corresponds with the barely more then 1PPM on the weapon.<br />
<br />
But at the same time we have clerics saying thier time hammer when aug'd does not proc nearly as much.<br />
<br />
Possibly...<br />
<br />
where:<br />
WPR = Weapon Proc Rate (Assuming 305 dex) in PPM<br />
APR = Aug Proc Rate (Assuming 305 dex) in PPM<br />
<br />
APR = ( WPR *0.9 &gt; 2.5 ) : APR = 2 + (WPR * 0.1) ? WPR * 0.9<br />
<br />
I doubt its right, but it took me 2 minutes to put it together.<br />
<br />
My point is, I think that APR is a function of WPR up to a certain # of PPM, then it either becomes a static 2 PPM or 2PPM + some small % of the WPR.<br />
<br />
(gonna use VB/BASIC code for ease of understanding)<br />
SIMPLIFIED VERSION:<br />
<br />
IF ( WPR * 0.9 &gt; 2.5 ) THENAPR = 2PPM OR APR = 2PPM + some small % of the WPR ELSEAPR = WPR * 0.9END IF<br />
<br />
Now lets see if you guys can parse something to prove me wrong  :cool:   <br />
<br />
Either way its another possibility that needs to be ruled out.<br />
<br />
EDIT: What we really need is 2 good cleric time hammer parses, one with an aug, 1 w/out. The longer the better, and both must have same Dex for valid results (aka 305dex).<br />
<br />
I think its possible the clerics may be mistaken and its an avenue we need to address before making hypothesis on possibly invalid information.....sort of like what I might have just done &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

The reason it and its aug is at ~1 ppm is because it is in the off hand, which is expected. The fact that the proc rates for aug and weapon are not related (other than the fact that the weapon proc can &quot;block&quot; an aug proc) is evident from the info you quoted above on the OSoW, where the scim procs at ~2.5ppm and the aug procs at ~2ppm. Please look up in the thread at Ciae's post where it is confirmed that with an aug'ed cleric hammer, the aug still procs at the standard rate.</div></div><hr />

I did not miss the statement about the aug on the cleric hammer, if you read my post I ask for a LOG PARSE showing conclusive data.  For a long time people didn't know how this game works, and a lot of great folks here at TSW have used log parses and mathematics to discover how those things work.  I see no point in &quot;taking someone's word for it&quot;, when a parsed log file would be solid evidense.<br />
<br />
So please, if you want to tell me I am wrong prove it.  I want you to! Its something else we can rule out.  Its a step in the right direction. Just saying &quot;it seems to be normal&quot; just isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
I have been looking at raw data for augs for possible proc rates on them, but its sort of hard for me to get a log file of an aug'd cleric hammer...since i am not a cleric, nor am I time flagged.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the aug proc rates have been hashed out .. it may be a beggar to find with a simple search tho.<br />
<br />
Failing that, one of the cheap augs on a Fine Steel Somesuch should be good enough for a parse log.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the very least the aug proc rate is not the standard 2PPM as some think.  Notice the GRMK has less then 1PPM on its aug, which corresponds with the barely more then 1PPM on the weapon.<br />
<br />
Unlikely imo.  It's common knowledge that an augment will fire less often than the weapon's natural proc, as long as it's one of the numerous normal proc rate weapons, since the order is 1) natural proc 2) augment 3) imbued<br />
<br />
I don't have access to a cleric that could current parses but was quite obvious when I was guilded with a cleric that put the mirror 1 aug on the furious hammer of zek (off VZ-Tactics) that the augment has no correlation to the weapon it was on.  The weapon procced like mad while the augment stayed true to the normal proc rate.<br />
<br />
I'm with everyone that has stated augments have their own base proc rate, which doesn't quite reach the 2ppm primary / 1ppm secondary @ 305 dex, WA0, CE0, because the natural proc takes precendent, thus, reducing the augment proc rate so around 1.8ppm/0.9 ppm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you can only get 1 proc per swing on a weapon?

So whether you swing once, twice, or more in a given round, you can only proc once (round being defined as the set of swings for a single weapon each time the weapon's delay timer is up. Primary and off hands would have separate rounds). But if you've got a log that shows differently it would be great to see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're correct on that, I've never noticed it before.  I went through some logs and couldn't find one double proc on a double attack on primary in one round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Procs happen once per swing, whether the swing is due to a double attack, triple attack, duel wield success, or rampage. This has been repeatedly proven by the multitude of warriors who have done any Earthshaker+Rampage AE killing. A single round of melee will result in many actual swings and many procs on a single round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rampage is a very special case, and is independant of the weapon delay. Do you have any logs that show multiple procs ocurring in the same round for non-rampage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is rampage a special case? Weapon delay does not change the ability to proc per swing. The effective weapon delay certainly will affect the chances to proc on a particular swing, but it does not change the fact that any single swing can produce a proc.<br />
<br />
The fact that individual swings can proc is the reason that someone with max offensive AAs gets more procs/minute than someone with the same DEX and no offensive AAs. This has been hashed out many times, in particular when people claimed to have weapons with multiple procs going off on the same swing.<br />
<br />
I am sure I can easily produce a log with multiple procs in a round, it's not that uncommon of an occurance. I have seen it myself many times, and since I don't have rampage it would be safe to say that the multiple procs where not due to a rampage. I'll have to see if I still have the logs of proc rate testing. If not I'll run some 10+ hour logs tonight and get back to you.</div></div><hr />

I went through a 9 hour log on my parse mob and gave up after hitting F3  (Find Next) trying to find multiple procs on the same round - gave up after 2 hours in the log file.  I found numerous times primary and offhand firing simultaneous but not once on just a primary round or offhand round.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that on a typical 2 proc 20ish delay weapon hasted 36-41% you have a 5% likelyhood of procing on any one swing. The chances that procs will occur on back to back swings drops down to .25% so odds are not in your favor that this will ever happen. The only way to know for sure is to parse many hours of logs.</div></div><hr />

Both weapons have A3 augments on them. We know for sure that at least one of the procs come from the darkblade. The only scenario in which this log would represent procs in seperate rounds of melee would be:<br />
<br />
1. he had a bard in group playing overhaste to get the EoE delay under 1 second so that 2 rounds of attacks show up in the same second time stamp of the log<br />
2. his offhand successfully dual weilded on consecutive rounds of melee<br />
3. his offhand successfully proc'd the augment in consecutive rounds of melee<br />
4. his offhand did not double attack on either round of melee<br />
<br />
My guess is that what we are looking at is actually a successful triple attack with procs on each attack.<br />

Edit: the only real way I see it that this is separate rounds procs are still that previous and next round of the EoE somehow made it into the same timestamp, hastecapped EoE being exactly 1 second in delay.

I went through that 53 hour log by hand, because I wanted to know, I did not like what I found, but it was what I found nevertheless.<br />
<br />
Total, in the entire log, I found six (6) occurances like the one above, with 3 procs in the same timestamp.<br />
Number of occurrances with 2 procs in same timestamp were 273.<br />
<br />
Never did Anger proc twice in a round. (Nor 3 times for that matter.)<br />
Never did Time Snap proc twice in a round.<br />
All 6 occurences of 3 procs per round was Anger or Time Snap + 2x Anger3.<br />
And given no bard haste, I would contribute the 3rd proc on all cases to EoE delay of 10 exactly being squeezed into same timestamp by server delay or whatnot.<br />
<br />
The largely annoying fact lies in that had I had a piercer or blunt in offhand, maybe I could draw some conclusions from the large amount of double procs in a time stamp, but I cannot do that with two slashing.<br />
So if anyone out there has a really long parse with two different type weapons to compare with, could use some help.<br />

Looking at that, the top proc (in Orange) could not have come from you.  If it had come from you, it would have come directly before one of your swings (either a hit or a miss).  It really looks like somebody else must have procced on him (either Jobarn, which is unlikely, or someone your log didn't pick up due to filtering).<br />

Only the potential for the swing needs to exist. The upshot is, if you fail your dualwield check, you can still proc your offhand! Or at least, so I remember from when my ranger was little and was using a blunt, proccing weapon off hand, and a slashing, non-proccing weapon mainhand - I got lots of procs with no associated 'you try to crush'. I'll dig up a character with lower dw and parse it out this weekend.</div></div><hr />

I'll equip a lantern in my main hand and see if I proc with my offhand with hits and misses on. If a proc shows up and no swings were made then that will be...strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure you can proc anytime if your auto attack is turned on. I have had mobs be out of melee range, yet still get a proc in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was a much, much younger warrior I used to occasionally do run by killings on random goblins and orc pawns and such while running to dungeons.  It was not all that uncommon for one of my ssoy's to proc and the dd kill the mob before I ever swung the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His log supports it as well, now that I consider it: We have here a proc clearly detached from other sources of melee. The immediate impulse is to search for a second Anger/Enraging Blow proc. However, consider the following: <br />
<br />
1: This is an exp grind, and he is the only warrior. <br />
<br />
2: Only warriors may use Anger augments. There are only 3 EB weapons that are not warrior only - Blade of War, Blade of Carnage, and Anathema. The beastlord cannot wield any of these. Therefore, he is the only potential source of 'contorts with rage'.<br />
 <br />
3: We see that he has misses logged, thus removing this concern. <br />
<br />
Once other explanations are removed, whatever remains, no matter how absurd, must be the truth. We see a proc on a failed dual wield check. Igneous, can you please check for similiar time snap procs? <br />
<br />
At level 65 + Ambidex, this will be rare as hell -19 cases in 51 hours?- The phenomenon is probably best looked for with a warrior that just learned dualwield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daabu,<br />
I can confirm there was no one else with these types of procs but me. All procs logged are mine.<br />
<br />
Arathena,<br />
very interesting, I shall get on it when I find some time.<br />
<br />
Edit: if it's against rules to edit a libraried post, I'll remove the added conclusions below.<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
<br />
I followed Arathena's suggestion and went through the log looking for time snap procs with no associated swing, and guess what? There's tons of them, to be more precise, 388 instances. All of them looking like these:<br />

<br />
etc.<br />
The occurrences happen every few minutes apart of non stop fighting.<br />
<br />
With this newfound data I'd support that it is in fact, only possible to proc once per round, mainhand and offhand of course considered being separate.<br />
Obviously only the possibility to swing need exist, a failed dual-wield still allows offhand to proc.</div></div><hr />
