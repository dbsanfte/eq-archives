<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrathhob</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hello ppl:) ok, i'm new to this forum and to start with i give you guys a simple question to whom wishes to help:)<br />
<br />
I'm a lvl24 War, my armor is nothing great, i have 550ac+-...<br />
i dual weild a Bladecatcher Of the Marshall with a Zraxthril Forged Axe.<br />
<br />
what kind of gear you think i can easily buy or even better...which pieces of gear are decent for my lvl to quest?<br />
thks in advance<br />
<br />
edit1: i play for like 2 months so I'm still new:)<br />
<br />
edit2: btw, i don't play much so i don't have time to gain money(500pp only and i don't know good ways besides spiderling silks and goblins blood/heads) so quest items would be better:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, at level 24 I think the best thing you can do is to watch the bazaar for really inexpensive upgrades.  You can sit in the bazaar, make the maximum price for your search 100pp, and search for warrior items for your race that have AC.  THen click on the ac column to make the items with higher ac at the top...  if anything stands out to you as being an excellent buy, ask a friend.<br />
<br />
Another thing I reccomend is to make friends with a higher level warrior.  Tell them up front that you are not after powerleveling, gear or platinum from them, that you just want information.  Often he or she can make a reccomendation that you havent thought about, and friendships can go a long ways.<br />
<br />
Finally, don't expect to get that incredible item that will make or break your character for a long while.  For the most part, the really nice items have a minumum required level of 55 or higher, and a reccomended level of 60 or higher.  While there are some items that someone of your level can wear that is really incredible stuff, for the most part how good your character isnt going to be based on your gear, but rather on how well you treat people, how dedicated you are to the groups you are in, and the friends you make along the way.  Don't be afraid to make a friendship with someone you meet.<br />
<br />
Friends will take you a lot longer in this game than gear ever will, trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">like i tell a lot of people who come through here<br />
<br />
go to the bazaar, do a search per slot; and enter the max price you want to pay for an item and see what pops up. that'll weed out the mid-upper range things and believe it or not you'll find someone unloading something really nice dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
but do not deny the power of spider silks. at any level 100 silks are an easy 200 plat on most servers (if not more). tradeskill item farming is just about the most secure investment you can make. boring as hell; but it's money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dented</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I STILL tradeskill farm at level 62 when I want to raise money.  The fun thing is when you get high enough to get experience in Crystal Caverns, you can tradeskill farm and get experience for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yes, the zraxthril forged axe. Well, look into a centi short sword (12/25) or long sword (uh, I forgot the ratio) or even a Centi warhammer (15/32) for your offhand.<br />
Search by slot/race/class/deity in the bazaar as others have posted.<br />
The big thing with weapons (or armor, in fact) is not the name of it, but the stats and whether you can equip it. Well, and whether you can afford it, of course.<br />
At your budget, some potential armor lines: crafted, crustacean, and the LDoN player-made armor lines (gothic and frosted). Just make sure that on the gothic/frosted stuff you are buying a piece that fits your race (if you're large race, you need the large stuff, for example).<br />
In theory, you could quest the crafted stuff, but it really hasn't been logical to do for a level-appropriate toon for years. Sadly, questing your gear in this game takes exponentially longer than raising plat by farming and buying the gear in the bazaar. <br />
A few smiths still use LDoN armors for skill ups. Very often they make this armor in the PoK forge in the building with the dwarf smithing merchants. Sometimes they sell their successes right back to the merchants there, who will sell it to you for around 100 pp. So check that before buying in the bazaar.<br />
Look around for two opal encrusted steins, too. They raise your CHA by 25 each, and they will pay for themselves fairly quickly in better buy/sell prices from vendors that you sell your &quot;trash&quot; to.<br />
go to EQ traders, message board, smithing and tailoring, and look for tips on where to hunt for spiderling, spider, and shade silks.<br />
If you want a quick 20-100 plat, go to Everfrost via the adventure camp, and kill mammoths. Their tusks are heavy, but sell to vendors for 10 plat or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a low level warrior without a lot of money, spiderling silks are a great way to make money.  They sell for 15-20pp each on my server.<br />
<br />
As Brabble mentioned, the Centi Shortsword is a good weapon for you.  If you can come up with a grand or so, you may also want to look at picking up a Lamentation (9/19 and some stats).  The pair will easily last you up to your 40s when hopefully you can afford the droga pair.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 30 or so, take a friend (preferrably a druid for heal/snare) and head on over to Crystal Caverns.  The miners drop tradeskill velium which is a gold mine for someone trying to build their fortune.  I'm a 65 warrior and STILL farm velium when I have the time.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes, AC and HP are important at low levels.  Once you start getting to around 46+, STA becomes important as well.  Not wanting to sound like a broken record, but check the bazaar for AC and HP in your price range.<br />
<br />
Best of luck. =)</div></div><hr />
