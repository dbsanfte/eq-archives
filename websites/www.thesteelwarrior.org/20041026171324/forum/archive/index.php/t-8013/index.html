<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... please dont spread out all over the entire room!<br />
<br />
stand in front of me so i dont have chase the mob all over the place.<br />
<br />
i know a necro can fd so rarely dies to agro. but having 2 necros on opposite sides of the room chain dotting and pingponging the mob back and forth across the entire room is annoying.<br />
<br />
i think next time they do that to me im just going to grab me another mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2 necros on opposite sides of the room chain dotting and pingponging the mob back and forth  = they don't need a tank in that group (honestly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actually we tried it that way too and it worked. but they dragged the mobs all over the place so anyone who wanted to nuke them got no chances to med. we went back to tanking everything. i suppose i could have explained to them the benefits of kiting in circles but who really enjoys telling other people over and over how to play their class.<br />
<br />
incidentally this was in hoh and the reason we even tried the kiting method was because we had no slower andi thought i would waste a lot of healing manna. turned out it really wasnt bad enough to worry about. plus all those out of range messages while trying to melee the kited mobs were getting on my nerves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interestingly enough, necros can slow the undead basement mobs. And for kiting, which I also did alot in HoH, just have one necro chain snare a low level snare for aggro, then run in an oval along one wall. It works beautifully; the mobs won't really smack any casters. Anyhow, your casters should invest in a pony for medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is something humiliating about chasing a mob around, trying to hit taunt, trying to get its attention back.<br />
<br />
I've stopped doing it. I stand there where the fight should be and wait for the panic-stricken caster to train the mob back onto me.<br />
<br />
If they don't, well, maybe they'll get some def skill-ups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if only they would train it back on me. instead i run to it after i figure out where it is .. and then they jump over me. i think they are trying punish me for some past sins or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes people overaggro on accident and it's fine to chase that.  But if they keep on do it and they don't stand in the right place, I figure the caster can figure out how to deal with the mob themselves (like say, root).</div></div><hr />

I usually dont taunt mobs off repeat offenders/agro-grabbers as well. <br />
<br />
One such case was we were doing the first mini in Qvic(dvoin). It was solidly corner tanked and below half hp. I had even thrown in an extra an extra incite along the way. Then at 35% some wizard grabs agro.. <br />
<br />
Needless to say I did not taunt it back to teach him a lesson, and neither did any of the other tanks. Unfortunately our silly clerics foiled the plan by assist healing him and he ended up tanking it from 35% to 5% or so at which point he finally met his demise :D<br />
<br />
When I asked him why he didnt click his EP legs he said something along the lines of &quot;I usually dont have to&quot;.. lazy bum :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's both surprising and not surprising that so few casters know how small the &quot;range&quot; for taunt is. It's surprising because you think they'd pick up on it faster. It's not surprising because if they haven't played a melee class and no one has ever told them...and, face it, there are just as many bad warriors as any other class. My Shaman gets somewhat irritated when adds aggro him and he stands there getting beat on and none of the three tanks in the group notice until their dialog box completely fills up with my hotkey &quot;On me.&quot;<br />
Anyway, casters who run in circles can't possibly realize how much harder getting the mob back is for a warrior if the caster is running around. I say they can't possibly realize that because they otherwise wouldn't be running around.<br />
It's also annoying when, say, the necro and cleric set up very far away from each other. If the pull is very bad with lots of adds I might well have to choose which direction I run: to my cleric or to my necro. I can get a mob off the first caster I run to, but if I then have to turn around and run across country to get to the next caster, well...too late. If I were a necro, and I thought about this, I'd set up damn close to the cleric, lol.<br />
I've tried to get my casters to either stand still or in fact run right to me and stand in front of me if they get aggro (talking normal exp groups). Generally they see the point once you explain the range of taunt and how /shield works.<br />
Seriously, the percentage of casters who do not realize that I can cut the melee damage they take by half if they simply get close to me is very high.</div></div><hr />

Yea, I got Jolt or Cinder Jolt up all the time. Fuck tanking, I'm not made for it yet, maybe after some AAs.</div></div><hr />

Qvic is a poor zone to get punished for aggro since there's no named that hits more than 2000.  But wait until you get to Txevu, then you'll see some pretty fast deaths for overaggroing.  Speaking of Mshas, one time I knew there was a caster who had more aggro than I did but I had aggro due to proximity, so I just backed out of melee range and then the caster got summoned and died.  There's a lot of cool things you can do to lose aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Foof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">its the worst when casters nuke on inc and then complain about your lowsy agor =P</div></div><hr />
