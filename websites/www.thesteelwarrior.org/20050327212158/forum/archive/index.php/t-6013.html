<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dreamblade111</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am asking for a discussion on the pros and cons of this practice.<br />
<br />
I have personally found that I spend at least a few seconds of every raid beating on a charmed pet for no dmg. Either I miss the call %T is my pet,It's not called at all, or in the confusion of targeting involving multiple mobs there is no way to determine which mob is a pet and which an angry creature looking to eat my cleric. <br />
 Maybe the issue is how I target mobs... Ok help in that area would be appreciated. As a 2nd or 3rd tank (usually) it is frequently my job to determine offtanking duties and respond in a timely manner. Once inc is called and target is acquired I hit atk/taunt/incite etc. Over and over again I find myself in the position of a few rounds of dmg on mob X and suddenly I am doing no more dmg and the mob taking off to atk something else.  At that point there are several things to decide. Is my isp/computer/eq causing the  problem? No all looks good there. Does this mob have a rune? No I hit it to start with. Hmmm page back up in the spam and find the mssg that caster X has made one of the mobs a pet. Ok find new target and continue on.<br />
 My question is this. Is the extra dps of a pet worth the hassle?<br />
 Is it just me or do others have these types of problems? Crowd control is another reason they give me for the use.  Maybe we didn't field enough tanks for the encounter to mez tank em but if one of the available tanks is wasting time beating on the pet for no dmg doesn't that negate the whole point of ridding the raid of one attacking creature?<br />
 I don't wish to debate the value of a charmed mob here. They have their uses. but I would like some feedback on how others deal with them  in all the confusion/spam of a raid. I do know about multiple chat windows but I am not sure if/how that can be of real help. Unfortunately that would depend on the charmer calling his pet in a specific channel and I am not in the position within my guild to make that a requirement. Open to suggestions from all.</div></div><hr />

yes.... depending on the person doing the charming, the charmed mob, and the encounter.   Usually charm is the best dps in the game.<br />
<br />
edit: shrinking the charmed pet helps a ton in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get em to NDT their pets. It works well!<br />
<br />
Now if only the necro WTD pets ... /grumble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you know your chanters are charming pets, learn what type of mobs are charmable and when you pick up your next target if it is a charmable mob consider it before you attack.<br />
<br />
Personally if Im the assist for a raid I pickup my targets with F8 anyway which wont let you pick up a pet, but considering the mob is still the quickest way to see if its charmed.  NDT makes it much easier ofcourse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what these guys said. back when i raided a lot our chantys were a tight crew and we never had a targetting problem or anything of the likes. chantys are a wierd bunch; let them be and they won't get all charismatic and stuff :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love this idea! I hate clearing trash and always having one that I waste my time on. When your pulling 8-12 mobs at a time to speed things up the charmed pet gets lost in the confusion. I've burned endurance on them more than once for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heed these words.  Pets won't show up if you hit your F8 key, charmed pets included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild chanters used NDT on their pets yesterday for Grummus and it helped alot. Since there were so many undead we had a necro charming also. It really made a noticable difference coupled with the F8 tip, thanks Eriatha Egan. Now we just need to refine the tactics of keeping the pets under control upon charm breaking. They had them snared and tashed, but a couple got away from them and caused some deaths within the raid.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any tips for keeping them inline more reliably?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charmed pets are always going carry some risk, its the trade off for getting a pet that can out damage your average 6 man XP group.<br />
<br />
Maybe set a requirement that anyone wanting to use a charmed pet (non-DC) has the Total Domination 3 AA, heap on the debuffs before charming - Snare, Malo, Tash.  If you don't trust your charmers ask them not to haste their pets as it increases your survivability for when they do get loose, though you lose some of the benefit of having that pet.<br />
<br />
This is probably a question better asked on an enchanter board though because I don't think its a warrior's place to dicate to a chanter how to do their job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it is everyone in the raid's responsiblity to share information that they have. <br />
<br />
If done in a positive manner it helps all those involved. I don't so much want to dictate what the charmers are doing, but rather know what my job is when they are doing it. The potential damage is well-worth the learning curve in my book.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dreamblade111</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all who answered and for moving it to the correct forum. I wasn't sure which place to post it and figured those who know better would fix it. As to the original post targeting with f8 is problematical for me but I am working on it. In some cases it seems to make picking a different target from the ma on raids with multiple pulls even more difficult. On the other hand we have been doing the burrower beast in the deep some lately and to pick up and engage targets when we know we are getting a lot is great practice. As to changing the way the pets look that was a great idea and we are working on pets as an issue in general in the guild so that suggestion will work well. <br />
 I asked the question on the warrior boards instead of chanter boards for a purpose however. I wished to know how other warriors are dealing with it. I did not wish to start flame war from all the chantys who can't see life without charming something. Our guild is enchanter light atm and since we have plenty of dps it was my opinion that their talents would be better used in raids doing the other things that enchanters do. It has always seemed to me personally that if we need the added dps of a charmed pet on a raid to win then we are also adding the additional chance to lose because of the added risk. Anyways thanks again guys for the discussion... as usual on these boards I learned something useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it all depends on what encounter you're doing.  We rarely use charm except on a couple of events (RZ in particular), but when we do use charm, it's worth it.  It's risk vs. reward...sometimes that extra dps is what you need to win it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Rogue (ya know, a primary dps class) I smack my charmers silly if they don't charm on a number of encounters.  Indeed, if it is a totally trivial encounter we would pass on the risk but for so many of them the charmed pets make me look like I am wielding a rusty spoon and it would be silly not to use the extra damage.<br />
<br />
I've always said that healing, CC and tanking are the cores of any fight but I'll never pass up a massive dps boost when it is available.  Props again to LoS/SoS on that first AoW kill ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some tips for targeting mobs other then MA's:<br />
- set up /assist MA key, hit it on incoming, will see what target the MA has, and can change to another.<br />
- Talk to MA, see how he selects mob, he takes first to camp? He takes target from puller? <br />
- Some camps where you are clearing fast, set a left and right rule.  Every time 2 mobs come into camp, MA will take left, SA right.<br />
<br />
Tips for dealing with charming chanters (I don't cover everything, let them deal with mezing, I just want to have some control over mob selection as MA).<br />
- Have them call charm (nothing worst then hitting mob for 2-3 seconds then gets charmed).<br />
- If / When charm breaks, DON'T ATTACK THERE PET.  Can Incite, or taunt / area taunt to help, but don't do any damage.<br />
- Con mob if you are not sure if a pet (pets will be indifferent).<br />
<br />
Charmed pets can be worth the added DPS for some encounters, but might pass on some encounters that you can win easily, don't want to loose from a pet getting loose after killing it's owner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antii</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a cleric, I've somehow picked up the duty of stunning the charmed pets when they break.  I know a lot of people use paladins, but whichever class/person you designate as the stunner, make sure they're on the ball--there's nothing worse than having a pet break and having the enchanter die so you've got a hasted angry mob to deal with as well as whatever named you're on (especially bad in GoD zones &gt;&lt;)</div></div><hr />
