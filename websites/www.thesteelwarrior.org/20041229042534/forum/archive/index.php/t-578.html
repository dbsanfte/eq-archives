My guild is Vindi level , so high level no drop weapons are out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see any reason to go for Narandi's Lance.<br />
<br />
1) Useless for DPS , you have a windblade<br />
2) Useless for MA/MTing, you said you want a non MA/MT weapon.<br />
<br />
Had one ages ago, agro wasnt that impressive. Mediocre at best.<br />
Stay away from it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh only problem with Windblade is wife's characters keep stealing it, don't wanna buy another one lol<br />
If exclude Windblade how does it stck up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">44/45 8str 8sta 30hp  DoT 432-666<br />
DoT wont be huge agro, DPS will be good (1.00 is a good ratio)<br />
25-40 /tick is nothing to laught at if you proc early.<br />
<br />
The thing is i have an absolute phobia of DoT weapons.<br />
No mez, No memblur, Nothing. Really really hate it.<br />
<br />
If you have one, keep it, not worth the trouble of changing it.<br />
(Do look for a good deal, just dont be sad if you dont find one)<br />
<br />
NLance will serve you faithfully until you can find something better.<br />
(Just dont expect head turning agro, watch it with the DoT).<br />
<br />
If you want to buy a 2H, try looking for a faster PoP 2Hander.<br />
30/30  35/35  31/28 (no clue on names or stats).<br />
Will probably do a bit more dps, with more/less agro (and no DoT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your prolly still better off with one of the cazic 2 handers<br />
<br />
Lance is peircing for one (less of a skill cap) so you wont be doing max DPS with it, from the attack penalty you take on it.<br />
<br />
anything with a decent ratio.  Stone Bladed axe, Reaver, Tae Ew war maul, hell, even an Argent Protector i would think would be a better weapon for a warrior than Narandi's Lance.  Leave the lance to the hybrids to fight over.  Least, thats my 2cp anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Narandi's. Never meant to buy it but just won it in the ring war so started using it. Served me really well so I never had a reason to splash out 60k on the windblade. DPS is decent and i have never had a problem with  maintaining aggro with it in exp groups or raids.<br />
<br />
It also procs the most out of any proccing weapon ive ever had. LIke 4-6 times a fight easy. I wouldnt say the dot gets any big aggro though, not like a snare or slow proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azeroke</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a narandi's lance almost exclusively up until last week when I picked up a Greatstaff of Thunder.<br />
<br />
The lance served me well for a long time (since 55). Worked very well in Tier1 pop, okay in Tier2, other areas was great aggro wise. MT'd ToV a few times a while ago (and my guild was relatively sloppy at the time so holding aggro was an accomplishment hehe)<br />
<br />
Heck I even had a windblade when they had first come out and played with both, found the lance to hold aggro better for whatever reason. Key word is hold, the lance seemed to work really well over the time of the fight, whereas the windblade would bounce aggro around for me it seemed but got initial aggro a little better.<br />
<br />
::shrug::<br />
<br />
I liked my lance, cant talk bad about it at all. Only semi-bad thing was if you had to change targets and you proc'd early on another mob, which then cant be mez'd. This didnt happen to often for me though. And yes it procs quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I have a Narandi's lance.<br />
<br />
I bring it out now and then.  The boil blood proc is good aggro and procs 6-8 times in a fight but this is very important.  That is with 280 dex which I can produce myself with an avatar weapon just before bringing out the Lance.<br />
<br />
Without that dex seen it only proc about 2 times in an entire battle so if you have a windblade and low dex just use it and keep the lance at home.  If you have high dex then sure use the lance as an aggro type weapon but MAKE SURE YOU ALSO HAVE THE AA OFFENSIVE SKILLS THAT HELP 2H WEAPONS TO BACK IT UP.  Better yet make sure you have those same skills if you have decided to go 2h as your choice of weapon most of the time.<br />
<br />
If I had my way would rather use a weapon that was high in dam and low in delay like 35/23 with a proc rather than the lance but until I get one I still keep the lance around.<br />
<br />
I do have one pet peeve though and have reported it as a bug. &quot;The Narandi's Lance and the Primal (Avatar) Lance from ST have the exact same graphics unless I am missing something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing you might wont to consider is a Wideblade Great Sword.  They can be picked up pretty cheep (arround 5k on Prexus) and have some very nice stats.<br />
<br />
Widebladed Greatsword   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Damage: 35<br />

I use one and like it.  I am thinking about upgrading to a Windblade but they are selling for 40k or more on Prexus right now.<br />
<br />
Any advice on upgrading?   Seems like an awfull lot to spend for a slightly higher dam/del.</div></div><hr />

It is no drop on normal servers, but is frequently left to rot, due to being rather common. I suggest finding someone raiding this and asking to help and loot.<br />

<br />
For the same price you get a weapon that is a LOT better.<br />
But no resale options :)</div></div><hr />
