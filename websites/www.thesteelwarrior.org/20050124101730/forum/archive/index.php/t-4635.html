<br />
I won a Dragontib Club in NTOV.  It is 12/17, but has +1 Magic Fire damage.<br />
<br />
When is the +1 fire damage active?  I was thinking every mob and it hits if the mobs FR is low enough, but others have told me a mob has to be coded to get that damage.<br />
<br />
TIA for clearing this up and reseeding my grey matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you're right. as long as it's not &quot;bane&quot; damage, the + damage only checks against resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">+ damage also counts a real weapon damage. makeing it 13/17 if the mob fails its resist. +damage will not hit mobs the require bane weapons though.<br />
<br />
most of the time unless lb or green expect them to resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At a guesstimation, you could consider the weapon to be approximately 12.5/17 vs. mobs that aren't particularly resistant to fire.  I remember lots did parses with that longsword of ethereal energy (which has +5 magic damage) and it worked out so it averaged adding about 1.5 to the base damage of the weapon (assuming mobs that aren't particularly MR).</div></div><hr />

He tells me it hits harder in Solro and PoFire (on Fire imune mobs)<br />
This leads us to believe that elemental damage does in fact work the same as Bane.  Of course this goes against conventional thinking, and even common sense, but this is SOE we're talking about.  Anyone care to test this out with different types of elemental damage weapons and find out exactly how they work once and for all?  Perhaps this was just a bug, or perhaps everyone just assumed they knew how they worked w/o any real testing.</div></div><hr />

PARSE!  <br />
<br />
This has been tested many many times. The way you suggest makes no sense whatsoever and of course this would have already been discovered in the two years that elemental weapons have been around :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eradani</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you dont need a parse to tell you when your max hit has changed,  but I'll see if he has the time to provide that for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not really max damage that you're looking for, but overall DPS. Sometimes my blasphemous blade of the exiled proc would land on EXTREMELY MR mobs like Brother Qwinn in SK and several others that you really couldn't land much of anything magic based on. So hypothetically, even if the mobs in SRT are fire resistant, there's the possibility that the fire damage could still land a very small percentage of the time. And by the way, EQ Companion, one of the more popular parsers out there, keeps track of max hits and how often you get them. So yes, a parser would still present that piece of information in an easier to analyze fashion :D. I guess the best thing to do is compare how often you get a max hit on SRT mobs and other mobs like in say PoWater or maybe Everfrost adventures or something.</div></div><hr />

With that weapon (15 damage plus 10 magic damage), your damage will be 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25.<br />
<br />
It will be 15 if the mob completely resists the magic damage.  It will be 25 if the mob doesn't resist at all.  It can be any of the numbers in between if the mob partially resists.<br />
<br />
This is checked every swing.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just noticed that you had guesed the damage at 35.. which I'm thinkin' was because you added the damage, the elemental (magic) damage, and the damage bonus.  The damage bonus is not added in to the weapon's damage rating... rather it shows what your minimum damage hit will be (if the weapon is in the mainhand)  The minimum hit on any weapon is 1.  If you are swinging the weapon from your main hand, you add the damage bonus... therefore for the weapon listed your minimum hit would be 11 (1 minimum, plus 10 damage bonus).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eradani... elemental damage has been parsed extensively.  The scenario you proposed is just simply not possible.  Elemental damage is subject to a resistance check and can be fully resisted, not resisted at all, or partially resisted (in 1 damage steps).<br />
<br />
If you take a 15 damage weapon with 3 elemental damage and parse it against a mob with mid level resists (i.e not immune and not so fragile that it never resists) and then look at a histogram, it will reveal peaks in all of the appropriate spots for a weapon with a base damage of 15, 16, 17, and 18.<br />
<br />
It has been tested thoroughly by many different members of this community and other classes as well.</div></div><hr />
