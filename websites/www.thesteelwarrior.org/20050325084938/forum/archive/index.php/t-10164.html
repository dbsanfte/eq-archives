I'm runnin a 799mhz p2, 512 mb ram, with an nVidia GeForce FX5200 with 128mb of ram.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a comp setup similar to this, little worse, little better, and want to tell me how WoW runs on it? I don't want to play a game that I can't play due to lag issues, or have the fun factor lowered because I can't function. I was told that it ran pretty smooth on the low-end-comps, and it's within the min reqs. <br />

But I do read the Tech forums a lot, because I wanna know what works and what doesn't and which hardware has constant problems and avoid it hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I read about a guy with a 800Mhz, 256Mb RAM, FX5200 running it with all the graphical things turned down, and playing it well. I really can't find the post right now :( but I've seen people with similar specs post that it was running ok, I would recommend browsing the Tech forums and checking there :)<br />

That's the link, you can't post without an account but you can read whatever you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My fiance has almost the same set up as you except her processer is a bit more powerful (1.7Ghz i think).  Same vid and ram.  Her machine runs pretty good but you will sit there and wait when models are being loaded.  Once they get loaded up it settles down a lot.</div></div><hr />

Now if I could only find the damned game in stock someplace.<br />
EVERY store is sold out. Where are the shipments blizz??!111</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AMD Duron 1k,  386megs ram, geforce 3 videocard :).  It runs, but it does stick quite a bit in bigger cities and it starts to bog down if I play too long. I need more ram big time, I have heard ram in this game does wonders, so will probably buy a stick soon. and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Damn college is sapping pretty much all my money or I would just upgrade the whole damn thing.</div></div><hr />

I'm  running win98, and I heard that 512 was the max that it could handle well.<br />
<br />
Any truth to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True. To be able to use 1Gb+ of RAM you need either WinXP/2000 or Linux I believe, altho I dont think you are looking at Linux hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">512 MB of RAM wouldn't be a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rodocite</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive found that the these 3 factors affect game performance the most in this order : Ram, Video Card and CPU.<br />
<br />
In most cases, most of the lag or choppiness issues would be fixed with more ram. I highly recommend getting 1 gig. <br />
<br />
My system :<br />
<br />
Athlon XP 2100 (1.6-1.7ghz i forget)<br />
1 gig DDR<br />
ATI Radeon 9600 SE<br />
<br />
i run the game just fine. i have some chop and loading slowdown when all the settings are maxxed out, but it runs great with most video settings above normal.<br />
<br />
note : 'low-end' is a relative term. and i do consider my system to be low-end by todays standards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well.. if your are a low-end im running wow with a toaster:<br />
<br />
athlon 1.100 ghz<br />
384ddr<br />
gforce 2mx300 64mb<br />
<br />
and i have too much lag (600mb link dsl conection.. so definitively is my pc), commonly i need to wait round a min to load ingame(AFTER loading screen) when im in big cities like orgrimmar or undercity.  When flying also I even open map because the frame rate drops so much i got bored. Im looking forward to upgrade my pc as soon as possible, like rodocite said, first by a new 512 ddr memory card, then a new video card (radeon 9500/9600 would do fine for wow and its actually cheap) and finally then a new proc (better check my mainboard before to see what max proc is compatible but a ~2000 would be already ok for wow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run WoW on a low-end compy.  The graphics don't look near as good on my wife's box, but I don't experience alot of in-game lag once the game gets loaded and I'm out fighting.<br />
<br />
1.0ghz Athlon<br />
512mb SDRAM<br />
Geforce2 MX400 64mb<br />
20gb ATA66 drive<br />
<br />
Loading times are longish when you log into high population cities like Ironforge, but it's not unbearable.  Up to 90sec max.<br />
<br />
If you are thinking of upgrading a few things to make it run better on your comp, I'd suggest; 512mb DDR (at least), video card that FULLY supports Dx9c, ATA133 or SATA drive with at least 40gb of space.<br />
<br />
Also, when installing WoW, do everything you can to install it on its own drive partition of at least 8gb in size.  Most likely you'll need to defrag this partition right after installing the game and before patching.  The game installs itself almost completely fragmented (/growl).  WinXP SP2 is almost a necessity for it to run smoothly.  Oh, last but not least give your CDROM some loving before and after installation.  It will most likely be constantly spinning for 1 to 3hours while you install.</div></div><hr />

<br />
gotta love blizzard for creating a game that even old clunker pcs can run decent. unlike most games these days.</div></div><hr />
