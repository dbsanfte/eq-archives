<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwavlin</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I've been faithfully keeping my piercing skill up, but was interested in hearing opinions on whether this is really worth doing.<br />
<br />
2. Right now I have SotB in main hand and CHoS in offhand.  I would think that underwater mobs might be more affected by piercing, but I don't know how to determine whether that is true or not. Are some mobs more/less vulnerable to Piercing or 1HB or 1HS?  <br />
<br />
3. How do I know when to switch weapons (use 2 1HS or 2 1HB weaps, or swap in a piercing weap)?  Is there a list of mobs somewhere that can tell me whether they are more or less vulnerable to various types of weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure about whether or not the type of weapon (piercing, blunt, slash) has varying results against certain types of mobs like it can in other games I've played, but I think it is worthwhile to keep each of these skills up as you never know what weapon you'll be using tomorrow.  I currently use a Crow Footed Lance (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=26095) as my main DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, there are three reasons to keep &quot;up&quot; with piercing:<br />
1. You just never know when SOE will dink with itemization and then raise our cap. <br />
2. You're lvl 40 and not rich and some items might make sense because piercing items are often priced lower than similar slashing weapons -- like the jar. trident is fast/cheap and the shimmering partisan has nice stats.<br />
3. You're a warrior and you're really really stubborn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) The lower piercing cap has a negligible effect on DPS (1-2%). Some people make a really big deal out of it but it doesn't affect you much at all, obviously.<br />
<br />
2) I haven't heard anything of that sort but I can't tell ya for sure.<br />
<br />
3) I know of no list but this is one thing you can generally eyeball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Underwater has no effect on weapons (I know, I thought it should, too).  Don't concern yourself with the lower piercing skill cap, for the reason Iskandar gave.<br />
<br />
There aren't that many piercing weapons out there that end up in the hands of warriors (most of them go to rogues instead even if warriors can use them), but when you find a piercing weapon that's worth using, don't hesitate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep it up, something may come along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistikat</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perfect setup and a  reason to keep piercing up: Velium.  Crystal caverns is a nice spot to pharm velium for your velium vapor jars, or for smithing or other tradeskills. Snatch up a couple Bloodpoint's, dual wield them, and mow thru the whole cavern, self-healing as you go. 80 points tapped per proc, with WA5 it would be crazy. I only have WA 2 and its funny to see my self wade thru a heap of barney-colored orcs, and still come out full health. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pogi</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only mob you may fight up to this point where piercing will be more benifical over the others is Cragbeats Queen in Natimbi because she mitigates all over types harshly.  Warriors as I understand are suppose to be the jack of all weapon types but piercing caps at 240 I think while all others cap higher.  But like others have said something may come along and they may raise the cap on the skill.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A developer Q&amp;A was posted a while back where the question of whether or not our piercing caps would be raised.  The answer was that it was &quot;currently being looked into&quot;.  I think they will be removing the pircing &quot;penalty&quot; for warriors.  <br />
<br />
Also, the crow footed lance was linked- if you make it into an elemental guild these are pretty common to get in PoA and it is an excellent DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FurryCrew</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll want pierceing for Cragy Mom  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorekil</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep all of your weapon skills up, never know what might happen  :D . <br />
Good luck.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also suggest to keep all weapon skills maxed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might as well buy a bloodpoint and put it in your off hand and forget about it for a while.  It will max out after a few days of using it so it isn't really a big deal.  <br />
<br />
The weapon skills hardest to max for me are bash, throwing, and hand to hand (still have not maxed them hehe) since you don't really use them very much (exception being warriors with slam skill can max bash easily enough).  2 hand weapons are more important to keep up with than one hand also since they are fairly useless prior to level 50 and there isn't anything sadder than a 65 warrior with 20 skill in 2H blunt trying to do damage using his new GSo4W (no not me but I have seen it happen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even offhand a weapon will max skill out really, really quickly.  As a Rogue I neglected 1HB for example in my youth but acquired a decent offhander back in Velious that maxed my skill in a couple of casual days even in that era.  I felt pretty silly for the work I had done to keep up 1HS at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Piercing was the one skill I had never got around to maxxing, had it maxxed back at Lvl 50 in my KC days but then when caps were raised with levels I just never had a piercer.  <br />
<br />
  But I finally got around to maxxing it recently well doing the loyalist Shield. Killed Valdanov 3 times in less then a week using the piercer from the quest in TM and a cheap torch. With me and a 65 Pally and the shaman for heals they were long fights and allowed me the bonus of finally maxxing my piercing.  Now I need to find him again and see if things go faster using a Dedgerex Cudgel.</div></div><hr />
