<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>meatshieldd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just want to play the game ......i hate spending a hour  doing a cr because someone killed me in BFE.......if anyone can reccomend a server and why there server is better then others please share......thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any blue server.  Pick a relatively uncrowded one (but not a ghost-town).  Compettition for mobs is pretty rough on a few of the more populated and older servers.<br />
<br />
I started on Tallon Zek forever ago, and moved to a blue server when i wanted to progress.  You lose a lot of the excitement in moving from pvp to blue, but by-in-large it was worth it to me.  I'll still log in and PK people now and then, though, when i've had a long day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heard that today's patch is totally borking PvP.  It's like LDoN for PvP.  Wonder what the PvPers here think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My experience is Mith Marr has a solid population. Bazaar prices are low and very reasonable. And the open raiding channel has a solid population since you will eventually need some flagging. just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they just nailed the coffin shut for Rallos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No no no no ... dont convince anyone to migrate here heh.  Mith Marr is one of the most crowded servers out there.  Finding content to do isnt so terribly bad with all the new expansions these days, but gaming would be much more fun imo<br />
<br />
<br />
If i could transfer myself and my guild to another less croweded server i'd do it in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
That said, the prices on MM are pretty low since the server is so old and the population so large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>meatshieldd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea i was just on tallon zek after the patch ...its much worse now.......its a  madhouse......points for pvp......the folks who are on top will stay on top on tallon there is only 1 guild established in  plane of time......cause they pk anyone who tries to enter......it sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Drinal seems to be a pretty good server, but the prices seem to be consistantly higher than average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">High prices are ok as long as they are high all the way across the board.  Sure, it's bad if you buy your plat from yantis ... but higher prices mean that shit you come across will sell for more in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Relative values from server to server are remarkably similar (in terms of items)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What Apolyon said.  I recently started playing again, on a new server, and I was shocked by the (what I thought to be) extremenly high prices.  However, looting a few things here and there, and setting them at (what I think to be) astronomical prices, and having them sell in minutes makes it pretty easy to buy other things that are stupidly expensive.<br />
<br />
In fact, as long as you aren't a dolt that farms plat in RM, and makes money selling items, you are BETTER off on a server with high prices, as high prices = higher bank accounts.  Vendors/quests etc all require the same amount of plat on every server to complete, so having a higher average bank account means that in-game plat sinks are less of a burden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From what i've seen Terris Thule isnt a bad server. 1 tacvi guild, 1 in inktu'ta, 2 at uqua, 1 at ikk4., I think a few working on the ikk raids, who knows as far as elementals anymore.<br />
<br />
I havent seen a whole lot of drama but then again you'd have to ask some of the guilds aorund whatever level you're at for a better explanation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Saryrn is like the NY of eq~ you get the best of everything and the worst of everything. =p <br />
<br />
Bad things about Saryrn:<br />
1.Well, several people have cought on to the &quot; buy low, sell high &quot; strat which I used to make money with years ago in the nfp days, so there is mass inflation in the bazaar.<br />
2.Several idiots and purchased accounts, so you get in groups with 65 clerics who use a level 14 heal at 65 and give you like Courage for buffs.<br />
3.Lots of Competition - I wouldn't say this is such a bad thing, but there are 9 time+ guilds, 2 elemental guilds, 3 guilds under steadily trying to catch mine.<br />
<br />
Good things about Saryrn:<br />
1.Great people, when you get good groups, you tend to get really good groups, people know what their doing, will do need before greed loot if its an upgrade for someone, if two groups are headed toward the same named they'll roll in a civil fashion and split the spawn.<br />
2.If your ever in the mood for pvp there is almost *ALWAYS* people in the bazaar or rathe arena's (10+ people at a time)<br />
3.Lots of comedy~ you have people constantly trying to lead open raids on mobs that aren't up, or people leading a guild for a week, gathering all the PA'd accounts with time+ gear and then seeing them all wipe to rhag1 in ssra.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on second thought you could just shoot yourself in the leg and get the same thrill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Terris Thule ain't bad at all; pretty laid back and quiet ( since we were the castaways of the old Karana/Bertoxx/SolRo serversplit from years back ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">dunno the recruiting situation but legends is the most civil easy to move around server in EQ. stuff is reserved with GMs, there are daily events with set time blocks posted for the week, only 5 EP+ guilds 2 of them living in GoD atm so only 3 guilds vieing for EP spawns and all will not race each other or try to leapfrog. The GMs actually know a good deal of the players as people and just pop in and joke around or play with you. I know 40 a month seems alot but for me the server is well worth the extra 26 a month to leave the d3wdz and griefers in the past, so much so I have 3 accounts all on legends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tarew Marr is somewhat crowded, most of the EP guilds here just kinda fell apart, just one Euro and another that just kinda sucks and can't kill 1-group named without wiping. Quite a bit of competition for twink farming around the SSra/VT/BoT Tower level, but you got little to no competition for the EPs. Time is barely farmed anymore, just Numi and Pak I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>meatshieldd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i think im gonna go to e-marr i started a bard there today just to see what the people were like.....spent 8 hours there talking to people in the baz and in the pok....everyone seems very pleasent and ready to help........anyone have any bad expirences from e-marr lmk.....<br />
<br />
and thank you all for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>budtron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">holy shit 3 accounts at 40 a month? you have WAY too much extra time on your hands slick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The tribunal is one in the middle as it is a good server but it has a lot of whiners.. PoK has a lot of people in it selling buffs a lot and it is nothing to get  C3, SD, V, fo7, and 9 all at once in a MGB. But it is bad because there is no real farmer guilds out there. Yea there are guilds that are EP and time flagged. But they do not really farm it because there is not a lot of them that has a lot of people in them... 2-3 groups is about it. We do not have any guilds that can support a 5+ group raid with out getting a lot of allies and /ooc pick up calling...<br />
<br />
Prices are low on our server as the people that can just sit out there and farm anything that is dropable and sell it... we has the ornates all down under 100K except for the BP's and caster wrists... then they just stoped farming the zones and the prices jumped back to over 100k just for the sleaves and gloves... some have came back down but they still ask over 250K for the bp for melees...<br />
<br />
so i say we are in the middle somewhere..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">nah both are cleric bots I 2 box and my 2nd cleric is a frog that I wanted and has my shaman on it. I most likely am dropping my 2nd cleric but sometimes its nice to be able to rez guildies in 2 places at the same time lol. I contemplated 3 boxing but my desk I bought is one of the largest I could find and still isnt big enough for how I play and 3 monitors, notes, misc stuff around etc, so I am stuck with 2</div></div><hr />

<br />
VZ warrior here,<br />
<br />
The recent patch did totally bork pvp for 90% of the server, but fortunately for the top 10% the changes added even more items to increase their power in pvp and desire to farm lower tier guilds  :D   <br />
<br />
As  a warrior with &lt; 200 aa's I am meat for player hunters. considering those aa's have gone to defensive tanking skills, not offensive pking skills. Trying to exp beyond my meager &lt;200 aa's is not possible anymore because, as previously stated, I am now there simply to feed the top 10%'s need for pvp points.<br />
<br />
Joining a blue server sounds really boring, primarily because I would be severely undergeared and have no place as a tank, as pvp servers are generally behind blue servers in terms of pve. However pvp servers now are purgatories meant to test any of us who have not spent 24/7 of our lives playing eq and punish us according to the extent we have been found lacking. Seriously thinking about quitting, I won't be missed, there are plenty of lower tier guilds still to feed the top guilds.</div></div><hr />
