I seem to be getting a regular group together of warrior-cleric-ranger-enchanter-wizard.  <br />
<br />
If I used the LFG tool to get a 6th member and found every class available, what class would really help out this group?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But really just about anything would work I just happen to like to watch monks do that kicky spinny thing they do while I med.  Iksars (old model!) in dresses are the cutest.  ;)</div></div><hr />

They are so versatile that they can make any group better.  Or druid, a 2nd healer allows you to push the envelope on more difficult content.  Or necro, awesome dps and back-up rezz if things go sour. But really you have tank, cheal, slow, snare and evac; so anything would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vulpes</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have this exact setup in my regular group, our 6th is a mage, which is really good dps, and the pet can sometimes offtank (we are about PG level).  We suffer a little from a lack of a second healer (rampage is a bitch), but haven't found that to be much of a problem.  The air pet's stun provides some really helpful mitigation benefits too (3 seconds, stuns pretty much anything).<br />
<br />
Since you don't have a regular 5th, I'd probably go with a mage/rogue for straight dps, a monk if there's lots of split pulling to do, or maybe a necro if you are going deep in a dungeon or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydeon</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great group, add a bard if ones not available, then rogue ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a bard you get signifant DPS increas from over cap haste, lots more mana for DD's and heals and increased DD songs, back up mezzer, plus he can pull and produce lots of DPS on his own. But the best class deponds on the type of content you do and plan to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beasty would not be bad.  Added Shaman/Beasty line of buffs in-group is cool, some minor healing and paragon, and not bad dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah bst for dps + sham style buffs and slow imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought i'd throw this in also.  If you're gonna fill last spot out of /lfg tool, a lot of times you'll get more DPS from a very well geared player of a &quot;semi-DPS&quot; class than from a &quot;true DPS&quot; class that is much lesser geared. If you don't recognize the players in the /lfg window do a /who X and check guild tags to at least get a hint of how well geared they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowknight for the win! The can offtank+ heal themselves. <br />
When ever we 1group cursed. Its always Warrior,Cleric,Cleric,Shadowknight,Shadowknight,Bard(Or monk).<br />
Whenever i take DT from exiled. Shadowknight heals herself while I get a rez. Second cleric throws conviction oh me, and we just do that over and over again until Exiled is dead.<br />
<br />
SK with any decent 2hander(Epic 1.5, Queen Sword, Fang of Feratha, Greatblade of Chaos) make sweet dps, simply for their versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd second the beastlord if only because I am one... Beasts can fill shammy buff role pretty well, and can slow most anything except high resist mobs.  Slow goes a long way to group efficiency.  Beastlords can also haste and give additional mana regen to healers.  I box a Beast/Cleric combo and even without C, my SA + cleric self buff usually keeps the clerics mana on or close to full.  Having a real tank to tank stuff would let you do anything up to and including RS if you can take the beating.  Any time I pick up a real tank to tank, we move to the highest level the tank feels comfortable tanking in whether it is RCoD, MPG, or even RS if I get a sturdy tank (I don't like box healing a mid geared tank in RS).  <br />
<br />
I will admit though that if you are looking for sheer versatility a good bard is just hands down hard to beat, and if you are looking for sustained high DPS I agree that Rogues are indeed Kings.  But I've never found a group yet that hasn't benefitted from having a beast either...  While my DPS doesn't come close to Rogues, it's good DPS with slow and a whole pocket full of utility thrown into one.  I can even offtank if needed.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I also agree that just about anyone is good to fill out a group, and like someone said earlier alot depends on gearing and AA's.  I've seen a 65 time geared ranger with a buttload of AA's outtank a bazaar geared 70 warrior (not counting disciplines) with very few AA's and out DPS a 70 bazaar geared rogue.  Gear and AA's make a huge impact in abilities.<br />
<br />
Most importantly is to get someone to join you that is fun and competent.</div></div><hr />

Also once u find a good bard, they are the best... Can mes on inc to help the chanter, and lull/mes/fade pull, mana regen is hard to beat, and in a pinch they can also tank.. just there agro suxs, unless they have decent agro weapos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard ... no contest (assuming they know how to play well).<br />
<br />
-Tolerable melee dps<br />
-Overhaste<br />
-Nuke mod<br />
-Resists/DMG shield<br />
-Mana song<br />
-Puling skills<br />
<br />
A bard may only do 60-70% of a warriors dps, but they bring so much more to a group, that effectively your overall dps would probably be much better than adding the best rogue within your range.<br />
<br />
Roomate (bard qvic/time geared) is 180-200 melee dps, but he also adds 30-40 sustained raw dps to myself alone thanks to + attack and overhaste .... far more if more melee's are in the group. He adds 20-30% to all nukes, 20+/tick mana regen, 300 all resists constantly .... 30-40ac ... and gives me + 120-130 to my dmg shield (yet another 50ish dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard or Rogue. <br />
And bards dont come close to 60-70% of warriors. More like 50%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh a good bard with his aa's trained and good procs on his weapons will hit 67-70% of a warriors dps easily from melee alone.  Hammer of Timeweaver primary with songblade secondary and procs on both weapons his melee/proc dps is sustained 180-200.  How much does a warrior darkblade/eoe/timeweaver do?  surely not 360-400?  Last i checked they can float around 220 in xp groups while buffed.<br />
<br />
This is all melee dps mind you.  When he whips out his nuke/dot combo and kills group songs he can parse over 300 with relative ease.  If you believe a bard can only do 50% of a warriors dps you're just grouping with the wrong bards hehe.<br />
<br />
Bards are quite possibly the most overpowered class in EQ.  There are so few of them, and even fewer who know how to play well that it doesnt really matter though.  Very few bards serverwide know how to play there class to its fullest potential.  Once you happen across one that does, it will blow your mind away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inkorect</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  A bard would go nicely with a good wizard with crit AAs, more mana regen = more nukes, increase DD to add damage to nukes.  Higher damage nukes and more nukes, and extra haste for added agro over them :P  Pulling skillz are great to have too</div></div><hr />

Quoted for Truth, Sir. <br />
<br />
That said, you've got all the bases covered. A free sixth-man slot is actually a great thing to have, and you probably should be picking and choosing according to your need. Going somewhere the mobs are gonna be brutal hard hitters? Take a druid for extra heals and DPS or shaman for extra heals and faster slows. Gonna be facing a butt-ton of lighter mobs? Take a beastlord. Think there's a good chance you're gonna go down midfight? Take another tank. Pick a guy to fill you out against the night's task, cause its' gonna be a loooong time till you find a god-bard that's willing to hang with you every night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our normal trial and xp group consists of War SK Bard Cleric Shaman ... we like it at 5 for the reasons Arathena just mentioned.  It lets us me somewhat malleable and clip on whatever class can optimally help us get through the trial.  Weaponry?  Grab a ranger with appropriate gear.  Subversion?  Grab an intelligence caster with appropriate spells.  Destruction?  Grab any high dps class.  Fear?  Grab any class wanted.  Efficiency?  Grab any melee with decently strong dps.  Ingenuity?  Grab a rogue and go to town.<br />
<br />
In all cases a 2nd tank is a wonderful thing to have, provided the second tank also has the equipment and know-how to play a dps role decently.<br />
<br />
That said it's good to be the college roomate of a &quot;god-bard&quot;.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much hate for you now, Apo. I want my bards back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My morning group  is me, a bard, a druid, a necro and a cleric + usually a mage or a rogue.  And I have to say there are bards and then there are Bards.<br />
<br />
They can do a little bit of everything from offtanking to slowing, and if they know how to pull  they are the grease in the wheels of the machine<br />
<br />
Against some boss mobs bard slow is a bit on the shady side; but we hold up well enough against any boss a single group can tackle even with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulcoughing</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally would probably go with a druid, rogue, BL, or monk.  I did the bard thing for 3 years or so always hated grouping with enchanters (less somewhere they can charm) I'm sure an ultra high end bard can put out some decent dps.  For the most part bard = sucky war + enchanter = sucky wizard negates the dps a bard would provide.  If both are good players they won't need each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/nod on the Bard.<br />
<br />
I've seen a number of average and even Unskilled bards that are simply mana batteries or overhaste and they are not only not impressive, but frankly they suck.<br />
<br />
However, I've also seen the high-end and exceptionally skilled bard in action, and I can only say that it is a feat to behold.  I would agree that a SKILLED bard is just simply an amazing group enhancer that will completely blow your mind.  Not only do they put out quite respectable DPS by themselves, but the increase of performance to everyone in the group is quite substantial.  Haste/DS/DD boost/Mez/Pulling... The only problem is that the Truly skilled bards are few and far between.  <br />
<br />
but on a side note, I'm still partial to Beastlords... since I am one...</div></div><hr />
