<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuzed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 26 Halfling, Rallos Zek warrior with mostly Crusty gear, although I've replaced a few pieces with Enchanted Dwarven stuff... while I'm not trying for uber dex, I didn't like the dex penalties before. I've also noticed my wep skills going up faster since the change... whether it was because of losing negative Dex or raising dex over 100..  I don't know... but when I traded out the Crusty Greaves and Arms for Ench Dwarven ones, I made about an even swap of +AC for -Hp... so hopefully I'm going about this the right way.<br />
<br />
I don't see the Enchanted Dwarven stuff talked about, so I was wondering if it's good gear for this level?.<br />
<br />
Currently AC around 650, HPs around 1125, Sta is 149 BTW... after reading on here it seems those are the stats to worry a whole lot about.<br />
<br />
So, am I going in the right direction is my first question? Suggestions are appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, how do you get all your wep skills up??? Right now I'm at 1HB 60, 1HS 110, 2HB 57, 2HS 59, Pierce (an embarrassing) 14. Any weapon change suggestions?<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to starting to pick up the first pieces of the Fierce Heraldic Armor soon... cheaper stuff first I'm afraid... and I'm just heading into HHK for leveling...<br />
<br />
Does everything seem on track?<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying this guy a lot... my other is a druid and boy, talk about differences!  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />
