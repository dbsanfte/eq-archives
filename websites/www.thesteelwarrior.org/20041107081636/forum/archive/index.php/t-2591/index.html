<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find this thread a tad bit on the ironic side, given how many Paladins have been mortally offended by the merest suggestion that stun aggro might need to be adjusted.  While I personally don't agree that is the approach to take, the ranting from certain quarters about the very idea is kind of funny once you read the thread I've linked.<br />

<br />
<br />
 I vote we all use Sup Elixir on paladins, hoping it'll crit heal. If it doesn't, they can rez themselves, so it's no loss.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I vote that every time we group with a pally, we remind them of getting our hammers nerfed, then we go scream and cry an piss our pants like Galidin because they can group heal almost as well as us, and we can't melee anywhere near as well as them. Well, actually, I'll leave the pants pissing part to galid, but I think we should all break down the walls of Sony's inner offices with the facts about how a naked level 55 pally can pulll aggro off a level 65, fully dressed cleric, and cry that it's just so WRONG.<br />
<br />
With any luck, that'll get pally stun aggro nerfed, which will be of GREAT BENEFIT to clerics everywhere. Plus, the warriors will like us better, too. I also feel we should SERIOUSLY start a petition on the fact that druids are as good group healers as pallies if they have Woodie, and should really make sure to get that little business nerfed, too. After all, the more we can nerf the classes that help us, the better off we are. Paladins actually HEALING while they ALSO MELEE, OMFG, it's OVERPOWERED. Clerics, line up behind me, please, time to start the million miles of pally nerfage to freedom march. Now, be sure to leave out facts, make LOTS of suppositions, slant things to our point of view and railroad everyone else. Ignore those who have points and just bombard them with excessive one sided &quot;facts&quot;.<br />
<br />
(See, we've been learning from you pallies. And obviously, you've been learning from the druids... so being last in the learning process, once we get the whole whining for nerfs thing going, we should know ALL the tricks. I hope you enjoy our beneficience as much as we've enjoyed yours... )<br />
<br />
OH, and by the way, it's time to get ALL AGGRO removed from group heals, it's OVERPOWERED that you can get aggro AND heal at the same time when it's your job to aggro. You should have to work for that aggro, not do something beneficial to earn it. It really sucks for clerics, and it's a clearly overpowered fact. You should HAVE to break mez to get aggro, it's overpowered that you don't have to, but warriors pretty much do.<br />
<br />
I think it's time clerics everywhere griped about the fact that pallies can reach nearly the same HP as warriors, yet have tremendously superior aggro abilities. Do you think we don't notice? Oh, we notice, and I think it's time we quit being selfish and staying quiet about it because it helps us. It's GAME BREAKING, and it is PURE SELFISHNESS for clerics not to complain as we so properly should! Nerf pallies and SKs, they get aggro too easily, it's horrible for the GAME! It trivializes POP encounters because enchanters and shamans can slow immediately with a knight tank. Which is WRONG, just WRONG. Clerics can heal upon inc with knights and can't with warriors... GAME BREAKING! Wizards overnuke with knight tanks, mages do, too! I say NERF instant aggro so these lunatics will learn PROPER AGGRO MANAGEMENT, which they aren't right now because it's TRIVIAL for either knight class to grab aggro!<br />
<br />
Rally forth, clerics, it's time to state the truth and quit being so selfish and depriving everyone in EQ of PROPERLY BALANCED fights! Gird your loins, take up your halos, TO THE GALLOWS with the knights! Stop this insane overpowered instant taunting! For GOD'S SAKE, THINK OF THE BALANCE!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I say we raid PoN...I hear Galidin's ego has more hp than Kerafyrm.<br />
<br />
I'm so glad he gave me yet another reason to allow paladins to die whenever I can.  I like how he jumps on the fact that it's &quot;overpowering&quot;...he went ranting and whining on pretty much every class board he could find, and then some.  Yet his first argument was over the fact that a cleric could &quot;theoretically&quot; kill all AoEs, and all paladins got was a 1250 instant group LoH.  Interesting argument there, eh?<br />
<br />
Maybe someone needs to go to that thread and put a big fucking sign that says &quot;YOU GODDAMN IDIOT, THE DAMN ABILITY ISN'T EVEN FUCKING FINISHED YET!  THE ABILITY CAN'T EVEN HIT THE FUCKING GROUP THE CLERIC IS IN YET, NOT EVEN COUNTING MGB!  IT ALSO REQUIRES PREREQUISITES THAT MOST CLERICS WON&quot;T EVEN GET FOR A LONG WHILE, AS WE'RE ALL GETTING SCM WHICH ACTUALLY SAVES US MANA ON THE SPELLS THAT DO TAKE MANA, WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THIS ABILITY.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's true...the spell has a AE range of 0 right now, if a cleric uses it, even MGB, he can only hit himself.  Nice overpowering ability there, huh?  The fact that the aerange is 0 should be the absolute first indicator that the ability isn't finished yet, and changes are still on the way.  Now we get a 25hp increase per tick for 6 fucking AA.  That's almost as worthless as getting another point of mana for 12AA.  I can understand them lowering it, but lowering it to the same as a spell we ALREADY HAVE...sorry, that's not worth it.  Maybe if it was 400 when maxed, or even 500 (clerics have been asking for a group version of their highest elixer spell for a long time).<br />
<br />
Another interesting thing I noticed was that there were clerics and warriors both going after them...interesting, both the parent classes going after the hybrid.  We need to do this more often...as that says something, you think? :D<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh yeah, the stun thing was also funny. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It should be noted that Clerics are nearly in the same position Warriors are in.

I agree, for now.  But it wouldn't take much to nudge them along the same path as Warriors.  It's very close as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It'd take a pretty chunky nudge, but it's true. They're not all that far off in exp groups. I've not been in an exp group lately, including Sol Ro, that couldn't be healed by a compentant druid. It'd be a bit much for a shammy, that's true, but once the mobs are slowed a druid can take care of business. For raids, though, they're still king. The extra hp on their CH over a druid CH keeps them ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before PoP clerics were useless in an xp group with the exception of a few camps in a few zones.  I got pitty groups from my guildmates but no one needed a cleric to heal 'cause a druid and sometimes even a shaman healed well enough.  PoP fixed clerics for the most part - druids can still heal well enough for a lot of xp groups but mobs are tough enough now that most groups want a cleric as healer and the druid as evac or dps.  <br />
<br />
As Glatius said though, it wouldn't take much to swing it back the other way.  I remember tradeskilling for hours because my friends didn't log in that day so I couldn't get a group.  Unless they give me an alternative to grouping I am very protective about the abilities that allow me to get a group when I want one now.  <br />
<br />
Clerics, warriors and other pure melee either need to be able to solo a lot better than they currently can or they need to be valuable to a group so that they can get the groups that they can't survive without.<br />
<br />
I've always had a sort of 'we are in this boat together' feeling toward warriors.  I realize you guys have it bad right now and really am behind anything that fixes things.  I hope you understand though that I prefer not to join you where you are although I'd love it if they fixed your class enough for you to be where you should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">stun agro readjusting is pretty pointless, they just cast more then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, they'd cast more...and therfor, use more mana...theoretically.<br />
<br />
Clerics are different from warriors in that despite the other two classes being able to handle it, clerics are still able to do the job much better than them.  Warriors do not have the same situation in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There was a time when people scoffed at the idea of putting a Paladin infront of a big raid monster too.<br />
<br />
I can already think of an event where a Cleric is inefficient: The Executioner Trial in Justice.  Neither the little monsters nor the big guy really hit for that much damage.  The massive healing Clerics have is just plainly inappropriate since the amount of damage dealt is covered by either a Druid or a Shaman (or a strong Paladin!).  The point of the event is to be FAST! not durable.<br />
<br />
Its just something to think about.  Clerics aren't in trouble yet but neither were Warriors at one point.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Like I said...theoretically :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its just something to think about. Clerics aren't in trouble yet but neither were Warriors at one point.<br />
<br />
Right.  If you consider the various healing abilities of the priest classes it might by something like this, on a scale of 1 to 10.<br />
<br />
Cleric: 10<br />
Druid: 7<br />
Shaman: 6<br />
<br />
Now if once you factor in slow and KEI it might look something like this.<br />
<br />
Cleric: 10+<br />
Druid: 8<br />
Shaman: 7<br />
<br />
And if the game is designed in such a way that you need a healing value of 8 or better just to get by, then clearly the Clerics fit that bill nicely and a Druid can, under the right circumstances, but a Shaman would have a hard time.  Which is pretty much the current situation.  However if there ever comes a time where the value of healing required drops down to say a level 6, then Clerics will be overpowered in healing for the environment.  People won't need all the healing or even a substantial part of the healing a Cleric can produce.  Druids and Shamans would be able to replace a Cleric just fine.  And since a Cleric doesn't bring a whole lot to the situation other than more healing, their desirability as specialists will be lower, since a specialist isn't required, and more adaptable classes would become more desired.<br />
<br />
The current situation with Knights and Warriors tanking is like this.<br />
<br />
Warrior: 10<br />
Knight: 8<br />
<br />
Except that the environment really needs an 11 or 12 to tank without slow.  Once slow is factored in, only about a 7 is needed to tank acceptably.  Which means that the Knight tanks well enough while the Warrior tanks better.  But the additional tanking of the Warrior really isn't required.  And given the fact that his complete specialization isn't necessary once slow is factored in and isn't enough when it isn't, there really is no reason to take a Warrior over a Knight given the extra things a Knight can do, unless you just want a bigger tanking buffer.<br />
<br />
However, once you consider aggro control differences you begin to realize that even with the larger tanking buffer the Warrior represents, he's still more of a liability than the Knight because he reduces the effectiveness of everyone else in the group while not bringing anything you  &quot;have&quot; to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Roehm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is amazing the fear generated by two words; &quot;nerf stuns&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any time the subject comes up on PoN, the fear is palpable you can cut it with a knife.<br />
<br />
They seem to like being at the top of the heap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Trondir, any 'stun nerf' would rather obviously include the elimination of 15 mana cost stuns as an aggro tool (since they don't affect the mob) and i assume there is a long timer on the AA manaless stun?<br />
<br />
A nerf (in the unlikely event of it actually happening) might include increasing mana costs and or any number of different tuning measures also. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yes, the timer is with max AA 9 seconds and without any haste AA 30 seconds.<br />
And if immune mobs no longer hate the attempt of stunning etc against their immunity, we can drag alot of our non EB weaposn on the destroy button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">How do we know they won't change some of these effects that have stuns so they effect higher lev...wait, nm...this is SOE we're talking about.<br />
<br />
Wait, GSoT still stuns to 65, and it's selling for cheap in bazaar, so that one will still definitely be good.  And many a warrior already use it if they don't have EB weapons.<br />
<br />
Debuffs will still work, so the Frostbringer will still be good, as well as any others. :D<br />
<br />
All I've been asking for is reduced aggro on immune stuns, not no aggro on stuns.  Obviously if it doesn't affect you, you're not going to pay as much attention to it, right?  However you're still gonna notice, so there's some.<br />
<br />
Divine Stun is 30 second reuse without any extra AA?  Okay.  They get that at 59...stuns up to level 68 for 1 second (spell info here (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2190&amp;source=Live)).  In PoP AA, they get 3 levels of a time reducer, each one reduces the reuse by 7 seconds.  So at max AA you've got paladins with a very fast cast 1 second stun, manafree, with a 9 second reuse, that can stun almost any mob in the game (except those rare level 70 mobs), not counting resists.<br />
<br />
Someone needs to find out if that stun still carries as much agro as any other 1 second stun...because I've got this very odd feeling that if Warriors had that ability, even on a 30 second reuse with no reduce, they'd be much better off.  Hell, not even the stun, just the same aggro from it.<br />
Use it right off and build agro from that.  Focused blow or some stupid name like that.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">9 seconds? That's pretty unbalanced to my mind. Especially when you consider taunt is a 6 second timer :p<br />
<br />
Who says stuns need to be changed across the board - just give the class where aggro is a bonus not a penalty a different line of spells - hell they chuck out spell after spell after spell why not make the paladin 'his own class' like so many paladins want and tailor his spell lines to his specific gameplay situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oh yeah, that'd be a nerf though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Divine Stun is pretty low aggro though, so it is more useful for damage mitigation and spell interruption than aggro. The thing that pisses me off most about Divine Stun is that clerics don't get it *grumble*.</div></div><hr />

I think more than any true balance concern caused by this spell, it is mainly just angst against the paladin class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">NM, I thought this was about the mini aego spell on test for paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm wiling to bet that warriors will have a much easier time in XP groups if they've an ability like Divine Stun that just plain adds 100 hate on the same timer.  You're not behind by as much aggro as you think even with the psychos doing their immediate tash/slow on incoming.  As for overnuking that problem cannot be solved nor should it be... wizards, after all, are given considerable deaggro skills to deal with their aggro.  <br />
<br />
As for clerics, they're not needed in PoP, but people get them for the same reason why you'd get a Knight because they're afraid.  If you have a slower you can probably heal with just a shaman, and certainly a druid is plenty enough and a druid in that case obviously brings more to a group than a cleric.  In zones without fire immunity, a Druid can function as half a slower with their attack debuffs and actually there's a good deal of mobs with slow mitigation but nothing mitigates attack debuff unless they're fire immune (only 2 zones in the game I can think of).  Heck, just attack debuff the mob and fight it unslowed, I'm pretty sure the extra damage you get on the damage shield makes up for the healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Drach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">my SK can tank just fine with just a shaman on heal and slow duties.  cast quicence &lt;sp&gt; on me on inc, malo slow and patch as needed.

<br />
This works well for a knight because of the complete aggro lock.  I would NEVER try this with my warrior, I'd be picking the splattered shaman gore out of my hair for weeks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Why would healing aggro be with an issue?  Healing aggro is very low especiallly with all the CH line of spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In simplistic terms, its a six way heal which means six times the agro.  Spread this out over an entire raid of 50+....that is mind boggling amounts of agro.  Even if its a low agro HOT the amount becomes stagering quickly and accumulates a lot of agro.<br />
<br />
Paladin group heals are around one tick of this thing.  I've died more times in raid due to popping a group heal than tanking something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well, that's not exactly accurate at all=P Ask your druids/clerics/beastlords.<br />
<br />
 Pal group heals are massive agro though. And I would certainly not say healing agro is &quot;very low&quot; as Phantron put it. I play a cleric pretty often for raids, and heal agro is not low, it is manageable though. But I get agro sometimes if a MT dies. Meaning I must be pretty far up that thar agro list.<br />
<br />
 Didn't read most of thread so just commenting on specific statements I saw, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You need to read the whole post since you took my quote out context. ^_^<br />
<br />
The point is a 50+ way heal is a lot of agro reguardless if the first one is low.  I can generally pop 1k heals without fear of being beat on.  Poping six 1k heals at once is a sure way to draw agro from loose monsters.  Poping a theoretical 800 per tick heal x 50 is a lot of agro every tick even if coded low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Not really Aeka. HoTs don't seem to give aggro based on the number of hps they heal, they give aggro like a buff does. I doubt a 800hp/tick heal MGB heal gives any more aggro than our 300hp/tick heal already does.<br />
<br />
Group direct heals, that's a different story *shudder*<br />
<br />
In any case, it doesn't really matter. The ability was obviously unfinished (it had an AE range of 0 meaning it was still self only), bt that didn't stop a few paladins from going postal. Given the history of paladins at least appearing to get cleric abilities nerfed, it was very poor judgement to start whining about an obviously incomplete spell that never even went live on Test.</div></div><hr />

ya, they are on the hate list, just with a very little amount of agro. I personally love grouping with bards, they slow right on inc, but do not get agro with the slow song! and fighting a mob for 45 seconds when the mob is slowed 52 &gt;&gt;&gt; fighting unslowed 15 seconds and 75% slowed 30 seconds</div></div><hr />

 AE HoT's garner very very little agro. have done as a cleric in the CH cycle after a large CH and gained no appreciable agro(not summoned or turned on). And done as a druid a few times with no issues whatsoever. A single stun or nuke will garner more agro.</div></div><hr />

&quot;my SK can tank just fine with just a shaman on heal and slow duties. cast quicence &lt;sp&gt; on me on inc, malo slow and patch as needed. We did this for hours in BoT with no problems at all. Wouldn't recommend it for a mini, but works fine for xp grind.&quot;<br />

No group heals are involved here.  And if you as a warrior cannot overcome the heal aggro from your own group's healer then pretty much anyone else doing anything important (like slowing) is going to die.  Clerics end up next on the aggro list in raids because warriors below the MT sometimes misgauge their aggro.  If you wanted to, you can always have a 2nd warrior get aggro (minus some wizards in between) the moment the MT dies but that's actually more harmful due to the DPS of PoP ubers, you often end up just losing your second tank with nothing to show for it, so it's preferable to use other people, clerics if necessary, to get the time to heals (this assumes you've a bigger surplus of healers versus capable tanks, which is usually true from my experience).</div></div><hr />
