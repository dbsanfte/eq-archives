<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I've been out of the game since not too long after GoD came out, so I'm pretty far behind on what's out there. I have a 65 ogre warrior that I had leveled up primarily for helping my cleric farm and to multibox in LDoNs with my wife. Now my guild is super short on tanks, and I'd like to consider upgrading him to someday being a viable backup tank for our big meatshield. He is currenlty in full FH with a Anger II auged CHoS and Fabled SSoY. Is there a viable upgrade path from that for a fairly casual single group outside of LDoN? (I'm putting in some time in LDoN, but I want to know what is attainable other than Royal Attendant, and whether I should put my LDoN points into armor or augs). Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BoT is empty.  I'd go Ornate.<br />
<br />
That should at least make you passable as a tank for whatever you're doing. (Not that Fierce is shitty or anything, but you'll get a bit more AC out of Ornate)<br />
<br />
The LDoN route is a long fuckin haul to get usable armor.  If you do a lot of them, it might be viable, but I definitely wouldn't consider it a path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep. BoT is a good place to get a bunch of ornate pieces. theres some nicish stuff dropping in oow zones too, but it's so camped out it could be hard to get your hands on. Theres a few decent pieces in riwwi / god sewers too, although they're all gimpy on AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you said no ldon i assume you meant buyable ldon stuff.<br />
<br />
Bloody boots of dark rites<br />
Mana-threaded bone bracelet<br />
Warlord Steel gauntlets<br />
<br />
All 3 drop off named in hard ldon and are actually sellable.  You can spend the points you earn on the side for aggro/hp/ac augs.<br />
<br />
Aside from BP and legs, Ornate isnt a big enough upgrade imo to warrant the effort from FH, and once you quest it you cannot turn it in later for futher upgrades.  It'll rot in your bank just like it's rotting in mine now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're into GoD trials and have a decent group you can get Pitten Vambraces (28ac 85hp) and Burnished Antique Greaves (40ac 110hps) as well.<br />
<br />
Any upgrade you make up from FH will either cost you a lot of money or a sizable time investment.  GoD trials and Hard LDoN is probably your best bet for efficiency.  Royal Attendant armor is nice but i personally wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pole.  It's too damn expensive for only a marginal upgrrade over ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmm... don't you have to be geared up pretty good to Tank a hard? I seem to see that a lot on these boards --- Do LDoN hards for gear up-grades! I tried one and got my ass kicked before we got out of the 1st room. I'm going the ornate route and my hp and defensive AA's. Then maybe i can do hards.<br />
<br />
Haas is right, BoT is empty and ornate prices are coming down on my server.<br />
<br />
Ldon for AC augs and perhaps Hp augs <br />
<br />
Is a FH set enough AC / Hp's to tank a hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't tanked a hard, but having healed for hard, a FH set would be enough only if you have a minimum of your arch defensive AAs done (which I am not yet). Of course, needless to say your resists will suck.</div></div><hr />
