<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished taing a look at the Paladin and Warrior Class issues lists and I was struck by the difference.<br />
<br />
Paladins are asking for more effective stuns on higher level mobs, a voidance disc, more mitigation, better heals, etc.<br />
<br />
Warriors are primarily asking for the status quo vs. other classes and some very minor tweaks - nothing earth shattering.<br />
<br />
Paladins already have utility class advantages that Warriors will never (and should never) have. As a Tank/hybrid class, they can tank to within 5% as well as a Warrior and stun mitigate and heal and Root and step back and potentially pacity and goodness knows what else. <br />
<br />
They already outdo Warriors by far on stunable mobs unless we use one of our mitigation disciplines (which unlike stuns and heals can't be used on every mob).<br />
<br />
I'm getting seriously concerned that they are asking for across the board improvements that when coupled with a voidance disc is going to horribly marginalize Warriors.<br />
<br />
If I keep seeing &quot;Discussing.&quot;, &quot;Evaluating&quot;, etc. on their rather extensive list, I think it's about time Warriors ask for:<br />
<br />
Melee Update 2 (Warrior portion of the needed improvements):<br />
<br />
Warrior's Advantage 1, 2, 3 - decrease the refresh time of Defensive by 10% for each level.<br />
<br />
You're Not a Warrior 1, 2, 3 - add &quot;-1 DI' per level to the always present Warriror DI based mitigation advantage when no Mitigation discipline is in effect.<br />
<br />
Meaty Meat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - add 100HP's per level to maximum HP's. Sturdyness 1-5 must be completed.<br />
<br />
Skeptic's Resistance 1, 2, 3 - reduces the damage a Warrior recieves form Magical Atacks 2% per level - not being a magic practitioner, Warriors are naturally less affected by Magical attack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dare say we ought to at least be asking for some warrior specific defensive AA's. It seems silly that silk classes get the exact same ones we do, even if ours may do more for us due to more defensive skills / ac. <br />
<br />
I'd like some more xp-group usable offensive discs too, so people will quit bitching about &quot;warriors can't be dps&quot; blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
We probably ought to maintain the piercing cap crusade too, just because we can.<br />
<br />
More class specific weapons (and other items) too, dangit.<br />
<br />
That being said, I have no idea how facetious you were being with those suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like to see AA's that lower the mobs DI, that'd be cool. Or even more mitigation/avoidance AA's that are only available to melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, plenty. None of those changes, should Paladins get their requested improvements, would alter the status quo. Want Beef with a capital 'B'? Get a Warrior. Want beef with a small 'b' plus utility then get a fighter/caster/multi-role hybrid.<br />
<br />
Vs normal adds the changes would amount to very little except a reasonable and expected 100% Tank's resiliance advantage.<br />
<br />
Vs. harder hitting yellow and red mobs, it would represent more insuring that at some point a Warrior's greater resiliance &gt; approximating it with spellcasting and a voidance disk.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, if Paladins get all they are looking for, the improvements listed above would likely not matter. Adequate survivability against hard hitting mobs (a point they've pretty much achieved anyway) plus utility trumps excess un-needed survivability every time.<br />
<br />
As soon as they can stun red con mobs, Warriors might as well log out. Perhaps you haven't noticed as time goes on, even Blue mobs quckly eat through a Warrior's HP. We don't have an extra HP bar hidden in our mana bar and another hidden in LoH, the ability to stun to get off a heal or the ability to Root and step back out of melee range.<br />

BB you  talk about unbalancing and over powered.  Everything on this list is unbalancing except maybe the resistes<br />
<br />
Warrior's Advantage 1, 2, 3 - decrease the refresh time of Defensive by 10% for each level.<br />
<br />
Defensive is way overpowerd already.  What do you want to be in defensive 50 % of the time?<br />
<br />
You're Not a Warrior 1, 2, 3 - add &quot;-1 DI' per level to the always present Warriror DI based mitigation advantage when no Mitigation discipline is in effect.<br />

Gee all the complaints about Knights getting -1 DI and warriors getting -2 DI were wrong?  What happneed here?  You got the best mitigation in the game already, DENIED<br />
<br />
<br />
Meaty Meat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - add 100HP's per level to maximum HP's. Sturdyness 1-5 must be completed.<br />

<br />
There is a huge HP gap already between Knights and Warriors.  Warriors get more hp inately, get more hp added to their class specific armors.  You have an aa that adds 500 hp.  DENIED<br />

The Mobs are Dark Blue.<br />
<br />
This, I think is the problem.<br />
<br />
I wont reply as to what I think about your comments about what Paladins are asking for because I wouldnt want you all coming over to a paladin board and posting the same junk.  But, I will say this:<br />
<br />
SoE should even the playing field when it comes to mobs vs. levels vs. damage.<br />
<br />
Level 63 mobs in Tier 3 Plane of Hate are Pansy's compared to the level 63 mobs in GoD.<br />
<br />
This, I think, is where it all starts.  <br />
<br />
63's should hit for inbetween X and Y.  Period.  <br />
<br />
A level 63 Quadding for 1200 each hit in GoD is rediculous when you take into consideration 63's in PoHate tripple 600-700.  <br />
<br />
See where Im going?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think a level 65 Paladin should be able to Tank a Dark Blue.  Maybe even a White or a slim shot at a yellow.. but I dont think they should be able to tank all yellows or any reds.<br />
<br />
But, take into consideration the wide variety of mobs out there, and how unbalanced the mobs are versus their level.<br />
<br />
I can tank a 65 Zone Boss (Lord Dinni dalnnija... ehh... Lord Bob in Velks.. the 65 Monk)  but cant tank a 63 in a different zone?  Thats ignorant.<br />
<br />
Now before everyone starts spouting off about older content versus newer content, they should take into consideration this:  I think GoD is full of level 66-67-68-69-70 mobs that are conning Dark Blue to 65.  This is the problem that begins the complaining of Balance.<br />
<br />
Balancing something or someone against a &quot;Sliding Scale&quot; will never work.  This is what people are attempting to do.<br />

the problem is you're trying to tank stuff that hits for 1k with not enough aa, hp, or ac.<br />

ok, they could do that. then to make it fair, they'd have to make their hp the same too, making all the content of that lvl the same and giving it no variety!<br />

not in a place designed to be hunted in by lvl 70s.<br />
<br />

<br />
there's balance there. mobs in GoD hit for a fuckton but have crap hp. stuff in PoP hits for less but has more hp.<br />
<br />
I can tank a 65 Zone Boss (Lord Dinni dalnnija... ehh... Lord Bob in Velks.. the 65 Monk)  but cant tank a 63 in a different zone?  Thats ignorant.<br />

no, that's 4 year old content.<br />
<br />
I think GoD is full of level 66-67-68-69-70 mobs that are conning Dark Blue to 65.<br />
<br />
no, this is just you trying to tank stuff without the right stats or lvl. go try tanking your tier3 Hate stuff at lvl60, without the 60+ buffs and spells from your groupmates too. it's a bit harder isnt it?<br />
<br />
Paladins are asking for more effective stuns on higher level mobs<br />
Defensive is way overpowerd already. What do you want to be in defensive 50 % of the time?<br />
<br />
what do you want to have the mob stunned more than 50% of the time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pointed out the Paladin Class Issues Top Ten List is a soup to nuts list of improvements - direct mitigation, burst mitigation, stun mitigation, dps, CC, and heals.<br />
<br />
The Warrior list in contrast had stuff like augment reuse (general issue), shields (likely to benefit Knights disproportionally), and some modest tweaks.<br />
<br />
If you believe a plate tank/caster hybrid can advance significantly while Wariors stand still, then you entitled to that opinion.<br />
<br />
I'm a little concerned that with a 20 second autoparry disc, stun mitigation, heals, buffs, pacify, root and res Warriors may find themselves pretty undesireable in places like Kod'Taz groups. If you're not, then fine.<br />
<br />
If you believe Warrior Class Issues aren't as significant as those of Paladins, or even Casual Player Class Isuues as have goten a lot of discussion and input here, that's fine too.<br />
<br />
But this is TSW and discussing relative class balance and the possible effects of an across the boards increase to another plate tank classes' plans for enhancement and how it might effect Warriors is not to my mind out of order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think that OoW, with its new lvl cap at 70, will act like a huricane in class balance. thus nothing should be done now (less than one month before its lunch) to change class power, and see what will arise from this new expension to decide what exactly classes need. So no new over powering spell for knight, no new disc either, no modif to our disc or innate advantage.<br />
In two or three month, when issues will be clearly drawed, balance would be possible, not before.<br />
<br />
This is what we should say to dev : &quot;Put balance issues aside for two month, then it will be time to think about it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Cute. Warrior kick stun has been around for a very long time and I believe Cripples may stun. It certainly is NOT unreasonable to expect that Kick, Bash, and Slam have a chance to stun and stop a gater. The idea that a particularly hard blow (Cripple?) might stun is very reasonable as well. <br />

And Warriors don't at present have a 5 second special attack Stun.

No, I clearly said that of the classes that are concidered TANKS, Warriors are the only one with a voidance disc.<br />
<br />
As you may recall Defensive, and it's cousins are considered rightfully Warrior class defining abilities that shoudn't be shared. Surely the developers weren't refering to being shared with Enchanters, Monks, or Bards - they meant shared with other Plate Tanks. It would erode the uniqueness of the Warrior class - the only TANK with a voidance disc.<br />
<br />
Upgrading the existing Warrior special attack stun however isn't such an issue. We already have kick stun and an upgrade would not erode a unique ability among Tanks.<br />
<br />
Maybe 5 seconds IS unreasonable and Half of that would be more appropriate.<br />

&quot;Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. There is supposed to be a disparity between the tanking abilities of warriors and knights.&quot;<br />

<br />
You are correct, Knights are currently without any defensive disciplines.  I brought this to the attention of the development team and the addition of a defensive discipline in the future seemed to be promising. However, for now, we are going to work on the content.  Let's see if we can get that sorted out and tuned so that more than the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; can enjoy it and then start looking at a potential defensive discipline.<br />

Level 63 mobs in Tier 3 Plane of Hate are Pansy's compared to the level 63 mobs in GoD.<br />
Gonzo, those mobs in Hate are tuned for players with far less AA's (ie. like you with your 35AA).  The mobs in GoD are tuned for people with far more AA's.<br />
<br />
When you have as few AA's as you have, then yes, you will enjoy your time more in a place like Hate, which was tuned for your power level.<br />

The warriors with 150+ AA's can handle GoD's version of level 63 mobs.<br />

Does anyone else thing AAs should be listed when you do a /who?   Additionally, I think they should also factor into how a player/mob cons somehow...maybe the base color is the same as before but the con message varies by number of AAs.<br />
<br />
A lot of the casual vs. hardcore debate stems from the fact that people who are 65 with 0 AAs don't always realize that they are light years away from someone who is 65 with 500 AAs.<br />

A 65 warrior is a 65 warrior.  But a 65.12 warrior is not a 65.455 warrior.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for pointing out that post from May before the GoD content adjustment. I missed it. So few Warriors read that forum, much less as you incorrectly stated I do, post frequently in it.<br />
<br />
I'm glad adjusting the content was so successful.<br />
<br />
As Brenlo pointed out:<br />
Remember that there is nothing firm on this, the idea was merely well recieved by the developers.<br />
Adjusting the content showed that a ~20 second autoparry disc every 30 minutes is far from an absolute necessity. It would be nice for things to remain stable. One 100% Tank with mitigation discs and 2 tank/caster hybrids with spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Of course kick stuns may need a significant duration adjustment should Knights actually get a piece of the Warrior class defining ability that shouldn't be shared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs. There is supposed to be a disparity between the tanking abilities of warriors and knights.&quot;<br />

<br />
My point exactly.  If 4 year old content was listed as 65.. then they should be either A) adjusted or B) Streamlined.<br />
<br />
A 65 should be a 65 no matter the date of content.  If they put out harder content then the levels of those mobs should be shown with respect to older content.<br />
<br />
We can use Lord Bob (65) as an example.<br />
<br />
SoE Should Have done one of two things when coming out with new content.<br />
<br />
1)  Lowered mobs like Lord Bob there to a more defined level (I wouldnt go this route)<br />
<br />
2) Make the &quot;GoD's Version of 63&quot; what they would be compared to older content, which, in my opinion should be 66-67-68ish.<br />
<br />
To make a &quot;Old&quot; 65 mob a wuss compared to a &quot;New&quot; 63 just doesnt make sense.  If the &quot;New&quot; 63 is going to hit like a 66-67-68 they should be that level.  <br />
<br />
This also goes towards the new level 70 Cap coming.  You are going to fight MUCH harder mobs with lower levels, making EQ even more of a treadmill than it already is.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would be hunting all old content wussy 65's to get more exp (considering exp is based on level) than to work my tail off to kill a 63.<br />
<br />
My intention wasnt to De-Rail the thread.  It was to more expand on balancing.  Personally, I think people see 63's that they cant kill, and start screaming bloody murder about balance, and gimme-this gimme-that.  Whereas if they saw that they were fighting a 67 mob, they wouldnt say much, I dont think, because they KNOW its 67.<br />
<br />
But, when it comes to &quot;What Paladins Want&quot;  dont lump us all into one catagory.  Not all paladins want all those things.  That was a combination of everyones opinions.  I dont think SoE will give us all those goodies.  But, they asked for ideas, and thats what &quot;The Paladins&quot; came up with.  To assume we will get all of those is idiotic.  But, again, they asked us and what youre seeing is a compilation of numerous peoples opinions.<br />

QUOTE from eqlive.station description of Warriors:<br />
&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.&quot;<br />

Ya know, it might not have been bumped in awhile, but I'm pretty sure there's a Warrior Correspondent initiated Warrior Class Top Ten Class Issues thread here and THAT'S the place to make actual suggestions.<br />
<br />
I started this thread ONLY to encourage people to compare and contrast the Paladin and Warrior list and then perhaps to turn their attention to the Warrior Class Top Ten Class Issues.<br />
<br />
With 20/20 hindsight, that's probably where I should have made my initial post on this thread.<br />
BB,<br />
<br />
I did not feel this is a top 10 priority, rather it is a nice to have.<br />
<br />
<br />
we have it, it's called kick ...<br />
Kicking is a zero second stun, not 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
I figured since a kick is a zero second stun, why not have an AA triggered attack using a 2 hander that will stun for 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
The theory behind my madness is, a powerful Warrior swinging a big broadsword with ALL his/her might would be a Devastating Blow that would knock you out of your boots/slippers and would/should render you briefly stunned.<br />
<br />
Much like getting an uppercut, see stars/blue dots for a second or 2, pain shooting throughout your sensory system, immediately consumed by rage and then commence reciprocation to your opponent.</div></div><hr />

I needed 2 healers in sewers when I was not as geared as I am now.<br />
<br />
With caster skill caps and mitigation I think casters need to have most of our defensive dis's to be able to live, the less hits a slower can take the more important agro is and the more needed knights are. Dont try to down grade casters and put us out of work!</div></div><hr />

<br />
sooo you want stuff in GoD trials to be as weak as 4 year old content but still drop the uber gear that they do for 1 groupable content? that would be stupid.<br />
<br />
or do you want it to be the other way and have lord bob hit for 1200 and still drop the shit that he does? cause that would be stupid also.<br />
<br />
in order for gear to get better in new content, the mobs have to get harder.<br />
<br />
Is that anything like when warriors got an endurance based version of the SK-only agro spells?<br />
<br />
they're not really SK only, pally stuns do pretty much the same damn thing as far as aggro. so it's only logical that the only tank class that didnt have it, who is supposed to be THE tank class, got something similar as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
peek at the paladin list<br />
<br />
If you want a stun roll a pally<br />
<br />
If you want a mitigation disc roll a warrior.<br />
<br />
those kind of statements work both ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Gonzo,<br />

Ideally levels wouldn't have been caped and AA abilities would have been given out as players progressed. Today's level 65 with 50 AA's might be level 90 and a 65 with 500 AA's might be level 300. IF this had been the sysyem used then perhaps a mob's con would have been more consistant.<br />
<br />
However, mudflation would have still had an impact. My 52 Paladin can easily solo Blues inside KC continuously, a situation I don't recall being true when Kunark came out. He has no AA's. I imagine that a 52 Warrior with no AA's would have a lot more of a problem. So, player class which means a lot when facing a mob isn't taken into account at all when you con.<br />
<br />
/con has always been a very rough scale that assumes you are up to handling the content you are chosing to fight. It's a progression game that assumes you are progressing.<br />

What's your point ? Avoidance is an ability knights never had, stun is an ability warriors always had. Beside stun is all but paladin only, Clerics &amp; Enchanters have stuns to. I guess an AA that would make the stun part of kick more efficient would not be totaly stupid.</div></div><hr />

Paladin:<br />
Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath.  Paladins are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
 <br />
Paladins are able fighters and battlefield healers whose combat spells focus on stunning enemies    and smiting undead. They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies.  Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves of their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<br />
 <br />
Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<br />
 <br />
Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal.  Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Exactly right Inferna,<br />
<br />
While Warriors may have Kick stun and Cripples may stun, Warriors have never had an on demand stun ability or a stun with as near as I can tell any duration - except perhaps through weapons. Clerics, listed as a primarily caster class (and therefore secondarily a melee class) in their Class Description may stun for a duration greater than 0. Still stunning is pretty much a Paladin (among the plate tanks) defining ability.<br />
<br />
It's exactly the same for avoidance and mitigation disciplines. Only the Warrior class has the ability to achieve unmatched survivability among the plate tanks. Even a ~20 second with a 30 minute refresh auto parry discipline seriously impinges on the Wariror Class Defining Ability that will not be shared. <br />
<br />
NO class other than Warirors have a voidance/mitigation abilitly that allows them to act as the MT from start to finish on a named mob in places like KoD'Taz. Not Rangers, Monks, Bards, Rogues, who are not tanks and SURELY not Knights, who are tanks.<br />
<br />
Neither you know I know what SoE MAY do in OoW. However, to my mind if Knights ask for and receive abilities or skil increases that are intended not to keep them unique classes that are fun to play and have a role in every environment, but specifically intended to make them as Warrior-like as possible, I assure you that Warrior ARE very likely to ask for:<br />
<br />
Super Sturdyness 1-5<br />
<br />
&quot;-2 DI&quot;, &quot;-3 DI&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
2H Bash with an AA ability to allow it a chance to stun.<br />
<br />
Increased duration for Warrior attack stuns.<br />
<br />
Reduction of the Defensive timer through AA's<br />
<br />
Major improvements to Crits or perhaps Cripples instead of Crits with Cripples having a 1 or 2 second stun.<br />
<br />
Improved Healing Will<br />
<br />
Aggressive Knight Issue Top Ten Lists will not likely be met IMO indefinately with a Warrior List containing generic and low impact items. Most Warriors resisted the idea of Knights getting Half Defensive and becoming Warrior-like (with Spellbooks besides) earlier. I doubt they will see the same thing achieved by another route - acting like Warriors have no room for improvements while Knights ask for and recieve concideration for far-reaching improvements across the board.<br />
<br />
That was, if you read the first post, exactly what I originally pointed out.<br />
<br />
Improving the duration of existing Warrior attack stuns is a LOT less of an infringment on a Paladin niche ability than giving Knights an avoidance or mitigation ability they have never had.<br />
<br />
Two of the plate tank Top Ten Class Issues List are pretty extensive. One is laying on the road with a sign next to it saying &quot;Run over me, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shoot, the Warrior list discussion isn't even at the top of the items on the SoE Warrior site - the Casual Warrior List is, wtf?????!!!!! Our Class Issues should be our #1 Concern! If we aren't advocates for our Class interests, who will be? Knights? Not hardly, they are busy trying to be us and improve their spelbooks at the same time.<br />

I went back and read SoE's SK Class forums and Class Defintion section. I have to admit, I was led astray by reading sk.org (I followed your link and explored a bit) and merely expected the SoE site to reflet it.<br />
<br />

I am quite familiar with the SK list.  I am one of the main posters on that site.  We all have our roles to play.   I am not saying I agree with everything on the Paladin list either but the problem of lumping Knights together is common.<br />
<br />
Like Paladins having an unbalancing buff (AOTC) that stacked with focus and gave them over 350 hp advantage to sk's went on for a year.<br />
<br />
Then this lead to the warriors getting a 500 hp increase while sk's gained nothing.<br />
<br />
(This was only recently fixed when sk' buffs were allowed to stack not as a result of sk' complaints which have been on going but because of palandin complaints that aotc does not stack)<br />
<br />
So now if warriors get increase due to further suggested paladin increases because we have no stuns atm, then that leaves sk' s even further behind both Paladins and warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">they're not really SK only, pally stuns do pretty much the same damn thing as far as aggro. so it's only logical that the only tank class that didnt have it, who is supposed to be THE tank class, got something similar as well.<br />
<br />
Pally stuns can be used to gain agro on a mezed mob without breaking mez?<br />
<br />
Agro abilities were the only reason SKs were occasionally preferred to offtank on raids and to tank in high dps groups.  New warrior agro abilities made warriors the preferred tanks in basically every situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The SK Class Issues Top Ten List is nothing like the Paladin list. Even when discussing the need for a voidance discipline, it focuses on initial contact with the mob and getting heals rolling and not on a tool intended to last the duration of a fight.<br />
This is a huge problem for SKs, we are constantly lumped together with Paladins.  I think that a main reason for this is that the warrior community is large and vocal and since warriors generally lump Pallys and SKs together, so does everyone else.<br />
<br />
Against challanging content, warriors have higher mitigation, more hp, and nice discs to save them.  Paladins have stuns to mitigate some damage.  SKs are left with lifetaps that don't scale with content and basically don't even put a dent in the damage that we are taking.<br />
<br />
There are high end (think top 1%) SKs reporting that they've been one rounded in Tipt even after the content changes.  SKs have NO WAY to deal with this.<br />
<br />
Almost every tank balance discussion on the SK boards centers around &quot;how can we get the upgrades we need without stepping on the warriors' toes&quot;.  SKs are generally okay with the idea that we will never be viable tanks for difficult raids.  All we really want is to not be turned down for single group content because the group &quot;needs a warrior&quot;.  If the group can't heal fast enough at the start of a fight to keep the SK alive until slows/debuffs land and a healing chain can begin, that is a problem.  That is where most of the SK top ten list comes in.<br />
<br />
I think that both Paladins and SKs need some new tools in the form of a short duration voidance disc to help at the start of a fight.  I also think that SKs need a tool that helps them mitigate damage on par with what Paladin stuns do for them.  Neither of these changes should put us on par with warriors for sheer tanking power but they should allow us to do our job against single group content appropriate for our level.</div></div><hr />

Aggro is currently mostly sufficent, provided the will to abuse the spell system. Spell damage has its snarls currently, but they are comparatively minor. What is the issue is that when ugly rears its head, Warriors have /discs as well as the top passive abilities, Paladins have stuns and highly focusable/AAable flash heals, and SKs have much less focusable/AAable lifetaps, which usually leads nicely into another part of the SK spell book, the lovely little spells that use coffins as reagents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gonzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">sooo you want stuff in GoD trials to be as weak as 4 year old content but still drop the uber gear that they do for 1 groupable content? that would be stupid.<br />
<br />
or do you want it to be the other way and have lord bob hit for 1200 and still drop the shit that he does? cause that would be stupid also.<br />
<br />
in order for gear to get better in new content, the mobs have to get harder.<br />
<br />
I believe what I was saying was that the mob's levels in GoD should be raised.  <br />
<br />
Did you even get through my post, or did you jump at the first sentence?<br />
<br />
Look... all Im saying is that a 65 should hit like a 65 throughout the game.  If a 4 year old 65 hits like a Pansy, then Brand New 65's should hit the same.  If they hit harder, then their level number should be raised.<br />
<br />
Parse a 63 Plane of Hate mob and Parse a 63 GoD mob... there is one hell of a difference there.  And there shouldnt be.<br />
<br />
If a &quot;New Content mob&quot; is going to hit for double the damage an &quot;Old Content mob&quot; hits for, making them the same level is absurd.<br />
<br />
Dont forget, this also ties into the level 70 cap.  Are you going to kill a 63 in GoD for experience or are you going to go kill pansy 65's and get to 70 faster?  Or would you prefer that GoD content has level 65's running around as yard trash because they hit like a 65.<br />
<br />
Now dont take this to an extreme.. Im not saying all yard trash in GoD should be 65..  get the point of the message on the whole.<br />
<br />
If something trips or quads 1200 calling that a 63 is absurd.  It should be called 65-66 ish.<br />
<br />
And no, I dont know the exact numbers.  All I know is I can tank 63-65's in old content and cant tank 63's in new content.  I dont think thats right.<br />

Levelling the playing field is the first step in balance.<br />

<br />
Read all three Class Descriptions please. If you do what you'll discover is that:<br />
<br />
Warriors are intended to be beefy without peer, taunt well enough to keep party members safe from harm, and be masters of all weapons. (ALL the characteristics of what we think of as a TANK).<br />
<br />
Paladins are supposed to be melee with heals, stuns, and seriously hurt undead.<br />
<br />
SK's are supposed to be melee with major debuffs and able to produce DPS in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
Each of these basic class descriptions suggest exactly how three different classes could have a role and be fun to play in every environment.<br />
<br />
In a group all three of these classes typically tank:<br />
<br />
A Warrior demands little healing and is a solid taunter with good DPS.<br />
<br />
A Paladin demands more healing but can do some himself especially between fights and can reduce damage taken by stunning and can help with CC.<br />
<br />
An SK demands more healing but can do some himself with lifetaps and can reduce damage taken with debuffs and by reducing the duration of a fight by being able to convert mana into DPS and can either pull or help with pulling.<br />
<br />
The problem is that SoE and Knights themselves kept looking at Warriors and measuring Knights against them. This is as silly as measuring Shaman and Druids against Clerics. YES, each class should be fairly interchanable in groups with marginal class defining advantages in specific situations. BUT they should reach that interchangability by using ALL of the resources they have available - including the unique abilities that make their classes distinct.<br />
<br />
A advoidance/mitigation discipline would make Knights into 100% Warriors in groups (even when tanking a hard hitting single group mob) without having to tap their unique abilities (Spellbooks) at all.<br />
<br />
That's what's wrong with the Knight's need a mitigation disciplne argument. No they don't. They might get one, but it would be a god awful design descision.<br />

Ideally levels wouldn't have been caped and AA abilities would have been given out as players progressed. Today's level 65 with 50 AA's might be level 90 and a 65 with 500 AA's might be level 300. IF this had been the sysyem used then perhaps a mob's con would have been more consistant.<br />
<br />
However, mudflation would have still had an impact. My 52 Paladin can easily solo Blues inside KC continuously, a situation I don't recall being true when Kunark came out. He has no AA's. I imagine that a 52 Warrior with no AA's would have a lot more of a problem. So, player class which means a lot when facing a mob isn't taken into account at all when you con.<br />
<br />
/con has always been a very rough scale that assumes you are up to handling the content you are chosing to fight. It's a progression game that assumes you are progressing.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
I appreciate the candid conversation here.  I really do.<br />
<br />
To be completely honest, I dont know what mudflation means..<br />
<br />
I can grasp your point, tho.  AA's raise your &quot;level&quot;.  Which means you should be able to tank harder and harder mobs..  But, seeing a 63 in one place hit for 500 and seeing a 63 trip 1000 is a little crazy.  <br />
<br />
This doesnt have to be an exact thing, Im just saying that these spreads are really really wide.<br />

<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Right, Wrong, or indifferent, Yes.  We can do this.<br />
<br />
When this usually happens is when the mob is mezzed and the aggro gained is on the Chanter that did the mezzing.  The Paladin will stun a few times (NOT breaking mez) until the mob turns to him.  Then he knows he has Aggro instead of the chanter that will go down faster than... well.. you know..<br />
<br />
Easier to let the chanter cast memblur, tho.. IMHO<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Back when Kanark came out, I retired my 52 Paladin because he was a burden for a group to keep healed and his spellbook/mana was of limited use. Even in a group he couldn't in my mind compete with a Warrior, I understood he'd never MT in a raid again and that was OK, but short of LOH he was poor general melee in a raid too.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Windblade, KIE, FT, Class Diety armor, etc. NEEDED to fight Blues in a group in a place like Maidens Eye, I could instead use those things to very sucessfuly solo inside KC, a place where previously my usefulness in a group was in my mind questionable.<br />
<br />
Mudflation - mobs and the assets players use to kill them get increasingly more powerful. Over time this trivializes previous content. For my level 52 in KC or a level 65 in the Kael Arena today.<br />
<br />
However, if you don't keep pace with mudflation by progressing (and with the 65 level cap that means AA's and equipment) you find new content quite difficult. Basically this means progress or stand in place doing the same content you were doing before new expansions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Er...a lot of our knights go thru tipt fine tanking in ep gear.<br />
Sure, SKs have tanked through Tipt.  The problem is that it's entirely based on the RNG.  There are extremely high end SKs (the 9.5k/2.4k unbuffed variety) reporting that they've been one rounded in Tipt in the last 6 weeks.  There is a thread on SKO that started today where a SK that buffs to 10.6khp and 2.2kac reports that Tipt isn't doable for him yet.<br />
<br />
The overall mitigation gap should not close between wars &amp; Knights.<br />
I believe that the number one thing that most SKs want is a voidance disc of some sort, not more mitigation.<br />
<br />
What is the issue is that when ugly rears its head, Warriors have /discs as well as the top passive abilities, Paladins have stuns and highly focusable/AAable flash heals, and SKs have much less focusable/AAable lifetaps, which usually leads nicely into another part of the SK spell book, the lovely little spells that use coffins as reagents.<br />
Bingo, that's the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe what I was saying was that the mob's levels in GoD should be raised.<br />
The problem with just raising mob levels in GoD is that many combat equations in the game are based on level.  So if you raise the level of the mob, you are going to make it easier for the mob to land hits and harder for a player to hit the mob, even if the mob's ac/atk/dmg remain the same.<br />
<br />
I think the solution here is that both mobs and players should have AA factored into their level.  You shouldn't have leve 65 warriors, you should have level 65.0 warriors, level 65.80 warriors, and level 65.500 warrors.  Similarly, mobs should be assigned &quot;AA levels&quot; based on difficulty.  So a level 65 mob in the old world would be 65.0 where as a level 65 mob in GoD would be 65.300.  Just basing things on level doesn't work at this stage of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Mudflation is an old term.  Basically it means that over time skills/power inflates leaving the previous &quot;cutting edge&quot; content to become trivial.

<br />
 <br />
So now if warriors get increase due to further suggested paladin increases because we have no stuns atm, then that leaves sk' s even further behind both Paladins and warriors <br />

A sum up of why Inferna has been so adamant in this thread (a long time valued contribtor on TSW).<br />

BB<br />
<br />
See there's a problem with this line of thinking.  While I think Knight's getting specific spell-like abilities to make them fairly interchangeable with warriors SHOULD be the answer, in EQ's current design, it just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
With mobs hitting as hard as they are today in GoD, any spell based answer would be severely overpowered compared to their parent spell casting class.  <br />
<br />
For example, an answer to pallies and their mitigation problem might be a 1second cast super fast self heal that heals for a significant amount - 2 or 3k or something (because GoD mobs hit that hard).   Or the ability to stun anything and everything.  How would clerics, druids, and shaman deal with this?  And warriors are already complaining about stun mitigation on blue/white mobs.<br />
<br />
What about shadowknights?  How would necros see a 1500-2000hp 1sec lifetap?  They already complain about the better resist rate on the SK tap.   But said lifetap may alleviate some of the tanking concerns SKs have. <br />
<br />
Any change will end up stepping on somebody's toes, because thats the way hybrids are designed.  The entire premise of 75% tank, 25% something else just doesn't work on content that is new or cutting edge.  Assuming that premise means you are relegating knights to content that is older, because they do not possess any capability to be effective in the new (because of their being partial everything just isn't effective enough in any arena except old, already mastered content).  The correct solution would be to determine what knight's are supposed to be - tank or caster.  Then you develop solutions from there.  Of course, you'll never have SoE doing that....they like to skirt the issues.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's right that any class should be relegated to older content till the specialized classes get through it first.  All classes should be viable in any content that is released, in my opinion, but like you said with advantages going out to each class depending on certain specific circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">SK's are supposed to be melee with major debuffs and able to produce DPS in a variety of ways.<br />
SK &quot;debuffs&quot; don't help at all with tanking.  Our best ac/atk &quot;taps&quot; don't actually change the mob's ac/atk, so they aren't debuffs.  Our resist debuffs are too small to matter and don't stack with better debuffs from other classes.  As for our dps, other than a single occasional burst from HT, SK dps isn't much different from warrior dps.<br />
<br />
An SK demands more healing but can do some himself with lifetaps and can reduce damage taken with debuffs and by reducing the duration of a fight by being able to convert mana into DPS and can either pull or help with pulling.<br />
First, keep resists and immune mobs out of this as all 3 classes have special cases where their abilities don't work.  With that in mind, warrior discs scale with mob damage, so they work equally well on mobs regardless of the mob's damage output.  Paladin stuns also work equally well on all mobs, no matter their damage output.  SK lifetaps, on the other hand, don't scale.  Our best lifetap is less than a single round of damage on most GoD mobs and we generally can't cast it more than 1-2 times per fight due to the recast time.<br />
<br />
BUT they should reach that interchangability by using ALL of the resources they have available - including the unique abilities that make their classes distinct.<br />
SKs don't have the unique abilities necessary to make them interchangable as tanks in single group content right now.<br />
<br />
A advoidance/mitigation discipline would make Knights into 100% Warriors in groups (even when tanking a hard hitting single group mob) without having to tap their unique abilities (Spellbooks) at all.<br />
SKs do have endurance yet all of our current discs are basically useless.  We may have spellbooks but that doesn't mean all of our abilities should be spell based.  Warriors often act like knights should only receive spell based upgrades.  Part of our solution should be melee based though and discs are the path for melee upgrades.  A small avoidance disc would certainly be keeping the spirit of our &quot;part melee, part caster&quot; nature.</div></div><hr />

If SKs and Pallys were given undead tanking abilities (say a nice avoidance disc that only worked vs. undead, or maybe better innate mitigation vs. undead) AND a large portion (say 30%+, including nameds) of all new content were undead, I could deal with this.

<br />
Unfortunately, there is a critical failure here, nearly as critical as the pre-melee adjustment warrior issues with aggro. The Shadow Knight is not capable of significantly altering the combat abilities of a mob. Let me say it again, for emphasis. The Shadow Knight has no debuffs which appreciably alter the damage output of a mob, either alone, or in combination.<br />
<br />
Searching the high end spell book for stackable debuffs that reduce strength, dexterity(Hi, Chaos Claws!), attack, Chance to Hit, and Melee Damage Reduction, we find the following:<br />
Abduction of Strength: -25 STR, with personal Recourse.<br />
Asystole: -12?(Can't check right now) STR, with DOT effect. As a note, very highly resisted.<br />
Torrent of Hate: -40 atk, with group recourse. As a note, very highly resisted.<br />
<br />
... Yeah. -40 atk is within Margin of Error on a many-hour parse. It doesn't buy time, it doesn't nullify spikes. It might save 1 cheal over the course of an hour. <br />
<br />
People ask for disciplines because they know they work, and because the SK has never been able to bring significant debuffs to the table. We're used to standing on the toes of warriors and necros. We're supposed to go jump up and down on the shaman's feet now too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Xwraithx,<br />

We come right back to our observations. I see Knights tanking normal adds and normal experiance group mobs just like Warriors. After all when a Warrior isn't using Defensive the difference is not great at all and more than made up by spellbooks. You'll never convince me otherwise.<br />
<br />
I do ocassionally see a Knight getting splated by a red hard hitting mob, particularly a boss mob split or named. That to my mind is where a Warrior's unmatched survivability comes into play.<br />
<br />
You may not like the Warrior Class Description or Brenlo's assertion that Warriors are supposed to tank better than Knights, but that's the way the game is and how it's been for a very loooooong time.<br />
<br />
Instead of throwing up your hands and saying SoE will never fix our spellbooks, I believe that it's necessary to hold SoE to their assertions.<br />
<br />
Read your class description. See the comment abvout debuffing? Where is it? What's your best debuff and how does it stack up???<br />
<br />
ALL classes are entitled to have a role and be fun to play in all environments with unique capabilites taht make them distinct and justify their existance as a separate class in EQ. I'm paraphrasing Brenlo on this.<br />
<br />
For goodness sake, that to my mind is a heck of a lot better vision of EQ than what y'all have had - mini-Warriors with ineffective spellbooks is foolish in the extreme.<br />
<br />
When OoW settles in and we see where the classes are with respect to content, then be sure to hold SoE to:<br />
ALL classes are entitled to have a role and be fun to play in all environments with unique capabilites that make them distinct and justify their existance as a separate class in EQ.<br />
<br />
That's why I chose not to have a spellbook and you chose to have one. My choice was Primary Tank, yours was Death Knight. I'm supposed to be the class that plants it's feet and can't be moved. You are supposed to be an able fighter that wracks your opponents with fear and ruin inspiring shrieks of terror and gibbering while they helplessly await the fall of your cold iron sword.<br />
<br />
We've had far to much class blurring and far to little attention to what makes classes unique and fun to play. If anything is going to retain players, it's not going to be 3 equal tanks with different names and little else to distinquish them.<br />

<br />
yep, but EQ has never been a game where classes were &quot;viable in any content that is released&quot;. things are moving along its history but never any content as been tuned to be beatable by x players. they all have been tuned to be beated by x1 Bard, x2 Beastlord, x3 Berserker, ... and so on till the wizard.

that's why a warior can't be replaced by another tank before this other tank gets one step futher, and the same apply to us on other event. The pb is that when the diff event don't have the same reward, then some are prefered to other : ie the RvR is different from classes to classes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">We come right back to our observations. I see Knights tanking normal adds and normal experiance group mobs just like Warriors. After all when a Warrior isn't using Defensive the difference is not great at all and more than made up by spellbooks. You'll never convince me otherwise.<br />
<br />
I do ocassionally see a Knight getting splated by a red hard hitting mob, particularly a boss mob split or named. That to my mind is where a Warrior's unmatched survivability comes into play.<br />
The problem with this is that when people get together to do single group content, the goal is generally to kill the nameds.  It's one thing for SKs to not be viable tanks against raid mobs that require 50+ people to kill.  It's entirely different when a SK has to pray the RNG doesn't one round him in order to tank the boss of a GoD trial or and LDoN assassinate.<br />
<br />
SKs need a tool that allows us to tank the nameds in single group content.  An avoidance disc is one option.  A self buff that provides mitigation or avoidance or *scaleable* self-healing is another.  An atk or haste tap that cripples the mob significantly is another.  There are plenty of options here but something has to be done.<br />
<br />
One minor problem with spell based solutions is the limitation on spell gems and the fact that self buffs take up limited buff slots.  I've heard that they're going to be adding ways to get additional spell gems and buff slots in OoW, so this may help.  However, if warriors can still run with the same number of buffs as SKs and a SK is required to drop group buffs in order to use his self-buffs, that doesnt fix the problem at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>xwraithx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">For goodness sake, that to my mind is a heck of a lot better vision of EQ than what y'all have had - mini-Warriors with ineffective spellbooks is foolish in the extreme.<br />
<br />
When OoW settles in and we see where the classes are with respect to content, then be sure to hold SoE to:<br />
ALL classes are entitled to have a role and be fun to play in all environments with unique capabilites that make them distinct and justify their existance as a separate class in EQ.<br />
<br />
That's why I chose not to have a spellbook and you chose to have one. My choice was Primary Tank, yours was Death Knight. I'm supposed to be the class that plants it's feet and can't be moved. You are supposed to be an able fighter that wracks your opponents with fear and ruin inspiring shrieks of terror and gibbering while they helplessly await the fall of your cold iron sword.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Ok first things first.  I don't play an SK.  I play a 65 pally as primary, and I also have access to some 65 warriors that I fiddle with now and then (hence my interest in TSW).  My comments are not about how I want defensive, or what I chose over what, or anything like that.<br />
<br />
My entire point is that because of the way SOE has decided to design mob difficulty in GoD you can not balance knights via spellbook.  This is because any fix to the spellbook will create even MORE unbalancing problems, which I addressed in my post before.  If pallies can stun all mobs, and SKs can debuff mobs to the point of tolerability or chain lifetap for 1-2-3k every time, that will totally unbalance the environment via the spell casting side.  You don't see that happening?<br />
<br />
I absolutely and totally agree that balance fixes for knights should come from their spell castnig side.  I mean that is the difference between knights and warriors, right?  But it is my opinion that EQ is too fubared in design at the moment to allow this.  The easiest way to fix certain things is via melee balance, using already existing tools (discs that already exist and things like that) to do it (again my opinion....SOE is known to go the path of least resistance IE the easiest and laziest thing to do).  Also, do not go overboard on changes.  Make small changes first like a 2 or 3 tick parry disc to knights, and see how that pans out.  Big changes all at once can throw the equation out of whack.<br />
<br />
I also disagree that you should have to wait for a new expansion to be able to enjoy the full capabilities of each class.  Each expansion SHOULD not break an existing class, but rather should provide opportunities to make that class better/funner/more interesting.  Sadly, SoE is not good with that either.<br />
<br />
Currently, in GoD, the specialists are running the show, and everyone else is an added bonus.  That shouldn't be the way it is.  There should be clearly defined roles (tank, healer, dps, CC) and each class should fit into one niche as a primary role with their skills (both spells and discs) mainly focused on that primary job, and another niche as a secondary with some skills to allow for this.  And all roles and their associated classes should be equally WANTED (NOT NEEDED~!) to fill each role in a group.<br />
<br />
But again, that's not how EQ is designed.  I think I am just griping at an overall badly designed class system.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm jumping around....I tend to type stuff up as it comes to me rather than organizing my thoughts :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  This is bad game design.  Instead of thinking of individual classes, they should be thinking archtype role, and how to fit that role into a big event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">The thing about balancing tanks is that the devs would prefer to make content challenging to both knights and warriors.  For that to be possible the tanking gap between warriors and knights MUST be relatively small.  There's no way around it.  Because of that, any significant tanking upgrades that we get, they'll get too.  Or something equivalent.<br />
<br />
If we want upgrades that don't automatically also go to knights then we have to look at things that don't increase our tanking ability.  Basically that leaves us with DPS and utility.  Our DPS can only be increased so much before the DPS classes start to complain.  So the only way we'll get any significant improvements is through utility.  That's the only category where we are so inept that there's absolutely no chance of stepping on anyone's toes.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm sure it's always easier to look at the Warrior plate and say, well Warirors have X and try to find a rare situation where Knights would need X too till Warirors have nothing distinctive. Better I think is to see what Knights need consistant with their ways of accomplishing their roles and strengthening and expanding those capabilities as needed.<br />
<br />
My concern is when that approach means a melee hybrid creates  a wish list that translates to Tank like a Warrior and heal like a Cleric or cast like a Necro. Better is to be a viable Paladin or SK without having to glance at &quot;parent class&quot; capabilities and say &quot;But Warriors have&quot; or &quot;Necros have&quot; , or &quot;Clerics have&quot;.<br />
<br />
And I disagree Khumak. Warriors can be made into such superlative Warriors that it's pointless for any class to aspire to be Warrior-like. Who would want a pale imitation when you can have the real thing? The same applies to Knights - who would want a Ranger when you need a Paladin?<br />

Actually what BB says makes a lot of sense.  Only problem is our Oow spells are not providing this.<br />

The amount of debuff you would need to make a significant difference would be huge and I don't see us getting it.<br />

On the other hand many warriors have supported us getting a short term avoidence disk even the warrior class correspondant Frodlin has said this would be supported.</div></div><hr />

Step back and rethink what your class was created to be, and how your class can be improved upon without trying to compare yourselves to Warriors.<br />

It is my belief that the Devs originally coded the superior damage mitigation for Warriors based on their ideal role of the Warrior. I also think they will continue Warriors' tanking superiority to suit their EQ vision and ours(EQ players).<br />

I would like to hear from the Dev Team about what they have received for feedback so far about class balance vs. content and see what they have to say about their EQ vision, and if they think it is on par.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that this would stack with defensive if there is both a warrior and an SK in the group.  A warrior/SK group would then be so absurdly overpowered compared to any other group that you could never create balanced encounters.<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns do stack with defensive (on stunnable encounters).  However, stuns are high agro so a defensive warrior may not be able to hold agro over a chain-stunning paladin.  A SK could feign after his atk debuf to keep agro on the defensive warrior.<br />
<br />
I think any SK solution is going to have to be a self buff or a disc to avoid stacking with warrior defensive.  I don't see any other solutions if warriors are going to continue to be allowed to use defensive/evasive on one group encounters (something that probably isn't going to change except on the occasional mob).</div></div><hr />

Step back and rethink what your class was created to be, and how your class can be improved upon without trying to compare yourselves to Warriors.<br />
Warriors were created to be tanks in all situations.  Knights were created to be tanks in single group content, offtanks on raids, and to fill secondary rolls on raids.  The problem is that knights (especially SKs) do not have the tools necessary to tank newer single group content.  When it comes to tanking single group content, we should compare ourselves to warriors because WE ARE FILLING THE SAME ROLE.<br />
<br />
For SK's issues; Maybe SOE could or should be looking at improving SK Lifetaps on NPCs....bigger, better, less interupted lifetaps.<br />

I can't really disaggree with you, however IMO SK's should consistant with their class character make creatures writhe and be weakened. Stealing some of a creature's attack, stealing some of it's hitponts, or having it freeze for a moment in fear is to my mind more in character than self buffing like a Paladin or blinding it with Flash of Divine Light.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping SoE will be imaginative. My eldest son quit playing EQ primarily because SK's had become weak Warriors with a weak spellbook. I believe he wanted to be a certain DE Ranger dual wielding Adamantite Scimiters. Barring that he wanted to be Lord Soth Knight of the Black Rose. My middle son wanted to emulate Sturm Brightblade. And I of course Flint Fireforge. Our expectations never truly leave us and copying another classes's charateristics just because it's an easy route to having our needs met while nulifying their class advantages is not a good way to go. Sturm and Flynt were not the same characters.<br />
<br />
We all have certain class expectations and in my view at least it is the differences and our expectaions of what they mean that led us to be attached to one class and not another.<br />
<br />
I wish SoE would expand groups to 8 (I realize they won't) so it could focus on classes and how they interact and compliment each other rather than focus on narrow &quot;roles&quot;. It is this focus on roles that will prevent me from playing any of the MMoRPG's currently headed to market. No way am I going to play a Guardian or a Paladin main with a Monk sub-job so I can be a &quot;tank&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>xwraithx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">But are you starting to see my point now?<br />
<br />
If SK get new accuracy debuff, it can be abused via warrior/SK in group, since SK can FD.  That will trivialize plenty mobs when combined with warrior defensive.  Not to mention to allow SK to have parity, the debuff will have to be pretty powerful to the point of overshadowing Shammy slow.  Or worse, combined with it.<br />
<br />
That's exactly an example about the point I was making.  A tiny change like that spell can throw off the entire raid game.<br />
<br />
I wish knights would be fixed via a spell solution, but it has to have 2 caveats for it to work.<br />
<br />
1)  It has to be simple.  SoE has in never in the past exerted a decent amount of work to make a change.  They've always gone with the easiest fix, even if it isnt the best.<br />
<br />
2) It has to be thought out carefully and tested carefully to make sure it does not upset any equations that are, for all intents and purposes, balanced today.<br />
<br />
That's why I honestly think SoE will go about fixing things via melee.  There seems to be less factors along that path to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">With level 70 being claimed as the appropiate highend tankng level for GOD any balancing and gameplay tweaking in similiar regard should wait until after the new expansion comes out imo.<br />
<br />
We just hit time so my post doesn't take into account peoples GOD experiences past grouping in KT.Whatever they have done with tuning content there; any knight closure of the overall mitigation gap with warriors(including all discs that migate damage)will unbalance Knights in comparison to warriors imo for at least all previous content.Soe just upgraded the warrior overall mitigation advantage to restore balance between our classes.Any discs and relavent mitigation type spell casting must be included in this measure because they will affect the class balance in gameplay.I'm not  sure that knights shouldn't get a fortitude type disc of similiar or weaker power.Just that it would improve their overall ability to mitigate incoming damage and close the gap to warriors.Some further balancing ,or ,increase of warrior mitigation may be required to balance this.<br />
<br />
1)Arathena,are you talking about higher end GOD raid content when you say that aggro and dps enhancements would not address sk issues?If so those isssues may be alleviated with the new expansion.As far as other content go's I don't see a problem for our knights.They tank all the same group content I do and the stronger knights by virtue of better snap aggro generation tan more than our lighter warriors on raids.<br />
<br />
It seems that you are focusing solely on tanking equivalency to paladins.Are SK's supposed to  exactly balance in this regard?I know they have been most often utilized in pop in this manner,but, I thought they were the offensive half of the Knight group.Personally,I'd rather see them with their own niche.SK's imo should be the masters of hate/fear and offensive tanking.Paladin aggro if anything should be much less than an sk's in this light.Paladin and warrior aggro is probably a little strong atm.If SK's are basically going to be relagated to the same position as paladins with their class identity's effectively blurred than they should have either old spell lines upgraded or new ones developed to equal pally stunning.I think the whole stun concept is hard to balance and often makes tamking ridiculously trivial for paladins tho.If this is the only way can they not code a seizure of fear type spell to mimmick paladin stun effects?Of course sk's can't have it both ways and I would rather they be something differant than paladins in dark armor...<br />
<br />
Overall mitigation abilities for knights in GOD must  still be subject to a balancing against the warrior class and any increase in this area should result in a simliar upgrade to warriors.<br />
<br />
2) Gonzo,I don't think coding mob level is that simple to balance difficulty.Level plays a big role in recieving and dishing out damage.GOD mobs hit harder because older content mobs have not kept pace with player aa,gear and especially the new level jump coming up.They have been strengthened to provide more challenge and really I could care less rather one level 65 in GOD hits harder than a level 65 trash mob in HOH.Level has never been the sole measure of mob difficulty.<br />
<br />
3)Noctix...keeping in mind its an expansion created for people with an extra 5 levels of hp/mitigation blance agains the mobs...<br />
<br />
a) Tipt ...k thats fine if some people seem to be having trouble there,but, erm our knights are not high end.We just broke into time and have not yet begun farming there.Our Knights that routinely tank in tipt are around 9-9.7k and  under 2k ac.What was one rounding these guys? The most I see trash do is quad for just over 1k.In your case I would take a good pet team and hope for very good luck,but, we have knights of much lighter weight that tank there often then those you've used as examples.Nevermind level 70.<br />
<br />
b) Avoidance/parry/riposte discs are all forms of mitigation that go directly to a classes ability to manage incoming damage.I tank most everything for my guild often without any discs as we pull to fast.However, all such discs must be factored into class mitigation balance.<br />
<br />
c) What are you tanking that you can't interchange with paladins and warriors of the same content level?Bearing in mind that there is supposed to be an obvious differance between a warrior and knight tanking the same mob our knights can tank almost everything I do.Warriors go splat all the time due to healer focus not being on them.They have extra tools to increase their chances of picking up heals,but, furiousand fortitude are often down and defensive not enough.Still they are better at surviving incoming damage as warriors are intended to be.Our stronger knights can tank all of our trash mobs and the majority of our bosses with a little more healing than I often use un disced imo.<br />
<br />
Again, level 70 is coming soon with more aa.What that will do for highend players raiding GOD is yet to be seen.However,class balance was just adjusted to better balance warriors against knights and give back their #1 tanking identity.Warriors are not hybrids and most of us don't want utility imo.We just want to be obviously the strongest class at absorbing damage for our friends and guilds.This includes an overall balance of discs occasionally available for use and undisced tanking....it's all part of the same package.</div></div><hr />

Ok.. this is the funniest thing ive read in a long time. Sorry to break it to you but thanks to the defensive nerf that annoyed BB so much, warriors have no overwhelming advantage in Tipt. If a SK with 10.6k hps cant tank the kyv, he better buy his cleric some healing spells.

I think you missed this part of Brael's suggestion:<br />

A SK couldn't chain cast this spell so it wouldn't really do that much over the course of a fight.  The key use for it would be to help the SK mitigate a little bit of damage at the very start of a fight, before the mob is slowed and when the healers are first getting settled in.</div></div><hr />

Ive healed Jirhu with my cleric and knights tanking several times. Ive done it with a time equipped paladin with myself being the only healer since the changes. It wasnt hard at all (even when I had to heal rampage on a monk also). Maybe your friend needs to bring more then 1 healer, or a healer who pays attention and uses the correct spells. Ive done Tipt at least 50 times now, with a huge variety of characters and 2box combinations. Right now he is *extremely* easy compared to how he was before the defensive nerf.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I was attempting to find out when I started this thread and the two on the soe boards.<br />
<br />
What the thread has revealed is the content tune has been succesful for Knights that are time geared which is beyond the content.  This follows SoE past practice of Knights needing to be geared beyond content in order to be able to tank hard hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
So I guess this was the target they were shooting for and it appears it is succesful so far as I can see.</div></div><hr />

That's partially because there aren't enough SKs for our complaints about anything to be widespread  :D <br />
<br />
Tipt has been acknowledged as having had a content tuning problem. If SK's believe they ought to be capable of getting this flag and can't, then they should report the continued tuning problem to SoE with parses to back it up.<br />
This is being discussed on SKO already.<br />
<br />
I didn't really mean to derail this thread into a matter of balancing Tipt.  Tipt is just what I've been reading about the most lately so I used that as an example.<br />
<br />
Here's another example.  I play almost exclusively single gorup content.  That means I've done a lot of LDoN.  My group did probably 100+ 65 normals, all collects or slaughters, before we even tried a 65 hard.  At that point, we could handle 3-4 pulls no problem and win in 30-45 minutes consistantly.  One night we decided to try an assassinate, since the boss for that adventure would be similar to what we might see in a 65 hard.<br />
<br />
We got to the boss in about 30 minutes.  We then spent the next hour or so dying repeatedly as the boss slaughtered us about a dozen times.  Every time I aggroed the mob, I'd be dead in just a couple seconds.  Finally I tried using my rogue to tank (I 3box).  I popped my riposte disc, was able to survive long enough for malo and slow to land, and then my rogue tanked the mob to about 50% before I got around to snagging agro back with my SK.<br />
<br />
Somehow this didn't make me feel that my SK is interchangable with a warrior on single group content.</div></div><hr />

SoE's caving in on Knight demands on the GoD single group manditory individual flag content (1 group trials) has either confused or emboldened some Knights to pretend they are confused.<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to be better tanks than Knights period at the same progression level vs. non trivial mobs. I MT'd single groupable harder hitting mobs well in advance of Knights at my progression level in every expansion starting with Kunark.<br />
<br />
Warriors tank and melee. Knights tank, melee, and do other things as well. Versus normal mobs in moderately challanging content a Knight's total package of abilities is supposed to make him as worthwhile to group as a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Versus an exceptional or boss mob when a Warrior's class defining abiities that will not be shared are needed to succeed, Warriors shine. Warriors always (since Kunark) have had an easier time MTing hard hitting boss mobs. That doesn't mean Knights won't catch up, they most assuridly will. That Assassinate you had difficulty with at 5ish K HP's unbuffed is easily done by Inferna - yet both of you are level 65.<br />
<br />
Inferna approaches calling Tipt PoTime+ for SK's. I claim it's EP+ (if that, actually I think is barely EP), which is exactly what many Paladins specifically requested.<br />
<br />
Let's remember, Tanks (as contrasted with players that face the mob, taunt, and pray they don't die) are just as responsible for having every last AC and HP they can possibly get when facing a hard hiting mob as a caster having the needed spells. If a Cleric needs SL or HL, I better not be seeing a CH and hearing the excuse &quot;Oh, I haven't gotten those spells yet.&quot;<br />

Noctix, you haven't gotten those AC and HP's yet. Tipt isn't even hard, it's been nerfed - a lot.<br />

The LDoN experience I mentioned happened a few months ago when I had considerably lower ac/hp.  I can tank LDoN hards consistantly now.  Not that my current progression stage is really the point here.<br />
<br />
I know that it is my job, as a tank, to have proper ac and hp.  That's why my SK is still farming LDoN instead of heading to GoD.  I never suggested that I should be able to tank Tipt (although warriors at my progression level can).  But I think many of the 7-8k unbuffed SKs who are claiming they can't tank Tipt should be able to.  Having seen first hand the problems that SKs can have tanking nameds in single group content, I can see where we are lacking certain tools necessary to do our job.<br />
<br />
Almost every class can perform their job in GoD up through Tipt with pre-elemental gear.  My rogue and wizard certainly can and they're not even geared as well as my SK.  Pre-elemental warriors can also.  SKs and Pallys can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">My concern is when that approach means a melee hybrid creates  a wish list that translates to Tank like a Warrior and heal like a Cleric or cast like a Necro. Better is to be a viable Paladin or SK without having to glance at &quot;parent class&quot; capabilities and say &quot;But Warriors have&quot; or &quot;Necros have&quot; , or &quot;Clerics have&quot;.<br />
<br />
And I disagree Khumak. Warriors can be made into such superlative Warriors that it's pointless for any class to aspire to be Warrior-like. Who would want a pale imitation when you can have the real thing? The same applies to Knights - who would want a Ranger when you need a Paladin?<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
The problem with that line of logic is that warriors, paladins, and SKs all share the same primary function &quot;tank&quot;.  They compete for tank spots in groups, not main healer spots or DPS spots.  Obviously warriors should be better at it since we are specialists, but for single group situations knights need to be close enough to be roughly interchangeable as a group tank.  The warrior raid role specialty of tanking bosses means that we are also superior at tanking named in XP groups.  That's fine and most knights are okay with that as long as the gap is small enough that a named that is not trivial for a warrior is at most difficult for a knight, not impossible.<br />
<br />
There's a certain balance that has to be maintained between the 3 tank classes at their core function.  Other than some single group named in GoD most people agree that the current balance is just about right.  To maintain that balance, any significant tanking upgrades warriors get, knights would have to get equivalent abilities unless it only affects raid bosses.  Knights will get improvements to their secondary abilities and that doesn't threaten our superiority as tanks.  If we get improvements to our tanking abilities and they don't then that WILL threaten their viability as group tanks.<br />
<br />
Because of that, there are basically 2 types of upgrades that we can ask for.  The first kind is tanking upgrades that all 3 tanks will wind up getting.  The second kind is secondary upgrades that don't affect tanking such as DPS and utility.  Those can safely be given to just warriors without upsetting balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">The problem with your thinking Khumak is that Knight secondary abilities figure in their desirability in groups and raids. They are NOT just Tanks. Depending on which class you talk about, they are pullers, healers, CC, undead mulchers, buffers, ressers, snarers, burst damage etc. And where they are ineffective at performing these many traditional capabilities, they should be improved.<br />
<br />
I prefer a system where Warriors are the Primary Tank and Knights are desireable as add tanks in raids and in group MT slots because of their total package of abilities, I want to see unique classes with a substantial reason to exist as distinct classes, not 3 tank classes doing the same exact function in groups and raids - two having atrophied spellbooks.<br />
<br />
As long as Knights are imitation Warriors, no raid will be cancelled because of a lack of Knights and no guild will find a compelling reason to use Knights to tank anything rather than a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Warriors will always (and must always) tank better than Knights. As Medium Tanks, what can Knights bring to the table that Warirors can not? /point Spellbook - help with CC, group heals, debuffs, burst damage, assisting the pull team, versatility and flexability to affect the situation when the poo hits the fan while picking up unmezzable adds and handling them, using a stun to save a Cleric getting hammered by one of four adds in camp when AE Taunt is rendered useless, transfering aggro from an exceptionally hard hitting mob to a beefy tank, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
You can not simultainiously eliminate the Warrior hard hitting mob advantage and allow Knight spellbooks to have real impact. Knights are NOT Tanks, they are Tank/Casters, else there is no reason for them to exist.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason why Warriors can not specialize in hard hitting mobs to a degree Knights can not match while Knight are focused on things like raids adds and multi-role raid versatility without destroying group balance. However, major increases in Knight spellbook usefullness must be accompianied be improvements in Wariror survivability (often unneeded in groups) - you don't maintain a balanced scale by adding weight to just one side. You don't &quot;fix&quot; a complex class like Knights by making them Warirors.<br />

That sounds like a cleric issue, not a tanking issue. Assuming your cleric isn't a dumbass - though most are - and actually knows what burst healing is, I'd say your cleric is scared. If your cleric burst heals fine but things still go wrong, make sure that cleric has Arbitration, Subtlety3, and Bulwark of Vie. Note that if you still get shredded before BoV fades, it's not a cleric or a tanking issue, it's gear (the extra 10% mitigation pushes you from knight to warrior-level tanking). If that still fails, get your cleric a healing focus and Holy Light; the difference between SL and HL is huge when it comes to Jhiru/Ikkinz/whatever. If that still doesn't work, try not 3-boxing or DI, I dunno.<br />
<br />
Having done way too many mountain trials pre and post-nerf, with all manner of tanks from pre-elemental to post-time, knights tank fine. Chaining Supernal on an elemental paladin got me my first win against Jhiru pre-nerf; with Holy Light and Discordant Healing now, I dozed off during Jhiru healing a warrior using a droga combo, who didn't disc at all because he thought he couldn't use furious on it either. Tipt isn't that hard.<br />
<br />
I'll agree Shadow Knights are somewhat underpowered in very-high risk single group situations, but that doesn't mean a tanking upgrade is the only solution (or even a solution at all). Warriors would need more utility to counter-balance a knight tanking upgrade, blurring class lines retardedly.<br />
<br />
In one of the many threads arguing about knight mini-defensive, Arathena and I discussed my idea of a major SK debuff instead of giving them a defensive disc. I later retracted that idea because knights don't need it in post-nerf Gates, and because there was no clean way to prevent stacking that major debuff with defensive when a warrior is tanking - future content would have to be balanced against it.<br />
<br />
My version of a spellbook solution for Shadow Knights is simplistically two-fold.<br />
<br />
Add SHD/61 to Cripple and give it a recast time of 4 so that it won't be chain cast for aggro; giving them a significant debuff for group situations, but not creating something new that future raid content would need to be balanced against. This also decreases the workload/aggro on enchanter/shaman, since they won't be using cripple. Using a spectrum of abilities to overlap and help other group members do their job (be it paladins with healing, or shadow knights with pulling or this suggested cripple) is what being a generalist class is all about. Don't even try to tell me you can't channel a 2.5 second spell, I channel HL (2.4 sec with focus and Reverence) myself reasonably well against trash mobs up to Txevu.<br />
<br />
Retune Zevfeer's Bite so that it's not resisted often except by highly-resistant mobs. I've seen lots of complaints about it being resisted often at Disease -500, so change it to something like Magic -150. Tweak the mana slightly so it's 10 to 12 per tick sustained, *after* factoring in resists against average-resist mobs. <br />
<br />
Those two changes would help SK tanking without blurring class lines or going too far, fits with the class description, and gives Shadow Knights a bit of a secondary role that not many classes have - mana battery. Shadow Knights won't ever be able to tank as well as an equally geared warrior, and will therefore always require more healing mana. That means that the secondary mana role balances the primary tanking role. More mana is being spent healing, but there's more mana coming in to balance that need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Personally, I'm still very attached to the idea of a major SK debuff, because it solves most of the defensively oriented gradient between stuns and the big wad of nothing in the SK toolbox. As well, to my viewpoint, the fact that it can and will stack with both stuns and warrior /disciplines is something that I see as a major benefit, not a detraction. It would be a comparatively simple manner to go through the major encounters in PoP / GoD, and hit them with an 'you lose~' immunity to SK debuff flag, while giving an SK a meaningful contribution to a group where he is not the tank beyond sub-par DPS/Pulling. With the availability of partial and total immunity, balancing a new line of debuffing should not be drastically difficult. <br />
<br />
This last benefit is something that I feel is highly important: A skilled paladin can be another tank's best friend in a support role: With the comination of stun, flash heals, root, and dispell, a paladin can add his own mitigation techniques to another tank's, while still being available to offtank. He can hold his own through secondary skills, every single fight, without the need to tank. For the SK, however, if off tanking is not required, a monk or bard is an infinitely superior support member for any of the SK secondary tasks, pulling, damage, or inferior mana-battery. This is the real appeal of the debuffing SK - While capable of tanking, he is thorougly capable of holding his own in any environment, reguardless of the need for his primary skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that its possible that more than a few warriors are concerned about the parry/riposte disc idea due to the suggestions on another excrutiatingly(sp) long thread here on TSW where knights (a few, not all) were suggesting a 4 tick/2 min reuse avoidance disc...  I also think that even tho wiht the melee upgrades, ranger WS pulls aren't as utilized as they once were, if knights were to be given an avoidance disc that it shouldn't infringe on the ranger WS niche and shouldn't be more than 2 ticks every 40-60 minutes... thats enough to pop during a named pull for a buffer while not really being able to do much more, it could also help during raids as a paladin/sk could be sacrificial when MT dies to bossmobs... again just suggestions and thoughts :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">What do the warrior/paladin/sk communities think of maybe giving Paladins an improved version of RGC say... 12x5 instead of 9x5 and a cast time of 2 seconds... that would improve their raid desireability, at least a little, and I couldn't really see it stepping on too many toes... most clerics would be busy healing, and shaman/druids could still stack dots and play with adds and what not, leaving the Sks and druids/shaman in charge of add tanking and what not on those add intensive encounters... just a thought and friendly suggestion for increasing Paladin's raid desireability through spellbooks.<br />
<br />
With the exception of maybe bards, paladins already have the best compact cure spells in the game. They're also the only class that gets a new cure spell in OoW, curing 30/30/15 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5283&amp;source=Live) instead of 20/20/5 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3190&amp;source=Live). They don't need any more help there, nor would it increase their raid desirability - they're already the best at it. Clerics have a better poison cure, and shaman/beastlord have a better disease cure, but paladins have that generalist class versatility and can cure all three.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm still very attached to the idea of a major SK debuff, because it solves most of the defensively oriented gradient between stuns and the big wad of nothing in the SK toolbox. As well, to my viewpoint, the fact that it can and will stack with both stuns and warrior /disciplines is something that I see as a major benefit, not a detraction. It would be a comparatively simple manner to go through the major encounters in PoP / GoD, and hit them with an 'you lose~' immunity to SK debuff flag, while giving an SK a meaningful contribution to a group where he is not the tank beyond sub-par DPS/Pulling. With the availability of partial and total immunity, balancing a new line of debuffing should not be drastically difficult.<br />
<br />
I'll use a couple examples to illustrate, starting with a medium-end PoP encounter - Fennin Ro. This is a raid mob (usually) tanked by a warrior, that requires a lot of steady healing. His damage spikes and AE are such that - after defensive wears off - having high AC is critical. A new shadow knight major ATK debuff, even on the low side at around 200 or so, could very well mean that a warrior with 2000AC now tanks it as if he had 2200AC. The effect this would have on damage spikes is huge. A damage modifier debuff like my &quot;Virus&quot; idea a few months back would have an even greater effect. Future raid content would need to be balanced against that, simply by giving raid mobs 200 more ATK than they would've had.<br />
<br />
Heartstriker Jhiru is a Gates encounter that requires the exact opposite - burst healing over a short duration. A new SK debuff on its own would be balanced here, except for the fact that you could bring a warrior to tank and use the SK debuff to trivialize the encounter. Future single-group content would need to be balanced against the fact that people will just bring a warrior *and* a shadow knight.<br />
<br />
In both cases, it gives shadow knights a secondary role which, as a cleric, I can very much understand wanting. The problems lie in the fact that for raid content, unless it is mini-defensive caliber and has a 10-minute refresh, guilds will still only need one SK. If it does have a long refresh, not only will guilds just load up on shadow knights, but it will still be used on every difficult mob, allowing lower-end guilds to kill things they really shouldn't (the VT guild that beat an Ikkinz raid, for example, would happen a lot more often). While it would be good to give shadow knights more group desirability, it would make them a required class for future very-high risk single-group content, and it would be a bad move on Sony's part to make any more classes (especially a generalist) required.<br />
<br />
Of course, we could give the example mobs mitigation or immunity to a new SK debuff, but as far as I know, mitigation to a non-percentage debuff isn't codeable right now (if it were, Qvic/Txevu trash would mitigate mez and stun, not outright resist it 80% of the time). Mitigation to a damage modifier debuff should be codeable, but it's so overpowering both mobs would have to be immune to it. Net result, we're right back where we started from, shadow knights are still having trouble tanking very-high risk encounters, but mobs in those encounters must remain immune/resistant/mitigant to the new debuff otherwise it would be trivial for warriors. Thereby accomplishing nothing.<br />
<br />
This last benefit is something that I feel is highly important: A skilled paladin can be another tank's best friend in a support role: With the comination of stun, flash heals, root, and dispell, a paladin can add his own mitigation techniques to another tank's, while still being available to offtank. He can hold his own through secondary skills, every single fight, without the need to tank. For the SK, however, if off tanking is not required, a monk or bard is an infinitely superior support member for any of the SK secondary tasks, pulling, damage, or inferior mana-battery. This is the real appeal of the debuffing SK - While capable of tanking, he is thorougly capable of holding his own in any environment, reguardless of the need for his primary skill.<br />
<br />
The other day I was in a Kod'Taz group that had 2 warriors and a paladin. The paladin had much better gear than the warriors, so he tanked. I'm sure every warrior here will echo this question, but I'll ask it anyway: What mitigation techniques could a warrior add to a paladin? &quot;Assisted tanking&quot; as it were is something only paladins have (due to their defensive utility, as opposed to shadow knights' offensive utility and warriors' zero utility) and for it to be given to shadow knights, some form of it would need to be given to warriors as well. Like shadow knights, when a warrior isn't tanking, dps is all they have. Giving &quot;assisted tanking&quot; to all three tank classes would blur class lines.<br />
<br />
My previous suggestions still stand; cripple is a debuff that has a significant effect, and content is already balanced against it. 10 to 12 mana per tick sustained would make shadow knights 3rd place in mana (bards 19 per tick, chanters 18, beastlords 9, druids 8, mages 7.2, necromancers variable), and mana regen stacks better than tanking or healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Sorry this is kinda long, but I'd like to see the opinions of a number of posters on this thread.<br />
<br />
I believe that in order for SK's to be a viable class they should bring something to the table consistant with most players expectations (at least in part as layed out in their Class Descriptions).<br />
<br />
Take a look at that single groupable hard hitting named mob.<br />
<br />
A Warrior has base level DPS, unmatched survivability and Furious. A Paladin has in the best of all possible worlds a damage producing weapon buff and a damage augment rather than an Anger aug (providing near base level DPS), heals, LoH, and Group Heals, and potentially a stun (although in practice seldom the case) providing stun mitigation. All these assets are very class consistant.<br />
<br />
IMO the SK ought to have a damage producing weapon buff and a damage augment rather than an Anger aug (providing near base level DPS), useful healing via life taps, damage using multiple sources (pet, HT, spears, lifetap), the manabattery capability you've pointed out, and mob debuffing - ideally stealing a mob's attack or strength and getting it for himself. Potentially they ought to be able to produce an effect like stun mitigation with a Fear-like spell. All very class consistant, but largely unimplimented or impractical given the way their spellcasting and tanking conflict.<br />
<br />
I frankly don't much care if SK's get a new debuff or an SK version of the Shaman Cripple spell that doesn't stack with it, except that a debuff capability is SK class consistant.<br />
<br />
My point is that it ought to me possible for all 3 Plate tanks to acheive near same results vs. a single groupable named mob using shared base level tanking plus their unique (at least among Plate tank) assets. If that means that each class has a better fit with different group compositions then this should be minimal. Vs. single groupable named mobs the goal s/b interchangability without eliminating the use of class unique abilities.<br />
<br />
Using the same philosophy to find different raids roles where a Warrior might be a specialized Meat Tank, a Paladin a specialized Protector (add tank, pulls aggro instantly off Casters, combat medic, CC) and an SK add tank, significant melee DPS, burst DPS, aggro maniputator/assigner, debuffer, and pull team member seems to me not only to be possible, but desireable.<br />
<br />
I think for too long the design direction for Knights has been terribly wrong headed. Determined to put aside &quot;The Vision&quot; and sensitive about the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; we've had years of class blurring. Instead, what we need is what Brenlo pointed out - Classes that are fun to play and have a role[/s] in all enviornments having unique capabilities that justify their existance as distinct classes. That's ALL (except for preserving traditional roles) that I'm advocating.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Ciae, your major point against appears to be that all future major encounters would require balancing against this new ability line, correct? I would argue that without such an effect, the addition of an ability to the SK is primarily meritless. Currently, there are only two spell casting classes whose abilities do not require extra effort put into balancing, the SK and the Ranger. The fact that the ability would require being taken into account rather than just ignored as current SK debuffs appear to be would be an excellent measure of its potency. I am billed as a debuffing class in my description, while druids, bards, and mages are all more effective at debuffs than I am. Further, BoVie is a prime previously added balance-raping example that comes to mind, never mind the fact that when OoW hits the shelves, current encounter balance goes down the toilet bowl faster than light. As for guilds still only needing one SK, a guild only needs one shaman, but how many guild roll willingly without multiples?<br />
<br />
As for the SK-warrior stacking issue, allow me these points. Currently, a warrior, through /shield, is significantly more effective at tank stacking than the shadow knight. Yes, I know /shield sucks, but it saves lives much more than Torrent of Hate does. However, given gear equivalence, the warrior will tank. He should. However, the SK gave up the superiority of pure tanking for the nebulous concept of utility, a utility he does not currently have. Saying that because a given shadow knight can exceed a warrior's gear, and thus cannot have a debuff, is not unlike saying a druid cannot have snare because the druid can have more mana/FT than the cleric, and thus should be doing the majority of the healing while the cleric twiddles his thumbs. Instead, unless the cleric is a naked, drooling moron, he handles the bulk of healing, while the druid brings to bear the full spread of his utility, which is a hell of a lot more than just DPS. <br />
<br />
Utility must be a full package. Mana Regen/DPS/Inferior pulling is not sufficently viable to motivate the decision to bring an SK over availble alternatives. Currently, every one of those mana regen classes you've listed is capable of exceeding the SK in DPS and pulling duties, while still bringing buffs, debuffs, and various random other abilities to the table - Jumping a sustained Zbite from 6-8(16-19 if you have the ancient and burn multiple spellgems) to 10-12 mana per tick isn't going to help change the current utility deficency much.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't have to be this way.  Imagine (although I'm not necessarily advocating) a knight defensive disc, 60-90 second duration, -7 or so to DI.  True raid bosses can be flagged immune to this disc (this is already in the game with the warrior defensive &quot;nerf&quot;), but adds and single group/trial nameds wouldn't be.  Not as long lasting, less effective, and no opening riposte disc means that warriors are still better for these mobs, but now knights have a reasonable chance of survival and chain/leather classes (with their parry/short term mitigation discs) are well behind. <br />
<br />
<br />
as opposed to shadow knights' offensive utility and warriors' zero utility)<br />
With a pet and a dot and spear on every mob, SK DPS will equal warrior DPS +- 5%.  When tanking, a warrior's riposte disc is about equal to a SK's HT, and infinitely more useful.  I would, however, argue that survivability is a form of utility, and outside of FD (which doesn't do much for the group's survivability when mobs are in the camp), warriors have better survivability than SKs.<br />

Keep in mind that SK mana regen comes at the expensive of their own mana (for example, unfocused, a BL will use 425 mana for 45 minutes of 9/tick regen for his group, a SK, under the best conditions will use ZB 45 times at the cost of 4500 mana for 10/tick regen), requires a mob to be in camp at the time of gem refresh to max efficiency, can be resisted, and requires a spell gem at all times (i.e can't be swapped in as needed).  Also, Bards, chanters, beastlords, and druids all have a point at which their mana regen spell has regened back the cost of casting their spell; SKs never reach this point.<br />

On KT content when I use spears due to the resist rate and disease not being debuffed your going to get out of 10 casts 2 total resists, 6 partial resists, one crit (not sure if it will be a max crit) and 2 will land for full 660 damage value.<br />
<br />
The recast time is 45 seconds.  So you can only cast it on one mob at at time and if your pulling fast maybe only once every mob and half or so. You not going to dot because the mob will be dead in a couple of ticks after you cast it and at 160 damage a tick its a waste to use it<br />
<br />
The pet will be dead the first engrage or riposte if your tanking and if your not then you going to need to make sure u position it behind the mob.  The pets average dps is around 20 dps but you will see less on mobs that are high level since it is only level 41.</div></div><hr />

Ciae was arguing that powerful SK debuffs would mean that mobs would need to tuned around them.  I offered a counter-perspective showing that abilities can work on lesser mobs but not on greater mobs.  A Vie-like spell or reverse lifetap spell (heals you when the mobs hits you) could just as easily be made to work on trial/single group mobs and not on raid mobs.<br />
<br />
Debuffs are, plain and simple, complete bullshit in today's game.    The only debuffs that matter are Malos[inia], Tash, and Slow.  Mobs die too quickly for debuffs to matter, and for mobs that don't die quickly (ie. raid mobs), SK debuffs will always be lesser than what other classes can cast (they don't have to be, but I can't see SKs getting unique and/or stronger versions of debuffs cast by the other classes).  Between trying to cast spells for aggro and trying to cast taps to stay alive (forget about trying to cast spears and dots to keep up with Warrior DPS), just when are SKs supposed to cast these debuffs?   30 seconds into the fight when the mob is half dead?  Any SK debuff would have to also incorporate aggro generation or lifetap effects for them to have half a chance of being worthwhile.   If they did have one of those effects, and the debuff effect was, well, effective (see previous post with link to SC thread on cripple doing pretty much nothing), these could be a worthwhile solution.<br />
<br />
What also goes forgotten is that much of a knight's spell book (of which I'm most familiar with are SK spells) is designed to ensure a knight &quot;keeps pace&quot; with a warrior.  A warrior turns on auto-attack and gets the best HP, best AC, best mitigation, equivalent (to SKs anyway) DPS,  and probably the best long term aggro generation.  They don't have to choose.  As an SK, I have to pick.  I'm not complaining, but it's not like I'm summoning a corpse while keeping rock solid aggro and doting and spearing to make up the DPS gap while tapping to make up the HP gap and keeping Aura of Pain  up to close the AC gap and...Again, don't think I'm bitching, but only 2 of my 8 spell gems are truly unique (FD and snare), the rest of the lineup are things a warrior essentially gets innately.<br />
<br />
I'm not discounting some key abilities knights have through spells, which, I'm assuming you'd argue is the tradeoff for Defensive.  The difference, though, is that knights could unmem all their spells and all it would require is some adjustments of tactics and class composition.  Have the warrior not use Defensive, and progression flat out stalls.  On large scale raid encounters, warrior MT'ing is fine.  The question becomes whether MT'ing smaller scale (1 group) progression content should be in such large favor of warriors also.  I suspect we'd disagree on the answer :)<br />

Unmatched doesn't have to mean &quot;no one else can.&quot;  As I see it, the two issues are: 1) which mobs a tank class is supposed to have reasonable success against, and 2) how that success is achieved.  Of course, issue 1 can be further expanded by raid versus one group named versus normal exp mobs and as to what reasonable success means (which could vary by tank class too).<br />
<br />
<br />
In both cases there's a denial that Knights (SK's) aren't Warirors<br />
Knights are tanks.  Where we differ would be our list of mobs for issue number 1 above. We are probably in agreement that traditional raid mobs that require a multi-group force should be warrior only, but on one group/trial nameds we'd differ on what should be knight tankable and with what degree of success.  My gut says that for one group/trial nameds (at appropriate progression level, I'm not talking about trying to 1-group  AoW), knight survivabiltity should be about 10% behind warrior's.  Get too far behind that, and knights cease to be tanks and are just liabilities.<br />

Which don't heal enough, don't help with being one rounded or with damage spikes, have to be channeled through mob attacks, and have to be cast at the expense of better DPS spells and better aggro spells.<br />

plus debuffing<br />
Which currently amounts to -10 to resists with a recourse effect (1 less buff box for the group), -40Str and -18 AC through a dot, and -35 ATK at the expense of another group buff slot, not to mention stacking problems with other ATK buffs.  And not much else.<br />
<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
With real, effective debuffs along with some improvements to lifetaps and a few other things, the  &quot;etc.&quot; catergory becomes less important, although I suspect that we could argue over what, if anything, should go here until we are blue in the face.  There are plenty of suggestions made by respected SKs that could go into the &quot;etc.&quot; category that would help the class without infringing on warrior territory.<br />

<br />
Stuns have a set duration, when the mob is slowed youre avoiding less damage overall for a set period of time. Your idea has no set duration and will last longer if a mob is debuffed. Stuns also have level caps, resists and immune mobs.<br />
<br />
Comparing to warrior discs (which is retarded in the first place because they are part of our existing tanking advantage) is also highly problematic. Fortitude has a 45 minute reuse, you are proposing an ability which could almost emulate fortitude in alot of situations, with a 36 second reuse time. Fortitude, like stuns, last a set amount of time so when a mob is slowed it stops less damage overall.<br />
<br />
Defensive does scale to yes, but in a much different way to what youre suggesting. Defensive also has very little to do with your idea because it isnt a melee invulnerabilty like you are proposing. You still take 55% of the DI + the DB, so how hard a particular mob is actually hitting does come into play. Your suggestion is total melee immunity which doesnt factor how hard the mob is hitting into the equation at all. Also, if a mob is slowed defensive doesnt suddenly last 3x as long.<br />
<br />
Lets be serious, a mob is slowed and its hitting (lets say) every 3 seconds. If its doubling AND it hits every swing then you have 6-9 seconds of melee immunity. If it quads, you have at 3-6 seconds of melee immunity, supposing EVERY hit lands. Every time it misses, that time extends. Then 36 seconds later you repeat. How is that in any way remotely balanced vs 12 second immunity every 45minutes? In the absolute WORST case scanario, you are totally immune to melee damage about 12% of the time. Ill say it again, if they implemented this idea then they better make stuns land on everything and change the re-use time on fortitude to 72 seconds, because thats what youre asking for.</div></div><hr />

I love threads like these. I went and visited some friends last week and just the other day I was wondering how mnay wonderful debates I was missings. I checked the new posts pages and got just about to the end of reading them all, resigned that I would get to read any Knight bashing.<br />
<br />
I'm so glad i was wrong.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think we should add a &quot;knight-bashing&quot; flag for threads like the &quot;sticky&quot; flags so that I know where the action is at, but then I realized that we just need to be able to see how many pages long a thread is on the new posts page and it'l do the same thing. (long sentence, still unsure where/if I should have broke that up.)<br />

When hunting every newly encountered named single-groupable mob in the game since Kunark, as a Warrior I have had major survivability advantages over other Plate Tanks. Note that I've never had FD, a pet, Fear, snare, Stun (other than Kick stun), and a plethora of other abilities associated with the Knight Class Descriptions and not mentioned in mine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unmatched&quot; survivability does have to mean what it says to some extent or Warriors are in the position where what they get instead of a spellbook is without value.<br />
<br />
So the Myconid King starts out Warrior only and as time progresess, Knights get to tank him too.<br />
<br />
Why ever group a Warrior at all if Knights are Warrior+ in all group situations? I'll tell you why - EhEmTea tell you, &quot;We're doing a named in Kod'Taz (and we don't yet trust the ability of a Knight to tank it) - wanna come?&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember, all the single group individual required flag content was nerfed to heck and back. The last bastion where Warriors aren't simply Knights without Spellbooks is cutting edge named mobs. Everywhere else in all group content, we are Knights without Spellbooks.<br />
<br />
You and Brael are obviously trying to convert Warriors into Knights without Spellbooks in ALL content except for those lucky enough to MT a raid named mob for a few minutes a couple of time a week (providing the named raid mob isn't, like all content though to Quarm himself Knight tankable).<br />
<br />
Brael isn't satisfied with a &quot;Rut roh&quot; 20 second autoparry disc available every half hour. He wants to be a Warrior with a Spellbook or better yet, a Super Warrior with a Spellbook.<br />
<br />
Want unmatched survivability or real burst mitigation useful for MTing during a significant portion of a battle? Roll a Warrior. Sure other classes get burst mitigation, but they are not Tanks. Coincidence? I think not.<br />

<br />
This has been hashed out on many threads before now, I'm sorry you missed the error in this arguement, but I'll point it out to you in case you missed it.<br />
Clerics always outheal the other priest, all the time, not just 10 minutes when they hit a &quot;healing disc&quot;. That difference is very apparent even in experience groups. They heal at least 40% better than the other priests, all the time.<br />
<br />
Cheal was not given to shamans and druids. They are similar, but in no way are they even in the same ballpark of each other. First they cap the % that can be healed, then they gave it higher mana cost, and lastly, the max it heals for is less than Cheal.<br />
<br />
Clerics have been designed with healing superiority built into all their spells. Cheal has not been given to the other classes, and neither has their healing ability been given to other classes. The cleric class defining ability has not been given to other classes.<br />
<br />
With that said, the analogy between cleric vs priest and warrior vs knights is not that apparent. Warriors do not have a significant innate tanking advantage. In experience groups, the healer will be hard pressed to tell the difference in tanking ability between comparitively geared tanks, warriors or knights. The only time warriors are significantly better tanks than the same geared knight is when using thier defensive discs and even then only against high DI mobs and defensive.<br />
<br />
Any other time warrior is just a knight without a spellbook.<br />
<br />
If you would like things to exactly like cleric vs preists, and insist that defensive discs be given to the knights then I'm sure you won't mind getting a watered down version and warriors recieving an innate &quot;always on&quot; tanking superiority that allows them to mitigate melee damage 40% better than knights. Then your cleric analogy will be complete.<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating this, just pointing out the error in trying to use cheal as an example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Clerics always outheal the other priest, all the time, not just 10 minutes when they hit a &quot;healing disc&quot;.

<br />
Depends on your perspective.<br />
Paladins heal faster.<br />
Shamans heal over times are more efficient.<br />
There are situational advantages, yes, but not across the board.<br />
<br />
Cheal was not given to shamans and druids. They are similar, but in no way are they even in the same ballpark of each other. First they cap the % that can be healed, then they gave it higher mana cost, and lastly, the max it heals for is less than Cheal.<br />
These would be the same differences partial defensive would have... less damage reduction power, and higher cost. Yet with those limitations, the same things that you're saying are &quot;not even in the same ballpark&quot; as complete heal, those same concepts when applied to a partial defensive are all of a sudden too close? You can't have it both ways.<br />
<br />
Clerics have been designed with healing superiority built into all their spells. Cheal has not been given to the other classes, and neither has their healing ability been given to other classes. The cleric class defining ability has not been given to other classes.<br />
As have warriors been designed with tanking superiority with all of their armour and abilities. <br />
Yes, it HAS been given to other classes. The ability itself is commonly linked to clerical CH when talking about balance. The ability given to another class has led the class to assume the role in certain of groups, that a cleric would have HAD to take, before the changes. If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, guess what, it's a duck.<br />
<br />
Let's apply that to the theoretical addiction of a knight's defensive along the same lines as a druid/shaman CH. The ability would be commonly linked to warrior defensive when talking about balance. The ability given to another class would lead the class to assume the role in certain of groups, that a warrior would have HAD to take, before the changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that said, the analogy between cleric vs priest and warrior vs knights is not that apparent. Warriors do not have a significant innate tanking advantage.<br />
That all depends on what you feel is a &quot;significant&quot; advantage, as there is a proven advantage to having a warrior tank instead of a hybrid, MOST ESPECIALLY on named. On named, the difference is nothing short of huge.<br />
<br />
<br />
In experience groups, the healer will be hard pressed to tell the difference in tanking ability between comparitively geared tanks, warriors or knights.<br />
On trash tanking, maybe. I can simply swap weapons and clerics can and have many times notice a big differenc. And that's with a simple difference in weapons and procs, image what spells could do! On named tanking, which is the problem that some say exist, and that a knight's defensive would address, there is a huge difference.<br />
At the same time, hybrids can be better than warriors on trash mobs with other things such as aggro control as well, just as dru/shm are better on XP group mobs with DPS and slows, etc. That has to be taken into account as well.<br />
<br />
 The only time warriors are significantly better tanks than the same geared knight is when using thier defensive discs and even then only against high DI mobs and defensive.<br />
Except for the high DI mobs, which is incorrect (after all, a warrior has an advantage even on high DB mobs by simply using evasive instead of defensive) that's the thing that some people would consider to be a problem, that the gap is TOO wide between knights and warriors on named tanking.<br />
<br />
You can't have it both ways with trying to argue how the addition of partial CH wasn't a big addition at all because it's so much less powerful that it's &quot;not in the same league&quot; as clerical CH, so it doesn't really matter, and then argue the opposite, and say that same level of power of an ability given to knights is somehow overpowered.<br />
<br />
To understand how partial CH and CH is so similar to partial defensive and defensive, you have to understand the application of the abilities, and the role they would fulfill in the game. In that case, CH is an ability that has a wider impact in the game. Limit partial defensive with the knights to the named tanking role alone, and it's very close to the XP-group (in its entirety) role that the partial CHeal was implemented to address.<br />
<br />
As I've previously stated, I'm unsure as to whether knight defensive is really needed or not. One thing's for sure, OoWar will have to come out and the balance changes have to settle out  before it's really looked at seriously. But what I'm really concerned about, is throwing words from devs around like they've come down from God himself, when the reality is devs change their minds about what they will and will not do on a constant basis, and many times have done exactly what they said they will not do.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, unless you think LOH alone is considered a viable healing strategy.<br />
<br />
Shamans heal over times are more efficient. <br />
<br />
marginally more efficient HOT that heals alot slower.<br />
<br />
Clerics have an enormous healing advantage across the board in every area, nothing comes close to chain HL for hp/second healing, and nothing comes close to CH for efficiency. Holy elixir and divine arb provide an enormous pool of totally agro-free healing on multipulls, an extremely important part of being an effective healer. In Uqua, id guess about 90% of our healer deaths are druids dying to early heal agro. Clerics also get by far the best group heals, which become extremely important in qvic/inktuta/txevu. <br />
<br />
There is no portion of the healing equation where clerics come out 2nd best to another class.</div></div><hr />

The problem you come across is this:<br />
<br />
The addition of &quot;mini CH's&quot; is a terrible example, and I'll tell you why.   In the VERY same change, Clerics were supposed to have been given a set of tools which allowed them to solo, only less efficiently than druids and shamans as &quot;compensation&quot;.<br />
<br />
That promise was broken the day it went live when the hammer was nerfed into oblivion (thanks to the lovely fellows over at Paladins of Norrath), but the promise was OBLITERATED in PoP because clerics, in order to take advantage of this newfound ability to solo at a slightly lower efficiency than druids and shamans, they have to be taking swings at mobs (and thus have swings taken at them as well).   They coudln't stand up to the mobs in question, this has gotten even worse in GoD for them.  Cleric soloing simply is no longer an option.    Thus they were asked, or more accurately &quot;forced&quot; to give up something that set them apart, and received nothing realistic in return which they were promised, and which was stated quite clearly when the &quot;change&quot; was announced was a goal, which was that clerics needed a way to be able to solo to face the loss of opportunities.<br />
<br />
That has been put out in the &quot;oh well&quot; left field of obscurity, and clerics got hosed.    In the meantime, druids who got bored soloing frogs in Storms or aggro kiting at fire tables or duoing all of BoT with enchanters could go get a 'fair shot&quot; at groups with their new incomplete heal.   I'm sorry, this is wrong, and if this is the example you want to set forth, then it's the wrong one.   Clerics experienced a net loss, and there's no way to argue that they got what they were promised, which was a new way to solo at the same efficiency loss as druids and shamans got with the heals.    They got a new way to solo at the Chardok entrance... yeah thanks.  <br />
<br />
Now that the content has been changed, I'm not interested in seeing the same kind of giveaway that happenned to clerics, they got completely hosed.</div></div><hr />

It not needed a lot to nerf this. You only need to make a parse and every parse shown that a cleric meleeing outdps 90% of the knights with a castable waepons.<br />
<br />
You call that balance, that a cleric can outdps a knight with melee?<br />
<br />
If not, then dont bring up this anti paladin stuff. Which only have the sense to create an anti paladin area.<br />
<br />
You guys talk nonsense anyway. There can happen 2 things in OOW. <br />
<br />
1. The stuns knigh get will total destroy balance and make us to the new best tankclass for every situation which exist. Because we have unlimited 'defensiv' with stuns. (total overpowered)<br />
<br />
2.) Stuns will be like now. They make us to the best tank in situation when even enchanter can tank and get more and more useless as stronger mobs get because they resist it or are stunimmun. (useless)<br />
<br />
Defensiv was the worst thing they was able to create. Now they are on the way to create defensiv II for paladins which are named 'stuns'. Both are not balanceable and will lead to bitching from the class which got the black peter. If they give us this stuns and they work. Bye, bye warrior superness and welcome knights superness...<br />
<br />
The best way still is to remove defensiv and stuns and balance migration right. This nonsense with disciplines and stuns only lead to unbalancable content.<br />

Yes, CH was whored out to other priests as mini-CH, and all we got for it was Yaulp5. Frodlin is right, and I can see Arbosch remembers the &quot;Fastest Nerf in History&quot; as well as I do.<br />
<br />
It not needed a lot to nerf this. You only need to make a parse and every parse shown that a cleric meleeing outdps 90% of the knights with a castable waepons.<br />
<br />
A VT cleric, level 60, at 255 dex, could do about 25dps with a Hammer of Souls. A bazaar-geared cleric, level 65, 280 dex, will do about 32. A potime cleric, 305 dex, using a Hammer of Holy Vengeance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20627), does about 38. I don't believe for a second that a paladin can't beat that, but apparently your fine steel long sword parses over at PoN proved me wrong and got our hammer nerfed. It doesn't matter in the end, a dev said on EQCleric long ago that Hammer of Souls was stealth-retuned to Hammer of Judgement's original proc rate, and the level 63 hammer is even higher than that.<br />
<br />
When Sony whored clerics' CH out to the other priests as part of Priest Rebalancing during Luclin, we were a dead class outside of raids. I had to use that nerfed hammer (Thanks again for misleading devs about that, Arbosch) to solo low blue guards in echo for hours on end because it was the only xp I could find. Outside of raids, we were pretty much a dead class. PoP saved us from total marginalization in a couple of ways.<br />
<br />
First of all, Divine Arbitration. It's even faster than a paladin heal, it's aggro-free, it's mana-free, it's our panic button. We use it for healing group members on raids between CH on the tank, we use it as one last heal on the tank when we're out of mana, we use it for everything. It's a unique cleric tool.<br />
<br />
Secondly, and much, much more importantly, is the reason CH and mini-CH aren't at all comparable to defensive and mini-defensive: We were given a secondary role. Clerics' high-hps, fast casting heal spells didn't exist until PoP, which released about 2 weeks after Priest Rebalancing ended.<br />
<br />
Before mini-CH:<br />
Cleric - Divine Light (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1519&amp;source=Live), 2.6 hp/mana, 130 hps (including cycle time)<br />
Remedy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1518&amp;source=Live), 2.5 hp/mana, 79.63 hps<br />
<br />
Druid - Nature's Touch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1291&amp;source=Live), 2.445 hp/mana, 122.25 hps<br />
Chloroblast (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1290&amp;source=Live), 2.445 hp/mana, 77.81 hps<br />
<br />
Before PoP, cleric and druid point heals were nearly identical. The only difference was that clerics had CH. When Sony gave CH to druids, we were given a secondary healing role that not only do most clerics not recognize, they don't even realize it.<br />
<br />
Cleric - Supernal Light (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3480&amp;source=Live), 4.583 hp/mana, 440 hps (including cycle time)<br />
<br />
Druid - Nature's Infusion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3443&amp;source=Live), 3.5 hp/mana, 280 hps<br />
<br />
Part of that low hp/mana is balanced by the fact that druids have better mana regen than clerics, the gap widening even farther in OoW. Clerics' better point heals to keep up when CH doesn't work, plus Arbitration as a panic button, plus good ol' rez is what brought new life into the cleric class when PoP released. Not to mention the fact that standard trash mobs became exponentially tougher, scaring people into bringing clerics. So Daemonwynd, what exactly is warriors' secondary tanking role that will keep your class afloat should defensive ever be whored out to knights? I sure can't think of anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever played a cleric? Because I have no idea where your numbers are coming from. At all. Light spells' recast time is less than their fizzle time, so there's no reason, ever, to chain Holy Light with Supernal. Also, +healing and mana preservation focus effects are random - focus could add 1% healing and 1% mana preservation to one cast, then the next cast could be 38% +healing and 14% mana preservation, etc. Only increases from AA - Healing Adept, SCM for example, are constant, except for effects that increase duration or range (Extension effects).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">As a side note, during the early luclin era, wielding a 25/25 1 hander at capped haste, I parsed at roughly 20-25 DPS against a comparatively high AC mob(Cazic thule lizards). Of course, as soon as I put the shield down and got out my 40/45 epic, my damage output more than doubled, to around 50-60 DPS. Our primal/priceless monk, meanwhile, was pushing 100 DPS, and our primal/epic rogues were pushing 120. Old-time knight one hander DPS was patheticly anemic, especially on Luclin itself, where mob AC greatly exceeded everyone's attack, and the 100 or so point attack penalty innate in being a knight came into play. It's still rock stupid for a knight to wield a one hander before he gets the elemental drops, for much the same reason - Grimrors has enough vengance to catch our attack up to the baseline, while high rato weapons such as the Gem Encrusted Axe have enough punch to catch up to 75-80% of the damage of our comparative 2 handers. <br />
<br />
It doesn't make the nerf on the cleric hammers any more justified, however, people forget just how effective a penalty the 20 points of offense and 20 points of weapons skill really are.</div></div><hr />

Defensiv was the worst thing they was able to create.<br />
Defensive was perhaps the most ingenious discipline or spell ever put into the game. I'll be only too happy to explain why.<br />
<br />
1. Warrior and Knight base level tanking (when Warriors are not using a discipline to augment their survivability) is actually quite close. If anyone wants to contend that there is a huge gap because of differences in the visable armor sets, &quot;-1 DI&quot;, and Warrior HP advantges that isn't offset by Knight utility and versatility in normal experiance groups then go right ahead - it'll be fun dubunking your assertions. There is a gap and there should be, BUT<br />
<br />
2. Warrior tanking supremacy, thanks to to the brilliant design of Defensive is limited in it's application. Since it can be active only 3 out of every 13 minutes, it's saved for when it's needed. Warriors don't use Defensive for mobs encountered in normal experiance groups, plow tanking, or raid add tanking. They save Defensive for exceptionally hard hitting red mobs (generally named mobs and splits). This insures Knights can, if they choose to focus on Tank gear, have a group and raid tanking role.<br />
<br />
It being 3 out of 13 minutes insures that Knights can even MT such mobs when their gear, BoV, and a little more attention from healers permits - I think Afterlife's sucess in having non-Wariors MT all of PoTime amply illustrates that named mobs don't sart out as Warrior tankable only and remain so forever.<br />
<br />
Since Defensive only effects the DI portion of melee damage from a mob, mobs can be designed to minimize it's impact with a mob's proc, DS, AE DD, etc. as well as self-blurring, Knockback, Fear, etc.<br />
<br />
With a full range of methods to insure that Warriors are not the prefered raid MT, Verant and SoE have maintained them in this role. Is that's what bothering some Knights? Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's and in some content the difference will be noticable?<br />
<br />
Arbosch, Jovec, Brael, Soledragondead, et al - Warriors have the unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles. It would be the height of absurdity for such battles to be encountered in cutting edge content once a day for one Warrior. In cutting edge content, brutal mobs are encountered with some frequency, giving Warriors an opprotunity to use their Class Defining Ability that will not be shared.<br />
<br />
Do Knights not have a spellbook, disciplines, and abilities? Do they not use them? Seeing one central defining cability they don't have, must they like the Ferengi try to invoke the Rules of Acquisition and have this too? Isn't being able to HP buff for more than a Cleric, 90% Res, GRC, heal like a Shaman, etc. worth anything? How about Fear kite to 65, FD pull, HT, lifetap, spear, etc.<br />
<br />
Does class jealousy run so deep in some people so they must either outdo Warriors at their own game as Bael has proposed two different ways or they must remove the Warrior Class Defining Ability as Arbosh has proposed even before GoD was released? Seriously, if you want to be a Warrior THAT badly, roll one.<br />
<br />
What can't you tank in GoD that you contend you should be able to tank Brael? (I won't ask Arbosch, Jovec, Soledragondead, et al - they aren't dedicated Tanks, they putter around and expect to be able to compete with the Primary Tank).<br />

D. Inferna, you claim that &quot;In the guild I was in previous to the one I am in now&quot; (longwinded, for what I assume to mean your last guild &quot;...all day long as I would hear Defensive! in guild chat&quot;.<br />
<br />
May I inquire as to why you left your previous guild? Was that guild having problems content wise? More specifically, were Warriors dying often on raids when they tanked? Were they a little trigger happy on their defensive discs, leaving them grayed out for when they really needed them?<br />
<br />
Obviously a Warrior can sit all day and spam use his defensive discs, endurance permitting. A Paladin, in some of the better exp spots in PoP (not too sure about GoD) can sit all day and spam use their healing and stun spells to mitigate damage, mana permitting. A Shadow Knight is the most limited of the three, but even they can sit all day and spam their lifetaps (I am not claiming this is even close to as efficient as the prior two examples, but by the same token I did not want to overlook SKs), mana permitting.<br />
<br />
The smarter Warriors will save their defensive disc for when it's needed. The smarter Paladins will save their mana to mitigate damage when it is needed. The smarter Shadow Knights will save their mana in the same way, although it will most likely be to a lesser degree of efficiency than the first two examples. Obviously, on easier enemies, neither of these three options are necessary, now are they? <br />
<br />
So yes, Warriors can use defensive in exp groups, every so often, endurance permitting (which it probably won't permit if they're using it everytime it's up, especially in conjunction with our incite line!!!) If you had the choice to group with a Warrior that misused his discs, and a Warrior that had a bit more knowledge and saved them for maybe that next named coming up, which would you chose? Which do you think would do better in performing his (her) class role?<br />
<br />
Have you ever used LoH in an experience group? Have Shadow Knights ever used HT in an experience group? Probably! Was it necessary? Maybe! But then again, maybe not!<br />
<br />
<br />
I constantly sit and see a multitude of clerics lfg. Face it, it's a fact. Clerics at one time, were both some of the better cash makers (due to their frequent ability to get a group, thus at least share in a split, if not a chance to roll on a dropped item) as well as the most sought out class to group with. There isn't a shortage, there's an abundance of them. I personally will not take another healing class in place of a cleric, for most of the experience spots I go to. I certainly will not take one to GoD trials or KT, and I wouldn't even rely on one in an ldon (corpse runs suck) or an elemental group (too much spike damage compared with easier PoP areas) unless that druid was Time geared +. I wouldn't DREAM of taking a shaman - my wife is a shaman, we levelled together, and what perhaps was once considered an average ability to keep me alive, but her healing as a main healer will simply not cut it anymore. Her CH heals for too little, with the same cast time as every other CH, and her spotheals are too mana consuming. If she keeps Quinessence on me, it does of course make the healing easier...but again, it's too mana consuming. No way she'd be able to heal rampage damage simultaneously as keeping me alive. Well, let me correct that; she would be able to, but that'd be it for her entire mana bar nearly. It's not a reliable sort of healing that you could expect continuous pulls with.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't buy it. No guilds will break up over a lack of shaman or druids. You rarely see a raid being called for lack of either of those classes, unless you have zero of either, and then it's more for the loss of their BUFFS and not of their HEALING. Are they useful spothealers, yes, but it's not a critical role that can't be filled or done without. On a raid, clerics are the meat of the healing, don't try to deny it. The game would NOT have been drastically different, people would NOT have flocked away because of lack of experiance groups. Verant built nearly every raid encounter from Velious up with the level 39 cleric spell Complete Heal in mind, and almost nothing has changed since - it's only in GoD that CHs are being vacated, in favor of faster spotheals, because of streaky damage. But the CH rotation has not died yet, and I daresay it might never.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem you come across is this:<br />
<br />
The addition of &quot;mini CH's&quot; is a terrible example, and I'll tell you why.   In the VERY same change, Clerics were supposed to have been given a set of tools which allowed them to solo, only less efficiently than druids and shamans as &quot;compensation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Heh, that reminds me of the warrior addition we were supposed to get in Phase 2 melee balance in the new abillities, they didn't just get nerfed, they get cancelled altogether.<br />
<br />
It of course is not a perfect comparison. When you're talking about changes to classes whose role is wholly different, it never is. However given how vastly different it is, the similarities that remain are striking.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
Umm, a 1 second 850 point heal is nowhere near the healing/second of Holy Light. When I think of &quot;fast&quot; healing I think of doing the most healing per unit of time.. not getting off a weak heal quickly. Or maybe you think that minor heal with its 1 second cast time is a clerics &quot;fastest healing&quot;? Arguing semantics wont change the fact that clerics heal far faster then paladins.<br />
<br />
You, sir, are the one arguing semantics here.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
So Daemonwynd, what exactly is warriors' secondary tanking role that will keep your class afloat should defensive ever be whored out to knights? I sure can't think of anything<br />
<br />
Secondary role? Who needs a secondary role? Warriors are so good in their primary role, and mini defensive would be, if properly balanced, such a minor class balancing  addition, that we would not need a secondary role. Although granted, if knights were to get a mini defensive, I think it's only fair that warriors should be granted a mini spellbook as welll, berserker type abilities as an example to snare and stun.<br />
Knights would not suddenly be preferred over warriors in zones like KT, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">BB you dont unterstand balance.<br />
<br />
For groups there should not exist a single mob in this game which is not tankable from a knight. This should not exist if we talk about balance. Knights are tanks in groupe. This is our role. If you dont aggree with this for single groups where only 6 people can join we dont have to go further. If something is limited to a single groupe and so limited to 6 persons all 3 tankclasses have to be able to tank this mobs. Or you think the gamedesign that from 16 classes 15 have to search 1 class to do something is a smart design.<br />
<br />
In groups we should be equal. Warrior are better but knights can counter this with there spells. This is the easy concept. Defensiv is the worst thing they created becuase defensiv scale up with the mobs dps. You have to give knight insane spellcasting power to counter the effect of defensiv (stuns). Take a named from kodaz. All our warriors us there defensiv discipline when they fight a named there. They dont need it, but it make it way easier. The problem come now. That i am able to tank this named. How much gear less need a warrior that he can tank the same named with defensiv? If i can tank it with time level gear.  A warrior with elemental gear can tank it to. Now you usually play with friends which have the same gear as you or near the same.<br />
<br />
Defensiv create the situation that the friends of the elemental warrior can go hunt in kodaz and kill nameds because defensiv. He will have it hard against the trash but it is not impossible and he has the same or even better success rate against nameds there then i have with me superior gear against him. On the other side if there is a elemental geared knight. He have no way to tank the named in kodaz because he can not avoid damage. I dont call this situation balanced. Simple because knights allways are the idiots which need gear to be able to do the same in the groupe where warrior dont need this gear and so are able to do the stuff earlier. Again this is not on raids. this is in single groups. In groups we need to be equal tanks or the 16 classes / 6 groupespot system dont work. It is bad for warriors because they are stressed to do it for the other 15 classes. It is bad for the other 15 classes because they have to find a single class. That is the source of the problem. We need to be equal tanks in everything which need only one groupe. Knights counter the effect of disciplines with there spellbook theoretical. But the mobs dps is allready that high that our casting side is a bad joke against your disciplines. Increase dps and not increase our spellbook in the same % and we are even more a joke. To increase our spellbook look like the best way. But the problem is that we step on the casters foot then. We can not be more effectiv healers then clerics only to counter the effect of defensiv like disciplines etc.<br />
<br />
In easy words. The casting power from players get not increased in the same value as the mobs dps. Because knights are balanced against the castingpower from other players and warrior get the benefit from disciplines against higher and higher dps mobs this create a bigger and bigger gap.<br />
<br />
Now come with your statment, but warrior are the class tank blah, blah, blah. If you think this then yes, but that isnt balance for single groupe situation. That is total domination from warrior against the other 15 classes which is the total difference from balance. There should not exist a single situation in a groupe that a knight need a warrior to tank for him and so 1/3 of the groupe are tanks.<br />

I don't understand this mentality. I regularly group with a Paladin or a Shadow Knight, whichever of my two friends happen to be on at the moment, simply because of the utility they bring the group.

I'm really not to blame for the company you keep. I'm enough of a Nervous Nellie that I reported to my Raid Leader that Defensive was down MTing the Goblins in Uqua. He didn't deign to reply - they just kept coming and I kept MTing. Ditto trap mobs.<br />
<br />
No, I don't use Defensive in LDoN. Don't always use it for so-called &quot;Difficult&quot; Assassinates. My Cleric spends nearly all of his time in normal LDoN's meleeing. I don't care if it's up, down or sideways. I only use it in experiance groups (I do exp groups to move the bar as quickly as possible - continuous pulling beats the heck out of tank a mob and wait for Defensive to pop for the next pull) to take advantage of my Damage Shields and/or when the Cleric is lom.<br />

For groups there should not exist a single mob in this game which is not tankable from a knight. This should not exist if we talk about balance. Knights are tanks in groupe. <br />
Arbosch you don't understand balance. There most certainly should be mobs in the game where a Warrior's unmatchable survivability is a factor in getting a group. Knights are Tank/Casters in a group.<br />
<br />
MOST of the spells Paladins cast have little to do with Tanking. Brells, spot heals and Root are regularly cast by Paladins in groups. Ocassionlly they even res da Cleric. It is the Knight classes as TOTAL packages that determines their desireability in groups - their versatility (always a concideration) vs. Warrior tanking superiority (which is ONLY meaningful when a group goes hunting something hard).<br />
<br />
I've MT'd enough Epic fights (even for Knights), done Kriegers when they were concidered to be hard hitters, tower mini-boses, etc. for you to revise history and claim it didn't happen.<br />

Very well then, despite the spell types they chose to have memorized for optimal tanking efficiency, the base comparison of using their mana-based spells to increase their ability to tank something [edit:] remains the same.

Warriors turned their back on FD pulling, snaring mobs, Fear kiting, etc. and ended up quite group dependent, with a narrow role - Tanking, and 1 area of specialization - unmatched survivablity.<br />

If Tipt, which was supposed to be retuned, is still too difficult for SK's then Brael ought to let SoE know, else he should drop it. But, playing along - can you do Tipt Brael? I use a charmed Pooka, do you? Can you pull in a pinch? I can't.<br />

Shadow Knights still provide superior aggro control, and that has not been shared. Obviously, Warriors are nowhere close to where they were in the Kunark era concerning aggro now, but I would say it's unfair to attempt to subtly infer that Warriors now rival a level of &quot;superior aggro control.&quot; Warriors still would gain the same benefit to having a Shadow Knight in their group now, that they would have gained before the melee rebalancing.<br />
<br />
Every post I've seen so far seems to equivocate that equal tanking implies balance. I see nobody at all that is willing to acknowledge that knights bring other abilities to the table that balances their presence in a group WITHOUT them needing to be related to their OWN ability to tank, that does indeed create a balance. Shadow Knights as well as Paladins still hold places in a group WITH a warrior, because their spells compliment a Warrior's own ability, and still maintain the ability to tank on their own except for very rare circumstances. Why won't anybody even consider this?</div></div><hr />

I don't deny that SK agro is still superior however the gap has been closed enough that warriors provide more than sufficient agro.

Actually, most of us wanted Taunt fixed, which would have aided all three classes, or wanted 'aggro lock' removed, which would have evened the field even more between the three classes.

We by no means have knight aggro.  We got a small boost that was sorely needed vs. level headed players, that was it.<br />
<br />
Warriors are still 100% dependant upon a roll of the dice to get a successful tuant to get aggro, or the completely random event that our weapons proc... incite just insures the mob won't instantly snap back to another class when we acheive aggro, barring that class isn't purposely trying to take aggro from us.  A warrior uses his tuant and prays it works, then uses incite to get himself above the ping pong portion of the hate list that taunt alone puts him at.<br />
<br />
Finally, because of incite, we don't have to tell the other classes in the game to hold off for while before engaging.

Sure, Knights have taunt buttons. Groups use them to tank. But they are Warrior/caster hybrids. They are not going to tank as well as a Tank Specialist any more than a Ranger is nor are they going to have the more class defining Tank - oops, I meant Warrior (funny how people use those terms interchanably) specialization abilities.<br />

I think that when they added two completely new spell lines to the SK spellbook that have the sole purpose of generating agro, they were making a statement that the agro patch message you're talking about from four years ago doesn't apply anymore.  The current class definitions, defensive, and almost everything that exists in the game today didn't exist back then.<br />
<br />
And if you're going to keep twisting those generic class descriptions to fit your own meanings, where knights are warriors &quot;with a small w&quot;, then how about giving knights &quot;small w&quot; versions of the warrior discs?<br />

Arbosch you don't understand balance. There most certainly should be mobs in the game where a Warrior's unmatchable survivability is a factor in getting a group. Knights are Tank/Casters in a group<br />
***<br />
<br />
I said A and you said B. I aggree with your statment. But this statment say clear that warriors 'unmatched survivability is a factor' to get in a groupe. This is correct and should be like this. But this dont include that this mobs are not tankable from knights. This mobs should still be tankable from an as good geared knights as warrior. The warrior bring in his unmatched surviviability and the knight bring in his utility and BOTH are able to tank this mob which is only doable in a groupe. That is balance. The other extrem is when you want have mobs which are that hard that only warrior can tank it with there 'unmatched survivability'. Then you have to put in mobs which are that hard that they are only tankable with the knights 'utlity' and not from warriors. One mob only tankable from warrior. One mob only tankable from shadowknights and one mob only tankable from paladins. Then you have allso balance but a balance i dont like because it increase the pain to create the perfect groups etc. If you will have mobs which are only tankable from warriors. Then you have to accept that there exist allso mobs which are only tankable from knights. Give knights a 40% 3 minute magic damage discipline and create mobs which only create damage with procs. The knights will be able to tank this and warriors not. You will have this art of balance?<br />

I dont' necessarily disagree with you, I don't think that single group nameds shouldn't be tankable by knights.   I think they went a tad overboard on melee damage on a lot of mobs in GoD, then of course, they scaled it back, but there remains a few mobs where it's pretty insane to use a knight on if a warrior is available.   <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it's not a crime either to say &quot;Yes, you can tank this, but you need to form your group a little differently&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I just don't see defensive as being the criminal here.   I see the model of &quot;mob does insane damage&quot; as what is challenging that is the real criminal.   I dont' want a group tanking advantage over you, because I think it's stupid, if me and you are LFG, I want to be chosen based on me, not based on my class.   I don't think my class should really be a factor in single group exp mobs, or loot droppers, beyond &quot;plate tank&quot;.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">To me, this is really all a problem of class glut versus content (which is why I think many upcoming games have less classes).  As the content gets harder, &quot;almost as good&quot; (knight tanking / dru,shm healing) becomes &quot;not good enough.&quot;  It also means that what is truly challenging for the &quot;almost as good&quot; classes is utterly gimp for the warrior and cleric, making for content that is extremly hard to balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that the content has been changed, I'm not interested in seeing the same kind of giveaway that happenned to clerics, they got completely hosed.<br />
<br />
I not disagreeing that Clerics got hosed, but the game, and the general playerbase, benefited, by 1) no longer needing a cleric for things in the challenging-to-hard range, and 2) guild rosters didn't need to have the same ratio of clerics-to-dru/shm since the latter could pick up some of the healing load (well, druids mostly).  However, clerics aren't the only class getting screwed.  Ask your local shaman how long they've been paying a DPS and Healing penalty for having 75% slow.<br />

Currently, you have it.  And any knight mitigation ability, if one was added,  could be made useless (i.e. mob is immune) on large scale raid mobs to keep it that way.<br />

We by no means have knight aggro. We got a small boost that was sorely needed vs. level headed players, that was it.<br />
<br />

Knights do still have an intial aggro advantage. Knights are still somewhat dependant (though not to the extent of warriors) on the RNG through fizzles and interruptions.  However, there is one big difference; warriors generate aggro automatically - knights (and especially SKs) generate aggro at the expense of our other abilities like healing and DPS. I'm not saying this should be changed, but it has to be kept in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no way warriors can be accused of getting knight aggro.<br />
Initial aggro advantage still lies with knights, but with Anger3 augs, dual wielding innate EB/Anger weapons, WA5, Echo of Anger effects, and the incite line, I believe players have done the math where that comes out to about 10 procs per minute and the best long term aggro generation.  I understand, of course, that at lower stages of the game all of the above doesn't apply.<br />
<br />

I'm not a knight that thinks we must have defensive (I've seen strong cases made both for and against),  and certainly, say, of 10 1-group nameds it's fine for 1-2 to really be warrior only, but of those other 8-9, I'm worried about content difficulty.  If a knight dies 3 out of 10 times on a mob (certainly challenging, and enough to give the group pause as to whether they want to proceed with a knight tank), then a warrior will most likely die 0 out of 10 times.  If a warrior goes down every 3 out of 10, a knight would be lucky to survive 3 out of 10, and could just as easily go 0 for 10.  What a knight burst mitigation ability gives you is a situation where a mob that actually has a chance to kill a furious/defensive warrior can still be doable by a knight, although with less success.  Right now, if it has a reasonable chance to kill a warrior (say, maybe 25% chance), it may as well DT the knight.  There is hardly any middle ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is warriors have to tank(stand up to incoming damge ) clearly better than knights or what advantage do they have?<br />
Agreed, but the converse of this is that knights have to have a minimum level of tanking (via innate abilities and spells) else they are no longer tanks.  So, where do we draw line?  Innate abilties and spells should equal 100% of warrior tanking?  Probably too high and it infringes on warrior advantages.  75%?  Probably too low and groups actively start seeking warriors for everything. And on what mobs?  Traditional raid mobs should remain warrior only.  Knights should be suitable EXP mob tanks.  It's the middle area where opinions tend to differ...raid offtanking and forced single group/progression content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors still would gain the same benefit to having a Shadow Knight in their group now, that they would have gained before the melee rebalancing.<br />
Except for Warriors with Echo of Anger effects, they don't stack with the SK Voice line. Although I'm sure the SK is glad not to have to devote a slot to Voice :)<br />

Well then we agree on this.The &quot;middle area&quot;,or, &quot;gap&quot; is what is in question.The gap was believed by many players and obviously soe to have become to small to make for decent class balance so they recently widened it.This overall sense of balance being too far in favor of knights included our discs before the adjustment.Imo I don't think they widened it too much.Level 70 will probably have strong effect on GOD content and as for pop...Knights in my guild tank all the same group content and a lot of the raid stuff I do,they just don't mitigate it quite as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">I'm perfectly fine with having a different take on group dynamics and the abilities of the 3 Plate tanks in groups than Frodlin. We aren't all so very far apart.<br />
<br />
I claim there is plenty of content where I would prefer a Paladin or Shadow Knight in the group for a variety of reasons. Offsetting this is the fact that when you get to extremes in single-groupable mobs and Warrior survivability, there has always been a strong preference for Warriors vs. some few mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
IMO Frodlin knows that it has existed, that I believe it is a long-standing tradition, but he in turn would not be particularly concerned if it disappeared. I on the other hand would be quite concerned. Want to be certain that single-groupable mob goes down? Send me a /tell - 10500HP unbuffed and a fair amount of AC. Yes, Brael can sucessfully tank that mob too. WAIT, no he can't - send ME the tell. SK's are gimp, just look at Brael asking for burst mitigation that he CLAIMS to need to tank in normal experiance groups, do raid adds, and I'm sure single groupable named in Kod'Taz. Send ME the /tell!!<br />
<br />
Unless of course you want someone who can assist the puller in getting the mob to you solo and can also tank the mob - in which case you probably want Brael 8(.<br />
<br />
Unless of course DArb + group heal + some CC + a back up tank sounds good in which case you might want a Warrior and a Paladin.<br />
<br />
You aren't restricted in group composition when killing open zone single groupable mobs. Go with what works - it excludes nobody. Heck, yas can even use *gasp* two groups that experiance near each other and take on the toughest mobs together. Why that way, even EP groups can take down named in Kod'Taz.<br />

But for instance, I prefer to have a knight against DD.   A SK is extremely useful in that they can dispel the mob, freeing up the casting types to perform that role, as well as not be as worried about getting a crack or two in the face if they draw a little aggro on dispel.

The only thing unique a Knight brings to a group in a difficult 1 group situation is that a Paladin can rez (and this is huge).  For everything else a Knight can be replaced by someone who is better at doing what you'd need him for.<br />
<br />
But then, I can count on one hand the number of times I've actually done a 1 group trial with the optimum group.  A Knight is probably one of the least useful members in a 1 group situation (especially if you don't need the rez) but they're hardly alone.  I remember when Ikk was hard you'd see Wizards getting turned down because people want another Cleric or at least a Druid.  A Knight has never been to your go-to guy on a top of the line encounter, so why does this need to be changed?  You can't have everyone be the go-to guy, because that's the same as having no go-to guy.</div></div><hr />

If you can support 1 warrior for every groupe this isnt a problem. But how realistic is this? Lets take a guild with 80 people which have between 5 to 10 warriors on. This guild is limited to 5 to 10 groups. The number of warriors they have. The rest simple cant do this stuff. Aslong you dont unterstand how bad it is for this game that there exist anything which need a special class to be able to do it you dont unterstand the source of the problem. It is bad when this are clerics. It is bad when his are enchanter. It is bad when this are knigts. Simple because we have t many classes to support such things and it wll only give troubles. Warriors need to learn that they have to share there job in groups. They are not better then knights.<br />
<br />
Allso you said you invite knights as non tanks. I allso invited warrior for dps. You think that you as warrior will be happy when you get limited to the dps job becuase you can get groups because you can do it. To tell knights we dont have problems because we get invited because our utility is like to tell warrior that they dont need anything because they can get invited as dps class and dont need to be better tanks then knights. Our utility is like warriors which get the dps job in a groupe. You can do it but that isnt really effectiv for the groupe. We even let warrior pull this days because it is that easy to singlepull. A knight can pull with stun and a warrior with bows. There isnt a big difference. <br />

When a Paladin groups with a Warrior he draws initial aggro and gives it up to the Tank. He helps control adds with Root or alternately tanks an early arriving pull while the previous one is finished up. He makes sure no mobs execute the Cleric or slower and reses the Cleric should the unthinkable happen. He finishes off the mob should the Tank die mid-fight. He interrupts a gater with a stun. He removes curses and helps keep the group in fighting trim. He spot heals so while the Cleric is attending to the Tank, the wounded Cleric or Enchanter don't get low HP aggro and expire. He group heals following the Clerics DArb often providing as many HP's healed as ANY class in the game. All of this while being able to produce 80%+ of the DPS of a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Don't fib and say any class can provide more usefulness to a group than that I outlined in part above.<br />
<br />
When playing my 52 Paladin, I'll gladly let a Warrior tank and take the beating. I'm very much more than satisfied with my ability as a Paladin to give a group much more than full value for the cost of two tanks.<br />
<br />

When a Paladin groups with a Warrior he draws initial aggro and gives it up to the Tank. He helps control adds with Root or alternately tanks an early arriving pull while the previous one is finished up.<br />
***<br />
<br />
But this is not something knights only can do. Every class with root can do it. Bard/enchanter even outclass us for this. So 90% of the time you have someone in the groupe which can do this even when you dont have a knight. If somoene can do this allready i dont add anything to the groupe when i do the same. I only replace this person in the groupe. This is ineffectiv if i replace others and dont add powers to the groupe.<br />
<br />
***<br />
He makes sure no mobs execute the Cleric or slower and reses the Cleric should the unthinkable happen. He finishes off the mob should the Tank die mid-fight. He interrupts a gater with a stun. He removes curses and helps keep the group in fighting trim. He spot heals so while the Cleric is attending to the Tank, the wounded Cleric or Enchanter don't get low HP aggro and expire. He group heals following the Clerics DArb often providing as many HP's healed as ANY class in the game. All of this while being able to produce 80%+ of the DPS of a Warrior.<br />
***<br />
<br />
If i do all this things. I dont even come near 20% of the dps of a warrior. That is the other part warrior dont unterstand. I can not heal the cleric, enchanter, shaman control 2. mob and keep doing 80% of the damage from a warrior. I can do 80% of the damage if i never cast anything. Then i do 80% the dps of a warrior and add 0 utility. That is most of the time the norm i do in the groupe. Because all the utlity i have is not needed. <br />
<br />
The other part you dont unterstand. If something is limited to 6 person. You have to watch your dps to. If you have the tank as non dps class. The healer as non dps class. There is allready 1/3 of your groupe which dont create massiv dps. As more non dps you add to the groupe as more healing you will need. Simple if a mob make 1000 damage every second. If you kill the mob in 5 sec. He do 5000 dmg. If you need 10sec. he do 10'000dmg. So what look great on the first view to add healing to make it more save is usually very, very uneffectiv because you increase the fighttime and so you have a higher risk. Because you dont limit the risk to die. You only make the fight longer and make sure you can heal for longer with more healers. This is what knights hurt to. If you have first 2 slots allready given to non dps class which are warrior/cleric in most case. You will usually have a slower to which dont create dps which make 1/2 of the groupe to non dps class.  With this setup you simple loose to much when you dont start to add dps. Simple because this utility is not worth it that you have to fight the mob for 10 to 15 more seconds. This utility you allready have to 90% from the healer/slower in your groupe. There are setups which make sense to get knigts utility like Warrior/druid/bard. But it come down to if you add to much non dps class you increase the time you need to kill the mob. It allways come down to this. If you make something that hard that only warrior can tank it. The knights utility will not help them to get in a groupe for this. Simple because the odds are aganst us. You will need a slower then. You will need a cleric then. You will need dps. Our utility look good on the paper and against low dps mobs. But the moment a mob can kill a tank every second in the fight. The best way to kill the mob is to kill him as fast as possible and lower the fight time. Everything which make this fight longer need a good reason why you do it. To be able to ress the cleric when he die in the fight. Well player die that fast today, that it is very rarly that you only have half wipes. You dont have deaths or your full groupe wipped. I can not ress the cleric when i am nacked at me bindspot with the other groupemembers. I can not keep a warrior alive against high dps mobs when the cleric die and i am the only healer left. Our utlity only look great when you dont use it and can say 'but you can do this and that'. Yes i can do it, but something i can do but is not needed but lower the mobs dps is not effectiv. Like warrior as dps class. They can do it but it is not as effectiv as to take a roque as dps class.<br />

You think that you as warrior will be happy when you get limited to the dps job becuase you can get groups because you can do it. To tell knights we dont have problems because we get invited because our utility is like to tell warrior that they dont need anything because they can get invited as dps class and dont need to be better tanks then knights. Our utility is like warriors which get the dps job in a groupe. You can do it but that isnt really effectiv for the groupe. We even let warrior pull this days because it is that easy to singlepull. A knight can pull with stun and a warrior with bows. There isnt a big difference.  <br />

That's because all of the mobs that stand in the way of progression and all of the mobs that drop the phat lewtz that everyone is after happen to be the same mobs that warriors have a competative advantage on.<br />
<br />
Until there are a significant number of encounters at every level of progression that meet the above two criteria and the knight &quot;competative advantage&quot;, whatever that may be, is desired over a warrior, things are not balanced.<br />
<br />
A Knight has never been to your go-to guy on a top of the line encounter, so why does this need to be changed?  You can't have everyone be the go-to guy, because that's the same as having no go-to guy.<br />
&quot;Having no go-to guy&quot; is the very definition of class balance.  If you can't see that, you're really not going to be able to contribute productively to any discussion on balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we raid it is often a Knight who gives me the best back up aggro on mezz breaks and loose mobs,also I prefer them to ma in places like POW and trans aggro to me.Paladins are still an incredibly powerful class than can group the stuff I do,solo and be a great asset to a raid force.SKs need some balancing with Paladins imo,but, they still have a lot to offer.The nature of a hybrid is there will always be parent classes of skills that can preform them better.However,Knights make great add tanks and aggro support in my content.No doubt level 70 and Oow will help with some issues of knights in GOD.<br />

<br />
Hey, guess what? In 98% of all group content in the game, I don't want a Wariror in my group. Not when I can get a Warrior+ and group a Knight.<br />

<br />
This is correct.  But this is not EQ.  This is anything but EQ.  In current EQ, in SITUATIONS THAT MATTER (Raids, trials, named hunting) in the newest expansion, you REQUIRE certain classes.  There is no 'some classes are going to be better' clause.  It's 'You can't do this stuff reasonably without these classes.'  Really, it's not just the tank problem between knights and warriors, but a problem between many classes in EQ.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, what class balance SHOULD be like is that in each specific situation, there should be a PREFERRED class over all the others, one class that will maximize efficiency, but does not disclude other classes taht can perform the duty to a sufficient degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's change the game. Your guild is doing Quarm. Quarm does a tremendous amount of damage via AE's, Dot's, put nasty buffs on players, etc. I assure you guilds make certain that every Paladin available is grouped for Quarm.<br />
<br />
Why not add a cleric instead?  Better heals and cures for that which you are talking about.  This is an instance where there is a PREFERENCE between the two classes.<br />
<br />
Let's change the game. You've a 11k HP buffed Paladin and a 12k HP buffed Warrior available to MT Inny or CT in PoTime. Who's the go to guy? The Paladin has my vote.<br />
<br />
Again this is another PREFERENCE.  A warrior can also MT Inny sufficiently, if not maximized in efficiency.  What about the other 90% of raid mobs?  Are there any such preference there?  Nope.<br />
<br />
Let's change the game. We're doing the little village of ghostie's in of the trials. SU/Holyforge works on them. They sometimes come two or three at a time. The Cleric dying means you start over and lose two hours. Who do you want in your group? Warrior or your Paladin go to guy?<br />
<br />
At the end of that trial you have a boss that you have to beat to pass the trial.  With a warrior you have a 90% chance of winning.  With a paladin, you have a 30% chance.  Who do you take then?<br />
<br />
Or during the trials you have the chance to spawn several named that drop upgrades to your group members.  A warrior has 90% chance of tanking them down, and a knight has a 30% chance.  Would you still take a knight in place of a warrior then?<br />
<br />
God is set up to be way more like my two examples than yours.<br />
<br />
I'm still of the mindset that EQ is too far along to truly return to a true balance, where classes are PREFERRED and not REQUIRED for certain events.  But your examples, while they work, reflect small areas in the game where you actually see a preference at work.  Most of EQ where it counts, you are still required to have those core classes IE warrior, cleric, enchanter.  <br />
<br />
You can't say XP groups because well, honestly, any melee class can tank for those.  The XP they get may not be as good as having a true tank class tank, but you can still get it.</div></div><hr />

There still aren't nearly as many encounters in the game where either knight class is the &quot;go to guy&quot; as there are for warriors.  And there are FAR more progression required encounters where a warrior is either required or much preferred than there are encounters where a knight is preferred.  As for encounters where a SK is specifically preferred?  Hardly any.<br />
<br />
Hey, guess what? In 98% of all group content in the game, I don't want a Wariror in my group. Not when I can get a Warrior+ and group a Knight.<br />
That's a cute argument but almost everyone who isn't an warrior arguing about class balance would take a warrior tank over a knight tank for 98% of encounters.  In five years of playing, I have never been in a group that chose a knight over a warrior unless the knight had a) better gear or b) the knight was a friend.  You can make a small argument that a knight is better for undead content but there is hardly any progession-relavant undead content in the game and even on undead content, most groups would take a warrior over a SK and possibly even a Paladin.<br />
<br />
Now it's possible given your Magelo you haven't done the EP's, PoTime, Sewers, VXed, Tipt, etc. and merely parrot things you hear other Knights whining.

You're right, I take my rogue or wizard to those zones because my SK needs to farm LDoN for about 200 more adventures in order to accomplish what a bazaar geared warrior can.  It's a catch 22 for SKs...they need better gear than a warrior in order to progress yet they can't get better gear because progression groups don't want them unless they just need to fill a spot.<br />
<br />
It's important enough that it bears repeating:<br />
Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's.<br />
And I've never disagreed with that.  I simply think knights need a tool to help them avoid insta-splatting before slow lands and healing begins.  Somehow there is a communication problem here because that is not the same thing as saying knights should tank as well as warriors.</div></div><hr />

Yes and no, it depends on where your  XPing, if your XPing in Qvic, Yxxta etc, class definately matters, if your XPing in PoN, probably not as much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">There is a big hole in the argument being made here. Afaik there is not even one mob in the game that appears to me intended to be single groupable (mobs generally don't wear signs saying &quot;One Group Only&quot; in open zones) that no Knight can tank.<br />
<br />
So the issue is not that single groupable mobs are Warrior only. The issue is wether Noctix at 5k HP's unbuffed should be able to succeed or if it takes a 7500HP unbuffed Knight or if it takes a Brael.<br />
<br />
Some Knights will claim Warirors are unfairly advantaged. However, from Paladins over at PoN that specifically asked that pre-EP Warriors not be able to do Tipt and Vxed to Warriors here on TSW that did not want to see the sneak in through the back door into BoT crowd in Kod'Taz there has been resistance to undergeared Plate Tanks regardless of class succeeding in advanced content without following a progression path to get there.<br />
<br />
Don't even begin to say Knights can't do Vxed, Tipt, or exp in Kod'Taz and knock off mini's - they can. Maybe you can't (or a sub-7500HP unbuffed Warrior for that matter) but there's an obvious explanation and it's not necessary to look any further than yourself to find it. There is a progression path and you haven't progressed far enough along it.<br />

This isnt a lie. I groupe often with warriors when i started the groupe. The question most of the time isnt which class it is. It is who ask first. Simple because i dont need a special class for most stuff i do. This is how the game should work. But this 'need for warriors' break this. It break it because i dont have to look who ask first. I have to look which warrior is arround. If you dont need a special class it is your decision which class you invite to your groupe. It is your decision if you will be less effectiv then with the perfect groupe. This is how the game work out of GoD. In GoD this change to which class you need to make stuff A and B and C. If you cant do the stuff if you dont have class A. You simple dont have the decision if you will do it with a less effectiv groupe. You need this class you need this perfect groupe. There should not exist a single mob in this game which is design for a single groupe which need the perfect groupe and this include that there dont exist a single mob which need a warrior to tank whch an equal geared knight can not tank.<br />
<br />
Where we come to the problem that warrior can go arround this with there discipline. If they can hit defnesiv and go arround the hard part of the encounter (fight the named which is most of the time the sense behind this groups). They allow the not well enough geared player to do this stuff to. The equal geared knight dont have this and so is not balanced against this. It is allways only the question which gearlevel it hit. Warrior allways have the option to get arround the need of gear aslong they can activate 'defensiv'. Tipt etc. shown this very clear. This work for GoD because this are flagged areas and they nerfed defensiv in the flag tirals. If you open up kodaz zone to everyone. You will have this problem again. OOW will be for most part an open zone with no flags (only 1 flagged zone asfar i know). This will be a serious problem for knights. Take away the need for a flag in kodaz and most guilds which are not geared for this level of the game can hunt there when they use there warriors for mininamed but will not be able to hunt there with equal geared knights. You think that this situation is fair against this knights?<br />
<br />
Like you said it isnt the class which solve the problem. It is the flag that the undergeared warrior cant tank the trash in tipt save and have a to hard time with there disciplines nerfed. Take away the flag and give back the disciplines and what you have?<br />

It is a lie. In your original post I replied to, you're attempting to say that the DPS that a Warrior could bring a group in which he is not the main tank, would be equal to the level of utility a Knight can bring to a group in which he is not the main tank.<br />
<br />
Don't try to coat your argument. That's what you're saying, and you're flat out wrong. I don't care that a Knight does less DPS than a Warrior when I'm asking one to come group. I'm asking a Knight to come group with me as a Warrior for their spellbook. Because their spellbook compliments my own ability to tank. Which doesn't necessarily mean DPS. <br />

Warrior DPS when not the main tank /= Knight Spellbook Utility when not the main tank. End of Story.</div></div><hr />

First, what do you think the tanking gap should be?<br />

Are things balanced if a bazaar geared warrior tanks as well as a Time+ geared knight?  Should an elemental level warrior tank about the same as a Time+ knight?  How about a bazaar geared warrior vs. a knight in full Tak gear plus augs?<br />

Also, the original point of this thread was BB noticing the Paladin top ten list and then suggesting that warriors should demand some huge tanking upgrades to compensate.  After that, several SKs, including myself, mentioned that SKs feel that we are currently far behind both warriors and Paladins in tanking power because we don't have anything to compete with warrior discs/mitigation/hp or Paladin stuns.  Do warriors generally agree with this?  Note that I am not suggesting that SKs should be brought up to warrior level here, only asking if you agree that SKs are lacking compared to the other two tank classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">I personnally don't want that tanking disc been shared with knights.<br />
But I do agrre that while stuns keep Paladin on the edge (of their role, not on our, but it's good as is it), SK has been left behind. Yes I think they need improvement to get back at Paladin lvl of tanking. But this must be done by spellbook tweakage not disc benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : I just got an Idee, and I don't think that anybody has speaked about it, so I will throw it here before thinking of its balance...<br />
What about a 'reverse rune' ? I mean a spell casted by SK on a mob that would decrease its next melee or spell domage (depending on the spell) by a given amount and percentage.<br />
this would be very powerfull since whatever the mob's target is, it would mitigate a part of the domage. plus it's stackable with everythings since all form of mitigation are player based, not mob based. all of this would make SK enourmously more attractive whatever the content.<br />
<br />
the idee is a spell that would englue the mob rendering its hit less domagous or its spell decreased/masked at its source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">I think the general opinion of warriors, or atleast mine is that is the defensive is the one line of abilites that is not gear oriented. It is the one tool that warriors have had that makes them desired beyond how good their gear is. <br />
<br />
Warriors should be able to tank content earlier than knights based on good use of thier disciplines. The skills of warrior provide advantage only to tank.<br />
<br />
I agree, that knights, SK's more so than paladins, need a spell casting improvement to their utility in groups. It is falling behind. <br />
<br />
I do not feel that their needs to be encounters that Knights have a significant advantage as the tank for. Just as I don't feel there needs to be encounters were druids have a greater advantage as healer. Knights should be able to reasonably tank content that their gear and level/aa is suited for. Knights should always have the second best survivability as the tank, while maintaining useful spells for their point in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'd say SK's generally get the short end of the stick right now, although I think they have a tendency to discount their utility (just like paladins). At the minimum they can fill a puller role quite well, unlike pallies or warriors.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, taps are vastly inferior to stuns at this point, and sk's don't have the buffs or rez that pallies bring to the table, so I have to figure they're getting a raw deal. I certainly think they deserve to be equally as desirable as paladins, although i'm not sure of a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
WRT warrior vs knight balance. With defensive on (for 3 minutes) I think a bazaar warrior should be competitive with a Time+ knight. That 3 minutes every 13 isn't enough to trivialize anything, and at this point is the only real advantage to a warrior. Roll a warrior and ding 65 levels and a bunch of AA without pl'ing and no utility and come back and tell me theres no benefit to your utility.<br />
<br />
In trivial content, the tank gap is pretty reasonable right now in my opinion, except for when mobs are stunnable where paladins get a monster power increase that sk's and warriors just can't match.</div></div><hr />

currenctly they have them, mostly in a group version and all in fast cast version, but there is to much staking and buff slot # issues to make it usefull when not soloing.<br />

but thats true that no negative melee focus are available in any class spellbook, so it would make SK more appealing to have them (in fast cast version of course).</div></div><hr />

You are also a little behind the times. I recently very casually ran Yalp from the entrance of the tunnel leading to Inkta'Tu to actual zone in. Lemme tell you a Diamond Tipped War Javelin outdamages my DBoW/EoE. It would be interesting to see how it would be with the undead weapon buff, Cleave and SU/Holyforge. IMO GoD has a few zones where, with the right equipment, a Paladin can do much better than Warrior DPS. BTW, I'm fine with that - in fact I think it's entirely fair.<br />

<br />
Point out that improved lifetaps are also consistant with this theme and would allow an SK to participate in their own survival while injuring the mob and ya get 'Lifetaps are useless.'<br />

Then difference of 1khp is nothing when the players have over 8khp. The only way to fix this is to give warriors a natural HP boost at each lvl. Doing it any other method would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Am I being biased? probly. But this is how I feel.  I am pretty  upset with the route the game is going.  Are the classes Balanced? Yes, in the sence that all casters and do the same &quot;Job&quot;, the Priest can do the same &quot;Job&quot;, the tanks can do the same &quot;job&quot; and the melle dps can do the same &quot;job&quot;.   So classes are balanced in this sence. which really bothers me as a warrior. Becouse that is not what I signed up for over4 years ago. The vision has changed from many different classes to 4 different classes. where all the middle men can do the jobs on either side of them. and the end men are stuck on there one job. <br />
<br />
Yes I am an end man. But I like my only job. So I ask please do not let the middle man take my job and be the catch all.  Now if that middle man wants my job and nothing else. Then I do not have a problem with that.<br />
<br />
For instance. if a paliden wants to tank just like a warrior, then he should have 100 percent tanking abilities, and 0 percent caster ablilities. If he wanted to have 20 percent caster ablilites, then he should only be able to tank 80 percent as good as I can. So what I ask. is for the palidens to decide where they want to be. More tank or more caster/catchall. And then they be put in that spot. They cannot be 95percent tank and 30percent caster/castall.</div></div><hr />

There are TONS of threads like these on SKO.  Yes, there are a few SKs who still suggest we should get warrior defensive or some clone of it.  However, I think that if you were to go read SKO, you'd see that almost all of the regular posters are constantly offering up creative suggestions for enhancing our class.  Most of the ideas you've mentioned above are there, along with tons of others.<br />
<br />
If the only place you read about SKs is here on TSW, I can understand why you think all SKs want to be warrior clones.  Why would a SK come here to talk about class balance unless he were comparing his class to the warrior class?  The SK class is part warrior so we come here to debate balance pertaining to that part of our class.  The non-warrior parts of our class balance discussion rarely make it over here and when they do, they're generally in some watered down, misconstrued format.</div></div><hr />

This argument was already made several pages back.  You should know by now that if BB is making the argument, he only compares warriors to knight classes, other classes don't count.  If a knight compares himself only to the warrior class though, BB accuses them of wanting to be a warrior clone.

If both paladins and SKs were given a 12 second auto-parry disc on a 50 minute timer and SKs were given a spell that increased our tanking ability to a level similar to what Paladins gain from stuns, I would consider the three tanking classes to be well balanced.

Paladin's got healing AA that helped them mitigate more damage, it would have made sense that warriors got straight tanking aa that did the same thing and was class specific. Except I don't think they should be on such a huge scale. If we got 3 levels of ID/LR type of aa's that gave us another 5-6% edge (around 1% each) I think that would have been more than sufficient. <br />

Something must be done for SK's, no idea what, but something :P<br />

That is because of the ABOVE reason.  They don't want there to be a small difference.

I also have seen a whole lot of indicisiveness on the warrior boards as to what we want and what is important to us all.  We need have a unified front taking one issue at a time and so long as what is being asked for will cause us no harm we all need to stand behind it and support it fully.

What I can't believe sometimes is that Warriors aren't asking for the stars.<br />
Well we're in a funny position. At the begining of this thread I posted:<br />
Melee Update 2 (Warrior portion of the needed improvements):<br />
<br />
Warrior's Advantage 1, 2, 3 - decrease the refresh time of Defensive by 10% for each level.<br />
<br />
You're Not a Warrior 1, 2, 3 - add &quot;-1 DI' per level to the always present Warriror DI based mitigation advantage when no Mitigation discipline is in effect.<br />
<br />
Meaty Meat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - add 100HP's per level to maximum HP's. Sturdyness 1-5 must be completed.<br />
<br />
Skeptic's Resistance 1, 2, 3 - reduces the damage a Warrior recieves form Magical Atacks 2% per level - not being a magic practitioner, Warriors are naturally less affected by Magical attack.<br />
<br />
Please note that NONE of these ideas were discussed in this thread. There were NO suggestions that Warrior's Advantage 1, 2, 3 is overblown at 10% but 5% might be realistic for example.<br />
<br />
Maybe ALL of theses ideas are waaaaay unbalancing. BUT they are lightyears more focused on Warrior ADVANCEMENT than most things on our Top Ten List.<br />
<br />
Our conduit to bring such suggestions to the attention of SoE can decide they are the unrealistic ramblings of an individual and not forward them. They certainly don't get on the Warrior Top Ten Issues List without an indication of support. Yet, I've not seen a single issue on the Warrior Top Ten Issues List with public support from more than 20 Warriors.<br />
<br />
So we have two seperate mechanisms that inhibit us from asking for the stars:<br />
<br />
1. Those that have some special access are interested in class balance and are convinced they know what that balance should be. Even if they pass on ideas they don't agree with, they may decide based on the level of support - which beings us to.....<br />
<br />
2. We ourselves are concerned with class balance and even for modest improvements don't publicly register support from more than 20 Warriors. We do not ourselves put Warrior advancement on the agenda.<br />
<br />
If we are not advocates for Warrior advancement nobody else is going to be.<br />

Well, on the SoE board there is the Top Ten Issues list. PoN duplicates their list and has a separate discusion of the issues. WE are certainly free to discuss things here and on the SoE Warrior board. We are also free to email SoE with suggestions directly.<br />
<br />
We can also discuss and examine ideas without necessarily being swayed by those that say any real Warrior advancement (I'm not talking raising the Piercing skill cap or general EQ issues) are imbalancing.<br />
<br />
One reality is that most Warriors believe we are well-balanced atm. Let's remember a lot of our issues were addressed by the Phase 1 Melee Update. <br />
<br />
But the game moves on. Other classes get spells - perhaps no one has noticed Ancient Chaos Call (Cry?) is a marginal improvement (although more aggro is always appreciated) or that the Vadd BP increases the frequency of our 1/10th the damage of other classes' exceptional DPS hits - something to look forward to the next time you are Beserk in a raid - I know I'm going to ask not to be healed in raids as soon as I get one.<br />
<br />
At the same time, there are those that suggest discussion of such things needs to wait for OoW - IMO that's a pretty reasonable position.<br />

There simply isn't anything 1 groupable in vxed/tipt/kt/ikkinz that I can do as a warrior that a paladin can't do better.  They often do it with less hp/ac.  I know I suck and maybe that is the reason why paladins can do it better, but I have 9800 HP / 1800 AC.

What a complete load of shit. I know you know better than that, Battleblade, why you're attempting to claim it is beyond me. Why you  think you can get away with such an outrageous claim is alwso beyond me.<br />
<br />
One word... fortitude.<br />
<br />
The advantage warriors have over knights with HS/DA vs fortitude is that aggro can be kept while using it. HS/DA is almost never used because the minute a knight uses it. Secondly, Sanctification DEFTINITELY doesn't avoid taking 100% of a mob's damage.<br />
<br />
You're just as bad with outrageous claims as the more extreme knights are.<br />
<br />

No Daemondwynd, it's exactly as I posted. A Paladin can DA or Root and Scoot or Blind mobs. An SK can FD and in many cases right click CoS and be invis upon standing, or even Fear some mobs, or snare others and escape their unkind attentions that way. A Warrior on the other hand MUST<br />
win the fight, die, or zone. <br />
Even with Fortitude, Warriors can't do otherwise. When DA, can the mob Root you? If successfully FD'd?<br />
<br />
I was not arguing that Warriors don't have the Tanking discipline Fortitude. But Fortitude is not as useful an ESCAPE method as those methods Knights have. Care to run backwards for the zoneline and hope you don't get rooted or stunned?<br />
The advantage warriors have over knights with HS/DA vs fortitude is that aggro can be kept while using it.<br />
Don't be so timid. The advantage Warriors have is that with Defensive/Stonewall/Furious Warriors can reduce of eliminate melee damage taken for a time while still holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Rytan said:<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
<br />
It appears SoE knows we believe it to be class defining and agrees. GoD content was adjusted instead of just reflexively giving Knights Defensive, part Defensive, or Defensive by another means. I rather imagine they will be reluctant to give Knights Weaponshield which also is rather unique to Rangers.<br />
<br />
I frankly expect a &quot;rut roh&quot; autoparry ability  with a 12-18 second duration and a 30-60 minute refresh to be given to Knights. That's enough for them to get the kind attentions of healers should they encounter an exceptional mob in a raid and to allow their groups to have an additional edge when fighting a named. More than that, and they start looking a lot like Warriors using a Tanking discipline so they can have unmatched survivability and a brutal mob can be slain.<br />
<br />
Even the other hybrids in ranger and bard get them.<br />
Are Rangers and Bards Tanks? Do they commonly Tank for groups. Are they prefered add tanks/offtanks in raids? No Daemonwynd, only one TANK has such abilities.<br />
<br />
With Paladins already discussing stun lock rotations, new stuns otw, etc. its hard to even justify a &quot;rut roh&quot; ability much less anything beyond it. SK's might not be in as good shape, but we don't know what OoW will bring. Whatever it brings, I expect that:<br />
<br />
Like it or not Warriors will tank better than Pallies or SK's.<br />

Fear is capped at 55. I dont fear kite Kod'taz named and rule the server with uberness nor does any other shadowknight.<br />
<br />
Snare immune mobs are so common now, even on trash its hardly an option. All Kod'taz named that I personally tried to snare were immune.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a shadowknight were to feign while his/her group was trying to kill a named, Try and guess the outcome, feigning in combat has bad effect if you would like to keep agro. <br />

Harmshield in combat is even worse, its a pulling tool for the most part, However it is handy to zone into Ikkinz trials and Uqua.<br />

<br />
Comparing Sanctification and Harmshield is just silly, neither are an effective tanking tool; when comparing Harmshield, however, you should use Divine Aura, unless you don't know what Harmshield does?  And saying Root and Fear allows paladins and Sk's to avoid the consequences of aggroing mobs is also silly, I know you must have a better grip on the game than this.  Fear, if it works at all, usually causes death (I have found this to be the case in my experiences with it) and both root and fear are resistable, while a voidance disc isn't.  As I said before, I personally don't care if they add one or don't for Knights, as I am at the extreme low end of the level 65 bell curve for gear, and don't require any additional tools atm, besides improved gear, and maybe a fixed Holyforge.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Fear is not effective on some mobs. However, I regularly, as a Warrior and dealing with the RNG, solo Fear kite blue mobs as an imitation SK at level 65. I use Polished Obsidean Greataxe, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, and a lifetap weapon. Don't even try to tell me SK's haven't gotten a LOT of milage out of Fear even after hitting 65. I know better. I know that with lifetaps and good regen a melee can Fear kite Blues non stop. I know that if you pull too many mobs you can send some packing with Fear. I know you can use Fear and snare to zone split. In Kod'Taz? Probably not. But still a HUGE advantage in lower tier experiance groups and soloing. Do you rationally expect to be the best soloing tank, a superior experiance group tank, AND kill hard hitting mobs like a Warrior??????!!!!<br />
<br />
Yep, snaring mobs on incoming, getting a start on aggro, giving the slower time and preventing a runner from taking off is totally useless - right.<br />
<br />
FD plus CoS stand with invis is without value - nod.<br />
<br />
Let's not pretend SK's don't kill VS with very tiny groups. Let's not pretend that their tools have no value starting when they first get them up to and including LDoN's and opne zone soloing even now.<br />
<br />
Let's pretend the ONLY balance that means anything is measuring SK's against a Warrior's ONLY strength. Getting end expansion equipment is too long to wait to MT all of PoTime. Well equipped SK's being fully capable of add tanking/off tanking and tanking names in GoD doesn't count. SK's don't have a mitigation/avoidance discipline and Warriors do - an injustice!! How dare Warriors have something unique and usefull among the Plate Tanks! SK's MUST have a piece of it.<br />
<br />
A 12 second autoparry discipline is barely justifiable. A 12 second autoreposte disciplne is ludicrous.<br />
<br />
Knight that get hosed in GoD are underequipped. Go ahead, compare your equipment to what ready for the content Knights have. Much of the non-raid content has been adjusted and it's primarily underequipped Knights that are complaining.<br />

<br />
Yep, I've been doing Tipt/Vxed lately with some guildies including a paladin.  We are all pre elemental and I'm nearly maxed out on pre elem gear for a warrior.  There just isn't much else for me to get in the way of upgrades.  Anyway, the paladin is similarly geared, slightly lower quality gear actually and I have more AAs though I suspect we both have all the important defensive ones.  Neither of us tank well in the mountains, but the paladin does every bit as well as I do if not better unless I have defensive up.  Those mobs are stunnable and that mitigates a huge amount of dps there.  I saw 2 different stuns landing consistently.  There was Divine Stun and I forget the other one.  Of course we were gimping through with charmed pets too and having such a great stunner to help control charm breaks was huge.<br />
<br />
Now to me mountain trials are the upper end of what I can hope to fight and are definitely harder than a huge portion of the single group game in EQ.  Yet a couple stuns already work on the mobs.  What happens when Omens of War comes out and paladins add even more stuns that work on these mobs?  Given how high mana regen can be pushed now, I don't see that being a huge issue.  With 3-4 stuns that work on mountain trial mobs, the paladin will be a far better tank than me both there and on virtually all easier content, which is most of the single group game.</div></div><hr />

Would you consider warriors to be balanced if defensive only worked on mobs up to level 55 and incite required you to buy an ultra-rare 100kpp+ item that doesn't drop anymore?  Using fear and pre-nerf CoS as examples of what SKs get to compensate for the innate defensive disc that every warrior gets for free at level 55 is pretty damn weak.  No doubt your other examples hold some water.<br />

<br />
Do you rationally expect to be the best soloing tank, a superior experiance group tank, AND kill hard hitting mobs like a Warrior??????!!!!<br />
<br />
As long as Knights get spells and abilities that allow them to surpass Warriors in other aspects of the Tanking Game, don't expect that you'll find any sympathy among most people that hear them ask for more. You tell me how many Warriors you see agro-kiting at fire tables or in kod'taz.<br />
<br />
Would it be nice if Knights got some kind of auto-parry or auto-riposte disc? I've argued in prior posts to create some kind of additional tanking utility through the spellbook, and not through discs. But seriously, don't get up on a soapbox and try to deny that both Paladins as well as Shadow Knights get some damn cool abilities that Warriors can't come close to matching. <br />
<br />
If you needed a triple-bypass surgery, would you get a neurologist to operate on you? No, you'd get a cardiologist. That's their specialty; that's what they do. Warriors are the cardiologists of high-end tanking; that's what they do, and they do it better than anybody else. And they SHOULD do it better than anybody else. Warriors give up far more on the NON-high end tanking level of the game, than a Paladin or a Shadow Knight does. It's only right that they maintain some kind of superiority in their own ballpark.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The real problem EQ has is that drivel like this goes unchallenged in the class balance forum of a supposedly respectable board.<br />
<br />
No Guyfencin, the real problem is not that there's drivel such as the post you quoted from Tamener. In all actuality, that &quot;drivel&quot; was the result of very valid concerns for far longer than one expansion. The real problem is that people talk out of their asses, using snide comments as opposed to well thought out arguments supported with fact, to try to prove their points.<br />
<br />
This is the quote you criticized: &quot;The real problem Knights have is that warrios played second fiddle to them for so long they don't know how to deal with us being the more desired tank class again (like it should of been all along).&quot;<br />
<br />
This was a prevailing mentality of a large percent of the Warrior population for a very long time. Knights currently claim that bazaar geared warriors can tank better than raid-geared knights. Well guess what, completely naked Knights have been able to grab aggro better than raid equipped Warriors since the first high end weaponry ever began to exist. It is only now, with the final onset of an aggro discipline, as well as some kind of high end raid weapon setup (dual wield) fully augmented with anger + WA5 that Warriors can actually safely maintain a reasonable degree of aggro above even a Paladin or Shadow Knight that is semi-seriously trying to outdo the Warrior. And it's still shakey even at that. A lot of good our defensive and riposte disciplines have done us while we couldn't get the enemy to hit us to begin with! It's far worse on the non-raiding part of the game, where weapon setups are simply far worse. The example I give above is the example of a raiding Warrior with a DBoW and EoE. A CHoS/SoBS Warrior won't even come close to outaggroing the Paladin or the Knight. When it came down to it, on an experience group level, clerics and casters preferred Knights to Warriors because it was SAFER to cast spells and heals on an enemy that had the superior aggro of a Knight.<br />
<br />
This did in fact cause Warriors to ride second fiddle to Knights in experience groups for a very long time. Early PoP, before the flags were removed from zonesm it wasn't rare to see 13 - 15 Warriors sitting lfg, while Knights tanked in Plane of Valor (which at that point, was still cutting edge experience) and even in Bastion of Thunder. When the zones opened up, even more Warriors would be sitting lfg for hours, while Knights still dominated the experience scene. This largly effected non-raiding Warriors more than raiding Warriors that would be experiencing in higher zones, and a majority of that non-raiding population STILL REMEMBERS THIS. You simply cannot deny the hard feelings that caused.</div></div><hr />

Warriors have a clear cut raid and group role.  They get to play THE primary role when any group/guild breaks into new content.  They are sought after for groups and required for raids.  They are preferred for nearly all content that drops cutting edge gear.  In any guild that isn't pure dkp, warriors get priority on plate drops and even in dkp systems, there's often a quiet push to get the warriors geared up first.  OF COURSE they want to retain this status and suggest that it's fair for their nearest competitors to be better at soloing.</div></div><hr />
