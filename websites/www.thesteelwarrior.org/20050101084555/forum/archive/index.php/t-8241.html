<br />
I'm new to being a warrior. I've been a necro most of my life. But I wanted to try melee, so I went to the heart of melee, the warrior.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize warriors had tomes... (yeah... I know) Where do you buy them? I looked in the POK library, but I never saw a warrior tome seller?<br />

Yeah I have a warrior and when I purchased the Provoke tomb, I was like .. wow that's awesome.   Now I use it for pulling since it has a pretty good range.  <br />
<br />
Btw, is there any implications with pulling with Provoke?  I could hold agro like a champ when I pulled in some LDoN adv and I had really gimp weapons (43 warrior though, using Wurm Slayer and Centi Longsword)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is contraticting reports on using provoke for pulling<br />
1. some says it's great.<br />
2. some meets behavior, in which they did pull but the mob plows someone else on inc.<br />
3. domaging the mob before provoking (ie using a bow to pull and chaining it with provoke on inc, before meleeing) may solve the obove problem almost always.<br />
4. sparsely, it has been reported that proke don't work at all on range even after taging with bow (may have been a bug).<br />
5. wizards have found that opening with DD on a mob has  a big chance to generate 30% more hate than usual. so is it possible with non DD spells ?<br />
6. wizards have parsed that opening with concussion prevent the above behavior even if it actually doesn't decrease hate under zero (ie it has no effect on opening). so is it becuase it generate zero hate on opening or because it isn't a DD spell ?<br />
<br />
so the question on what pulling with provoke do is still open ...</div></div><hr />
