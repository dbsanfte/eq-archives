<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Broadaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am on the last peice of my Strength of Elements quest.<br />
<br />
I normally group with 4 people.  Our group consists of a 65 warrior(me), 65 monk, 65 druid, and a 65 cleric.  <br />
<br />
Buffed I have around 8khp and the monk has somewhere over 5k.  <br />
<br />
What is everyone's opinion as to our ability to take out the mob in The Hole. <br />
<br />
I would also be interested if anyone might have any equipment upgrade suggestions.  My magelo is listed to the side. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">guardian is level 70 I think , so I'd say no on pacify.</div></div><hr />

You cannot pacify either the Guardian of the Seal (level 70, well red to 65 anyways) nor his two guards (believe they're 65) as you get 'this spell does not appear to have any affect'<br />
<br />
The good news is that the ore drops everytime, though this may not be true.  My logging shows we looted 3 ores in 6 fights with GotS (clearing guards each time), but everyone has one so it sometimes rotts and I don't remember to add it to my webpage as having dropped.<br />
<br />
The other good news is that if you position everyone on the farthest side away from GotS, right on the water's edge, you can have the monk pull and FD to the 'rock door' right there.  There is enough room and difference in walk speeds of the GotS, that you can get the guardians alone.  If you have the key to the door, you can run on up the ramps and pull GotS way away and guards will come back first, no problem.  Using the latter techinique, will require you to kill the guards a bit fast, else the GotS may come back and aggro.  I'd recommend the first method.<br />

<br />
Facing away from the pool of water near Nortlav, there's a rock in front of the ledge.  Stand on the far side of it from the GotS.  Easiest way to pull is FD pet trick.  Pets have smaller agro radius's than PCs, so if only the pet attacks then the GotS doesn't assist.<br />
<br />
Might consider buffing resists on the SK/Necro (so pet resists nukes) and hp buffing the pet (so it survives the trip back).  Pet Discipline AA works best also.<br />
<br />
Plant pet near the construct.  Have the SK/Necro stand where I mentioned above and FD.  Have someone target a mob outside the rock door to check if FD is successful, if you want (GotS and constructs near him are non-KoS).  Have them send the pet to attack (also hitting the follow button so he returns to the necro instead of where you planted him), and then either spam /pet back off after pet gets agro on the construct you want, or hit /pet hold if you have it.  The construct will nuke away at the pet, usually, before following...alone.  Wait until the pet and mob have reached the rock before necro stands to make sure you are indeed out of assist range, then simply kill the gargoyle.<br />
<br />
He's got a lot of hp, but he's simple.<br />
<br />
Did it with one group...took a little bit.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, the group was a 60 SK, 65 Warrior, 65 cleric, 64 cleric, 65 druid and a 65 enchanter.</div></div><hr />
