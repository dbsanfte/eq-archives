<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking to try to find a list of proc augmentations that are warrior useable. Has anyone seen anything like this or is anybody currently working on a list like this? (on a side note what's the highest HP aug for armor that has been found?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are a LOT of augments that you might want to use...<br />
<br />
There's lifetaps, 25, 50, 75 and 100 point.<br />
Anger 1,2,3 for 100, 200 and 300 points of hate.<br />
Ykesha procs, for various amounts up to 150dd, all with 0.0 stun.<br />
Mirror Procs, that add a chance to reflect spells back at the caster, levels 1 to 4 I believe.<br />
There's cold based DD procs.<br />
There's also a proc that I believe is a rune, from 50 to 200 points worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heated blade 50dd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would LOVE to see a breakdown of proc augmentation point costs, effects and people's opinions of them.<br />
<br />
I'll try to put together what I know and post again in a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay first of all please keep in mind that I am guessing on the point costs of many of these procs, based off of the information available to me but after looking at Lucy's raw spell data and the stacking here is a list of known proc augmentations:<br />
<br />
20 pts Blast of Frost 20 cr dd (this duplicates a low level spell)<br />
<br />
30/?/?/? points Mirror I, II, III and IV (5%, 10%, 15%, 20% targeted spell damage reflection for 3 ticks)<br />
Comments: This would be good for PVP servers but is largely useless elsewhere. It does not affect AEs and will not stack with Bounce or Reflect<br />
<br />
150/510/760/1150 Guard I, II, III, IV (5% upto 50hp max, 5% upto 100hp max, 5% upto 150hp max, 5% upto 200hp max for 5 minutes)<br />
Comments: This is a longer lasting self rune. It will not stack with the Vie (CLR) series of spells.<br />
<br />
150/510/760/1150 Spell Guard I, II, III, IV (5% upto 50hp max, 5% upto 100hp max, 5% upto 150hp max, 5% upto 200hp max for 5 minutes)<br />
Comments: This is a longer lasting self spell rune. It will not affect AE spells. I'm not sure about DoTs. It will not stack with the Aelendor (ENC) series of spells.<br />
<br />
150/510/760 Anger I, II, III (there is no IV listed in Lucy's) (+100 hate, +200 hate, +300 hate)<br />
Comments: Does anyone know if Anger III woudl be &gt; or &lt; hate than a Ykesha proc<br />
<br />
150/340/510/760/1150 FR dd's: Chill (50hp) Icicle Stike (75hp), Icicle Claw (100hp), Vox' Bite (125hp), Permafrost (150hp)<br />
Comments: These are currently set as Fire resists. This is a mistake, I am sure and will be changed someday.<br />
<br />
150/510/760/1150 Ykesha (mr dd and 0.0 stun): Bite (50hp), Strike (100hp), Force (125hp), Wrath (150hp)<br />
Comments: these are all MR dd's.<br />
<br />
Finally, here are a few procs that have reportedly been released with LDoN but I cannot find in Lucy's data:<br />
340 points Vampiric Talon (LT)<br />
1150 points Vampiric Kiss (LT)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought I better throw in an explanation of Guard and Spell Guard for those who do not already understand how these works..<br />
<br />
Essentially the proc will buff you to mitigate an additional 5% of either melee or spell damage (Guard vs. Spell Guard) for 5 minutes or until a set number of hit points have been absorbed.<br />
<br />
That means that the level I versions will last 5 mins or until you take a TOTAL of 1,000hp damage (5% of which is 50), the level II version will last 5 mins or until you take a TOTAL of 2,000 damage (5% of which is 100), the level III version will last 5 mins or until you take a TOTAL of 3,000 damage (5% of which is 150) and the level IV versions will last 5 mins or until you take a TOTAL of 4,000 damage (5% of which is 200).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Finally here are my opinions on these procs. I'd love to hear other people's too...<br />
<br />
Mirror: Since I do not play on a PVP server, Mirror is worthless to me.<br />
<br />
Spell Guard: Since I will never try to solo casters, this has no solo utility. Caster's aren't common enough that I'm going to worry about 5% damage reduction from nukes. This proc might be useful on a raid weapon 'built' especially to combat high-level caster mobs with targeted rather than AE spells. In most of those situations, however, there should be an ENC present to cast the Bulwark of Aelendor spell (or however you spell it) so this proc is IMO worthless.<br />
<br />
Guard IV: This has some utility in xp groups because it is unlikely that you will convince your CLR to spend Peri after Peri to maintain the Bulwark of Vie on you (which lasts 36 minutes or upto 16k total damage) but, IMO, its true usefulness would be when soloing. Ultimately, it's only saving you 200hp a fight but you could choose to think of it as adding 200hp to your total pool.<br />
<br />
The Icicle Line: I don't like that they messed up the resist on these. It makes me nervous. Plus, I am confident in my MR procs. I know MR is often resisted more but it's rare that I'm not in a group that lowers MR and on those mobs where all my procs are resisted.. Oh well, then I DPS a little bit lower. This might have some utility in PVP or soloing.<br />
<br />
The Vampiric Line: I haven't thought too much about these because the info is so vague. LTs are supposedly slightly less aggro then stuns. These have obvious advantages in solo situations.<br />
<br />
The Ykesha Line: This is where I really become uncertain. I would love to add the DPS and spell interupts of Ykesha to my weapons but aggro is my main concern. For my own part I think I am leaning towards Ykesha for my weapons. [EDIT: Also, the old Ykesha proc had a level limit on it. These do not appear to according to the data in Lucy's]<br />
<br />
The Anger Line: I wish there was a way to know how the Ykesha stuns compare to +300 hate. If anger ensures aggro more often I would choose this, if not augmenting Anger is a waste of DPS and spellcasting interupts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One final thought: DPS additions from the Ykesha proc (ie what it costs you in lost opportunity if you get Anger III instead)<br />
<br />
Asumption: Mainhand procs 2/minute, offhand procs 1/minute<br />
<br />
DPS additions of Ykesha<br />
Bite (50): 1.67 MH, .83 OH<br />
Strike (100): 3.33 MH, 1.67 OH<br />
Force (125): 4.12 MH, 2.08 OH<br />
Wrath (150): 5 MH, 2.5 OH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do these procs only work in LDoN content like some of the charms that I have seen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">nope, they work everywhere ... <br />
<br />
Stuck heated blade into my BoC for fun, just to try it out, worked in PoP zones, so im assuming they work everywhere ... that only working in LDoN stuff is mythical</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are a few augs that only work in LDoN, but I haven't seen any procs limited that way. The ones that are limited mention it in the desription, something like &quot;Gives you more stamina while on an adventure.&quot; or some such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I bought a charm slot item that gives AC only in LDoN dungeons.  (my AC blows...)<br />
<br />
Anywho, thanks!  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Smakz,<br />
<br />
When you augmented your BoC did your weapon proc more, less, or the same? And, when it proced...did it do both at the same time or was it just one at a time?<br />
<br />
My concern is if the proc is the same then those times you proced the augmented effect then you might have missed the opportunity for EB to proc instead.<br />
<br />
Just curious...thanks</div></div><hr />

List of drops, maybe not complete, but a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Has anyone purchased the &quot;guard&quot; aug?  If so does it have an agro component like rune?</div></div><hr />

I've had both my procs go off at once on the same swing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Anyone happen to know where to get slot 4 solvent at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Far as I know there is no slot 4 solvent.  There are only 3 slots on an item (slot1, slot2, slot3), but those slots may be of different TYPES (type1, type4 (procs etc.).  If you want to remove an aug just figure out which of the three slots it's in and buy that solvent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yea your right, im thinkin i need a slot 4 for a type 4, just had em backwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kabal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Are the hate, ykhesha, and LT augments available along all story lines or are they only available with a specific story line ie<br />
<br />
Deepest Guk <br />
Miragul's Menagerie  <br />
Mistmoore Catacombs  <br />
Rujarkian Hills <br />
Takish-Hiz  <br />
<br />
I just got this last night and haven't looked around that much. I did one adventer and now have 51 points, but one thing I coulcn't seem to figure out is if you augment your weapon can that augment later be undone and improved? Reading the above text it looks as though it can but was just wanting to make sure I am reading that right, also when you do remove an augment is it lost or can it be reused?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the hate ones are from mistmoore<br />
the yak ones are from guk<br />
lt i dont remember<br />
and yeah you gotta win adventures from the camp you want to buy the augs from (i.e. you want stun aug you gotta win advs from SRo camp)<br />
only a few items that do not have a theme when you look in vendor window can be purchased with any kind of points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not quite true (or ambiguous at least)<br />
<br />
You need to get a certain amount of points in a theme to unlock the items in that theme's teirs. Once unlocked, you can use points from anywhere to buy them.<br />
<br />
eg:<br />
<br />
You have:<br />
300 points from Guk<br />
400 points from Everfrost<br />
600 points from Butcherblock<br />
Total = 1300 points<br />
<br />
You cannot buy items from the 500 tier in Guk or Everfrost, but you can buy from the 500 teir in Butcherblock. You can buy 2 items from the 500 point tier from Butcherblock if you wish, leaving yourself with 300 points left.<br />
<br />
If you then went out and gained 700 points in Mistmoore (total points now =1000), you could buy a 500 tier item or two from Mistmoore, or another one or two 500 point items from Butcherblock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">mm and butcherblock are same camp.</div></div><hr />
