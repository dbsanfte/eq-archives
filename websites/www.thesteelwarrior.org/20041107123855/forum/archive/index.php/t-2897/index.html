<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Starting a new thread for impressions on Beta, now that the NDA is lifted.<br />
<br />
My impressions on Beta: The missions are all about rushing around, kill this ASAP, pull the next mob, let's go, let's go...<br />
<br />
Hybrids being able to generate more aggro, they are much better equipped to handle the frenzied, rushing pace than the warrior, who requires time to build his aggro.<br />
<br />
Tanking on normal is trivial enough that rangers can do it, so on normal, which I believe the vast majority of players will be, there's no benefit to picking a warrior, save perhaps the slight<br />
DPS a dvantage from that warrior. <br />
<br />
Rogues are needed in many dungeons to scout the proper way in many of the missions, if you don't go the right way, you won't succeed in assassination or NPC rescue missions. There are a LOT of dead ends.<br />
<br />
Pally/shaman healing combinations work great, druids work just fine as healers, you really don't need a cleric in LDON.<br />
<br />
DPS classes are KING in LDoN IMO, all the dungeons are about getting things done ASAP. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, you NEED some sort of CC, that can be a bard, chanter, or another plate class, but you pretty much need a CC of some sort, as well as clarity and speed (as it slows you down bigtime without them) however on the bonus side you can usually find achanter in the wayfarer camp who's prepping to go out on a journey to cast em for you if you don't have a chanter.<br />
<br />
LDoN augmentations are interesting. Most that I saw were +6 to a given stat or resist. however, this I would suspect will change in balancing.<br />
<br />
Traps on the boxes are goddamn brutal, they can wipe out a party in under a minute if you're not on top of cures of various kinds. ALWAYS a far better idea to have the box disarmed and opened by soemone who can do it.<br />
<br />
Mobs at level 65 usually are level 56-62 in con.<br />
<br />
There's various kinds of mobs in the dungeons, depending on the &quot;theme&quot;, for example I've seen mobs with predominantly undead some with elemental, some with lots of animals... charm can last for quite a while or for no time at all, charmed pets make GREAT additions to DPS, however they can wipe the group if charm breaks at the wrong time. If the group wipe, you pretty much are guaranteed a fail, you usually can't CR and get back in and expect to finish in time.<br />
<br />
That's bout all I can think off of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Nearly every piece of gear outside of LdoN can be augmented.<br />
<br />
All zones are indoor, means no horses, and no sow, altho they are adding a new indoor sow, Shrew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I enjoyed the fact that CRs are really easy. You are able to recover really quickly, imo, unless you don't know what you are doing. I havn't played on the beta for about a week, and unless they changed something.. I never had problems getting in after a wipe and then  recovering.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a good expansion, I enjoyed the time I spent playing it, and will be worth the money the way I look at it. Instant content owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem with the wipe is everyone being able to get back into the dungeon, rezzed, rebuffed, and ready to go, really quickly.<br />
<br />
Adding the soulbinders to the wayfarer camps is nice, and it helps, but it forces you, or at the very least, a rezzer, to change thier bind point to the wayfarer camp closest to the dungeon, every adventure. If not, running back from a given town or the Planes takes way too much time.... because that timer is still ticking down whether you're in the dungeon or not.<br />
<br />
At any rate, that would be much more of an issue for Hard adventures, I don't see people wiping on normal unless they're pretty much clueless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1% from what I saw per kill, aaexp at 65. It's been a while since I was on beta though, so it may have changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">obs at level 65 usually are level 56-62 in con<br />
<br />
no need to say more, there goes 65 AA exping down the drain, but what did we expect?</div></div><hr />
