&quot;Combat Fury is great for holding aggro, it increases your dps!&quot;<br />
&quot;I say you should get This one first!  No, don't get that, get this one first!&quot; <br />
<br />
We've all heard statements like this before.  I got bored today and decided to try to help newer warriors out by compiling a list of every possible AA a warrior can get, categorize them into their primary function (as defined by our class roles: Primary-Taking Hits and Holding the Mob's attention.  Secondary-Dealing Damage), and rank and how effecient it rates against other abilities that fit into the same category.<br />
<br />
People can now decide what area they want to improve upon (Tanking, Getting/Maintaining Aggro, Dealing Damage), look at the list, and get a general idea of what they should go for next.<br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions/criticism, please feel free to post.  I'll try to keep the thread updated as people's general opinions come in (ie, if more tanks think ND&gt;ID/LR).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
THE ESSENTIALS<br />
<br />
Abilities that, while they don't actually fit any of the other categories, they are something that should be gotten as soon as possible<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Innate Run Speed - 1<br />
<br />
Area Taunt - 2<br />
<br />
Swift Journey - 3<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
*****************************<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
TANKING ABILITIES<br />
<br />
Abilities that help you live longer against a mob, whether you're soloing, exp'ing, or on a raid<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Combat Agility - 1<br />
Combat Stability - 1<br />
Natural Durability - 1<br />
Sturdiness 1 - 1<br />
<br />
Physical Enhancement - 2<br />
<br />
Innate Defense - 3<br />
Lightning Reflexes - 3<br />
Planar Durability - 3<br />
<br />
Planar Power - 4 <br />
<br />
Sturdiness 2/3/4/5 - 5<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Explanations/Notes: <br />
- There is no difference if you level up CA1/CS1/ND1/CA2/ND2/CS2 or if you go CA3/CS3/ND3, or if you start with CS instead of CA, or ND instead of...etc.  They all make about the same impact in the long run.  If your HP is low but your AC is good, level up HP first...if your AC is low but your HP is good, level up your CA/CS first.  It's really not that big of a deal.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
*****************************<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
AGGRO ABILITIES<br />
<br />
These abilities are able to increase the hate you are able to keep on the mob...equally important as tanking abilities, when you make the realization that if the mob isn't hitting you, all your HP/AC/AAs are being wasted.<br />
IF AN ABILITY IS NOT LISTED UNDER HERE, THEN IT WILL NOT HELP YOU KEEP AGGRO ON ANY MOB!<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Weapon Affinity - 1<br />
<br />
Ferocity - 2 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity - 3 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
Punishing Blade - 3 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
<br />
Flurry - 4 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
Raging Flurry - 4 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance - 5 (Cross-Listed with UTILITY)<br />
<br />
Double Riposte - 6 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
Flash of Steel - 6 (Cross-Listed with DPS)<br />
<br />
Sinister Strikes - ?<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Explanations/Notes:<br />
- Weapon Affinity is listed first assuming the warrior has a significant aggro proc (Enraging Blow, Anger3, etc).<br />
- Ferocity grants an extra chance to double attack no matter what weapon scheme you are using, so it is the cheapest/easiest to get AA.<br />
- Ambidexterity/Punishing Blade are put in place to be dependant on whatever tanking weapon choice the warrior uses.<br />
- Flurry is, in my opinion, the second best aggro AA we have (behind Weapon Affinity).  However, I placed it behind Ferocity and Ambidex/PB because of the amount of AAs needed to max it (48AAs when you include the prerequisites) -- getting those two will give you more bang for your buck faster.<br />
- Stalwart Endurance lets you avoid being stunned -- in other words, you are able to continue to melee, building aggro and keep up with your proc-rate.<br />
- Double Riposte is a marginal increase in aggro -- basically, it gives you an extra swing about once a minute (that's an eyeball figure...if somebody has actual data I'll modify it). <br />
- I'm adding Sinister Strikes to the end of this list.  There is some discussion over whether the increased damage bonus in your offhand will in turn increase your aggro.  I am waiting for an aggro test to come up (similar to that which was used in this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789)) which proves Sinister Strikes increases your offhand aggro.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
*****************************<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
DPS ABILITIES<br />
<br />
These take a back seat to the Tanking and Aggro abilities, if you're looking to optimize your role as a tank.  However, these are very important for exp grouping situations -- the faster the mob dies, the better.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Ferocity - 1 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
Tactical Mastery - 1<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity - 2 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
Punishing Blade - 2 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
Sinister Strikes - 2 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
<br />
Combat Fury - 3<br />
Fury of the Ages - 3<br />
<br />
Flurry - 4 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
Raging Flurry - 4 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
<br />
Double Riposte - 5 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
Flash of Steel - 5 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
<br />
Ingenuity - 6<br />
<br />
Strengthened Strike - 7<br />
<br />
Finishing Blow - 8<br />
Coup de Grace - 8<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Explanation/Notes:<br />
- I put Ingenuity at 4, but really it could change depending on what weapon you are wielding, and if you have any levels of WA yet.  Wielding an Ethereal Destroyer with WA5 will put Ingenuity higher on the list, dual wielding DBotW/BF won't even include Ingenuity at all.<br />
- Sinister Strikes is only worth getting if you dual wield (obviously)<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
*****************************<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
UTILITY ABILITIES<br />
<br />
These are abilities which are important to the warrior class, but do not necessarily fit into any of the previous categories<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance - 1 (Cross-Listed with AGGRO)<br />
<br />
Hastened Instigation - 2<br />
<br />
Innate Resists - 3<br />
Innate Charisma - 3<br />
<br />
Living Shield - 4<br />
Extended Shielding - 4<br />
<br />
<br />
Fear Resistance - 5<br />
War Cry - 5<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Explanations/Notes:<br />
- Innate Charisma is listed because it is, generally, one of the important stats to a raiding warrior that is not easily maxed with gear.  Charisma increases the chance of DI succeding (DI is a buff that, if you are low on health, dispells itself and has a chance to fully or partially heal you.  DI succeding refers to a heal taking place, DI failing refers to DI dispelling itself but no heal or a partial heal taking place)<br />
- Level 3+ is listed to fill out at your wont.  None of them are game-breaking, and depending on your play style, each can be better than the one before it.  If you are a warrior and you don't use /shield, I recommend you try it out.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
*****************************<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
FLASHY ABILITIES<br />
<br />
These abilities, for lack of a better description, are just gravy.  They have minimal uses for any job that a tank may need to fulfill in a group situation, and are mostly used either for showing off (like Rampage), or to help soloing, or have such a minimal effect on gameplay that they're not worth getting until last (innate str, anyone?)<br />
<br />
There is special preference given to the abilities that are worth spending points on because, while they don't help with actually tanking/damaging/helping a group, they are definately worth getting before others.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism - 1<br />
Innate Regeneration - 1<br />
Natural Healing - 1<br />
Convalescence - 1<br />
<br />
Rampage - 2<br />
Furious Rampage - 2<br />
<br />
Innate Str/Sta/Agi/Dex/Int/Wis - 3<br />
Innate Lung Capacity - 3<br />
Lasting Breath - 3<br />
Heightened Endurance - 3<br />
Warlord's Tenacity - 3<br />
First Aid - 3<br />
Bandage Wound - 3<br />
Mithaniel's Binding - 3<br />
New Tanaan Crafting Mastery - 3<br />
Packrat - 3<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Explanations/Notes:<br />
- Some people swear by metabolism, other's think its a waste.  If you find yourself annoyed with having to buy food, or if you spend considerable time/effort getting food that satisfies your tastes, its definately one to consider<br />
- Understand that most of these are situational abilities.  Some people feel it is very important (soloers may feel the bind-wound abilities are very important.  Tradeskillers will probably want to get New Tanaan Crafting Mastery.  Pretty self-explanitory<br />
- Rampage is top priority if you have an Earthshaker.  Duh.<br />
----------------------------------------------</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice Post. <br />
<br />
a few things I seem to remember about aggro that dont fit, i might be wrong though.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that crit spells dont count as extra aggro, most wizards I talk to say they dont, but then again a few do.<br />
<br />
I was never able to fully understand the whole aggro from swings post. but wasnt there something about the damage bonus of a weapon figuring into the aggro? Or am I offbase there - If so would that make sinister strike a slight aggro ability, since it improves offhand DB, and theoretically aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korak Sarathai</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it hard to argue with anything in your post.  It is thorough, and in the opinion of this warrior entirely correct.  Btw, I am one of those solo'ers that did his first aid :).  Binding to 100% is awesome for just 3 AAs invested.  It is a great mana saver for topping up people after a mass rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple things:<br />
<br />
The first rank of sturdiness is only 4 AA for 100 hit points.  That's 25hp per AA and hard to beat with any of the other hit point AAs.  While I agree that high levels of sturdiness should be delayed considerably (100hp for 20AA? bleh!), sturdiness 1 is a great, great deal.  Get it early.  Sturdiness 1 and probably sturd 2 as well also blow away Planar Power.<br />
<br />
The agility, stability, and hit point AAs are all very important and I'd have a hard time ranking one ahead of the other.  I'd increase them all at once, but the exact order isn't real important.  <br />
<br />
Sinister Strikes will add several percent to your dps.  I'd personally rank it well above Ingenuity.  <br />
<br />
You do note the high cost of Flurry.  I just can't say enough what a ripoff it is given the high price.  Totally maxed to flurry6, you gain a few percent dps.  It's no more and possibly less than simply getting ambidexterity for 9 AA.  Absolutely get that nice utility disc Stalwart Endurance first, unless you're an ogre.<br />
<br />
All and all a nice way to categorize the AA though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kurim</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to agree with Callon on most points, although i personally love both flurry and PP =)<br />
<br />
If it had been around at the time, I certainly would have valued 100hps for 4AA from sturdi 1 instead of ND, but ND gets to be more bang for buck eventually.  Maybe Sturdi2-&gt;ND3-&gt;Sturdi5 for the hp approach.  Likewise, WA gets pretty expensive toward the end for small improvements where PB/Fero/Ambi could potentially be better investments.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a few things like PP might be put in several categories.  Dex adds to procs adds to DPS/Aggro.  STR lets you carry more bixie stingers.  It's not *just* for tanking.  Rampage can be used as a mini-AE taunt if you can get it in before the chanter starts mezzing, it's not just flash.  And I swear I noticed a significant aggro difference when I dinged Flurry...<br />
<br />
I don't think it's possible to create a cookie-cutter template for people that are missing &lt;hps/aggro/utility/babe-magnet-skillz&gt;, and I'm not sure you'll ever get 100% agreement on what ranks better than what, but it's cool to have something to work off, thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crit procs do not give more aggro, so you can take Ingenuity off of the aggro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aet should be above wa, wile you cant get it before wa its worth gtting as soon as possible if you have agro problems sometimes.<br />
<br />
a non flashy way to use rampage is to get a eb/stun proc on just about every mob in range, or when you flb up a pull.<br />
<br />
would cross link planer power with dps and agro. higher dex slightly more procs and higher str= higher attack = more dps, <br />
<br />
might move physical enhancement lower and nd up since haveing nd cs ca then pe seams to be more benifit per aa cost, but accual order of purchase dosent matter much. and if your doing the cs ca route first then i would place lr/id above pe due to cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Innate Run Speed - 1<br />
Swift Journey - 1&quot;<br />
<br />
You contradict yourself. Basically, the first statement doesn't describe Run 3 or SJ-2. Improved run speed isn't flashy. Granted it's not much of a tanking tool, but it's not what you describe this category as being. And somewhere along the line you realized that indeed Run speed and Swift Journey don't match that description, so you added the second statement to sort of offset that.<br />
<br />
Why not just put Run Speed in it's own classification? It certainly deserves it. It's the most functional, powerful, efficient AA in the game. It is what it is. And for 3 mere points, it's the most power you'll ever see per point spent in EQ. Swift Journey is a tad pricier, mind you, but Run 3 will always be economy in a can. Just separate the Run AAs off into their own little category/world. Everyone else already does this anyways. There's Run Speed AAs and then there's the rest of the AAs.</div></div><hr />

It should definatey help the younger warriors out there and even some of us vets. I leanred a couple things and have a few more to think about now =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changes I'm making:<br />
<br />
I'm moving Durability up above Physical Enhancement.  Its logical, it's the way I did it...I'm not sure why I didn't write it that way.<br />
<br />
I added an &quot;essentials&quot; group for Run Speed and AETaunt.  Superchum is right.<br />
<br />
I removed Ingenuity from the Aggro possibility<br />
<br />
I split up Sturdiness, because one level of sturdiness is definately a first-getter (didn't think of it that way because I had already had max hp AAs when GoD came out)<br />
<br />
I modified some of the notes to reflect the changes I made<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for a few comments: Regarding Flurry, it's not a DPS AA nearly as much as it's an aggro AA.  You swing 2 more times.  You may miss, but you're swinging...and that's raw hate.  It's quite significant, (or seemed like it to me at least).  As for Rampage, in my opinion it really isn't significant enough to include in anything other than flashiness/non-expgroup/non-raid situations (although I admit I havent tried it).  What do you guys think?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback! keep em coming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sorta disagre with some of your basic categories.  The primary purpose for ferocity / PB / flurry and such is their DPS increase, yet you list them under agro aas.  This might be sorta confusing to some.  To be truely useful you should probably list every applicable AA under each category where it applies.  That way if someone wants to improve their DPS, they will train the right aas in the right order (i.e. fero / PB and such first) rather than working on combat fury and ingenuity which you have listed as dps aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for putting this post together in the first place, and thanks for revising it based on the input of the community. I have found the discussion very helpful for planning.<br />
<br />
One question: are there points in your leveling where it makes sense to pause and grind some AA's? Or are you better off to work your way to 65 and then grind AA's?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Lathen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">65 &gt; AA's<br />
<br />
Easier to get at 65 and the levels will help more than any AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only AAs I would endorse getting before hitting 65 are:<br />
Run Speed 3<br />
Swift Journey 2<br />
possibly New Tanaan Crafting Mastery, if you are tradeskilling and find it necessary.<br />
<br />
In comparison to level 65 vs all the other AAs, I would choose 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As to the DPS/Aggro category, I guess you're right -- does anyone have any feedback on roughly how much DPS is increased from Fero, PB/Ambidex, Flurry, Riposte when compared with TM?  Either parsings or general consensus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Understood that flurry gives you both additional dps and additional aggro due to more swings.  As do ambidexterity, ferocity, and punishing blade.  My point was just that parses show flurry to be a very minor  benefit relative to its cost.  It really is only a few percent more for 36 AA (48 counting the combat fury prereq).  You get just as much if not more of an upgrade from 9 AA spent on Ambidextery, assuming you're using 1 handers, or 12 AA spent on punishing blade for 2 handers.  <br />
<br />
You did list it below all of those skills though.  It's above Stalwart, but if people look at utility they'll see stalwart at the top and know it's pretty good.  So I guess it's alright.  <br />
<br />
Almost all of the aggro abilities could be cross linked to dps as well.  That should be self evident to most people though.  <br />
<br />
Can we add a steaming pile of crap category for stuff like Packrat?  :)<br />
<br />
Ingenuity --  Let's take one of the best case scenarios for it.  Okay, it's not quite best case, but what warrior is going to have weapons with DD procs and then aug those with DD procs?  Let's say you're wielding a pair of weapons that both proc 179 dd.  You have WA5.  You'll average 4.5 procs per minute.  Someone recently posted a long log in another thread where they included a crit proc rate of 9.25% with Ingenuity 3.  That means the crit procs will add another 75 dmg per minute with this setup, or 1.25 dps.  I doubt most warriors even use that much of a dd proc on their weapons.  Anyway, these numbers should give you an idea about how much you'll get with whatever DD proc setup you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most usefull AA :  Run3<br />
Best AA : AE taunt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Callon, what about an Ethereal Destroyer(750DD) in one hand and a SoD (288DD) in the offhand.  Throw a pair of 125 ykeshas on each one (this is best case scenario that I can come up with, but there may be better)  WA5 on both.<br />
<br />
ED Main Proc Rate: 2.775 / minute (because it has a -15% proc mod built in), 750dmg = 2081dmg/min = 34.68dps<br />
<br />
Breaking it down by 90.75% at 750, and 9.25% at 1500, and our new DPS is:<br />
680.625 + 138.75 = 819.375dmg / proc.  At the 2.775 / min proc rate, new damage is: 2273dmg/min = 37.89dps<br />
<br />
Now, that's more math than I feel like doing while travelling to a Tipt group right now, but you can see that right there you have an increase of 3dps.  It's not huge, but it's an increase...and until I see some parse of Strengthened Strike, it's going to stay where it is on the list :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But factor in the amount of damage you are losing by going with a high damage proc weapon rather than a pure dps weapon or an aggro weapon with a superior ratio.  The question is, will that setup produce enough damage via procs to outdamage what you could've done with a better ratio weapon.</div></div><hr />

But who does this?  As Derrict said, you'd probably give up weapon dmg ratio to do it, which you'd have to subtract from any dps gained with procs.  I was going with a setup that maybe is more reasonable for the amount of procs someone might actually use.  Of course Sinister Strikes will help you with all dual wielding setups, not just the high proc ones.  <br />
<br />
I'll check some of my recent parses, but based on rough calculations of an average offhand hit of 50 or so, for simplicity assume the same 18 delay weapon in primary (that's a 13 dmg bonus right? I can't remember for sure, it's 13 or less, so 63 per hit), an offhand swinging 80-85% as much as primary, and my 5 dmg per hit bonus on my 18 delay weapon from the AA, I've estimated Sinister Strikes as a 3-4% dmg upgrade.  <br />
<br />
63 + (50 * 0.85) = 105.5 before sinister strikes<br />
63 + (55 * 0.85) = 109.75 after<br />
<br />
(109.75 - 105.5) / 109.75 = 3.87%<br />
<br />
If offhand only swings 80% of the time, it's about a 3.7% upgrade.<br />
<br />
Obviously that's an estimate.  Of course I'm wasting time, because it's easy to get a parse and figure out.  I know I get 5 dmg per hit extra from sinister strikes right now.  All I need to know to find out how much it helps me with my current weapon setup is how many hits I get with the offhand, count each hit as 5 more points of damage, and see how much total damage I did over that time.  <br />
<br />
I seem to remember parses of ambidexterity showing somewhere around a 4% dps gain, so it's fairly comparable, but obviously ranks lower because it costs more (not to mention ambi is a prereq).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, nice list, and you'll never get total agreement on the ranking of all the AAs.  :)<br />
<br />
I'll look into sinister strikes more just because I really want to know what it parses out to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An easier way is to see your offhand swings per second, which can be found easily using EQC since it displays the HPS or just by taking total hits div total duration.  <br />
<br />
I posted parses with graphs and junk on Sinister Strikes on the rogue forum but it's pushed off already (damn you ezboard).  I have the data in HTML format and I'm not going to convert it here (too much work) but it basically ended up showing roughly a 3.27 dps increase unbuffed, 41% worn haste, all offensive AAs.  Hasted, this figure increases to approx 5.5 dps for  a rogue.  Warriors should get roughly the same increase, give or take +-1 dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPS:<br />
TM and SS &gt; Fury. Getting all 6 Fury AAs gives under 2 dps increase, painfully low dps per AA. Even though TM and SS are situational, they give so much more dps/AA than fury when in use (not attacking from behind the mob, dual weilding) that even if not used vey often, they are better.<br />
<br />
UTILITY:<br />
I would put HI in group 2, or even 1. AE Taunt is Huge for us, it's only real drawback being refresh time, so decreasing it even marginaly is nice. But I can see the argument for keeping HI in group 3; this is just my own feeling with no numbers to back it up.<br />
<br />
FLASH:<br />
Rampage should be all alone at rank 1. Of course, with the caveat: if you have an Earthshaker. Shaker Ramps are Enormous flash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked some of my recent logs, taking data over several days from multiple zones including BoT and GoD sewers among others to get a feel for what SS did for me personally.  My weapon setup is a 17/20 in primary and a 14/18 in the offhand.  The only actual damage proc is a 179 dd in the offhand.  I counted all my melee dmg plus the proc damage.  I dual wield almost 100% of the time because I'm almost always the main tank in my groups and I'm the main tank for my guild as well.<br />
<br />
Total damage dealt was 1,253,365 points.<br />
<br />
Damage bonus on the offhand was 5 points.  <br />
<br />
Total offhand hits -- 9,871 for 49,355 dmg from sinister strikes.<br />
<br />
(49,355 / (1,253,365 - 49,355)) * 100 = 4.1% more damage<br />
<br />
For me then, it's roughly a 4% dps upgrade that I use almost all the time.  For 15 AAs, it far outpaces the return per AA of many of our offensive AAs, especially Combat Fury, double riposte, etc.  So I'm pretty happy with it.  <br />
<br />

305 dex is needed to get the 2ppm anything less is well not 2ppm. it defintly would fall into the relm of opinion weither the increas in max dex from 280 to 305, or the currently iirc unknow rate of flurry firing would be greater agro. from the purely aa cost perspective. many would agree pp should be bought befor flurry if only for tanking additions(kinda makes it a moot point). from the dps perspective the attack and unparaseable proc increase would still net cheaper dps increases. in my opinion this would place pp above flurry on just about any part of the list. <br />

What was the duration of the fights for the dps gain itself?  4.1% is an excellent gain but SS will remain a fairly constant DPS since it won't scale as your offhand weapon improves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My log parses are at home.  I'll check them later, but point taken, Derrict, that as my weapons and over dps improve, SS will be a lower percentage increase.  Also more attack buffs I have up, the more dps I will do and thus the less percentage gain from SS.  I took the parse from several different zones and I'm sure I had a variety of attack buffs up.  I was going more for an overall average of what I get from the skill.  For dps, all I can really do is take YALP's word for it, whatever it came out, but YALP seems to be kind of off sometimes on it's timing.  I use 17/20 and 14/18 weapons right now.</div></div><hr />

I made a reply but I guess it didn't make it through.  Like Callon mentioned, it's delay div 3.5 to find the offhand damage bonus so this keeps the offhand damage bonus dps fairly consistent within 0.5 dps regardless of the weapon you use.  As you get a faster offhand, the DB decreases.  Vice versa, higher DB for a slower delay.

<br />
I guess I was thinking it but didn't type it.  What I meant was the difference in delay but the same damage bonus.  A weapon with 19 delay has the same DB as a 20 delay weapon but the 19 delay weapon will do slightly more dps, roughly within 0.5 dps of the 20 delay weapon but the overall damage increase is roughly 5-5.5 dps with ambidex and fero 3 and should remain consistent regardless of the weapon in offhand.<br />

<br />
You say:<br />
&quot;IF AN ABILITY IS NOT LISTED UNDER HERE, THEN IT WILL NOT HELP YOU KEEP AGGRO ON ANY MOB!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then go on to not list all the dps aas.  However, increasing your dps will increase your agro so the above statement is FALSE.  Further if you look at the aa's listed under agro, Weapon Affinity and Stalwart Endurance are the only ones that do not increase dps. <br />
<br />
Ie you should list all the dps aa's together, put weapon affinity and stalwart endurance under the misc category and mention that they will aid in agro (in the case of WA only if you have an agro proc from the weapon and not from an augment of course).  <br />

<br />
There is a difference between your DPS and your aggro.  More damage does NOT mean more aggro.  That's the whole reason I've separated them.  Combat Fury will NOT increase your aggro.  Flurry will.  Sinister Strikes will NOT increase your aggro.  Stalwart Endurance will.<br />
<br />
Let me recap for you what causes aggro.  Your aggro is caused by either:<br />
A) Procs<br />
B) Potential Damage<br />
<br />
Increasing your swings increases potential damage.  Increasing your average hit per swing, or increasing your attack, or anything that doesnt make you swing an extra time, does not increase your aggro.<br />
<br />
Some people have asked that I cross list many of the aggro AAs under DPS so that those tanks who just want to increase their DPS without worrying about aggro train things in the correct order.  I'm considering doing that -- but I was waiting for more feedback.  I'm probably going to make the change soon, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um yes it does, go test it.  If you take two identical warriors (use level 5s or so with lots of hp buffs so they live) and have them attack a mob with identical weapons with no procs (rusty sword or some such).  Have one warrior with a zero weapon skill and have the other capped.  You can even give them an attack buff if you so choose.  Now with these two warriors, potential damage is the same, there are no procs and the ONLY difference is dps.  The higher dps warrior gets agro every time.  I tested this back in velious when I was doing my ac tests, if you do not believe me feel free to test it yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference in aggro is miniscule at level 65...if I remember correctly, something along the lines of a swing's worth.  There have been EXTENSIVE tests on how hits and misses play absolutely NO role in aggro.  Tests where 15hits 10misses pulled aggro at the same exact time 5hits 20misses did.  Tests where damage deviation went nearly double...and yet, it all has to do with your weapon swing.<br />
<br />
By the way, in order to do the test you described, you'd need at least 3 characters...<br />
One to pull initially.  Then one warrior has to stand there and taunt until successful.  Then the other.  Then, you need to have them both turn autoattack on at EXACTLY the same time.  As in, no deviation at all.  Why?  Because the one who turns on attack first will get aggro, otherwise (assuming all other things equal).<br />
<br />
If you give one a simple atk buff, nothing will change.  If you give one haste, or a weapon with more potential damage per second, then he will get aggro.<br />
<br />
Either way, though, you can't compare two toons at the same time, because of things like attack time syncs, proximity agro, and I'm sure there's more.<br />
<br />
I have logged tests done by respected members of the EQ community to support my theory.  All you have is &quot;I tested this back in Velious.&quot;  If you can show me otherwise via a controlled test, then i'll be willing to change my tune.  Until then, increasing your average damage will do two things for your ability to maintain aggro: Jack, and Shit.</div></div><hr />

As was mentioned, there is every reason to believe that SS will increase your aggro, since it adds a DB to the offhand. Aggro is not based on &quot;potential&quot; damage per se, but on some other formula that seems to weight the DB portion higher than the rest of the damage. Some have suggested damage+db, but that doesn't quite work, though it is closer than the &quot;potential damage&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I had finally finished off the standard warrior defensive AA route, and was getting to the point where my AA path wasn't totally set in stone, so I wasn't sure what direction I wanted to go.

Now for what I think, AA's should be used on the bassis of making you survive an encounter. If you are the MA of your guild you may want to go with CS3/CA3 and LR5/ID5 first, being that you are the one taking the hits. If you rarely tank for your guild you may want to go ND3 Sturdiness and the other HP AA's (although the others only give a small amount). My thinking for this is simple. If you are not the one taking the hits directly then you need to have as many HP as you can get to survive those AE's and such. Because when it comes down to it, it is all about SURVIVING.<br />

<br />
  I got six aa at level 55. (Run3 and Regen3) then leveled to 65. AA have been extremely<br />
  easy to aquire at 65. The first things I went for were ND1, ND2 and ND3.<br />
 <br />
  ND3 for six aa gave me 250 hp while sturdiness 1 is 4 aa for only 100hp, which I havent<br />
  yet purchased. <br />
<br />
  I will most likely be working to notch aa  in many abilities from now on rather then <br />
  focusing on anything special. It seems to me its more worthwhile to work my aa<br />
  thats only equally to whatever Im wielding. So 2h and 1h skills are out for now, <br />
  I am a master of all weapons, but I have no master weapon as of yet.<br />
<br />
  Keep moving forward and your enemy will fall at your feet. =)<br />
<br />
  That being said, whats the best aa to work on for dps, that isnt dependant <br />
  on your weapon type, or 1h 2h type skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a sweet post to review. But I have one question?<br />
<br />
The AA's are there grouped by usefulness and what not.<br />
<br />
If a warrior was working up to 65 and wanted to do AA's along the way. They would place say 10 pct into AAs. They ding an AA every couple levels, how should they go about placing AAs?? I know a lot of people that while raiding they place all EXP into AAs as that is a better place to put the exp to get maximum out of the meager exp that we get while raiding. So that ups your AA dinging to say one every level (for someone who raids a lot) to one every other level. <br />
So now a common mid active char that raids say once or twice a week will ding lets say one AA per level to level and a half of exp dinging. This is not a bad bonus in my book. Now where would I place the AAs??<br />
I know 51 AAs and 60 AAs are general and place them where ever to get to the next tier of AAs and or what not.<br />
But looking at the current ranking of AAs you have Sturdiness up at the top, which it is an AA that can only be gotten when you have AAs up to Warrior Planar Abilities. (That is the last tier of AAs before GoD)<br />
Yes I know you are saying it is important and what not but is you have someone like my self that is reading this for information about the class. I have a level one warrior that I am currently outfitting to play in place of my main or to set it up as a 2 box with my main. Main is a 65 Shaman. I am looking to get a 2-box going and this is all depending on the mood of the wife when I start after it 8P. <br />
 <br />
So the question<br />
Can anyone place these in pority per level that you can get them?<br />
Something like: <br />
RS3 REGEN3 for tier 1 (51)<br />
CS, CA, ND for tier 2 (55)<br />
PE for tier 3  (59)<br />
ID, LR for tier 4 (60+)<br />
So on and so forth for a defensive type warrior (a warrior that is after max AC and HP)<br />
And how about another for the offensive type warrior. (a warrior that wants to go after all the damage and agro type AAs)<br />
<br />
If this has been done somewhere else please just let me know the thread so I can read it as I have missed it somewhere and have not ready all the threads yet</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't, I would go full xp until I hit 65.  Level &gt; all in EQ by FAR.  And to top it off, getting aa's at 65 is much faster than at 51-64.  <br />
<br />
IE if you put 10% of your xp towards aa's at 51 and levelled to 65 you would have some number of aa's, let's call it X.  If you levelled to 65 and then xp'd until you got to the same number X aa's, it would take you less time by a pretty wide margin.<br />
<br />
Further your first 6 aa's have to be in general, run3 and metab3 seem to be the best there and those aren't anything much to worry about.  From the archtypes ND1-3 are the 3 best here...but here's something else to look at, use magelo and see how many hps you would get from ND3 and compare that to how many hps you get each level and again you will see that you are better levelling than aa'ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, this is total exaggeration.  The only way that AA is much faster is if you're in a high DPS tier 3 PoP group.  Otherwise you can do an AA an hour in Chardok or Droga or something of that nature at level 60 easy.<br />
<br />
I don't regret going to 65 when I did, but all my friends who stayed 60 fuckin passed me in AA's and then caught up to me at 65.  Where-ever this mystical 20 minute AA that everyone who's 65 seems to talk about, I couldn't find it, and likely, neither will you.</div></div><hr />

PoE gets close to this rate with a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, first off, to answer the initial question:<br />
 <br />
If you want to know what ability to spend your points in at, say, level 58, just see what ones are available to you, see how they rank, and pick whatever ranks highest for whatever you want to do.  That's why they are rankings, and not a list of what AAs to get when -- it gives you a heirarchy of AAs, and how they match up with each main function.<br />
 <br />
As for what general AAs are worth getting, get whatever you want.  They are situational...iI can make an argument for Warrior01 getting stamina and run3, another for Warrior02 getting regen and run3, Warrior03 getting the bandage one.  Run3 is hands down the best to get, but anything after that is just whatever you want.<br />
 <br />
----------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
As for AA vs reg exp; again, it depends.  The reason exp is faster at 65 than at 60 is because getting groups are easier.  You will get a decent group at level 65 far more often than you will at 60.  Your relative power increases a bit at level 65 (notice the amount of hp you get from 63 to 64, then from 64 to 65).  However, the biggest argument I personally make is that, in the time you could have gotten 2 AAs you could have gotten another level -- 2 AAs will not buy you the same benefits that another level will get (increased AC, hp, aggro, dps, resists).<br />
 <br />
Of course, it all depends on the group you can get, and the zone you hunt in, and your gear.  Yes, there are places you can get AAs in 30minutes or less -- PoEarth, PoFire tables, I've heard that GoD has some fast AA spots too.<br />
 <br />
However, I *do* feel that whatever you're going to focus on, be it AA or regular exp, you should do it 100%.  Why?  For starters, some parses have shown that some exp is lost in the percentage breakdown.  However, the real reason is that you're taking longer to enjoy the benefits.<br />
 <br />
Assume you go 50% / 50%.  After 10 hours, say, you have gotten one level and 3 AAs to buy your new skill.  That's great.<br />
 <br />
Now, lets go 100% AA.  After 5 hours, you got the new AA.  Now after 4hrs30mins, you got your level (your aa helped you kill faster).  You had that AA 5hrs earlier this way, and you thus benefitted from it more.<br />
 <br />
The only time I can see not going 100% is if someone is going 90% to fill up their exp bar in 65 (in which case there is no readily enjoyed benefit).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When I was a 53 in droga grouped with all 65's - the reg xp wasn't moving, I assumed it was nerfed because I was too low.  I switched to 100% AA's and got one blue per kill, very fast AAs IMO.  Now I'm a 63 and in a kick butt BoT group, I'm still only getting 1/3 blue per kill on 100% AA's.  Which I can also get in PoV, only the mobs go down faster.  I fought reds in PoM and I'm only getting 1/3 blue per kill.  I'm guessing the zones have a lot to do with it.<br />
<br />
I never got to try AA xp while I was a 60, it went too fast.  I dinged 60 on a Friday night and after 3 LDoN's with all 65's in the group, (ding) I was 61.  Haven't seen XP that fast since I was in Paludal Caverns !!  I would love to work on more AA's now, but I need to grind to 65 so I can get the most points in LDoN, Anger 3 is expensive and I think it would be a shame to put Anger 2 on a BoC.<br />

I say i am a low end one because the guild i am in currently cannot effectly kill tier 2 named mobs with out a wipe or two.<br />
The current melees in my guild are not raiders per say. They are not on every night. They do not log on for raids when we post them ahead of time. The guild is a family based guild that likes to hang out and just group every now and then. We have had 65 warriors that where equipted way above what we could raid and get come into the guild stay 6 months or less and then leave for a higher end guild.<br />
So i will not be seeing then end game for some time. Plus i am on a less popular server and we have like 5-6 guilds that are elemental flaged and 2-3 that are time flaged. and maybe one that can farm PoTime. I am on The Tribunal server.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I hope my question about how to do the AA's per level question i posted above makes a little more sence. Yea if i was in a guild or could just go out and flag the elementals and farm the AA's like you all say in PoEarth or in GoD zones i would rush to 65 and farm them.  But in my situation i can't do that as it is just out of reach for the most part.<br />
<br />
Another thing that i have seen and i do not want to fall into this sterotype is &quot;OH we have a 65 warrior that will tank PoV.&quot; Once the warrior gets there he just dinged 65 and has no AA's and is ok to Tier 2 outfited. He gets one in camp and drops in health fast. Then after he leaves or the next day we get a level 60 warrior that has been working on AA's off and on and when we get 2 in camp he gains argo and then takes the beating but he is outfited for it. That looks good and people remember that.<br />
<br />
So that is why i ask about the AA's and if anyone can place them in a ranking per level that you can get them...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its certainly not an exaggeration in any way shape or form.  Unless you have a regular group (which it sounds like your lvl 60 friends had) you will have a much easier time getting a group at 65 than 60.  (Hell these days when I log on I turn on LFG, and go solo somewhere with a bot cleric and just be lazy and wait for a group invite I want to join.)  If you do get a good group at 60, your example is Chardok or Droga, and crank an AA an hour, I promise you the same group at 65 can crank more than that in a no-flag zone such as BoT or HoH or even better if they do have flags.<br />
<br />
If you do have elemental flags so much the better you can easily get an aa every 30 minutes there.  Sol Ro can break an 1 aa/hour, hell PoV if you take all the caves inner and outer in a good group can break 1 aa/hour at 65.<br />
<br />
Here are the facts, 1 aa requires the same numeric xp at 51 as it does at 60 as it does at 65.  Its self evident that as long as you find an xp spot with mobs within 5 levels of you, you generate xp faster at 65 than 60 as you are killing higher level mobs.  The only possible way 60 could be faster or even as fast as 65 is if there are NO available xp spots at 65 with mobs within the xp bonus range.  And that's obviously wrong as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that is why i ask about the AA's and if anyone can place them in a ranking per level that you can get them...<br />
<br />
My advice applies for any warrior, regardless of guild.  Hell if you are not even in a guild it applies.  Having access to the better flagging xp zones just makes things easier.  I levelled to 65 and aa'd in BoT before I had access to the better xp zones myself, also without aa's.  <br />
<br />
The only copy of the old xp tables I can find online is:<br />
http://eq.jeuxonline.info/guides/experience/table.html<br />
(Now this is not 100% accurate any more but it serves for our purposes.)<br />
You need 24,815,677 to get through level 51, ie this is how much you need for an aa.  To go from level 51 to 60 you need 400,131,000xp.  This is equivalent to 16.1 aa's.<br />
<br />
Let me re-state that.  If you put 100% xp towards aa's at level 51 and another warrior xp'd at exactly the same rate and put 100% xp towards level you would have 16 aas by the time he hit level 60.  <br />
<br />
For your 16 aa's you have to have 6 in general, call it run3, metab3...no help in tanking there at all.  Then your next 10 will go towards ND1-2 and start saving towards 3.  (Yes I recognize you can't actually train in ND until level 55 but I am just using this as an example of how you waste your time aa'ing before level 65.)<br />
<br />
I just plugged some #s into Magelo.  I get that you would gain ~635hps to go from level 51 to 60.  At level 55 (when you can put aa's into ND1-3) I get that you would gain 238 hps for ND3.<br />
<br />
Are you seeing what I mean?  Don't forget here that level is still the most important thing in the game, above the visible #s even.<br />
<br />
And one final thing I will say.  If you take a level 65 with zero aa's and a level 60 with the same xp and some aa's (however few that turns into, probably something along the lines of 20 aa or so only).  And put them in identical gear and have them tank the same mob, the level 65 will tank better HANDS down and have more hps and more ac.  There are NO game mechanic situations whatsoever under any circumstances where you are better aa'ing than xp'ing.  Period.  (By game mechanic I mean ignoring something like Role play reasons, wanting to slow down levelling to stay with friends when you play more reasons, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had a level 60 with AAs who tanked better than a 65, the 65 either sucked at being a warrior, or the 65 had crappy gear compared to the 60.  That's all there is to it.<br />
<br />
You put that 60 at 65 and take away his AAs, and he'll still be better than the 65, because Gear plays a pretty big role as a tank, hands down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did have a permanent group, and we were all good players.  Shit like Chardok kennels at 60 (with no cleric) was ridiculous AA, and I'm telling you, I could not duplicate that fact in BoT or HoH, we tried them both.  Even switching my shammy to the main box, and pulling with her while i just left autoattack on with Haass, there was no way we were getting anything close to the AA rate we could get at 60....in multiple zones no less.  We could do it in FG, we could do it in Akheva, Chardok and Droga.<br />
<br />
I keep hearing everyone tell people that they can get AA's that fast in Elementals, but that's such a bullshit thing to tell people.  Sure, maybe half the people who post here regularly are flagged, but the VAST majority of people playing the game never will be, and they'll never see numbers like that.  Because I can promise you that my group pulled faster and gained more XP than any random pickup group in BoT or HoH could ever hope to do.  And that's not me waving my cock around, it's the truth.  When you play EQ with people for 4 years, you turn into a very well oiled XP machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course.  Pickup groups are horrible compared to a well oiled machine.  Have you tried the CY in BoT, or the PoV caves, or Tactics arena, using the same group you spent in chardok?  (I saw you reference it, but you were sorta ambiguous with your pronouns)...because I've seen damn good exp from those spots.</div></div><hr />

I never got flagged for tactics, PoV never impressed me at all, and BoT just wasn't that great of XP.  I made a helluva lotta cash off Ornate there, but that was about it.<br />
<br />
I dunno what kinda groups you guys have going on either, because the rogue I grouped with did pickup groups on the days I worked, and he never found anyone who came anywhere close to the kinda DPS that my group did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The groups that are good exp in BoT is the courtyard, and yes, you can get an AA an hour there easily.<br />
<br />
The same with PoV -- if you're in the desert, you're getting loot (metallic liquid, mainly)...the exp is less than in pov inner, where no loot worthwhile drops.  Try the caves in povalor, you'll be surprised.  I've heard of 45minute AAs there with a good DPS group.</div></div><hr />

Humm I had a pick up last night an we where doing the outter camp. I got a 4-5 blues from the time i got on about 7ish untill i dinged at 12 ish. We did have one group change out where we changed about 3 char's. (this dinged my main to 62) We where pulling some of the inner also as their was no one camping it.<br />
We had 2 tallons for the rings of gallentry drop and like 5-6 parchments during this time. Everything was yellow cons and one or two red cons. Then i dinged and everything was even cons.<br />
If you have a good group doing outter and most of inner before your repops then yea i can see getting phat exp.<br />

I do not know maybe it is just that it seemed slow as i was watching each kill for the exp? But i would say it is ok to decent exp.<br />

2% AA per kill, requiring 50 kills for 1 AA.  Most groups I've had in the zone were with a cleric oom after 10-12 chain pulls, requiring &quot;med time.&quot;  I haven't been in the zone for ages but it might be better AA per hour now that it might be less crowded so there's more mobs to keep chain pulling.

<br />
2% AA per kill, requiring 50 kills for 1 AA. Most groups I've had in the zone were with a cleric oom after 10-12 chain pulls, requiring &quot;med time.&quot; I haven't been in the zone for ages but it might be better AA per hour now that it might be less crowded so there's more mobs to keep chain pulling. I always remembered running out of mobs to pull when there were 20-30 in the zone.<br />
<br />
Any pickup group will be like that.  You cannot expect to get stellar exp in your average pickup group.  You bring a high dps group to PoV caves, and the AA will fly.<br />
<br />
But what should someone do for the next 3 AA's to unlock the next level at 55+ level requirement AA's?<br />
<br />
Really, it depends on your tastes.  Even with the changes in sit regen, Regen is always a good choice (regenerating an extra 3hp/tick wont seem to make a big difference most of the time, but when you're dotted, every point matters.  When you aren't the MA, every point matters as well).  <br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you buy stat food, you may want to go Innate Metabolism.  It saves trips to the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
If you do a lot of tradeskilling, and you want to be able to go over 200 on two skills, you may want to pop three points into New Tanaan Crafting Mastery.<br />
<br />
If you want to dump some points into a stat, like Stamina or Agility, that is also fine (especially for a casual player).  If you don't forsee maxing a particular stat any time soon, it couldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
Really, the general AAs aren't anything to worry about.  With the exception of Run3, they really don't make a huge impact on the game until you get to PoTime (where resists and regen play a big part).  My personal advice is to go for Metabolism, because longer-lasting food is something that both casual and hardcore raiders, can enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Bingo. <br />
<br />
I think this is understated in the original list by putting it as a #2. I would say with the bards/shammies/druids/rangers I play with I am at SoW speed+ more than actually at my Run 3. Now I realize that reflects my personal play environment and may not reflect that of others but there is no way anyone can deny what AET brings to you.<br />
<br />
-instant aggro on names/bosses<br />
-add control capability in exp groups (i.e. hit it and the 3 adds hit you while your CC people get them locked)<br />
-raid tank switching ability<br />

I would agree with about 99% of all that yall say but would like to add my experience with getting 65 and how I went about AAs.<br />
<br />
First I was hesitant on exping to 65 because as we all know the grind is loooooonnnngggg!!!  With alot of advice from my 65 elders I stopped at 60 to grab Run 3 and Regen 3.  Also cause LDoN had come out and having the ability to run for my life if all else fails seemed a good idea lol.  Pushing on to 62 I had been having trouble keeping agro in PoV and physically staying alive so I decided to see what my AAs had to offer.  I got Combat Stability thinking if I killed the mobs faster then I wouldnt take as many hits LOL.  Thinking I needed to do some research I contacted many already 65s in established guilds like Triton.  They told me that going to 65 was first smarter due to being able to get groups easier in zones like BoT, Tactics, and others.  Plus I will be gaining HPs each lvl.  <br />
<br />
Now at 65 I belive that was the best advice I recived.  Turning to more high lvl warriors in the guilds I contacted before my question was how should I go about my AAs?  All their answers again were the same: HPs, Area Taunt, Defense, Then my Attack AA's.  Presently Im beginning to explore my Defense AA's.  I got studiness to 1 but thought the dump of AAs was a waste for only 100hps, cause just improving my armor has me at 8100hps raid buffed.  I maxed my first round of Disease Resist because our guild had just entered the SSRA rotations.<br />
<br />
My question is from what I have now how should I begin my Defensive AA's?  It might be a lengthy post so if there is any sites with it mapped out individually I would greatly appreciate the link or if anyone is bored and wants to post them lol.  I read what was posted above me but I guess was slow on understanding the progression.  I bet once I have all my combat ability AAs I will understand lol.<br />

Thanks for the time and sorry for the long post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, using the post above, it gives you a description of how each will help you.<br />
<br />
If you want to improve your tanking ability (ie, how well you take hits), go down the list of the Tanking AAs, and buy them in order (the 1's first, then the 2's, etc etc until you are satisfied or want to see more dps or something).<br />
<br />
If you just want to put out more DPS, go for the DPS abilities.<br />
<br />
If you just want to improve your aggro, go for the Aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
If you want to just be a well-rounded tank, get the 1's and 2's of each department as you see fit.<br />
<br />
The problem with AAs is that there is no right way to do it, because everybody has different needs.  The guy tanking BoT doesnt have the same needs as the guy raiding cutting-edge GoD content.  If you want to know what the best AA is for your tanking, it is the CA/CS/ND line (and really, everybody has a different opinion on which you should get first, just do those three however you want).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ooka<br />
<br />
I totally disagree with this Ooka.  AE Taunt should be one of the last AAs you go for.<br />
<br />
Actually, AE Taunt is probably the most dissapointing AA I've gotten.  I was so psyched when I got it, but: 1) It has such a small radius that it really doesn't do much.  And  2) Even if it does manage to pull the mobs to you, the first time a cleric heals you, they will pull any mob you aren't hitting right back onto them.<br />
<br />
I can't hardly think of any raiding situations where it's really helped either.  As MT, you are focusing on the main mob and the last thing you want is adds.  Maybe it might help as a tank mezzer, but you don't usually want more than one there either.<br />
<br />
I use it so rarely in fact, that I often forget it's there.<br />
<br />
The best reason to wait on it though, is that when you use it, you'd better have the HP to back it up.  In other words, get those HP AA first, and then worry about the AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You ever had a MT die on a boss mob?  If your dps are doing their job, the back up tank will not be # 2 on the list.  Single target taunt is awful to rely on for gaining quick aggro from boss mobs.<br />
<br />
AET is not really about the area factor of the ability.  It is about being able to have something that you know will pull the one mob you need on you the most back onto you without failing (other than bs z-axis issues)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found AET to be fairly helpful, in LDoN's, Sewers and on Raids.<br />
<br />
LDoN + Sewer: Bad pull?  AET + Furious = 12 sec for evac or cc.<br />
<br />
Raids: Need to be on top of agro list fast? (e.g., right after slow lands?): AET.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, I do have an issue with AET's range.  I was on an RD (HoH) trial and I was not in the tank rotation (the MA was a warrior, the SA was a pally) and I put in the Greatstaff of Thunder due to warnings about drawing agro (I normally dual wield the droga 1hb/1hs w/ ldon procs)...to make a long story short, MA + SA died &lt; 12 secs, and I'm watching more people die.  So I figure since I'm the only other warrior on raid I'd just walk up do an AET + furious and let raid know after about 8 seconds I have agro, slow it and heal me asap.  I know RD was targeted and I should've been in melee range...however, furious was essentially gone by the time I was on the top of the agro list.  I realize I should've swapped weapons back, but if I do AET and furious, I should stay at the top of the hate list simply from riposting every hit the dragon tried landing on me.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that AET does not work well with dragons due to range issues (or else 6+ ppl all had low health agro)...can anyone confirm or deny this?  Also, I read a thread on EQLive site about PoP HP AA (planar durability i think?) being possibly broken (giving less hp than it should) can anyone confirm or deny that?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I can see where it was really usefull for that before the new discs came out.  But since AE taunt takes so long to regen, and incite takes so little, incite seems more usefull for that task.<br />
<br />
But I guess, you do what you have to do to get the mobs attention and throw whatever you have at it.<br />

If you were out far enough that you could see his whole body, you were probably out of range when you mashed AET.  Try to get right up under large mobs when you tank them.  Large models are not always their entire body, but rather a core in the middle.  Get right under his belly and AET and you should have no problem.  Stay far away and proximity to core might screw you up.  Although RD does rampage and have a dot, so low health is a possiblity.<br />
<br />
Ehh, incite is a tool to help you stay on top once you get there.  It is not a tool to get you to the top unless you are very close to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I could see most of RD, yes...although I received no OOR message for melee or AET.  It sounds like AET is bugged when it comes to dragons then?  If I need to wedge my halfling body (or corpse) between it's toes first, then I need to Furious then AET for dragons I'm guessing...so that I don't die before I get close enough to get AET off.  <br />
<br />
Any other mob types that work this way?  Or better, if I've simply (and quite probably) overlooked a thread on AET details, could someone point it out to me?  I do not have any 'higher aa' guild warriors to look up to for guidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason AE taunt is better than incite for that situation is 400 hate in most raiding situations is NOT going to put you on top of the hate list. If it does, some people just aren't doing enough damage, or your maintaining more aggro while not tanking than most warriors do. Ae taunt will put you on top of the hate list, clerics should be able to spam heals on you and never get touched in most raiding situations.<br />
<br />
The real efficient way to do it though is to ae taunt, then incite, putting you 400 hate above whoever is on top of the hate list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Stalwart Endurance is a bit underrated as an aggro ability.  Lets face it, the most critical period of time for aggro is at the very beginning of a fight, be it on a raid or in an exp group.  When is the most likely time to be stunned?  The very first round you engage a mob.  Think about it, you know it's true!  A mob gets all his combat rounds at once, including kick/bash.  That has been my experience at least.  SE helps you maintain aggro right at the top of the fight, when you need it most.<br />
<br />
I appreciate tactical mastery being rated so high for DPS.  The &quot;strikes through your opponents defenses&quot; messages may be spammy, but they provide vindication for those of us who have preached TM's virtues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokhelk</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tactical Mastery::  the ability gives you the chance to strike through your opponent's defenses.  This includes through basic ripostes and enrage ripostes.  With TM3 i notice significantly fewer ripostes from mobs, and it particularly pays off on bosses and in GoD (especially for those still using two 1-handed weapons).  I feel it should be cross-listed at the bottom of the Tanking Abilities list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be fun sometimes to see what hell I would bring down on myself from the enchanters if I actually used rampage.  <br />
<br />
I don't actually have it...  Am not anywhere near the AA total that would allow me to spend (waste?) them on that ability.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it  is not smart enough to avoid mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
It kind of amuses me that the class AA's tend to be the last ones I need to get.<br />
<br />
I dinged 165 tonight and *finally* went after the final class AA's i needed for marshall.   And even at that, I probably should have gotten others first (innate defense - don't have that yet).  I probably could have easily gone over 200 AA before really justifying going after the class ones I needed.  <br />
<br />
Ended up with AE Taunt, Physical Enhancement and Ambidexterity and then loading up on Double Riposte 2, which is not really tops on the list of Aggro abilities.  I was all prepared to blow my last 3 i needed on bandage wound till I found out I needed first aid for it, so I had to go for 3 more to get DR2 lol.  Oh well... it worked out for the best.  Don't see myself bandaging much anyways )</div></div><hr />

  I mapped out all the AA's available to Warriors  in a chart that outlines what level they become available and how many points per level are available to spend.<br />
<br />
 Since my Warrior is not yet 65 and there is a lack of reliable information out there (especially on the point costs of the GoD abilities), I had to guess on a few of the ability costs.<br />
<br />
 I came up with 784 total AA's available to Warriors.  I have heard that the actual number of AA's available is 804.  Please check out the chart by following this link: (chart is in .pdf format and will open another window).<br />

It might take a little while to do it, but you can go into magelo and then look at the final product to see the costs of each level of the AAs.  For example, set up a warrior with sturdiness at level 3, and then when you look at the magelo link for that character, under his AAs it will show that he needs to spend 16 points for the 4th level of sturdiness, etc.  Would take a while, but you can get reliable costs that way.</div></div><hr />

I end up using it every time it comes up.  Dont have the AA yet to make it come up sooner.  Been working on hp/avoidance/damage mitigation ones first.  But yes it will be done soon.<br />
<br />
Geez... I can't believe people are still replying to that part of the thread.</div></div><hr />

Question is what aa allows your stats to be increased. I have Planar Power5 and my stats max at 310 now. I know Chaotic Potential will allow another 5 points, but I see magelos where people have their stats at 355. Sorry if I missed it in another post, tons of info to digest :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've just freshly ding'd 65 and decided to pursue aa's.  Came to the steelwarrior HOPING to find a decent post on what to get first and to my suprise I am left with a very confident feeling that I can pursue the correct path now.<br />
<br />
Great post, good updates folks and a heartfelt thanks to all the hard work everyone puts into things here!  <br />

<br />
The upgrade to ID/LR will be high on lists, as will Delay Death (IMO, Delay Death is almost as good as sturdiness -- 250hp for less than half the cost of Sturdiness!)  The DPS ones, I have to either do some parsing myself or take a look at other people's parsings to get a feel for exactly where they fit in.</div></div><hr />

About the only thing that I would say is that I don't think it is a &quot;truth&quot; that a warrior should go for levels before any AAs, as some have suggested earlier in this thread.  I'm newly 70, but as part-time MT in a &quot;just short of Time&quot; guild, I thought that it was necessary throughtout my leveling to hang back and pick up some good AAs along the way.  Yeah, you lose some bragging rights for level and yeah you might not get picked up by groups as fast, but once they see your quality, they will tend to look for you again.  Just saying, be aware of what is there for some &quot;quickie&quot; AAs to pick up as you level.  IMHO some are very much worth the time.  Just my 2cp.  <br />
<br />
Looking forward to OOW AA discussion, because that is my focus at the moment.<br />

There is really no incentive to NOT level to 70 (or at least 69) before going hard AA again.  Maybe to get Origin --- maybe.</div></div><hr />

By the way, am I the only one who does not think Origin is the greatest thing around?  Gate neck or gate potions are reasonably cheap(and OT hammer is not that hard to come by), take you to a more convienient place, and cost no AA points, leaving you free to get those AA's that improve your ability.  I am going to break down soon and get Origin, but the biggest use I see for it is to quickly get to Halas to turn in items for tribute.</div></div><hr />

I argued the same point with a ranger the other day.  Take the cost of a 10 dose gate potion (3k on drinal) and subtract the cost of selling it back to a vendor (1800) and you're really paying 1200 for 9 gates to your convenient bind point.  Save those 7 AA's for something else and spend the 1200 every week or so for your gate potions.  Word~</div></div><hr />

The biggest advantage is convenience.  You don't have to contemplate if blowing a charge is worth saving the 10mins it would take to run from KT to PoK, or the 5 minutes it would take to just run yourself.  Cast origin, and depending on your starting city it's just a hop, skip and a jump to a portal (for me in Neriak at least).  I don't even think about it, I just use it if it's up and it's faster than running.<br />
<br />
That said, there's not been a whole lot of talk lately about which AA is better than which from OOW, so I'm buying level 1 of a bunch of different skills and seeing how useful they are in practice (ie flurry, delay death, etc etc).  I'll get there, it will probably take a really slow day at work.<br />
<br />
Also, remember that with the GoD AA revamp coming soon, things will change.  I may lump them all together in one ol' update.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a million plat in the bank.  I do have a shaman friend tho to make me cheap reagents for gate neck(whatever those things are called).<br />
<br />
Cast origin, and depending on your starting city it's just a hop, skip and a jump to a portal (for me in Neriak at least).<br />

This is where I would normally throw in some coment about trolls loosing their city to frogs and laugh at you.  Please consider that I did that.</div></div><hr />

Lets do the math real quick..... 1200 for 9 gates is roughly 133pp per gate.  If you're really concerned about money, that less than a Blue Diamond worth of VT plat is bothering you, consider farming some money.  I'm not rich, far from it, but I AM at a point where nothing in the bazaar is really an upgrade for me.  <br />
<br />
And no, the biggest advantage isn't the convenience, because going to PoK (Where most are bound) &gt; Home city, no matter how close it is.</div></div><hr />

Small price to pay for permanently not having to worry about gate potions anymore.  I dont' regret buying origin at all and I use it almost every night.  Also gives me a reason go go back to Halas :D.<br />
<br />
It's sorta like a cobalt bracer.  I traded 60k worth of stuff for one back in the day, and that was enough for about 10,000 ant leg potions.  Having a permanent item/ability to do something that you can't do normally is worth a lot more than the price of potions.  Look at the threads about invis on the cleric boards.  It's not just the 11pp for a cloudy potion that makes me &lt;3 my cobalt legs :).</div></div><hr />

I love my cobalt legs too...... but if you're in the middle of a field of mobs that run bard speed and are gonna kick my ass when invis starts to fade, instant cast invis pots are the win.  I still use cobalt legs, but I also still keep instant cast invis potions because they're indispensible.   :)</div></div><hr />
