<br />
But more importantly I made him Agnostic don't ask me why, will this create problems in the future... is there still good armour I can get thats not deity restricted he is almost lvl 50 so I would hate to have to recreate him<br />
<br />
thank you for reading this post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think no matter what race you are, you get screwed out of the 'good' cultural stuff. Agnostics simply dont get deity specific equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
However, the velious sets of gear should last till 65 or you get better. Thurgadin, PoG, Kael, Skyshrine, Cobalt even .... should still be decent enough until then.<br />
<br />
If you got cash or adventure points to spare (not likely but still, lol) can find some various decent stuff in the bazaar or LDoN bought stuff.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt give up and re-roll. Deity is a minor aspect of the character (although key in some quests), but still... not big enough where I'd even think about starting over.<br />
<br />
Even at 50, I'd have to stick with it.<br />
<br />
As for all points into sta, that is definitely one of the better ways to go, generally speaking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes us unbelievers get the shaft on somethings but is not that bad and I can tank just as well as a RZ worshiper.</div></div><hr />
