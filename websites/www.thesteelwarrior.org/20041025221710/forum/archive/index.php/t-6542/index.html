<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I was tanking Xegony in the mini-corner on the edge of the island where I always tank her. Suddenly I couldnt hit her anymore and when I tried to pull her to me, so I could again (after 2 mins of not being able to hit her) she summoned me and I fell through the world. Ended up at ZI, raid wiped.<br />
<br />
Anyone had this happen or know any remedies?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to the world of DX9 geometry exploitation, of which you were an innocent victim. Thank the pile of shit called a new and improved collision engine for your prompt kick / resummon to zone safe spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Specc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not tanking xegony /sigh but Gaukr lol ..... pulled him popped myself in corner .... about 30 pct his health i fell ..... player beneath the world .. blah blah blah .. ended up at BoT GY ... /sigh did he bother summoning be back like a good mob ? NO did he bother chasing me to GY ? NO .. what did he do ? killed my wizzy first.. then my cleric then my chanter ..... and yeh that blew! same thing happened at tables .... Ive also experienced some SERIOUS issues with horses .. dunno what everyone else is .. but normally mount up 4 toons .. side by side (oreen for instance) ... all of a sudden tanking a mob i am OOrange for a heal .. i goto move a bit on cleric .. and player beneath the world .. group dies /sigh /sigh /sigh .. i heard JUNE was when they est fixing this !?!? is this true?</div></div><hr />

No way June at the earliest. That is ridiculous. SoE may not have any customer service, but they are not stupid. They like their income.</div></div><hr />

It feels like we're alpha testing the EQ 2 engine right now. Since reports from Fan Faire are that all anyone was talking about or showing was EQ 2, I'm beginning to believe they intend to drive EQ 1 into the ground and force people to EQ 2 that way. It sounds utterly idiotic, but the last few patches are not the work of geniuses, by any stretch. The Hello Kitty patch alone proved that they either completely ignore their QA or don't do any acceptance testing at all. Then the login servers are fubar for 3 days, wtf?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Our MT fell through the island yesterday.  (Didn't get summoned or anything)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kater, I'm taking a guess that when tanking her, you had her in the corner, and you were outside the corner with your back to the clerics, pushing her in.  The only real suggestion I can think of is to try an minimize your push on her, and let necros/wizards or whatever do all of the damage.  Hopefully she won't pop back into the wall again, because that sucks man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">#@$@% directx indeed.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what we were doing Aon.<br />
<br />
I have no clue how to minimize the pushing and still maintain aggro against the 40 mins CH rot, except for not having haste. I use an augmented BoW.<br />
<br />
Guess we have to try kill her in the open field, somehow position her there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know they have a QA department, but it's obvious that they're either incompetent or not listened to. (Edit: or both)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you dont kick, you will push less<br />
<br />
If you have your back to the wall and push away, with a second melee behind her to counteract the push when she gets too close, you will push less.<br />
<br />
I would assume so, at least.  I dont tank her in a corner, we use a different placement strategy...but I would assume you could treat her like any other long term pin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">stand in the 249, 538 corner, keep xego in front of you, have a monk with dragonpunch aa position her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stormbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Have a second tank on her back to help push/position. A Shaman can keep him up. Also one of the tanks can be in tells with a pally to push with stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At a certain point she starts jumping up insidethe corner a bit, just pull her back and all is ok. She didn't do this before the miracle patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know they have a QA department, but it's obvious that they're either incompetent or not listened to. (Edit: or both)Key word there is both. Yes mine was just a sarcastic statement, but really, sometimes you just have to wonder. How 5 guys can produce this over an entire year, and release it as-is, calling it new and improved with a strait face is beyond me.<br />
<br />
If i was designing cars and my &quot;new and improved&quot; version suddenly veered to the left while you drive at times sure as fuck I wouldn't sell anymore untill it's fixed. Why does that mentality change just because it's 1's and 0's in a compiler?</div></div><hr />
