<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bowedup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard KT was easier than vindi and is able to be pull solo to zone.  I was wondering if anyone had any info on him.<br />
<br />
Just generic stuff <br />
max hit<br />
Max hit with defensive<br />
cripplable<br />
aprox Hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can pull him to zone, but it takes a lot of work usually 2 FD'rs if they have never done before, and he is tougher than Vindi.<br />
<br />
Other than that, sure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can single pull both of them.<br />
<br />
Vindi max is near 800 (775 i think), KT is 675ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IIRC, KT = 400k hps and Vindi = 150k.<br />
<br />
Longer fight meh, we didnt have the mana regen when we were doing, he outlasted us with like 35 level 60 peoples. <br />
<br />
Took us a while to get KT solo, Vindi is pretty easy.<br />
<br />
It kinda comes down to DPS. But with enough DPS to down Tmax in 6 mins and two tanks, Vindi is dead with one defensive tank.<br />
<br />
I always thought KT was harder. <br />
<br />
Harder to find up, Harder to pull (initially), harder to outlast till a win.<br />
<br />
Vindi hits for 700 non disc and 450 disc'd. Cant remember KT, I always thought he was higher.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vindi - Quads 700s, Rampages, 150k HP.  Pretty well known mob.<br />
<br />
KT - Quads 575, Rampages, ~500k HP.  From observation, despite KT hitting a little slower and having a lower max hit, he tends to land a heck of a lot more rounds on you.  I'm pretty sure he has higher ATK as well, because to be honest, Vindi's ATK really isn't all that high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah eriatha's post is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">KT runs faster then his guards and most everything else in Kael ;)  Remember that while pulling him ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bowedup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks.  that is the info I was looking for.  So have a ton of healers or mad DPS.  <br />
<br />
Guess I'll stick with vindi for now</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't let the math scare ya.  If Vindi is pretty easy for you then TMax is definitely within your reach.  Give him a shot and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He's right...dont get scared.<br />
<br />
That being said, if you dont have the DPS don't do it.<br />
<br />
P.S. DPS goes up by a TON with just one more hasted DC ench pet or Bard singing full DS song in MA group. Especially on non-slowable Quad mobs.<br />
<br />
All it depends on is two good tanks and clerics that dont miss heals/Pallys that are smart on LoH/Patch Healers that Pay attention/Your Charisma :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">kt is easier in many ways actually - he doesnt hit as hard as vindi, nor does he ramapge as hard...you can have a chanter be rampage tank on kt &amp; never need heals :D <br />
<br />
if you bring a bard &amp; you have a beefy tank, you can kill kt with 2 healers.<br />
<br />
a buddy of mine pulls kt solo to wl zone line with a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im pretty sure KT rampages more than Vindi does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">KT rarely rampage and on the only parse I have, I count 24rampages in a 7min fights, which sound to be way less than vindi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I single pulled KT to ice bridge with my SK, just having a necro assisting me on split. he isnt hard to single at all<br />
<br />
What noobpuller guilds can do to single him<br />
Camp is set up at WL zone line<br />
just clearing all trash up to the bank roughly, then sending someone not KoS up to tormax (with SoE) that pulls him. KT outruns everything else, so all you need is to run all the way back and zone out, easy single pull at WL zone.<br />
<br />
oh and I RTed him then too. Not alot of RT damage, 1 druid can cover that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When we did it, he kept warping onto the pullers because they were so afraid of him lol. I assume (now) that you need to make sure he stays in Line of Sight, etc...<br />
<br />
He pwned the monk before he got past the wolfie pits, I know that, but the guy Had Gleed Agro at the time too iirc.<br />
<br />
little sketchy now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol being afraid... really.<br />
<br />
The fastest way to fuck up is to be afraid of doing the thing you know you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">we agree on that point. :)</div></div><hr />
