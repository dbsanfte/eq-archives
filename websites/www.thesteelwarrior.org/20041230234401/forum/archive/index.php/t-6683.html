I pretty sure he wanders the zone.  If i rememebr correctly when I was looking for him I had my Druid friend go out near where the entrance to DN is a track from there.  He initially showed up at the exact opposite corner from zone in but by the time we found him he had moved a good amount.  She could not pick him up from zone in.   My guess is a Ranger would probably be able to track him form anywhere in the zone given their track range is greater than Druid.<br />

Not really sure what his spawn/despawn cycle is but we found him right after a server reset.</div></div><hr />

After tracking for 4 weeks near SG zoneline with my druid, i moved him in the NW are of the zone where if found him 1 or 2 days later...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to track the elemental just stay by Sirens ZI. He paths right on top of zone towards watter every 20 min or so. He is rare spawn thought and ppl kill him when they dont have the hole pice which is stupid. Also he is very very easy kill. He is soloable by right classes now days. So I dont think he stays up for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He wanders all over. From the NW side of zone well past ToV (near the wyverns  is one of his stopping points), and as far south as the DN area, near the water (even in the water sometimes).</div></div><hr />

Could actually target though, so probably possible to pull him up.</div></div><hr />

Hi there, not sure if you got an answer or not, I just killed him last night, and this is what I found.  I had a druid with me, and he was only trackable near the far NW corner of zone.  We were underwater, and he attacked me, along with 3 adds.  What we did we get as far underwater NW as we could, and he came.<br />
<br />
We wiped, but after that, he went back up the hill, out of the water, and began to path normally.<br />
