<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This coming Saturday ( 24th) is finally the big race. Me and my 1989 Nissan Sentra will be competing in the last car running/100 lap Enduro at the local racetrack along with 75-100 other competitors. Winner gets $1000.- . <br />
<br />
The best part is...only rules are you gotta drive counterclokwise around the track, and to drive the car ( if possible ) in the infield to the water truck if the car goes up in flames. Oh, and you gotta wear a helmet. <br />
<br />
That's all. Wish me luck !! Poppa needs a new pair of shoes !! <br />
<br />
( and will be borrowing a camera and will be videotaping the race. Hopefully I don't get too mangled up and can drive it to the finish line )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good Luck Shikarii <br />

<br />
Keep us updated. Definitely.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">small update:<br />
<br />
last night they picked the car numbers ( your car number designates your starting position ) and.<br />
<br />
<br />
get this<br />
<br />
<br />
NUMBER ONE is ME.<br />
<br />
/happy dance. good part is no one is in front of me. bad part is everyone else will be chasing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/catch the dude who's got the ball !!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : Don't disapoint us Shikarii, all TSW are behind you .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">omg, could we have some pics of your car pre and post race? =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well; just got back from the track a while ago and it's a little dissapointing.<br />
<br />
Out of 80 cars I finished 14th. Sadly; my computer that controls the engine stuff decided to take a krap on me on lap 19 and i lost about 8 laps trying to get the thing straightened out ( punched it a few times and it cleared up  /boggle ).<br />
<br />
all in all it was a good day; no one in my race left in an ambulance ( the three previous classes to mine all had drivers leave due to 'mild concussions' ) and the pics should be back wednesday.<br />
<br />
i found out though i'll never run a 4 cylinder car in an enduro again unless it has a turbo. top ten to place were all turbocharged :( . my only saving grace was stamina and i crossed the finish line under my own power on the 80th lap. <br />
My only mangled parts of the car were the right side door and fender; i launched some dude's car into the air ( i saw his exhaust in my window :D ) and managed to hook some other car's rear bumper on lap 50 or so with my front nose and sent the guy into the wall and used him to left turn my ride.<br />
<br />
So; all in all thanks for the support and thesteelwarrior.org logo was on the car. i went down swinging for ya although i couldn't pull off the big one and take the top prize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tanzen Whacksem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Way to go Shikarri!<br />
<br />
How long was each lap?<br />
<br />
And you are right -- a 4 cyclinder, normally aspirated engine isn't going to cut the mustard for races of any length most of the time.  The engine just doesn't have the oomph to get it done, especially up against turbos.<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you didn't get physically dinged up, too.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I move that the board banner be replaced with a pic of thesteelwarrior.org logo on Shikarii's car.</div></div><hr />

/applause loudly  and yiel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Where did you get the '89 Sentra from? Its not your normal car is it? Doesn't seem like $1000 could cover the damages to the car, unless the event happens fairly often, and you have a car worth 2 or 3k that can last for the whole season of races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">oh, i only paid $25. for the car baadan :D it's basically all older cars on their way to retirement and this is basically just a fun race for bragging rights and some $$$'s. there's a new class they started called 'Grand Enduro' where you keep the car number for the year and you draw from a hat your starting position each race ( 8 per year ). they're allowed roll cages ( 4 pt. ) and better tires and them guys ran a 75 lap race that only had one ( ONE ) accident. They were getting it done out there. <br />
<br />
and to tanzen; my best lap was 19.89 for a 1/4 mile lap; in the straightaway i was hitting ~65 mph and scooting along rather well. it was a strong 4 cyl. that i had; but there was just no way i could get the rpm's up fast enough to pull it through the turns ( no one passed me on straightaways, in the turns i was a lame duck ). i ended up drifting most of the turns just to keep momentum going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i ended up drifting most of the turns just to keep momentum going.<br />
<br />
try acme glue next time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That sounds like fun :)  and putting the TSW logo on the car owns.  I want to see a picture of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You rock Shik, post some picks you slacker!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Given the turbo charger issue, sounds like you were driving pretty darn well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Small Update:<br />
<br />
The track officals called me during lunch and wondered where I went after the race. Found out that I didn't finish 14th...I finished 10th !! The unofficial count and my scorer placed me at 14th but I guess that was wrong. That means ...  $$$ !! ( i think $50.- ). <br />
<br />
Pics will be back as soon as the developer finishes developing them ( wife dropped them off this morning ).<br />
<br />
And yeah; I drove the hell out of that little car. I think I dented the floorboard mashing the gas :D Hopefully if the wife lets me i'll be back next year in the 6 cyl. or 8 cyl. class ( and I can actually find one; they're getting scarce these days )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Go go Shik, that sounds great! #10 is nothing to scoff at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Damn, where did you find a car for $25?? That sounds like a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That's awesome. Thanks for the updates Shik. Great job.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thats really cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">one pic so far from the track website; rest will be back tonight...<br />
<br />
this is what the race looked like @ lap 15 or so; i was getting shoved down by lapped traffic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Argomir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Looks like you had a great time.  I'm a bit of a car nut meself.  I have a 92 GTI that is almost ready for the track; my daily driver is an '01 S4. :D <br />
<br />
I'd love to see more pics if you have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok, sorry for the amount of space taking up but here goes some more pics:<br />
<br />
Waiting in the chute for the call to go out on the Track. No one could believe how a 6'4&quot; Yeti such as myself could crawl in and out the window to get in the car.<br />
My reply was &quot; I go through the hole where the back window used to be&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">First off the line; and what steam my little Nissan had I poured into getting the momentum going. Straightaways I was hitting `60+ mph or so. Turning was a bit harder since my rollerskate tires were sliding around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Down the back straightaway; and avoiding all the lost pieces of exhaust pipes; bumpers, chains, and whatever else flies off cars while scooting around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">oh yeah, and this is me at the Funk Master Flex Superseries at Waterford Speedbowl (http://www.speedbowl.com); standing next to my cousin Rob's car..I wonder where the tires went... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Very very cool Shik, sounds like a helluva lot of fun, reminds me of scouting the boonies for old beatup cars littering peoples yards that we could buy for 50 bucks to run in the Demo Derbies lol, glad you had a good time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Grats mate, looks like you had a great time and did well for yourself :) Looking forward to the next installment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">neat<br />
<br />
where's the feckin logo tho =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">soon as i can scan in the rest of the pics bro ( other side of the car ).....unless you want to come over the house and paint the baby's room. :D priorities man, priorities<br />
<br />
time ain't on my side</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">That baby isn't gonna give a crap what color his room is.  Go get those pictures done dammit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">heh it's not the baby i'm worried about; it's the 8+ month pregnant woman i'm scared of.<br />
trust me; unless you've seen it firsthand you'd never believe it. i never believed it until i saw it myself. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Awesome pics man. Very awesome.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Heh :D<br />
<br />
Well, tried it again the other night; only made it 45 laps than got Black Flagged due to 3 flat tires.<br />
<br />
More pics to come; and the rest of the pics on that roll will be back sometime this month ( i hope, life is day to day now and can't make promises :D )</div></div><hr />
