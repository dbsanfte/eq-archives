<br />
I am currently a lvl 56 war and i soon(after I break 60) might be taking over some MT duties for my guild, and i was wondering if any of you other tanks out there could give me any tips on things i should know about high lvl encounters and skills that are really important and such..<br />
<br />
Also, if you know of any page that may serve as a good guide in my search for this information i would appreciate  it greatly.<br />

You must know how to backstep and sidestep (sometimes you'll be snared).  MT leads the mob movement and decides target placing, do it well.   Don't be afraid to be vocal :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Tell your clerics to keep you up, or it will hurt their merit/dkp (just kidding!).  But really, tell them to not skimp on the quick heals the first few times until they get used to your hps and damage absorbtion.<br />
<br />
2.  FIgure out a way for you to call out push.  Nothing I hate more than being a MA/MT on a raid, and calling assist to see the monster I'm supposedly tanking zoom off in another direction.  Its up to you to figure out how you can tell the raid to counter the push to keep the mob where it is, or if you need them to push the mob somewhere.<br />
<br />
3.  Get anger3 procs on both your tanking weapons.<br />
<br />
4.  Work on getting 65 and ND3 as soon as possible.  If you guys are hitting more velious/kunark stuff, then 60 to ND3 would be acceptable, but I loved being 65 and tanking mobs like vindi, aary, Trak, etc with 5 levels extra.<br />
<br />
5.  Always work on upgrading your gear.  Its an endless cycle, but you can't stop! =)<br />
<br />
Good luck, and enjoy tanking!  I know I do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunting right after a debuff lands is excellent aggro, since the debuffer most likely have more aggro than you, that early in a fight.<br />
<br />
The messages for a few of the most common debuffs casted early in a fight :<br />
Shaman Slow ........ (XYZ yawns)<br />
Enchanter slow ..... (XYZ slows down)<br />
Tash ................... (XYZ glances nervously around),<br />
Cripple................. (XYZ has been crippled),<br />
Malo ................... (XYZ looks very uncomfortable),<br />
Mala ................... (XYZ looks very uncomfortable)<br />
Asphyxiate .......... (XYZ begins to choke)<br />
<br />
If you are the one to call out assist and the likes (not all guilds have the tank do that, for whatever reason) make sure your hotkeys are easily seen and to the point !<br />
<br />
Example of a bad hotkey :<br />
/raid verily I say, this %t is bugging me and I ask of you to assist me. <br />
<br />
Example of a good hotkey :<br />
/raid &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ASSIST ME ON : %t &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br />
<br />
The second one is MUCH easier to spot and the message is short.<br />
<br />
If you have read around on other guides, you wil most likely already know the basis of the rest, so I won't repeat stuff like that here.<br />
Besides, there are better people than me to explain the finer points. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Positioning !!<br />
<br />
Are you doing the mobs you plan to MT now? If so learn the terrain. Especially the walls, edges and corners. You want to always be able to present the back of the mob to your melee when ever possible. Have lots of rangers? In this case, you want to try and keep the mobs out of the wall so they can plink away.<br />
<br />
Someone else already mentioned pushing which is a huge factor in positioning. If push is a problem, then you need to help the raid learn how to PIN or SORROUND a mob so that it stays put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tdog</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 62 and just started MTing alot more... I MT all of Hot north and south... I know no big deal but I also MTed one of the Named in AR and that was fun.<br />
<br />
My advice is to really watch the push, you will be the main person to call switch, ect.<br />
<br />
I have ND2 but working hard at getting ND3 then lvling to 65 but I am doing it ass back words.<br />
<br />
Get arggo weapons - We are finally raiding Ssra and are going after hate proc weapons.<br />
<br />
We have two 65 tanks in guild but not always on for raids So I am MT most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nagellom</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm MTing a mob that needs to be cornered and it's being difficult, I generate as much aggro as I can fast then Call the assist followed immediately by Telling the raid to push the mob to me. Then when the pallies and other folks stun/push it where I want it, I holler thanks, thats good and we proceed to disassemble the critter.<br />
Oh yeah, I'm one of the 3 MT's in my guild.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing...if you have to clear any sort of trash mobs or you get a multipull or something (BoT towers are a good example), whatever target you pick, stick with it.  If you accidentally target the mezzed giant instead of the one that's running around, stick with it.  Your enchanters will be able to pick up anything that's awake, and changing targets will only spread out your dps and end up with mezzes being broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All good advice. My biggest pet peve is the push. When I'm MTing, I call all the shots. Be vocal, be aggressive...swear if that's what it takes to get their attention. Learn to use the push to your advantage. It's not easy, every once in a while I find myself with my back to the wall and I'm getting the &quot;you cannot see your target&quot; message. The more experience you have the less often that will happen.<br />
<br />
Hit points aren't as big of an issue as most people think. As long as you have a solid amount, the healers should be able to make some slight adjustments and have no problems after that. 4.6k unbuffed is a good number for a level 60 warrior ( this puts you right at 6k with virtue ). Anything above that would be a bonus. Keep in mind I'm saying you can comfortably tank most mobs with this many hps, however, you can never have too many.<br />
<br />
An above poster mentioned taunting immediately after the debuff. I do that on reflex now...as soon as I see &quot;target yawns&quot; or &quot;target slows down&quot; my taunt finger hits. Regular shaman slow is 3 second cast and chanter slow is 5 second cast. You can even watch when you see &quot;Chanter_01 begins to cast a spell.&quot; and time your taunt off that. It helps to know when to expect the spell to hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes we're getting ready to take on a mob and the tank is like, &quot;Hey Xahulz, try not to let me die.  You'll need to heal&quot; and i'm like HOLY COW THATS RIGHT I HAVE HEALS, I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WITCH BUTTON MAKES EM GO.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just communicate. A lot. Get everyone used to seeing your chat messages so they don't blank them out. Also don't suck, if you screw up, ppl will have less faith in you, kind of like a quarterback that throws too many interceptions. Tell everyone what to do when it comes to mob position, aggro, mob procs, AEs etc. <br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed is that in general raid spam everyone's messages are &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SLOWING %T &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.  I try to keep mine simple. &lt; Kill %T. &gt; personally I think they stick out more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had to laugh about this one...I'm 65 and better equiped than most warriors I meet and I only have a little over 4.4k hp unbuffed :) .  Yes, I'm working to get ornate/ldon/ND3/etc....but it's very slow going and hp is definitely an issue for me (no idea about the original poster though.)<br />
<br />
As to being the main tank (which I love doing :))<br />
<br />
A few pieces of advice:<br />
1.  make sure you have clear, easy to read hot keys for:  (1) what you are targetting, (2) when people should assist, (3) when the mob is being pushed wrong, (4) when you are ready to flip the mob, and (5) when the mob enrages.  Hot keys allow you to communicate quickly and effectively without losing focus on what you are doing.<br />
<br />
2.  before the fight always make sure everyone understands where you will be and where they should be, and if there should be any pushing.  Be especially careful with pet classes.  The pets should stay home until the mob is positioned.  (and I wouldn't allow them in a lot of cases unless the caster has the pet hold AA)<br />
<br />
3.  have everyone practice controlling the push on easy mobs by;  (1) pushing in a specific direction, and (2) fighting at max range to minimize push.  I'd also combine this with controlling a mobs location by: (1) pushing in a circle, (2) pushing laterally and flipping to keep it where you want it, and (3) pushing the mob in a corner (you facing out...everyone else on the mobs back.)<br />
<br />
4.  get people used to always waiting for your assist call by intentionally waiting longer than normal (or calling very quickly) when fighting trash mobs.  <br />
<br />
5.  watch for the enrage call...nothing more embarrassing then killing yourself on the mob when it enrages, then listening to the ensuing wipe...  (been there, done that :p )<br />
<br />
6.  when you pick a boss to target, search on this board, monkly business, allakazam, etc. on the target name and see if there are tactics articles/posts.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarcharius</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">positioning is huge.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of methods, but when you cant corner pin, its your job to keep the mob were rogues can backstab and rangers have LoS.<br />
<br />
My method is to drill it into the head of all melee and pet casters that they need to be push the mob INTO me. directly behind or a ~15 degree either way from the rear. this allows me to simply sidestep to correct rotation, and every once in a while call &quot;SWITCH&quot; and turn the mob 180. in this way i can march the fight back and forth along a line keeping all the arrows, bolt spells, and rogues landing on the target.<br />
<br />
Using the target circle helps too. download or creat one that works for you, but i find this a great help for mobs that leap or fly, cuz i can see where the mob is actually centered on the ground at any given time.<br />
<br />
Also when initially engaging and or jumping in when a tank dies, make sure the rotation is landing on you before you taunt.<br />
watch for debuff messages and as soon as they go , hit taunt (then burn AE when taunt fails).<br />
<br />
always know the encounter, and have defensive or evasive (depending on the mob) ready to go, and engage the disc right before you grab aggro. When a mob can 1-round you and you forget to go defensive before you engage, it can mean the whole fight. <br />
<br />
another great thing for high end tanking is a LDoN spell from guk called Bulwark of Vie. This is a 1600hp max, 10% damage absorb cleric spell. This thing is amazing. make sure you have BoV and DI both on you, and have a cleric refresh them as they drop during the fight. Anyone not using BoV in their raid encounters should go power their clerics thru guk. i believe its like 640 or so points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zarch's comment about line of sight made me remember something...unless there's a compelling reason not to, insist on all of the tanks and pets shrinking to minimum size.  This will make a huge difference in reducing LoS problems for casters and rangers.  I carry a cobalt bracer with me to use if there are no shaman around.</div></div><hr />
