<br />
/ooc Looking for HoV, Brells SS, Fo7, will donate generously.<br />
<br />
Just my luck, all the high-level Paladins, Shaman, and Clerics seemed to be grouped. So, I paid a 52 Cleric and resolved to use Lesser Shielding, Marvelous Visions, and make the best of it. I was just about to click on the Freeport stone when it hit me - Buff Vendors. Buff Vendors!!<br />
<br />
Hey, if they can kill my Druid alt's taxi business then why not Buff Vendors? I'd use em. It would probably pull a lot of PP out of the system too and that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
Please please SoE, Spell Vendors!! Think of it, it would be sooooo sweeeeeet!! Hmm 230p to spend. HoV or Po9 and Symbol. Decisions... decisions.....<br />

Druid &quot;taxis&quot; weren't designed to be a business, nor were these buffs.  KEI whores, virtue bitches, they all piss me off, but that doesn't mean a stupid idea like buff vendors should exist.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with &quot;ruining the KEI market&quot;, because quite frankly I dont' even think KEI should exist in the game.  However your reasoning is flawed, and the concept is stupid.<br />
<br />
You are a prime example of what's wrong with Everquest today...unable to coordinate with your group and so go off to what's convenient and try to weasle out some buffs.<br />
<br />
You aren't obligated to those buffs, you don't deserve those buffs, and those buffs aren't a necessity to doing your job.<br />

Ya know Ezedriel, usually I agree with what you have to say, or at least can see your point.  But on this one, you're a tool.  To say that buffs are not necessary or whatever is true; but fuck it, they're in the game, why not use them, take advantage of them  ?   Your level 65 spells and the armour you use aren't &quot;necessary&quot; to play the game either - they just make it a fuck of a lot easier.  Of course, I'm sure you've never used KEI or VoQ or Fot7 or any non-self buff of your own, being against your noble principles and all...<br />
<br />
Again, fuckin' tool<br />

<br />
I've found that enchanters in LDoN use mez fairly often.  It's quite effective too because my entire group starts laughing too hard to play when the stupid NPC breaks his own mez :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like there's a frog in Gukta that will cast some low-level stuff on you for a bit of coin. If the game designers are willing to pander to newbies, they'll probably cave for the upper level players eventually. Can't have somebody stop paying for their access because the game is too hard...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm honored :)<br />
<br />
Yep, no one is obligated to buff me, groups aren't obligated to wait for me to run from the EC Bazaar Tunnel to Freeport and take the pedistal back to PoK so I can OOC for Cleric buffs because me pickup group wants to do hard without a Cleric or Paladin. <br />
<br />
Did I mention everyone is in a hurry these days? They aren't happy knowing that you are oocing for buffs. Flipper tells you, &quot;Hurry up or we'll have to get someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe they could get one of those melee that comes with Cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
Yes, the Vendor Buffs post was intended to be mildly amusing and sarcastic. You sir, may be sarcastic but you aren't even mildly amusing. Hopefully you'll get a 'lil cyber from an SLR and feel better soon. &lt;- My cat wrote that and ate my backspce key Shikarii - I've already chewed him out.<br />

<br />
A tool?  Because I don't like people not grasping how to play their class?  Yes, I'm a &quot;tool&quot; aren't I Zito?<br />
<br />
To say that buffs are not necessary or whatever is true; but fuck it, they're in the game, why not use them, take advantage of them ?<br />
<br />
I don't mind taking advantage of buffs, if I'm passing by and someone is offering up a KEI or a virtue sure I'll pick them up, but I won't do several things:<br />
<br />
1) I won't leave my group to acquire them.<br />
<br />
2) I won't look for them.<br />
<br />
3) I won't stay longer than needed.  I'll zone in from wherever, make my way to the bank, drop my stuff off, make my way to the other stone and head out.  If they're not auctioning anything oh well, I'll head out, it's not a necessity anyway.<br />
<br />
4) I won't ever, ever make my group wait for me for buffs.  They aren't needed and in the time I could've spent assisting them and learning my class, I spent trying to cheat my way through EQ.<br />
<br />
The buffs are there to assist your group or raid.  I don't mind geting a buff as you're passing through, but I do mind people expensing others so that they can get these buffs.<br />
<br />
Don't take my words to mean something they don't, virtue is a great spell given the context, but I don't feel people need to be detrimenting others so that they can get a few extra HPs.<br />
<br />
 Your level 65 spells and the armour you use aren't &quot;necessary&quot; to play the game either - they just make it a fuck of a lot easier.<br />
<br />
I don't have to detriment my group to get these items do I?<br />
<br />
I don't have to inconvenience anyone.  I get what I earn, and use what I provide myself.  If I get VoQ or whatever along the way great.  But when I get a group I weigh its strengths and weaknesses in accordance with what I can get buff-wise and heal wise.<br />
<br />
I will never tell my group &quot;Hey wait up you guys go ahead in LDoN I'm going to stop by PoK and get Virue and KEI&quot;.  It's wrong, it's stupid, and it's a clear sign that you are unable to handle your class without a crutch.<br />
<br />
If you want virtue, get a cleric.  If you want KEI, get an enchanter.  That's how I weigh my groups.  If somoene leaves one of my groups to go get these buffs they're not coming back.<br />
<br />
 Of course, I'm sure you've never used KEI or VoQ or Fot7 or any non-self buff of your own, being against your noble principles and all...<br />
<br />
So interesting that you come in and presume to know everything about me and my principles because *I* dislike the idea of placing a gimpy, game breaking thing.  You do know that the major reason for stupidity in the high levels this day is the easily attained levels via PC, Dreadlands, temperance and other such buffs?<br />
<br />
I thought Plane of Knowledge was a bad idea, if they put in KEI and Virtue machines then SoE has really lost any aspect of the fantasy game I bought and enjoy, and has lost any credibility it might have had left with me.<br />
<br />
Don't bring it down on me because you find it difficult to play without these handicaps.<br />
<br />
I play my class just fine without things that I can't attain in my exp groups.</div></div><hr />

OK tough guy. You tank LDoN hard assassinate without Cleric/Pally buffs with a Druid healing. Let me know how it went. I died on the Boss with 2 adds and had to try a second time and finally won.

<br />
First:   Hints that I am a paladin<br />
<br />
1. I have said so in no less than 30 posts on this board<br />
<br />
2. I have a soulfire on my signature, and a blurb about Mith Marr <br />
<br />
3. The real warriors on the board, the ones who have said &quot;Ezedirel, finally a paladin who cuts through the crap&quot; are peobably a dead giveaway.<br />
<br />
4. Finally my Magelo Link<br />
<br />
Now to the real issue.<br />
<br />
You are truly a gem... one who, not unlike Trondir doesn't understand a damn thing about what is being asked for.   Although Trondir on the other hand, I can probably understand, he has a wizard, so he kind of gets it.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you how many levels you are wrong on:<br />
<br />
1. The &quot;tank balance&quot; situation:<br />
<br />
What is being asked for will HURT the tank balance situation more than it will help it.    You bitching about my Paladin skills are too retarded to realize that you are ENABLING them even FURTHER with &quot;buff vendors&quot;.  Good show, every knight in EQ will ALWAYS have KEI at ALL times, increasing the aggro gap.<br />
<br />
2. The Psycopath Principle:<br />
<br />
Buffs and class interdependency means people need to be nice and friendly to each other to get what they need in order to be successful in EQ (Except Trondir who is misguided into thinking he's successful on his own).   PoK and buffbots have already gone a long way toward removing the need to act like human beings (Again, see Trondir as a great example) in order to attain what they want, but the recommended &quot;buff vendors&quot; would succeed into making EQ into a single player game EXCEPT FOR MELEES YOU STUPID JACKASS.<br />
<br />
3. The cash for mana principle:<br />
<br />
It is wrong to exchange something completely renweable for something of value.   PC's make that choice, but it's still wrong.   it is FURTHER wrong for Sony to encourage that by participating in it, and for this reason, the stupid idea will never fly.<br />
<br />
4. You are a moron if you think that I'd go buffless when I can buff.   Just like you'd be a moron putting together a group which didn't have buffers.   Are you asking to be a moron?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's always cool when melees comment about KEI when their haste duration tripled over time as well.<br />
<br />
So where IS my 4 hour haste?   Incidentally, you noob, since I have more HP than any two of your toons does that make me more qualified to talk than you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK tough guy.

<br />
If I have a druid healing and substandard buffs, I'm not gonna do a hard mission.   You see, life is full of these little choices.    Oh yeah, by the way, you gonna call ME a &quot;non tank&quot; because I think that choices are good and that making fucking &quot;buff vendors&quot; where the mana addicts can get their refill is a stupid idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 A-fucking-men.<br />

 Cleric too low to cast Virtue? Aego or Temp work just fine. (Hint: That 600 hp difference we yell about between Pallies and Warriors being 'insignifcant'? Same thing with Temp/Virtue)Chanter don't got KEI yet? C2+Brilliance is close enough to do the job.<br />
<br />
 It's really very funny. Some of the people on here bitch about 'functional equivalency', but they never seem to apply the term to ANY part of the buffs they use.</div></div><hr />

I Got EQ when it came as a package with ROK, and when I logged in and did the /who alls , the highest level was a 54 dwarf warrior. I think that qualifies me as not being noob.

<br />
I'm simply not going to argue with someone that never played a class that was limited by their mana regeneration and nothing else about a &quot;Generation KEI&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being a true noob is not defined by the level of play that you do...but it comes from the heart, it takes a real special someone and a degree of talent to a noob of your level.<br />
<br />
 Some level 62 Paladin that hasnt experienced the currently important expansion except for a few zones may not rant about a &quot;Generation KEI&quot; imo. Especially since he is pretty much a part of it.<br />
<br />
Allow me to school you on my &quot;experience&quot; since you are obviously to unfathomeably stupid to grasp that maybe, just maybe, this isn't the only character I've ever played.  Let's begin.<br />
<br />
1) Maladwen Shadowlurker, Wood Elf rogue of Bristlebane on the Brell Serilis server.  Leveled him to lvl 45 before there was a RL issue that caused me to remake him on a new account to which I leveled him to 31 where I had to transfer servers due to another RL complication.<br />
<br />
2) Morthaz Painbearer, Iksar Shadow Knight of Cazic-Thule on the Cazic-Thule server.  Leveled him to 35 before I lost interested in the class and deleted the character.<br />
<br />
Both of these were prior to Velious's release.  I remade MALADWEN about a week after Velious came out.<br />
<br />
3) Xabober, Iksar Monk of Cazic-Thule on the Seventh Hammer server.  Leveled him to 36 before the account was cancelled.<br />
<br />
4) Holliy Ezedriel, Half-Elf Paladin of Erollisi Marr on the Seventh Hammer server.  After real life complications I made him for the use of story writing until I gained full access to a computer and played him more thoroughly leveling him rather quickly.  Upon playing him I began leading several attempts to get the class tuned down, the warrior class turned up, and several other variations.  I have always been opposed to KEI.<br />
<br />
Now this isn't considering the fact that on another character whom shall remain nameless I have raided far more than you try to give me credit for, I assure you.<br />
<br />
I know my class and I know the warrior class very well.  I know the old rogue class. <br />
<br />
I talked Frodlin into buying Ruins of Kunark when it first came out because it was a very interesting, non-too cartoony fantasy game.  I got him to pick it up again after playing a wood elf ranger named Daryen in Kelethin because he thought the world would be too small.  I helped him pick a starting city and deity (I don't take credit for all of this, I am simply stating I was there and partaked in these events).<br />
<br />
I was there when people would still start rumors about Veeshan being in the Plane of Sky, when the name Venril Sathir was one spoken of awe and terror, I was there when this game was still being explored and Dalnir's was kept secret by those who discovered it so they themselves could have a haven of their own.<br />
<br />
I was there when Verant ran this game, and I was there when the character duel policy was changed so you had to be lvl 20+ in order for your name to show up via duel messages after &quot;Negro has defeated Whitey in a duel to the death!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't begin to question my experience in this game Trondir because I assure you, I am not of the KEI generation.<br />
<br />
And even if I was, that does not negate my right to speak about this game and what could make it better.<br />
<br />
Everyone, even idiots like you, have a right to voice their opinions and are right for doing so.<br />
<br />
Don't be so quick to judge who should lose their rights on this board for something Trondir.<br />

Not understanding the laws of exponentiality, that the further out one goes by &quot;tripling, quadrupling, quintupling&quot; durations the further the time difference is is one of the many many many many many stupid things you say in this discussion.<br />
<br />
Point is, buff vendors are a stupid idea, and for that, they'll never be implemented thank god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">now if you could just quote where I said I think buff vendors would be good.<br />
<br />
oh Frodlin, shall I consider myself flamed for language problems now ?<br />
I was somewhat sure it's quadrupling, but not 100% ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont get why so many people have a problem with KEI. it's the same as virtue, all 3 buffs combined in one that lasts longer and is slightly better, thus saving the enchanter alot of time rebuffing. Ever rebuffed C2 and wis/int and GoM on a whole group ?<br />
So it's 14 over 11 mana / tick. so what, mob HPs inflated way more than lower-end highlevel casters mana regeneration rate. If you want to blame something, then blame the TOTAL abuse of Horses. Every  caster gets a horse to have both non sit agro and 100% uptime meditating. Was this intended? Doubtfully<br />
<br />
The only real difference between KEI and Virtue is that casters grab a KEI and go off soloing. They solod before, it just took them longer, but eventually they reached the highlevel, too.<br />
I don't see any rants about Fungi melees that got to 40 basically without ever grouping because mob dmg was totally undone by the regen<br />
<br />
Frodlin I still don'T get tho why you say I say so &quot;many many many many stupid things&quot; and then chose to flame me on my 2nd language. You're such a hater :P´<br />
Being the big fighter for class balance, you think you are pretty cool and can do that, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about regarding a '2nd&quot; language.    Are you saying you're not primarily English speaking?   If so, I had no clue anyhow, so you're wrong again.<br />
<br />
1. Fungi rants have existed as long as the Fungi has.<br />
<br />
2. Your boneheaded statements dont' exist in this thread alone.   As a matter of fact, your wasting of almost 11 pages in a back and forth flame fest on another thread is where the bulk of them lie.<br />
<br />
3. Your disagreeing with someone who thought buff vendors was a bad idea is where I got the idea.   Of course, if you were just giving him crap for no reason other than that you chose to look at his magelo then I suppose in a wierd twisted way, you may have agreed with him but gave him crap for no reason.</div></div><hr />

Well, I kinda agree with Ezedriel, but that approach leaves much to be desired.  The website with the quotes makes me want to vomit in rage, that's how fuckin retarded that is.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, your quote is now going up on my website, feel free to check on it son at: <br />

That just screams 8 year old mentality right there.  So yeah, I don't think it's an issue of giving people crap for no reason, that definitely rubbed me the wrong way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are choices in this game. You can spend another half-hour /lfg or you can go with the group who gave you a /tell and do it on their terms.<br />
<br />
The point, if there was one, to this thread is Paladins ALWAYS have Cleric buffs - Warriors do not and sometimes Warriors have less HP's than an equivilant Paladins. That's less survivabilty, inferior aggro, and no spellbook.<br />
<br />
And yes, Buff Vendors is a bad idea - as bad as a class that has Warrior-like survivability and buffs like a Cleric.<br />

My website is retarded?  Oh well, so are the people on there, I feel it a fitting place to hold such quotes as you see there.<br />

So you choose to insult me because of that?  Battleblade I'm all for warrior fixes, AND paladin nerfs.  However buff vendors don't assist warriors in any way, they assist paladins far more.  And they won't last...if the buff vendor costs X amount of platinum, a player will charge Y, which will be less than X. <br />
<br />
I'm opposed to that and people complaining because buffs aren't regularly on hand.<br />
<br />
About the Gukta one, just because one exists at the low levels doesn't mean I agree on the whole with the idea.  Things like that have been around forever, if you hand in gold to certain NPCs they heal you or cure you.<br />
<br />
It doesn't however mean that KEI (raid level spell) should be handed out like candy from a soulbinder.  It's a ridiculous idea and the reasoning for it is even more so.  &quot;I couldn't weasle out buffs, so I want a buff vendor&quot;.</div></div><hr />

English is not my first language and you flame me on some grammar. That's what I'm saying<br />
<br />
1. of course, but they no longer exist. its the evil KEI now, probably because casters no longer suck totally in endgame?<br />
<br />
2. if you decide not to agree with me and flame me in every thread I posted no matter if you havent posted in it before, just put me on your ignore you hypocritical asshole. I could care less about Mr Class Balance himself not reading my psots anymore<br />
<br />
3. I am disagreeing with someone that said Buff vendors are a bad idea, but NOT about Buff vendors. you didnt even read my posts, you just checked who I disagreed with and proceeded with flaming. I thought this wasnt a flame board? but then, you appear to have a special status here that allows you to do whatever you feel like.. some knight tanked your raid mob tonight or what?<br />
I gave him crap for being fairly new at this game AND ranting on KEI, which benefitted him alot actually.</div></div><hr />

No, I'm flaming you for your math, not your English.   KEI lasting 4 hours vs. Haste lasting 45 mins regardless if haste lasted 10 minutes and is now  4 and a half times longer duration previously is silly.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I was estimating based on experience.... 4 hours is what I see advertised by the bots in PoK, and I dont' care if it's 42 mins or 1 hour and 13 mins maxed, the point is it's still rougly 4 times as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The majority of KEI vendors on The Nameless advertise an extended duration of 3.5 hours. Most of them don't yet have the AA to extend it fully to it's 4 hour maximum.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd throw some more chum in the water. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it does not matter if its 2 3 or 4 hours. It's a combined buff that enchanters used to have to rebuff every 15 minutes averagly per person. Now they can actually buff it and kick it from the memorized set for a while. The fact that people get KEI and go off soloing with it is not a KEI problem, but a gameplay problem, and it is not dumbing down this game either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree. A KEI'ed caster can get pretty twitchy when they have full mana all the time. It makes them think that they can nuke/dot/whatever whenever they feel like it, and that gets people (other than themselves, usually) killed.<br />
<br />
I'm all for getting a KEI and soloing, since I do so damn much of it (Damn my late work hours, can't get a friggin group ever). But I do think that it is a massive contributor to the growing number of clueless players flooding the higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">by the level an overnuker will get someone other than himself killed constantly he 1. Wont have unlimited mana anymore by KEI, 2. has access to C2, which is in terms of mana REGEN close enough to KEI already. You have to learn overnuking sooner or later anyways, and at level 30 overnuking wont get you killed, especially with agro in the lower levels so totally strange that its hardly possible to gain overnuking agro, the mob will drop dead before.</div></div><hr />
