<br />
Ok, to my question.<br />
<br />
I'm a very soon to be level 60 warrior (24pct to go) and my next step is going to be AA, and lots of them. My guild is nowhere near ready to tackle PoP so I have no desire to level higher (and become that paper tank:D)<br />
<br />
I'm sitting at 3200hp 1150ac unbuffed atm, FG/Swiftblade and using SoDB for haste, I would invest in a Kunzar Ku'juch if I was to duo with the shaman.<br />
<br />
I have access to a 51shm or a 55dru. Thoughts on possible AA spots?<br />
<br />
I considered Chardok with the shaman, I could concievably clear and hold the Zone Out but what is exp like for AA?<br />
<br />
Should I just bite the bullet and continue to LFG in Teir 1 and AA that way? SCY really is great exp, but always camped.<br />
<br />
Cheers )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chardok's not bad. You could always *wince* suck it up and get your AA in Velks. Most of the solo 60 monks destroying the spiders have all moved on now and I find it pretty empty every time I take my cleric in there.<br />
<br />
It's not bad AA, I was getting 1% per kill solo. Obviously, that's less two-boxed if you're going to get the shammy some exp, but you can probably chain pull until your mouse breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Velks sounds a good plan, velious gems would always be a bonus too ) Would you recomend the Dru or Shm? Kinda torn, the shm has low healing but haste/slow (spiders are wimps arent they?) cf to the Druids dots/ds/snare (no ICH yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman, every day .. But my feelings on a healing partner are well documented in a different thread *grins* .. <br />
<br />
slow &gt; all, although at 51 you'll be struggling with sheal. (That said, your druid would only have Sheal too, and no slow to compensate. Ya, I'd go with the shaman.<br />
<br />
Spiders don't run and they don't cast, so no need for a snare whip or anything like that. Just tank 'em down.<br />
<br />
edit: If you've never been to velks, look for me in-game, and I'll come show you where to camp and where to pull 'em from.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If grouped, try the PoN Guardians. Awesome AA exp and close if not better exp than a lot of the Tier2 zones. Just a little slow cause you only have 2. For added fun instead of FD pulling to break the spawn, let a Palli run the second around for a few minutes. They need a job...=)  Doh.... /em ducks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could grab either of those toons and head to fungus grove and do fine for AA.  It's about the same as velks, just not as much damage done to you, and DR is more of a concern.  And the best part is that it's empty since PoP came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcwolf</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to duo in the pits in Velks with my 60 warrior and 54 cleric.  Made most of the 200+ AA that I had before PoP came out that way.  Pits are nice because they are out of the way, you don't have to worry about someone stealing your pulls or training you.  They were also rarely ever camped when I used to go there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some things to consider though...<br />
  - You can solo pull around any of the lesser kobolds.  Champions, Prophets, and named, however, will agro.<br />
  - Prophets can complete heal, and gate, kick stun is nice, but not terribly reliable, so the cleric stun was nice.<br />
  - Champions and named can crank out some damage.  I am not sure if your shaman will be able to keep up with the healing, even after they are slowed.<br />
  - There is no legit way to get out of the pits without fighting all the way through them to come out by the castle or use a gate potion.<br />
<br />
You won't be able to clear more than a dozen to fifteen mobs or so before respawn, and once you get it broken up, it is pretty easy.  There are some areas where 3-5 mobs spawn in close proximity, and if you get 3 Prophets in those areas, you need to avoid them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ya could do pon also, but i dont go there, to crowded on me server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I have noticed when Duoing...<br />
<br />
I duo'd with a SK in Hall of Honor...<br />
3% AA per kill.<br />
Which sounds nice in the begining right?<br />
<br />
Here's the problem I have with it though, there is a lot of down time, and the fights are long...<br />
<br />
Full groups in BoT<br />
1-2% AA per kill.<br />
Next to no down time, and if you have a good group, and an even better puller, that just keeps the mobs coming, you can make AA's hand over fist. <br />
<br />
So just stay in full groups, and when you find a good group that can keep things going strong, hold onto it, and stay there as long as you can.<br />
<br />
I don't know about duoing in non-PoP places, as I don't leave PoP much now for AA xp as there is not a lot of good xp places outside of PoP that I am aware of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless the druid is 58+ I think you'll have a hard time duoing with any kind of efficiency as a warrior.  Druids are crappy healers until they get their CH spell, and DS doesn't make up for slow.  I used to bot a 51 druid with my warrior and basically all he was good for was snaring and cutting my downtime a little, but if it was mobs I couldn't kill solo, I couldn't duo them with my druid with any reasonable speed.<br />
<br />
The exception would be if you can find a place to fear kite animals or charm kill as someone else mentioned.  I was level 60 when PoP came out and pretty much jumped right to PoV so I can't say too much about the tier 1 planes, but in my experience anything you can do in PoP is better than anyplace else.  With my current warrior/cleric duo I can go to velks and pull 3 spiders at once pretty much non-stop with DS pots but exp is still better doing one mob at a time in PoJ.  <br />
<br />
Last time I did dogs in Velks was a little before PoP but I thought the exp was horrible compared to CT or soloing in FG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reverse kite with an EQ/AM3 ranger. He can keep agro ALL day long, and there's absolutely NO downtime if he has KEI. Just lose your agro weaps, and AA's will fly. If the duo has a hard time figuring out how this works, then maybe they both should head back to KC :p</div></div><hr />
