I feel bad for the higher end, well developed guilds on my server who wipe on this script, full knowing they can do it, because shit keeps changing on what seems like a daily basis.<br />
<br />
For crying out loud SoE, make up your mind!<br />
<br />
After RZ finished PLing himself all weekend to unsuspecting guilds, my guild finally strapped down and had to see for ourself.  Here's what looks like the latest, albeit probably going to change, changes:<br />
<br />
-TZ seems to still have a lot more hp, although I must admit I think his dps is a lot lower than it used to be.  I also play a cleric and am part of the spamming crew on this script.  Either my clerics are 200% better than they used to be (Hahaha...) or TZ's dps just isn't as high.  I used to regularly see the Paladin's health drop from 100% to 30% regularly, like every round, but the lowest I ever see him go now is 60-70% at the most.  The Paladin's gear has changed, but not *that* drastic.<br />
<br />
-VZ neither auto-agrod (which only happens sometimes) nor came with 'Zhukov's Pesky Zerg Brigade' of 6 decorins.  His dps and splitting remained the same though.<br />
<br />
-Rallos Zek!  Weee.  They must have upped his HP considerably cause it took a good minute longer to get him to despawn into the pit.  This is after my guild has gotten quite a few elemental weapon pieces as well.  On top of that, the adds!  Normally you get a few decorins storming Der Furor's mountain top office.  No biggy, right?   When we got them last night, we had not only the regular set of decorins adding, but about three times as many friends adding as well.  Our cleric crew was thrown across the room from the grav fluxing.  Elites also spawn as well.  It gets freaking MESSY.<br />
<br />
-Rallos Zek the Warlord had no adds from Rallos Zek.  The ones that do come seemed to come at the same time.  The only thing I noticed to be different was RZTW seemed to have a shitload more hp.  We had 7 CoD pets making mince meat of his backside and it was still a good 6 minute fight.  I dunno, I could be wrong, but he seems to have HP out the asshole now.  Our kiters were dead by about 5% and in came the horde of mass destruction.  We barely pulled it off with a win.<br />
<br />
Good show, but damn, it's hard.  =/<br />
<br />
***These are just observations btw.</div></div><hr />

We actually had a real ugly fake rallos fight with lots of people dying to adds but still managed to pull it off.</div></div><hr />
