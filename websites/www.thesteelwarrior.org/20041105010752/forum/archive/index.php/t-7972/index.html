<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hellslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there was a thread in the old forum discussing this but I have searched this new one for quite some time and can't find it.<br />

What I'm looking for is some loot priority since my guild will be entering VT very soon.  What are generally considered the best buys for warriors out of all the VT loot?  Assuming I can only walk out of VT with 2 or 3 pieces of loot, which ones would be ideal? (I'm pretty much straight ornate/Fierce Heraldric atm, with notable exception of AoW helm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best item for a warrior from VT is the gloves off aten ha ra. With the second best item likely being aten ha ra's mask. But since you probably won't get too many items from AHR. Other great items to pick up would be the belt of mastery or cloak of icey shadows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lots of haste items here so if you dont have a good one now is your chance.<br />
AHR loot is the best as always, but whatever or not you'll see any of it depens on your loot rules.<br />
There is a nice BP here - BP of Speed.<br />
Usually best to upgrade non visable slots.</div></div><hr />

If you plan on hitting beyond VT(Ie: EP/GoD) and you do plan on raiding continually, I would personally recommend getting the clickies out of VT.  Such as AHR's Glove, which has a 65DD spell proc, and the human illusion crown, targettable invis mask off Mini AHR. Crown and mask has 125hp so its not shabby, but thats me cuz I prefer to plan ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">best bets out of VT:<br />
<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
Earring of Eradication<br />
Crimson Runed Mask<br />
Pauldrons of Seething Darkness<br />
Belt of Mastery<br />
and, of course, Talisman of Vah Kerrath<br />
<br />
I'm mostly elemental geared now, but I won't replace 90% of those till Time.<br />
<br />
Of those if I had to choose, I'd aboslutely make sure I got<br />
<br />
1: Talisman of Vah Kerrath<br />
2: Crimson Runed Mask<br />
3: tossup between belt of mastery and earring of eradication.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cloak of icy shadows 35ac and 125 hp off a cloak plus a free DS.  one of the best imho simply b/c of the backslot hp + ac + DS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since you're not just going to waltz into VT and get the afforementioned items, about anything here is an excellent upgrade to your equipment.  There is ALOT OF LOOT IN VT.  If you guys use an ELP(DKP) system, I'd wait a raid to two until things settle down and then start going for items.  The first bosses drop a nice cloak and belt, as well as orb of the sky, a money item $$.<br />
<br />
Shoot for items with 80 - 100 hps.  And again, THERE IS PLENTLY OF LOOT FOR ALL IN VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">VT is indeed an excellent place to gear up for a warrior, or anyone for that matter. There is an excellent drop in VT for every equipment slot you have. VT armor has very good AC and on a good number of items the AC is actually better then what you will find on anything up until Time. If your gear were completely filled with VT items you would not be hurting by any stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
Don't overlook the Orb of Satisfaction that drops off  KTXAHR. It's a 35 AC ranged item. It's got crap for stats, but that's a nice AC bump for a ranged item and it has 100HP and 30 poison resist to boot. The clickie on it is just plain fun to have. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">VT haste items have been rotstopping a lot for us.  Tribute and LDON augments really lowered the overall value of haste items.  I'd say to try to improve your AC in your worst AC slots, then resists.  If there are two things that VT gear provides in huge amounts, it is AC and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">13 clears of Vex Thal and worth every penny.<br />
<br />
1)  The best warrior loot drops off Aten Ha Ra.  Pick one item from her melee loot list and stick to it, as you're probably not going to enjoyed 2 of her loots or more unless you either are planning on clearing VT a lot or you are one hell of a valuble, high attendance, solid member.  This includes:<br />
<br />
-Great Shadow Platemail (80ac/125hp)<br />
-Earring of Eradication (25ac/125hp)<br />
-Crimson Runed Mask (50ac/125hp)<br />
-Talisman of Vah Kerrath (35ac/125hp)<br />
-Gloves of the Crimson Sigil (??/??... We never had a single one drop in 13 clears)<br />
<br />
I can tell you now that the Earring of Eradication, Talisman of Vah Kerrath, and Crimson Runed Mask are not challenged in any way, shape or form, in terms of similar quality items out of the elemental planes.  The only one that is, is quested - Signet of Might.<br />
<br />
Now, the Gloves of the Crimson Sigil and Great Shadow Platemail are still both awesome, but they do have some similar counterparts in the elementals if you look at it from a giant perspective.  The BP off Rathe is technically better than the GSP, but I really wouldn't consider it so since Rathe is generally the last mountain before guilds reach Time.  Seru also drops one fucking awesome breastplate as well.  The Raex Gloves have better melee stats than the Gloves of the Crimson Sigil, though the Aten gloves do have better SVS.  Still, you can get an Orb of the Sky from one of the lower level Diabos and still get the same effect, granted the clicky on the Aten gloves lasts a shitload longer.<br />
<br />
2)  As the poster said above, there is a LOT of loot in Vex Thal.  Do NOT limit yourself to the &quot;Only The Best&quot; attitude.  You will be averaging 25-35 pieces of loot per clearing depending on if you hit the TVX's or not.  Other notable, awesome loots:<br />
<br />
-Ring of the Crimson Bull (20ac/100hp)<br />
-Belt of Mastery (35ac/125hp)<br />
-Ring of Resistance (10ac 80hp, but 170 overall SVS)<br />
-Spiked Shoulderpads (30ac 90hp)<br />
-Umbracite Bracer (38ac 75hp)<br />
-Earring of Vigor - 15ac 80hp<br />
-Earring of battle - 15ac 100hp (non lore)<br />
-Umbral Vambraces - 50ac 90hp<br />
-Umbracite Plate Leggings - 55ac 85hp (nice if you're unlucky with Kizrak Greaves)<br />
-Bone Necklace of Battle - 25ac 85hp<br />
-Helmet of Shadow - 50ac 125hp<br />
-Cloudy Steel Mask - 20ac 125hp (clicky invis)<br />
-Breastplate of Speed - 60ac 125hp 40% haste!<br />
<br />
And there are more.  Like I said, do not limit yourself to only Aten loot.  There is so much loot in Vex Thal that you will be doing yourself a disfavor if you &quot;only hold out for the best&quot;.  That's just wrong, not to mention, just selfish.  If your guild has their heads on straight, they will continue to do Vex Thal alongside the Elementals until they feel they have run out of upgrades in VT. <br />
<br />
VT loot + Elemental loot go hand-in-hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just for clarification... Orb of the Sky and Aten Gloves<br />
<br />
Orb of the Sky drops from an easier boss, and you can probably buy it much cheaper than aten gloves.  Its a clicky Call of Sky, a ranger spell that does 35 magic dmg and a 0.0/55 stun... the warriors that I know that have one love it, free agro!<br />
<br />
Aten gloves drop from aten herself :)  I'd expect them to sell for more than orb, if they won't work as an upgrade for you.  Its a clicky Call of Fire, a ranger spell that does 65 fire dmg and a 0.0/55 stun...   I'm not 100% on this but the 30 dd difference won't account for very much extra agro, so unless the gloves are also a solid upgrade then you might want to consider jsut getting the orb.<br />
<br />
Ring of Resistance is the tits... decent stats, comparable to tier 1-2 loot, but phenomenal resists, and to boot you get a Slot 1: Increase all resist by 10 clicky.  Other than aten loot thats the one item that seemed everyone wanted in my old guild.<br />
<br />
Clickies are the bomb diggity from VT, I'd love to go back to VT for a month or two just to stock up on the clickies :)  If you have an Allakhazam's account, I'd reccomend searching for items in each slot, only allowing Luclin and PoP gear to be displayed, then you can get a good comparison of what items you'd be likely to keep for a while, and which you might want to just hold off and save points for.  Jewelry from VT is pretty damn nice, and seemingly more common than those in EPs... Hydrotha's ring is t3h drool, damn pally won it over me... h8 h8 h8</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When my guild first started VT a few months back, I found this site. I found it very useful.  Thanks to the Darkwind guild for hosting it and I hope you don't mine me linking it :)<br />
http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/<br />
<br />
I have a few VT pieces if you want to look them over and see if they are anything you are interested in.  I would defiantely try for the Aten neck.  Some overall very nice pieces in VT and very nice on resists as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">imo, crimson runed mask is the best item no doubt. you simply cant beat 50ac on a mask pre time. the gloves of crimson sigil are nice but raex is better, GSP is nice but its not as big of an upgrade as the mask generally would be. that was the decision i made for if the items dropped for my guild in how i would put in for items. the mask would be a 38ac upgrade over my TZ one whereas the GSP would only be a 17ac upgrade over my ornate.<br />
<br />
belt of mastery off aten blobs has been mentioned and is quite nice<br />
TVXs drop cloak of icy shadows which is quite nice, and two nice haste items and arent farmed much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i cant find the edit button atm but the upgrade from current mask to AHR one is 32ac not 38 like i origionally posted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you plan on going through PoP, my advice in VT is to go for non-visible slots, legs, and BP.  As for AHR specific loot, go with either the neck or the mask.  The earing, BP, and gloves are nice, but can find similar.  BP off of Seru is very comparable, so is Seru earring and tradeskill earring.  The gloves have become less desirable since the WA line of AA has come out.  Here's what I would personally recommend for each slot (my guild has a rule of only one AHR loot per person):<br />
<br />
Ears: tradeskill earing, Seru earing...other nice options are earing of battle from mini aten, crystallized rain from Agnarr, and clawed earthcrafter's hoop in PoEb.<br />
<br />
Neck: Gorget of Superiority (41% haste) or bone necklace of battle, both are from VT<br />
<br />
Head: Raex<br />
<br />
Face: Crimson Runed Mask from AHR.....don't settle for anything worse, the best PoP mask out there i believe is 20ac 140hp off of fennin, where as aten mask is 50ac 125hp<br />
<br />
ring: emperor ring, ring of the crimson bull (VT), moss encrusted band (plane of water), ring of destruction (AoW)<br />
<br />
wrist: raex, earthen bracer of fortitude (41% haste) from PoEa<br />
<br />
arms: raex<br />
<br />
hands: raex<br />
<br />
shoulders: puresteel mantle from plane of air, flowing moss mantle (41% haste) PoEa<br />
<br />
feet: raex<br />
<br />
legs: umbracite plate legs from VT, kizrak's (raex only drops from elemental gods)<br />
<br />
belt: belt of mastery, cord of midnight (41% haste), both from VT<br />
<br />
chest: seru bp, cursed bp, breastplate of speed from VT (41% haste and some ATK), kizraks (raex only drops in time), ldon BP<br />
<br />
back: cloak of icy shadows from VT, cloak of thorns from NToV, quested loyalist shield of honor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">make sure all the ae summon water wands are accounted for &amp; promptly destroyed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if you include ring of crimson bull you should also throw in black basalt band from jiva</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if you include ring of crimson bull you should also throw in black basalt band from jiva<br />
<br />
The Black Basalt Band is only 10ac, very low for a warrior.  I honestly don't think the extra 15hp and 15ATK make up for the 10ac on the crimson bull ring.  Give the Black Basalt Band to the dps classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ring of Crimson Bull also isn't lore :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">make sure all the ae summon water wands are accounted for &amp; promptly destroyed.<br />
<br />
- couldnt agree more. As for priorities, I went for non-visible slots and a BP. All AHR loot is great, though if you use a dkp system, a BP of Speed might be cheaper than Great Shadow Platemail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, my guild pretty much owns VT on FV server atm.  We've killed AHR 9 of last 11 weeks.  We've gotten 6 great shadow platemail, 2 masks, and one earring of eradication.<br />
<br />
It seems that AHR always drops one of these 3 items, with the BP being the common drop.  We haven't gotten gloves of crimson sigil yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My previous guild got 17 bp's out of 24 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">AHR's mask is the only bit of loot I regretted not getting. <br />
<br />
Go for non-visible slots as once you hit the elementals you will want Raex in all visible - nothing really compares from earlier equipment.  Non visible slots from the elementals are pretty shite for AC though (Puresteel mantle aside) so look for non-visible gear that you wont upgrade until PoTime.<br />
<br />
AHR mask or clicky invis mask, either gorget of superiority or belt of mastery for haste, cloak of icy shadows for back.</div></div><hr />
