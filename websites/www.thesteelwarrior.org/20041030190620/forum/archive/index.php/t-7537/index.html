<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kardolimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if a Split Blade of Destruction is worth 80k. They usually go for 80-100 on my server and was wondering if it would be worth it to buy one at that price. I am lvl 62 incase that matters any</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really, imho.  I got mine through a drop, and like it, but most of the other guys on this board will tell you its crap, since its not a aggro weapon.  Depends what you want it for really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not worth it. Get a WBMS or a Windblade for DPS, and droga weapons for aggro. SBoD is poo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only way an SBoD is worth 80-100k is if it's packed in a box with 70-90k worth of packing material.  If you get one as a drop it's not bad for DPS.  Some people anger III aug SBoD's but the general consensus is that doing that is a waste of an aug. If you want an aggro weapon, get something with a proc and anger aug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">depends on how much your will to spend to look good while walking through pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KaunFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a SBoD with a Anger 3 Aug... heh Not worth it.  Waste of an aug in that weapon.  I did a trade to get it, I didn't put it in myself.  Hoping that SOE puts in a way to remove augs without destroying them and then that baby comes out and into something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No.<br />
<br />
It doesn't even look good, IMO.  (Do you really want to look the same as a paladin that just killed Aerin'Dar?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it's ( IMO ) the biggest can opener in EQ.....total piece of overpriced twinkie crapola.<br />
if you got one; make a fortune selling it to some asshat. don't ever buy one.<br />
For what they sell for; you could probabally FILL half your bank slots with superior weaponry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see a lot of warriors with dps weapons and when I replace them in xp groups people say to me &quot;omg you're awesome, we can nuke, slow and snare now /praise&quot; and I'm not kidding at all.<br />
<br />
Everytime a warrior wields a dps weapon while tanking God kills a kitten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SBoD is a PoS. Please destroy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can we get a sticky with the post title being Split Blade of Destruction Dont freeking buy it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sometimes I think people post about the SBoD just to see it get flamed and give us something to laugh at.<br />
<br />
The thing looks like shit, also. (IMO)  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't listen to all these people!!!!!<br />
There's a very good reason to buy this weapon for 80k: you can eventually sell it for 90K to an ebayed toon.<br />
You make 10K and God resurrects the kitten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Haw, Brabble!<br />
<br />
Just what we need -- more kittens.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though -- first time I saw a splitblade I thought it was cool because I'd never seen anything else like it in game. Then I saw the stats. Hmm..<br />
<br />
Good for tanking the PoK only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i think it's leet<br />
<br />
<br />
WTT my BoC for SBoD omg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A fool and his money are soon parted.  <br />
<br />
Don't touch that piece of crap with a 10 foot pole!</div></div><hr />
