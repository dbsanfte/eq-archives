I know Raex BP hasn't dropped anywhere yet, so don't include it!  My guild has the ability to grab any other kind...<br />

Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I really don't think there is much difference but i think my choice if i could pick one would be the heavy yttrium.</div></div><hr />

Of the BP's available either HYBP or GSP.<br />
<br />
I personally took the GSP, but had a HYBP dropped before the GSP I would have asked for it. <br />
<br />
This was before PoP and all the &quot;Aura of _______&quot; effects on Raex.<br />
<br />
IMO, it's a push between them. Maybe a slight edge to HYBP (only due to all the +ATK items that are out now), but not enough to pass on GSP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great Shadow Platemail, Heavy Yttrium Breastplate, and Kizrak's are also nice, basically it comes down to personal preference and which one you want more (and can feasibly loot).</div></div><hr />

Get any of the first 3 and your set for a looooooooong time.<br />
(BP of speed = the best imo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liringlas</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BP of Speed<br />
Yttrium BP<br />
Shadow BP<br />
<br />
in that order in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sound like a broken record but I agree that the top 3 are BP of Speed, Yttrium BP, and Shadow BP.<br />
<br />
With Yttrium at the top ;) but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinadorm</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seru has been rare from what I have seen, Love the saves though.<br />
<br />
GSP again rare, but 50 ATK + 80 is damm tough to beat.<br />
<br />
BP Speed 30 atk, 40% haste, no saves, but IMO when you can kill 2 birds (Haste + a solid BP) thats the way to go, with PoP AA saves are less of a issue. Haste allows you more choices in other slots.<br />
<br />
<br />
BP Speed IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah I wear one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hraldrin</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My top 3 are<br />
<br />
1) Great Shadow Platemail (more AC and nice ATK)<br />
2) Heavy Yttrium (regen + atk and nice AC)<br />
3) BP of Speed (haste and atk)<br />
<br />
I took the Heavy Yttrium cause well my former guild wasnt in VT, but we had 4 or 5 Seru BPs drop before i decided to go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SamirDaStinky</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got an Aten bp and i'm very satisfied with it. I personally wanted it more than those other bp's cuz it has superior atk, ac,  and it raised the 2 resists that I needed more of (fire and cold)<br />
<br />
But it all basically comes down to preference and what stats you want to raise the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'm going for Heavy Yttrium, although I keep eyeing the Breastplates of the Void that seem to be semi common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we are 2 out of 3 on bp of speed. no aten bp. not killing seru. seen 2 void bps in 8 or so kills.<br />
<br />
BP of speed is best and seems most common so far. ive passed on it with 40% haste in another slot though. just a waist imo to take from someone without unless everyone is already got haste.<br />
<br />
otherwise i would take the first one that drops, none of them are that common like vindi bp. aten loot table for instance is huge, just not something you can count on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of about 8 - 10 clearings of VT (i loose count) I've seen 0 BP of speed and 1 GSP<br />
out of about 20-ish Seru kills (i loose count again &gt;&lt;) I've seen about 6 BP's with 2 Double BP drops hehe<br />
<br />
So my best reccommendation is just take what you can get. I personally went with Yttrium because Aten BP never drops and niether did bp of speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious: if you can get the Great shadow BP, or the Seru Bp why is the Raex BP not an option?<br />
Have not got to the tier 4 planes yet?<br />
<br />
If the 3 BP's listed ( Yttrium, BP of the Void or Great Shadow )are the current choice and you can get anyone of them I choose:<br />
<br />
Heavy Yttrium<br />
<br />
More Saves=better resists<br />
most raw HP's <br />
High AC<br />

Plane of Time isnt open to any guild on any server as of yet. But if you were to scan the Magelo Profiles of Warriors belonging to Fires Of Heaven ( as an example ) you will see that almost every one of them has a Raex BP.<br />
BP drop off Tier 4 bosses/named and I have also heard they can randomly drop off any tier 4 mob.<br />

I camped that miniboss in plane of tactics for a week and eventually won the random (single xp group encounter) for my Ornate BP.<br />
<br />
It will fill in the niche until Time I guess. Though I'd kill for a Seru BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about this BP that drops in ST?<br />
<br />
Clawed Coat of Tyro<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: CHEST  <br />
AC: 52<br />
STR: +15  DEX: +15  AGI: +10  HP: +100  <br />
SV FIRE: +12  SV DISEASE: +12  SV COLD: +12  SV MAGIC: +12  <br />
SV POISON: +12<br />
Recommended level of 55.<br />
Effect: Haste (Worn)<br />
<br />
No Sta but most warriors sta is beyond maxed by this time anyway. I have never seen one drop but I think it can drop from one of the ancients. I have seen the Monk / Bst haste 100hp bp drop 2 times though.</div></div><hr />

Look here to see FoH magelos... (http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=counter&amp;class=&amp;server=) <br />
<br />
<br />
Not one war/sk/pal has an elemental breastplate.  That is because Hulanta was correct: the molds don't drop off mobs being killed right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, no. No elemental BP has dropped anywhere on any server. As a matter of fact, the plate god drop BP still has not dropped. Currently Fennin Ro drops a leather BP, Xegony drops silk BP, Coirnav drops chain, and it would stand to reason the Rathe will drop plate.<br />
<br />
At any rate, most of our warriors are wearing Yttrium or GSP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's cut to the chase right now.<br />
yes I was wrong. Scanning magelos is something I do and while I saw plenty of raex pieces in all the other slots I saw none in the chest slot after someone mentioned I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Let me say it again..I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Calling me clueless isnt to nice though. This isnt Flame central.<br />
Mind keeping it civil?<br />
<br />
By the way EmiliaEQ, take the time to answer the original posters question would ya? i would love to hear what you think on the subject since you know it all.<br />

As for the GSP rarity. Seems pretty damn common for my guild =x  We've killed Aten about 10 times now. 5 bp's.  We have the most of any guild on our server (the top guild has none, and another guild has 2)</div></div><hr />
