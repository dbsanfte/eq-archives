<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Interesting, to say the least.Help us Test &quot;The Fallen&quot;<br />
Please help us with testing the new server rule-set for &quot;The Fallen&quot;.  If you would like to help test this exciting new concept, please patch to EverQuest using Testeverquest.exe, which you can find in your Everquest directory.  Once patched, select &quot;The Fallen&quot; from the server directory and you are in.  Here is the proposed rule-set for this server;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-         Any character that is slain for any reason what so ever will be reset and placed back into newbie status.  Characters will not be restored or resurrected for ANY reason what so ever.  Once you're dead, you're dead.<br />
<br />
-         Each account will only be allowed one character on this server.  Any PvP death results in the killing player obtaining a number of points based on the levels of the characters involved.  Players can only gain points from characters that are within 5 levels of them.<br />
<br />
-        You may loot all tradeable items from the corpse of the character you just killed, all other equipment is destroyed with the character.<br />
<br />
-        The server will make use of the Firiona Vie no drop rules (few things will be No-Drop)<br />
<br />
-          The server will have the old world (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus) plus the Legacy of Ykesha expansion ,  and will only allow characters to reach level 50 with no AA.<br />
<br />
-        The server will have a doubled experience modifier to facilitate faster paced gameplay. <br />
<br />
-         Players will not be able to turn on /anonymous or /roleplay to hide their current location.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Help us out and let us know what you think.  You can use the Submit Comment link on the Dev Corner to send us your feedback and ideas.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help and I hope you enjoy &quot;The Fallen&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are double experience rates going to be fast enough when one death means you have to start over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds kinda fun, but it would be pretty lame to lose all of your work because of game errors, such as deaths from random 20k falls through the world, or any other bugs...wonder if theyll do anything about those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm .. very interesting .. no instant POP travel, no Bazaar, no Paludal Caverns, group gankers ...  interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got a Necro up to level 4 then died in the Warrens trying to solo more than I could, got stunned otw to zone line and died. I camped out when I popped back at the newbie area, completely naked with all my spells gone, except for those 2 you start with.<br />
<br />
The experience rates didn't seem any different than they are on live servers. Perhaps a tad faster (I got to level 4 in about an hour) but certainly not doubled.<br />
<br />
All characters start PVP and cannot engage in PVP until level 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jebus. This reminds me of that mode in Diablo - I think it was aptly named &quot;Hardcore.&quot; It sounds intriguing enough to try out, but I think if it catches on there will be a lot more &quot;Teenager Hangs Himself After His EverQuest Character Is Slain&quot; headlines in our newspapers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is like the lamest thing I ever saw in EQ so far.  At least give them 3 lives or something.  If experience was gained at 50 times the rate it is now then perhaps it might be worth it.  Anything less is a sad joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Death is too much of an encounter mechanic in EQ for this to work.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you guys remember deathtouching mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so when you die do you delevel back to 1?<br />
<br />
sounds interesting. wonder if theyll introduce a blue version of this for those who hanker after the good old days of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This could work if the deleveling only happens to deaths caused by other players</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fools_Errend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is an interesting idea...but I wonder...<br />
<br />
If you die, do you have a corpse out there with all the items on it? Is your bank still full? Or is it really you delevel to 1 with NOTHING.<br />
<br />
cuch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is so gonna promote gangs...err I mean guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL who wants to start The Gnomish Priates gang with me <br />
<br />
<br />
HARRRR!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i can guarantee warriors would be extremely rare on that server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">they prob removed the warrior class from that server. tis kinda pointless really.<br />
<br />
but yeah, it's Diablo 2 Hardcore....in Diablo though it was quite fun for some odd reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scruttok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">sounds great, I can't wait :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scruttok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thought I'd better qualify my previous statement a bit.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'd play full time on this server, but every so often, when I feel the need I reckon this could provide a real hardcore roleplaying experience.<br />
<br />
Imagine yourself as your character, with only one life to live.<br />
You'd better be bloody careful what sort of scrapes you get yourself into, who to trust etc.<br />
<br />
Just like real life really. Bravery would become a serious issue, after all in ordinary EQ where is the bravery in standing your ground if you know that all your going to lose is a few hours/days worth of xp. On this server you have everything to lose. <br />
<br />
A balance will need to be struck between risks and benefits in everything you do. Actual, real, tangible fear will become an element of the game, something which (for me at least) has been missing from EQ since shortly after I started playing.<br />
<br />
I remember, maybe twenty odd years ago, the first time I played D&amp;D, absolutely shitting myself while being chased by a fire beetle. That is an experience I would LOVE to have again.<br />
<br />
As I said, maybe not all the time. But I'll DEFINATELY have a char on this server when it goes live.<br />
<br />
I hope the language system from FV is included on this server too. Anything that adds reality to the immersive roleplay experience.<br />
<br />
I can't see many powergamers going for this but for quality enjoyment of low level EQ, for those that like that kind of thing, this will be a nice alternative option to have available whenever I'm in the mood.<br />
<br />
Scruttok<br />
<br />
Edit after trying it for about 4 hours<br />
<br />
It's hard  lol<br />
<br />
made it to lvl 3 once before dying :(<br />
<br />
I still see alot of attraction in this idea....but there has to be a balance point somewhere between the added intensity of real consequences for death and the embarassment of standing screaming obscenities at the monitor, turning round to see your five year old daughter chuckling at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Great idea in theory, about the absolute stupidest thing in practice.  Although, if you play a good soloing class, you'll probably do great since this server will be totally empty.  Imagine the frustration of carefully getting yourself up to level 20 and suddenly you are back to killing rats because of a lag spike or someone jumping you while you are low health or afk.  Imagine this happening again and again and again and again.  Thanks, I like the unreality of bind points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not just warriors, but any class without a mana bar.  This will be a caster/hybrid-only server basically.  And even then, it will be a lonely server.  I like the idea someone mentioned of having only the PvP deaths reset you back to lvl one... and even then, that's still pretty gimp too.  All the Zek ... gamers *for lack of a better word* who don't find the usual PvP servers intense enough, will flock to this server to form the Ub3r_W4nk3rZ_'R_Uz guild, comprised of 3 billion SK's and a few other ppl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Couple things they forgot to mention on the page:<br />
<br />
-The server's only going to be up for roughly a month.<br />
-There's going to be an item named after the winners (up to 6)<br />
-If you win you get to transfer your character to any server you so choose for free.<br />
-After one month the server is being wiped and likely started over again.<br />
<br />
Wish I had time to play on it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hmm lvl with a friend if you are about to die to a mob , your friend stpes in and ganks you and loots your gear - yay no gear loss.. cant save your XP but this is how I used to XP with a friend on TZ so neither of us lost XP there , here its to save gear,, shrug stupid idea for EQ considering the game is designed TO have chars DIE. idgits..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">great idea, but they would have to tip the balance of the entire server and add health potions, like a 1 person to 1 mob ratio, not 6 people to 1 mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Level 1 warriors would be pretty common :p</div></div><hr />

Does this include your points, or do you keep those?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">problem with this is that the game was made with the intent that death would suck, but not be the end all, what i mean is raiding in this game is made with the understanding you will loose people, this will not work on a perma death server, maybe it would work if you could stay at your corpse in spirt and wait for a cleric, meaning res would be useful, or you had to have a magic stone that saved your soul upon death (and they cost mega PP)</div></div><hr />

Reading that thread was about as informative as having the back of my skull cut open, and the few grey bits inside scrubbed with steel wool.  Out of what, 9 pages of drool-dripping spew, there seemed to be about 3 posts that had any rational thought to them.  <br />
<br />
The real &quot;hardcore&quot; players on the new server will be the loathed gamers from the &quot;gay blewbie&quot; servers, who log in to have fun and a change of pace from their regular EQ, and who are just having fun with it.   I don't think the zek regulars will be able to deal with the new server's rules, or lack thereof.  The total mayhem of this server's rule-set will favour the person who does not take PvP seriously, imo.  Only possible exception I can imagine to that is the bunch of zek players banding up to form their own little gang *btw, I don't see many guilds forming on this server, as it's too much of an everyone-for-themselves attitude* and running around ganking low lvls.  However, that will only last until the first one or two times someone in the gang dies, and the rest refuse to PL him up again, and then they all stand around yelling at each other &quot;you ph4g !!&quot;  &quot;yer Ghey !!&quot; &quot;I r0kz d00d !!&quot;<br />
<br />
Course, loot is gonna be another issue all on its own.  OMG a bunch of you finally got high enough to kill something that actually dropped a piece of wearable armour !! OMG !!!! You won the roll !!  Well, now 5 of your ex-closest friends are gonna turn on you like the newest piece of meat thrown into the cage, which you just became.  Conversely, you are now 000000bah-god, and wondering why you're hanging around with the rest of these ghey ph4gz, when you could be ganking them instead and racking up those valuable points.<br />
<br />
Course, I suppose I could be totally wrong on all this ! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You seriously expected anything less from Sam and the SZ cronies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">them SZ people make me laugh :D it must be a trip playing on that server with all them foolish mortals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It was sure a trip for the 3 months I was there.<br />
<br />
Then I ran because it made me sad =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well I thought my erudite elucidations were worth the read. <br />
<br />
Anyway the SZ people that go to Fallen will be training one end of the zone to the other almost non stop... heh.<br />
<br />
Ya I brought up that yur group mates gonna kill you for lootz heh its gonna happen this will be the all time drama server on their board..... &quot;My mates killed me for a cracked staff so I trained the whole zone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Im kinda getting an idea in the back of my head that instead of 1 chanter and 5 necros.... I might go one warrior and 5 clerics on a &quot;light healing cycle&quot; lol.... The problem with 5 necros is that no one of them will always get the kill shot to get the points. With 1 warrior and 5 clerics the warrior will always get the kill shot... Also 5 clerics and 1 warrior will level very fast needing almost no down time ever...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actually Sam, you did bring up good points in your posts, and actually used complete sentences, and sometimes even rational thought processes... scared the hell outta me, seeing that on those boards :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">so far its fun (only deleveled 2) very nerve wracking. first taste of pvp was tonight.. running to turn in some quest stuff and a lvl 6 shammy at ful health tried to gank me (at 60%). <br />
<br />
good thing the guards assist. boy that must have been a hard lesson to learn.  <br />
<br />
just trying to get to lvl 9 for my first pet...<br />
<br />
what you think I would play a warrior on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Izudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">This isnt really a server to &quot;play&quot; on, its for fun. Project &quot;Monster&quot; taken a step further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">so it is a pvp, and the point is to get 50 and kill everyone else above level 6 right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">The object is to gain the most points, which are awarded by killing other players within TWENTY levels of you and &gt; level 6.
