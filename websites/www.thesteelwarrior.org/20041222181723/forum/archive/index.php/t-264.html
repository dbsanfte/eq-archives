<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is enough to kill em easily, and the faction is around Kindly - ally, but you should have decent CoV faction right now, so u should be fine. And after u kill the people you could probly kill the scout for the BoB's yer wantin, i think the spawntime on the scout is ~6hrs. anyone else got a different spawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah dobbo thats more than enough. The 4 mobs are all level 55. <br />
<br />
The 2 by the closest rock are a pally and a cleric.<br />
There are 2 more by the further rock - a sham and a wizard.<br />
<br />
All can be single pulled. Watch the cleric he CHs and likes to nuke. They have a reasonably largish amount of HPs for some reason but as long as slowed and sufficient healing its a straightforward fight.<br />
<br />
I believe you need ally to do the hand in.<br />
<br />
For the BoB quest, hes a bit trickier. FIrst off hes immue so casters dont really factor into the DPS equation. Get a lvl 60 to single pull him and i normally fight ihim inside the WW tunnel. <br />

<br />
Scout seems to be up quite a lot these days on my server, so just leave a alt parked nearby to check if shes not up. The draconic pauldron mobs have always been up whenever ive been there with friends to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newbbarsher</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats definitely overkill Dobbo, I did the quest at 59 with a 59 druid. After we did the pally and cleric, the druid got his 59 mage to come along. We owned mercs with ease, gratz to me on draconic pauldrons.</div></div><hr />
