<br />
I hear this is one of the best AAs for increasing DPS -- anybody know how much?<br />
<br />
Obviously your hit percentage goes up, and how much it goes up would depend on the mob you are fighting, but does anyone have a feel for the numbers that might be behind this AA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this AA got nerfed a bit.  In any case, I would lose agro on a mob before I got this aa and now its much easier than it was.  Agro value for aa spent, I think this is one of the better aa.<br />
<br />
*edit* I don't have any parses but I did have all the offensive aa pre pop before I took this aa.  Also, I would guess 1 in 6 ripotse during enrage actually get through enrage.... Take that how you wish.</div></div><hr />

TM will give you chances to DEAL damage (not have it cancelled)<br />
Thats it. thats all.</div></div><hr />

Best for xp groups, pretty useless in a raid situation. Of course someone who raids 95% of the time will call this aa kinda crappy, someone on the other end of the scale won't.</div></div><hr />

(miss is a miss, its not a special defense)<br />
<br />
Lets be generous and stay TM3 is 30% (10/20/30)<br />
<br />
Thats 0.3x0.15 = 0.045 ... 4.5% increase in DPS ?<br />

I'll take PB &amp; Ferocity before that :)<br />

<br />
tm claims to be a offencive aa, but it realy is a defenceive.<br />
<br />
my mt onec got it in a xp group and i went from 2 ch a fight to 1 ch and a touch up heal. i finaly asked what he was doiing different. and he ohh ding TM. it more or less nocked out 2-3 repost that averaged 1000 dammage less total. dps din't increas much since it was 2-3 hits<br />
<br />
that was just one guy and what i think i saw. could be different for everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Each rank grants an increased chance to avoid an opponents special defenses such as: block, dodge, parry or riposte.<br />
<br />
The way i read it :<br />
-----------------------<br />
TM will help you land a hit if its blocked/dodged/parried<br />
<br />
I really dont think it will &quot;prevent&quot; riposte damage. <br />
You'll just land you hit like if it hadnt been riposted.<br />
And still take the damage from the mobs riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macbrother</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parses have shown that to be true.<br />
<br />
Easy way to test (which has been done by Gnimwit, I believe) is have a PC attack a PC that is not attacking back.  Therefore if you take any damage at all, it will be a riposte.  What happened was the attacker was taking damage without a riposte message, meaning he was hitting through a riposte (didn't get a message) but still took the damage.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I thought this was defensive at first as well, and got it first thing.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery subjugates more than 30% however.  I would say sat least 50% of all parry/riposte/dodges, if not more.  Pretty effective dps aa skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have said this a lot of times but just because it looks like Tactical Mastery almost certainly doesn't work means you can prove it doesn't work.  Not that riposte matters much after the riposte rate nerf a while back.  <br />
<br />
TM3 looks like 50% chance to ignore special defenses to me.  If a mob avoid 10% of the time via special skills, you'll get a 5.5% increase in DPS which is as good as anything else I can think of.  As the enemy uses special skills more often, the relative increase in DPS gets bigger.  During enrage, the increase in DPS is infinity since it used to be 0 pre TM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, just a DPS bonus and a bit of a tanking aggro enhancer.   Doesn't help mitigate any damage at all as people have said.  A bit less useful with the riposte nerf, but I still think it's useful... that is if you've got all of your defensive AAs done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran a bunch of logs before and between each TM rank and I found the results to be fairly consistent.  I'd have to go back and check the numbers for my DPS increase, but I recall the numbers for my attacks that were defended:<br />
<br />
Before any TM:<br />
15% of my attacks were defended (roughly 5% each for dodge, parry and riposte<br />
<br />
After TM1:<br />
12% were defended (roughly 4% each for dodge, parry, and riposte)<br />
<br />
After TM2:<br />
9-9.5% defended (3% each)<br />
<br />
After TM3:<br />
7-7.5% defended (about 2-2.5% each for dodge, parry and riposte) -- that amounts to roughly 50% less riposte dmg than before.<br />
<br />
Of the additional attacks that now get through a bunch become misses and the rest are hits for dmg.  The cleric I group with regularly told me that he noticed the difference in healing me with each rank I got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  You win!  You answered my question!<br />
<br />
I like the sound of it... going to have to get it in the next 30 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, np, TM3 is one of my personal favorites among all the warrior AA I have so far.  As one of the main tanks in my guild I feel the heavy burden of needing to get all those damned defensive AA skills first (about 100 AA points worth) before I do any of my offensive skills.  <br />
<br />
Talk about BORING!  <br />
<br />
I wanna dish out some serious damage if I'm gonna stand there and take a beating so I want to get all the fun AA.  <br />
<br />
TM3 is an AA skill that is both offensive and defensive so it partially satisfies my urge to get offensive skills and yet doesn't make me feel guilty that I might be straying from the &quot;Standard Warrior Defensive AA Path&quot;(TM).  You take less damage from ripostes and increase your DPS -- exactly what a tank needs.<br />
<br />
Another positive result of TM3 is I feel much more comfortable dual wielding in PoP.  My best 2hs weapon is 45dmg 44dly with no proc and holding agro with it is iffy at best.  I always dual wield when I tank and I have been fine doing that in PoP so far (Tier1 + PoS, PoV, and BoT).  If the higher tiers get any worse for riposte dmg and force me to use 2hs even with my TM3, I expect by the time I get there I will have a better 2hs to use for tanking anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TM3 wont lower the dmg you take :)<br />
<br />
It will just raise your DPS from 3-7%, depending if you tank or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Those tests aren't valid and don't show what you claim.  The reason that the % of defended attacks goes down is because you land more hits (they are both riposted and land).  Thus the % of blocks to hits will obviously go down.<br />
<br />
You still got the same # of blocks, you just got more hits.  Also the same # of ripostes, from which you took damge.<br />
<br />
The cleric will need to heal less because the mob dies faster due to your increased DPS.  Not your increased damage avoidance, which doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because surely you know exactly % of those hits from the mobs are actually pierced riposte but not negated swingback...<br />
<br />
Your assumption is equally as invalid as eyeballing 'I think the damage I took went down after TM' because there is no way you can eyeball how much damage came from pierced riposte but successful swingback beyond a very small set of controlled example (enrage).<br />
<br />
It's okay if you don't want to believe TM works.  It probably doesn't anyway and it no longer matters after riposte nerf.  But don't pretend for a moment that eyeballing 'I think the damage I'm taking went down (or not)' is a good measure of the ability's usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The percentages I gave before are not of blocks to hits but rather blocks to attacks.  The number of attacks in these logs is relatively constant (I was using the same weapons and had the same haste for all these logs) -- i.e. getting TM has nothing to do with the number of attacks I get in a certain amount of time.<br />
<br />
The trend I saw was that my % of attacks that are blocked decreases with ranks of TM, and my % of hits and % of misses both increase (again relative to the # of attacks).  And this is all based of course on seeing a message in my log that says something like &quot;you try to hit soandso but soandso Ripostes!&quot;.  If they are riposting me and it looks like any other hit then there is no way to discern whether or not it was a riposte.  But with ranks of TM the number of times I DO see the riposte msgs does decrease (parry and dodge too), as shown by these logs:<br />
<br />
Before any TM ranks:<br />
9920 hits (50.9%)<br />
6507 miss (33.4%)<br />
<br />
1065 riposte (5.4%)<br />
1061 parry (5.4%)<br />
914  dodge (4.7%)<br />
-----<br />
19467 total attacks<br />
<br />
<br />
after TM1:<br />
2884 hits (52.7%)<br />
1856 miss (33.9%)<br />
<br />
236 riposte (4.3%)<br />
276 parry (5.0%)<br />
217 dodge (3.9%)<br />
------<br />
5469 total attacks<br />
<br />
<br />
after TM2 (small log unfortunately)<br />
1228 hits (56.6%)<br />
753  miss (34.7%)<br />
<br />
66   riposte (3.0%)<br />
71   parry (3.3%)<br />
52   dodge (2.4%)<br />
------<br />
2170 total attacks<br />
<br />
<br />
after TM3:<br />
5170 hits (57.7%)<br />
3064 miss (34.2%)<br />
<br />
263 riposte (2.9%)<br />
244 parry (2.7%)<br />
215 dodge (2.4%<br />
------<br />
8956 total attacks<br />
<br />
<br />
The numbers I gave in my original post were slightly off since I pulled them from memory, but you can see from these numbers I got straight from my logs the general trend.  What my cleric friend specifically told me was that he noticed the burst dmg I take was less than it had been.  I.e. those moments when the mob lands a quad for max dmg per hit + a couple ripostes all in a short time.  The cleric still noticed these bursts but said they were easier to handle.<br />
<br />
At any rate, despite the hidden mysteries of what TM actually does behind the scenes, this will boost your DPS quite noticeably and that makes it well worth getting IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm those logs show a 13% increase in DPS (from hitting around 50% to 57%).  These logs seem to skew on the good side a bit but it's still impressive.<br />
<br />
I never knew mobs used their special defenses over 15% of the time.  Was these mobs blue or higher con?  At 15% special skills and 50% chance to ignore, you're looking at a 8.8% DPS.  12 AAs for 8.8% DPS is pretty hard to beat, even if it only works from the front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think were argueing semanics.<br />
basicly you swing at a mob it makes i prd(parry repost dodge) check if it succeds you get prd'd. with tm if the mob makes a prd check you get a tm check. if you succed you still hit the mob negating its prd. this will rais your dps. the seconday effec is if the mobs prd check is a repost your tm can turn this repost into a hit for you. the mob would still have to land the repost for it to mean  anything. without tm you would be prd'd and the repost could do dammage if it landed. i don't se any wrong post just to sides of the same coin. <br />
<br />
you can look at tm as increasing dps or as negating possible reposts. both are correct, but we do know that by its description tm can negate special defences and cutting through a prd check of repost is one, and by cutting through the prd checks you increase your dps.</div></div><hr />

I believe the giants were all high blue cons but I don't remember exactly, I've been 65 for a while now and those mobs are all blue now.  That camp was my bread and butter for many AA points before I got BoT flagged and all the casters dragged my ass over to BoT for exp.<br />
<br />
As for DPS I was at about 65 DPS before I got any TM ranks and was easily between 70-75 DPS after (I recall lots of logs with 72ish DPS).  I picked up an avatar proc weapon and now I'm averaging about 88-92 DPS.  I'm getting close to the magical milestone of 100 DPS -- I can't wait -- I just ned to pile on some offensive AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm wondering, if you hit Furious disc(auto-riposte) on enrage...how often would Tactical Mastery happen, and would you still be able to do a decent amount of dmg with the TM checks (remember it'll probably be checked a lot in that time)<br />
<br />
This is just a theory question...I doubt many warriors would regularly blow a 56 minute-reuse disc on enrage even if TM gave them a nice dmg boost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much to my dismay I discovered for myself the truth of how TM really works with respect to ripostes.  There are two parts to a normal riposte: You miss the mob, and then the mob gets a free return attack on you.   For example:<br />
<br />
you try to crush soandso but soandso Ripostes!<br />
soandso hits YOU for 500 points of damage!<br />
--or--<br />
you try to crush soandso but soandso Ripostes!<br />
soandso tries to hit YOU but MISSES!<br />
<br />
With TM here's what you start to see:<br />
you crush soandso for 80 points of damage!<br />
soandso hits YOU for 500 points of damage!<br />
--or--<br />
you crush soandso for 80 points of damage!<br />
soandso tries to hit YOU but MISSES!<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is difficult to tell if this is really a riposte because it looks like a normal hit/miss -- there is no riposte message.  I verified this by standing in front of a fleeing mob that was snared and just standing there, I beat on it and took a few hits in return, clearly ripostes because fleeing mobs do not attack, but I saw no riposte messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But if Tactical Mastery actually works, you would still never be able to tell it actually does on the fleeing &amp; snared mob example because there is no such message like:<br />
<br />
X would have riposted you but you were successful to evading its attack!<br />
You slash X for Y (or maybe miss)<br />
<br />
Instead you would just see:<br />
<br />
You slash X for Y (or maybe miss)<br />
<br />
A successful Tactical Mastery, by its very definition, is completely invisible to the user because the riposte would have never happened.  Whether it works or not, you would never be able to see ANY evidence of it working except on enrage, which is different enough from just 100% riposte (since things that normally are immune to riposte attacks get hit by enrage) that I do not feel it's safe to extrapolate enrage results to normal ripostes.<br />
<br />
Is there any mob left that would not fight back, is attackable, and ripostes?  I don't know of such mobs but one way to verify the whole debate at all would be take two warriors with same weapons (one with TM one without), beat on that mob for say 5 minutes, and count the number of times the mob swing at you, and see if there is any difference.  I suppose this can be done with players too.<br />
<br />
If the next patch SoE put in a message that randomly says 'You were successful at evading the enemy's riposte attack&quot; whenever the enemy simply did not use his special defenses at all, I bet most of the naysayers will now claim TM is great and evades enemy riposte because clearly there is this message that tells you that you have evaded a riposte attack and sure enough, if you look at the logs, the enemy will never swing at you when this message pops up.  And SoE would've suddenly fixed the complaint people have about the inadequcies of Tactical Mastery without having to actually change anything.  The whole notion that you can prove Tactical Mastery doesn't work is just plain silly.  It may very well not work, I don't dispute that, but you don't have proof.  SoE can make it *work* by just putting in a random message and none of you would be able to show it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
To illustrate take any random log:<br />
<br />
You slash X for Y<br />
You slash X for Y<br />
Y hits you for X<br />
You slash X but miss!<br />
<br />
Now I will append a &quot;You evaded the counterattack!&quot; message to any hit where the enemy did not use special skills:<br />
<br />
You slash X for Y<br />
'You evaded the counterattack!&quot; <br />
You slash X for Y<br />
'You evaded the counterattack!&quot; <br />
Y hits you for X<br />
You slash X but miss!<br />
'You evaded the counterattack!&quot; <br />
<br />
We know already that a successful TM does not show the special defense message at all.  I claim that the mob was supposed to riposte you three times, but TM negated the special defense 3 times and also negated the counterattack as well.  And you can't prove me wrong because there is no way for you to show that I'm just making these messages up or if Tactical Mastery is really doing its thing and negating a special defense (or riposte in particular) completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron, man you get ahold of an idea and you keep it no matter what is shown to you, you got spunk I will give you that.<br />
<br />
If the mob is in flee mode, and snared and not attacking, and you run around to its front and attack it, and you see the following<br />
<br />
<br />
A_snared_fleeing_mob_01 hits you for 100<br />
You slash A_snared_fleeing_mob_01 for 67<br />
<br />
There is no riposte message.  The mob is not attacking.  How can this possibly be anything other than Tactical mastery firing but not stopping the return blow.  Do mobs get a super sekret special power move when snared and in flee mode that gives them the special ability to hit you without attacking?<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is difficult to tell if this is really a riposte because it looks like a normal hit/miss -- there is no riposte message. I verified this by standing in front of a fleeing mob that was snared and just standing there, I beat on it and took a few hits in return, clearly ripostes because fleeing mobs do not attack, but I saw no riposte messages.<br />
<br />
Did you actually read this?  Do you think this person is lieing or part of some conspiracy?  I dont see how this point which undeniably proves that TM does not spot the return portion of the riposte is completely lost upon you in every post I have read about TM that you have responded to, dating all the way back to when Gnimwit posted his logs of the exact same thing vs a PC which had attack off.<br />
<br />
I just dont get it, but to each their own, you certainly have a right to believe what you want to believe.</div></div><hr />

Oh wait, you don't know that, you just think it should, despite the game has turned out to be very different than what players normally believed many times.  You just think if anything happened to hit you back even once when you didn't get a 'XXX ripostes' message that's instant proof that it doesn't work.  I've somewhere a log where the mob actually didn't hit back during enrage so that must prove TM always works, even though I'm pretty sure in reality the mob just turned around too fast for me to notice.  One example does not prove anything at all.  What you believe may be right but you believe it for the wrong cause.  It's no different back when people believed stats actually matter significantly, and as long as no one actually parsed, that's what people believed because it looked like it matters.<br />
<br />
If next patch SoE simply inserts a message that appears (50% X % of riposte) when a mob doesn't use its special defenses at all and everyone will come back here saying 'Wow it really works after all' even though nothing has changed.  Actually if Tactical Mastery started out with this placebo message all of you would believe it works and none of you would ever doubt it.  I mean it says you avoid the special attack and a message constructed that way certainly has no possibility of seeing an enemy swing in that instance.  Yes this message would never show up during enrage, but you'd probaly just convince yourself that it just doesn't work in enrage, since there's plenty of proof of you not getting hit back in normal attacks.</div></div><hr />

I.e. you get to hit through a riposte... doen't stop riposte, but removes some of the avoidance component of it.<br />

I haven't seen a shred of proof from you that your statement is remotely correct, only theories of what could happen if you were.<br />
<br />
Where do you even get the idea it negates the counterattack in the first place?  No where does it even say that.  All it says is that Tactical Mastery gives you the chance to evade the enemies special defenses.  Last I checked, a counterattack is OFFENSIVE, not DEFENSIVE.<br />
<br />
You've backed yourself into the corner of &quot;Until someone proves me 100% wrong, I'm right in every way&quot;.  Where are all these naysayers that say TM doesn't go through special defenses?  Everyone here agrees that TM allows warriors a chance to hit through the defenses (meaning, it lets the dodge/parry/riposte not stop the attack).  Only person who said anything negative about TM, and that was EmiliaEQ who won't get it until after getting a few other AAs.  The others simply doubt it negates the counterattack on riposte, and I've heard NOTHING from anyone to even give me the slight idea that it does negate it other than &quot;he said/I think it might, you never know/I swear/etc.&quot;, which has as much ground as a random guy shouting that the world is gonna end.<br />
<br />
Lose the &quot;special defenses&quot; term.  Special defenses mean Parry and Dodge as well as Riposte (do mobs Block?).  Only one of these have a counterattack.  Say riposte when you mean riposte, otherwise your statement is wrong everytime you say &quot;special defenses&quot; but mean Riposte.  What you mean does not carry through text, I had to reread the entire thread, as well as reread almost all of your posts 2-3 times just to understand what you were talking about.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see you prove that Tactical Mastery negates the counterattack on riposte.  You can't use enrage, because you already said that it's different enough from ripostes.Whether it works or not, you would never be able to see ANY evidence of it working except on enrage, which is different enough from just 100% riposte (since things that normally are immune to riposte attacks get hit by enrage) that I do not feel it's safe to extrapolate enrage results to normal ripostes  Except in the case if you took the time to parse against a player with attack off or a snared fleeing mob, you can't prove it, by the very same logic that you say we can't prove TM doesn't negate the counterattack.  Like I said earlier, those claims have as much ground as some guy shouting the world is ending.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery gives warriors a chance to evade the special defenses of an enemy.  This means, as we have seen, that we can &quot;hit through&quot; a defense that would normally stop the attack.  Riposte has an extra OFFENSIVE component in that when it goes off, the enemy attacks back, in addition to the DEFENSIVE component.  I see nothing in the description of Tactical Mastery that would lead anyone to believe it allows you to evade an OFFENSIVE ability (the counterattack of riposte).<br />

One example does not prove anything at all.One example proves a lot.  The example given by those who believe it doesn't negate the counterattack proves that the counter can still goes through, if TM even has the ability to negate the riposte counterattack.  <br />
The very fact that there are times when the counter can still go through a successful tactical mastery check proves that the counter attack is NOT connected to the defensive part of the Riposte other than both going off when a riposte check succeeds.  What does this mean?  It means Tactical Mastery is doing EXACTLY what it is designed to do...which is allow you to evade the DEFENSES.  Again, I see nothing in there about TM allowing you to evade OFFENSES, Warriors have other AAs for that like Lightning Reflexes and Combat Agility.<br />

I mean it says you avoid the special attack... Where does it say that?  I see special defenses, not special attack, so does almost everyone here.  There is nothing to prove you avoid the special attack (the counterattack on riposte), only that you don't get stopped by the defense.<br />

Hmmm those logs show a 13% increase in DPS (from hitting around 50% to 57%).  These logs seem to skew on the good side a bit but it's still impressive.<br />
<br />
I never knew mobs used their special defenses over 15% of the time.  Was these mobs blue or higher con?  At 15% special skills and 50% chance to ignore, you're looking at a 8.8% DPS.  12 AAs for 8.8% DPS is pretty hard to beat, even if it only works from the front.  <br />
<br />
Just a note (and I didn't see anyone else write this), I'm almost positive that Tactical Mastery is 2/3/4 AAs (I got it awhile ago, so I might have forgotten, but I'm pretty sure) for a total of 9 AAs. Even more reason to get TM if those log results are accurate.</div></div><hr />

You will get single attacks on you in between the attack rounds of the mob, but no riposte message.<br />

Sort of obvious when its a semi slow mob anyhow, but normally triple+ hits.<br />

<br />
Mobs generally defend closer to 15% of blows.<br />
<br />
Warriors generally, before TM, hit about 55%, miss about 30% and 15% defended as above.<br />
<br />
So post TM that changes to: <br />
<br />
Defended=7.5%<br />
Hit = 55% + (7.5*55/85)% = ~60%<br />
Miss = 30% + (7.5*30/85)% = ~32.5%<br />
<br />
DPS increase then is 100- (60/55*100) = 9%</div></div><hr />
