<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szlia</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this in my mind for a little while so I don't remember if it's actually my idea or if it has been brought up allready but anyway:<br />
<br />
Why not give warriors a skill that makes their weapon proc? You click the hotkey -&gt; the weapon procs.<br />
<br />
Of course there should be a reuse timer, it should be decided if it makes both weapons proc if DW'ing, etc. But before fine tuning, let's just take a step back and look at the possibilities:<br />
<br />
- A better control of agro (not dependent of the randomness of procs or an unreliable taunt skill)<br />
<br />
- Utility (there are many procs with debuffs)<br />
<br />
- DPS (there is a numbrer of good damaging procs so depending on the reuse that could be substancial dps)<br />
<br />
- Tactic (with the number of odd procs around, it gives a little more room for creativity when it comes to fighting tactics)<br />
<br />
I like the versatility and the simplicity of this solution and I guess it is pretty easy to implement in the game. Obviously, though, it is very equipement dependent but warriors have, after all, been equipement dependent since day one.<br />
<br />
I would even find it appropriate to give a similar skill to all PURE melee, the ones suposed to be the weapon experts you know. Make the reuse for warrior significantly lower maybe...<br />
<br />
Certainly not the end-all do-all of the agro and melee problems, but a step in the right direction I guess.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
PS: I am not familiar with the board and have been oriented here so I am not familar with the many ideas that have been tossed around on these very board. My appologies if that idea allready got debated and burried for some reason :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno how hard it'd be to implement with all the augmented additional procs on weapons but Im sure there'd be a way around it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been suggested before.  Again, raising our snap aggro capabilities anymore ruins the game.  Knight aggro must be nerfed, it breaks the game.  They've had upgrade after upgrade to increase their ability to tank, but their supreme aggro has remained.  It isn't right, and Sony needs to wake the hell up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree with you Darkoan. Knight aggro does break the game, BUT it's been broken so long that all the casters (not to mention all the knights) have come to accept it as the way things should be.  Nerfing knights would cause too much of an outcry from too many people(whether it's the right thing to do or not).  Given that, warriors do need to be brought up very close to knight aggro abilities, that way at least all of the plate tanks will be on even footing with eachother and we can all break the game equally.  Honestly I think nerfing knight aggro a little and increasing warrior aggro a little is the way to go.  Then if they give us some utility outside of tanking that would just be icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />
