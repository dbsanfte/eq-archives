<br />
3 Gnome Warriors throwing down.<br />
<br />
Diggitybop Bangpow, armed with Wavecrasher and Shaded Blade<br />
<br />
Foshiz Mynizz, armed with Wavecrasher and Wrapped Entropy Serpent Spine.<br />
<br />
Ricc Nunez, armed with Centi SS and Velium Battle Axe (k will still have a way to go). <br />
<br />
May we never fall against these lesser classes. GOGO WARRIORS.<br />
<br />
BTW, if anyone else wants to join us, we're currently rampaging about Paladual. Toss me (Diggitybop) a tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the plan as it stands so far:<br />
<br />
No drop.  We're mixing the gay with the gayer here: not only are we playing Gnome Warriors, of all things, and rampaging around with terrible names, we're going to have absolutely NOTHING to lose.  We've had enough of these lame-ass, completely skill-less SKs in No Drop on running from zone to zone throwing their ridiculous DD, shadowstepping around and whacking us with their 200+ str and tantor's tusks in PvP on Rallos.  It's time to do something even stupider, and if it's no-drop with Dex, Wavecrashers and WESSes, then by god, I don't want to know what it is.<br />
<br />
Of course, unless we get a solid proc, it's not like we're going to be landing a whole lot of kills.  I mean, in a way, that's kind of the point, we're not doing this for the roots or the snares, we're doing it to swarm people with Gnome Warriors.  What could be better?<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, we're gonna be hunting for some no-drop.  Gonna do Qeynos badges for see invis and see what dex gear we can get.  Going Rallos Zek makes us indifferent to pretty much everything in the game, and non-KOS to Giants, so we'll be doing Kael Drakkel when we get the chance.   Anyone planning to join the project let us know!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah, I think we could use a guild to let everyone know the project has showed up...<br />
<br />
Maybe something like &quot;The Gnomish Alliance of Gnomely Gnomes&quot; (GAGG)<br />
<br />
Though, Ak'Anon's Secret Service is already taken I think... great acronym on that one...<br />
<br />
Also, any other benefactors of the cause, we could use your help ;)<br />

<br />
You're so hard to hit! <br />
<br />
Plus it's a lot easier to hide behind things so casters can't start casting spells...<br />
<br />
Right now our main goal is to punish Shadowknights and Paladins. Shadowknights because it's a noble goal... Paladins cuz they need a whoopin once in a while to remember who tanks in this business *wink* :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahhj</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomers my friend, have we got the game for you. Let me let you in on a little practice I call the &quot;Nature's Law of the Wild As Applied to Messy Druids&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's quite simple.<br />
<br />
Everytime you find a fishing grub on the ground in a little sack... you put it in your ammo slot.<br />
<br />
When the grubs in your ammo slot amount to 20 grubs, a druid dies.<br />
<br />
It's a steep price to pay for littering, but darnit, they just don't listen. You'd be surprised how fast you can get to 20 in a casual afternoon of chatter in the Plane of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Particularly vicious players can change it to druid hunts at every 5 grubs... with power rounds being had when something like a Bookworm is found... quick.. for the next 30 minutes.. kill as many of the druids as you can for extra points!<br />
<br />
Now I realize innocent rangers/iksar may be caught in the crossfire, but really no one likes rangers anyway and the lizards can handle themselves just fine. <br />
<br />
We gnomes... allllllways thinkin.<br />

<br />
Tell ya what, I'll log on tonight, and I'll start me a Gnome Warrior.  I'll try to name him Wirmy, just to make it easy for me (i'm stoopid).<br />
<br />
I'll be on about 10pm PT, a newbie Gnome Warrior.  Who's gonna PL me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was playing, I was a 43 Ranger, Traknya Down.  Played with friends then, Boaz, Kyrro, etc.....<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll get lucky and see them on.<br />
<br />
So, you kids gonna give me a hand at getting my Newb Warrior out of the low levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Descarttes</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah crap, I didnt see this before...<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah, I'll pull out my 43 ranger and 46 chanter to track/PL you up to where we are, and anyone else that needs it... shouldnt take more than an hour or two. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't get the message last night, if you wanna contact me message either Gabejenkins, Spaztacular or Foshiz and I'll get right on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Descarttes</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just so you guys know, anyone who wants to join the project only has to let us know and we'll get you set up with a weapon and some basic no drop in no time, and we can PL anyone who's serious about hanging around.  It's really not much of a hassle if you are planning to stick around and hang with us, as long as we know you're coming we can help out however you need us to!<br />
<br />
Just message any of the characters pointed out above for me, or any of Mahhj's characters, and we'll get things going.... or leave a post here to set things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Descarttes</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen any of those guys around, Wirmy... sorry to say, a lot of the old blood has up and gone, either for good or to Shadowbane (poor bastards).<br />
<br />
Anyway, revamps in mechanics....  Number 1, spells cant kill you in a single shot.  No spell is allowed to do more than 75 percent of your max HP, so mana burn cant insta gib from full any more.  <br />
<br />
Second, bows do 66 percent to players, which sucks for rangers at lower levels, but at higher lvls they can still kick a whole lot of ass.  <br />
<br />
MOST IMPORTANTLY, MR has been nerfed A LOT, so while 120 mr might have made you invincible before now it's gonna take about double that.<br />
<br />
A lot of other things have changed in mechanics, but off the top of my head those are what come to mind....<br />
<br />
<br />
In terms of the community, a LOT has changed.  The server is no longer PK, it's primarily an anti server, as all the major power has solidified in top-end anti guilds which have sort of set the precedent.  The higher lvl you go the more anti the server gets, as most PKs are unguilded and from lvl 14-30ish.  What you end up seeing is isolated areas of PvP and then overall blue-server type existance, since there really aren't even guildwars between the anti guilds because they are too &quot;anti&quot; to fight each other.  <br />
<br />
Which, of course, makes the PKs and PK guilds even more important these days.  It's still dangerous as hell to go anywhere, but there's very little power to do anything to the top guilds at all... which is pretty damn lame, when you think about it.   Every once in a while the Curse or someone shows up and causes some problems during a Ringwar or whatnot, but there just aren't enough GROUPS of PK faction to really do much to shake the server up.  It's kinda sad, really, and we're working to change things a bit, because that's really something the server lacks right now (a difinitive evil faction).<br />
<br />
Anyway, GNOMES WILL RISE ABOVE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I logged on last night, started up my gnome warrior, he hasn't even killed anyone.  Couldn't locate anyone on last night..  <br />
<br />
Anyways, gonna log on now and see if I can't find any of you guys.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info, RZ really has changed.  It seems mostly for the better, but still a lot for worse.  Bah, we'll start a gnome only clan and start eating non-gnomes up, just like in the old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn i like the idea of 'wolf packing' all those other classes, make 'em pay for their utility! :p Unfortunately I'd probably log on on GMT hours and be 'one Gnome alone' so to speak :)<br />
<br />
plus the small issue that I'd probably suck at PVP :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got my newbie helm last night...  Still working on the rest of the newbie quest items.  Hit level 6, hehe.<br />
<br />
I think I'll work on the newbie quests, then I'll level up, gank some gimps for some money or equipment - hehehe.  Nah, I aint a solid PK.  But if there's someone in the zone, who ain't quite right (non-gnome), I reckon I might have to hurt him.</div></div><hr />

It's not that we're malicious, it's that they're altogether too tall, and loud, and... well, not Gnome.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't find half the stuff they wanted.  :)<br />

Maybe, if I were to come on over, y'all could help me with the newb quest so that I could get set up quicker? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahhj</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure thing. If you're going for the gnome newbie no drop, here are some suggestions!<br />
<br />
Check Rivervale/Greater Faydark for Brownie Parts. People sell em to vendors all the time and they are a big bottleneck in the newbie no drop.<br />
<br />
Coyote pelts are also far more common off the 4 coyotes that spawn in North Ro. <br />
<br />
Diloperia's Bracer can also be a problem, but usually you can get a high level person to do it for you with just a simple please :)<br />
<br />
Message me as Konjunktion whenever any of you are on and I'll do what I can, he's my main.<br />
<br />
Diggitybop continues his rampage, however!</div></div><hr />

I've only gotten the helm so far, but I'll get the rest.<br />
<br />
I'm adding all these names to my friends list.  Also, everytime I log on I /join gnomes.  When your on, please /join gnomes as well, that way we can all get to know who each other is and start working on getting ready to level each other and whatnot.<br />
<br />
When I hit 8 or 9, I'm moving over to crushbone.  I'll start camping there.  I wont hit 9 until I've grabbed my newbie armor though.</div></div><hr />

I'm almost tempted to start a message board for this alone.  And start the process of getting a guild together.  You don't know how much I miss Rallos Zek!!!!!<br />
<br />
But all my friends quit playing, so I haven't played RZ.<br />
<br />
But if we can get a good amount of like minded gnomes.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreiden</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive attempted a few pk kills and I want you fello gnomes to learn from my mistakes:).<br />
<br />
Naked humans in freeport bank = bad target.<br />
Woodelf ranger = bad target<br />
halfling warrior = good target but dont attack him when his mage friend is hiding behind a tree:)<br />
<br />
So far I've yet to get my first pk kill. I've never done pvp before my gnome so still testing the waters. Id love to group with like 5 other gnomes though and get that woodelf ranger to chase me into a cave where the 6 of us jump him.. heheh that'd be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a firm believer in not just PKing people.  I think you should have solid reason to attack someone.  Like maybe because he's taller than a woodelf.  I like woodelfs, most of em are druids, so they sow us and such.<br />
<br />
Best way to PvP is to add in some role playing.  Just attacking someone out of the blue without letting your intentions be known in a semi-acceptable way (nobody seems to thing PvP is acceptable, even on a PvP server!) isn't going to help you get through the game.  Then all of a sudden you're labeled as a PK/Darkenbane style.  Next thing you know, you're camping portals and zones.  :)<br />
<br />
I love PvP, but I quit when my friends stopped playing and when Darkenbane and like guilds seemed to rule the server.  I'd much rather we at least setup reasons for PvP so we're not labeled as a bunch of grief PKers.  Not only that, but I don't like it when  someone ganks me just to gank.  I have yet to attack anyone this time around on RZ, but that's because I'm a gnome warrior and I don't have the stats to do so yet.  :)</div></div><hr />
