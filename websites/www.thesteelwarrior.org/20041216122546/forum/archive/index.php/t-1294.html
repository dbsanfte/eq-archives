I am just wondering cause I have always heard of guilds doing it and didn’t know how much truth there was to it =D<br />

<br />
Now we use pure DKP system and it works just fine. If that caster wants a haste item, hes free to take it as long as he has the points to, and since he has the points, none has the right to complain.</div></div><hr />

Only time ever we did anything of the sort was in ToV when we started we let tanks get dibs on plate BPs. Other than that its been DKP and myself and other tanks working our asses off to quest SWC, ct gnome earring, EtoV quests - camping things like Gaukr for plate legs and such. I have a total of 2 VT items and im just over 9300 hps and 1617 AC which i hope is good enough to start EPs.</div></div><hr />

I personally agree.. there is nothing like kitting out 1 or 2 MT's and then they quit / go on break. I like the fact we are pure DKP and there is no favoritism. Nearly all of us are equal and can effectively MT just as good as the other.<br />
<br />
We can arguably say we have some of the best TEAM equipped warriors. (Notice team, and not individuals) 5 of which are now 10k+, the others very close behind.<br />

Pure DKP = fair as possible.</div></div><hr />

You have them because of the elemental planes and with maybe a little VT thrown in.  To have that many well-equipped tanks you still have to get the drops and even if you weren't using DKP those drops still would have ended up on your warrriors for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with trying to specifically gear up a MT to the exclusion of other people is twofold.  One, it frustrates the people who are being excluded in favor of the MT.  Two, if your MT quits or goes on vacation or whatever then what are you going to do?<br />
<br />
We use straight DKP and everyone seems to be getting geared up fairly well.  Our MT happens to have the best attendance so he's also got the best gear.  He's sitting at around 9300 or so HPs and we're still chugging through VT and PoP tier 3.  Hoping to be in the elementals in about 3 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weh ave killed all up to RZ, and he is next kill for us.<br />
<br />
Problem I have, and it is sad to say is with PoP Itemization.<br />
Where is the warrior gear?<br />
Paladins get great weapons for 1dkp. <br />
War must outbid rangers/rog/bards/pal/sk if they want a weapon.<br />
Then they have lots of points to get the all/all gear and our warriors get left behind.<br />
<br />
DKP is nice, you get what you work for, just some people get more, again because of SOE's PoP Itemizatation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gearing up a MT will help the guild advance faster<br />
<br />
But if something happens with the MT, your in deep trouble.<br />
(I wouldnt recommend it, its risky, and worse of all bad for the morale)<br />
<br />
As for the usual DKP vs Officer Wisdom ....<br />
I dont trust officers that much (ass kissing, favoritism,status quo)<br />
And i want to be able to choose what i loot, So its DKP for ever <br />
(Note that the Officer Wisdom works very well too)</div></div><hr />

No limit on items you can buy (first SoD on server went to a Shaman, only two pairs of Elemental Plate legs are on a bard and cleric).<br />

Our Primary MT is like 10.2k or some such, I'm second highest at 9900, with more in the 9600-9800 range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use award. One of our officers put in a lot of time and made us a really nice database. Track everything that dropped, when people last looted etc etc. Makes awarding a lot easier. When we broke into Ele planes we weren't as well geared as most. So at first focused the big HP upgrades on MT's. 4-5 of them. And it has helped immensely. We're about as casual as you can still get and progress at a fast rate. So couldn't just gear up 1-2 tanks. Probably slowed us down some, oh well.<br />
<br />
 For the most part I would advise against it unless you find yourselves in a situation like we did. Where your tanks obviously do not have the HP's to handle stuff. However you have more HP than I have right now. So you're probably OK(though looking at your roster the other wars in your guild are lucky to hit 6k unbuffed). <br />
<br />
 I think in general people are better off with 3-4 9000hp wars than 1 with 9500 and a bunch straining for 8500.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you have your answer here.  Don't do it.  Picking your favorite warrior and making them MT and giving them all the best loot first will only cause bad feelings, ESPECIALLY if that person happens to be you.  I have been in guilds that tried to do this and it is not the right way to run your guild.  The ideal situation would be for any warrior that plays a decent amount to have gear and experience to allow them to stand up and tank any mob that your guild kills.  Give gear to anyone that contributes to raids regularly, and let them tank.  Being MT isn't extremely hard, but it does take some practice to get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
Also, this is a Battlefield thread so it's going that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have heard the saying about putting all your eggs in one basket? I am sure the the warrior you pick to outfit would appreciate you helping gear him up so he can app to the local uber guild.<br />
<br />
Picking a favorite is a sure way to piss off everyone who isn't the favorite. Plus it sucks having everything you do tied to 1 persons schedule and raid attendance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im actually at 9300<br />
got 2 right at 9k even once Lcea stays up for one min to turn in seru earrings, they have worked hard questing crap to step up<br />
one at 8800 he has our second Bloodfrenzy <br />
and the rest are all 8500-9k but all have pretty decent AA and all have EB weaps.<br />
<br />
We chose to farm Ssra like crack whores and AoW till all got geared and then Emp / VT while most other guilds started pop right away ( of the guilds on our level, were like i said a year old so didnt have much exp in raiding or a base ) So it pays off cause we dont wipe but maybe once to all weve tried in PoP even Rydda we owned first try. My concern was going into EP kind of weak, but it seems were not that bad off. We definetly need some work tho =D</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
As long as you have someone doing loot that can be fair and is trusted by everyone in the guild, it can be good.  People make mistakes though, and people's feelings get hurt over it.  If you really do all of the loot I would bet money that there are people who disagree with your decisions on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
My guild of two years was a merit guild and I supported the system right up until the time the guild imploded and 3/4 of the members left.  It wasn't all about loot, but bad loot decisions were definitely the catalyst.  DKP has it's problems, but there are never questions of favoritism, and there almost always is with merit, even if you have a good database and you can show your loot per month per person etc, you are still opening yourself up for criticism.  DKP isn't perfect, but there is no favoritism, or perception of favoritism in it at all.<br />
<br />
I like merit because it can take certain intangibles into consideration where DKP is strictly raid attendence, but if I was to start a guild today, after watching my previous guild self destruct, I would definitely go with DKP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually krassus i forgot to mention that if you do end up going merit; than get some people together if you can and do trust and; like grimmlokk mentioned; assemble a database of everyone's gear ( magelos works nicely ); than appoint a &quot;loot council&quot; or whatever you want to call it and have them hash out the week's targets; see who needs what and keep track of attendance; and merit the loot out that way.<br />
<br />
we started that with our guild a while ago; and switched to a DKP system when we were winding out of ToVN and things have from what i have seen; been pretty good.<br />
<br />
the best part though about a pure DKP system is that there really are no more vald &quot;favoritism&quot; or &quot;biased decisions&quot; being made any longer and causing dissention amongst the troops.<br />
<br />
you raid, you get loot. you slack; you get no loot. pretty cut and dry really.</div></div><hr />

If your guild is more casual, or has lots of tradeskilling folks, points systems can alienate the non hardcore raiders.  It creates a rift in the guild, which sucks.  My guild discussed it as an option and people were already drawing lines.<br />
<br />
Merit works if people are responsible and reasonable about their decisions.  Merit always tends to lead to questions, and people tend to hold out with merit like they are saving up points.<br />
<br />
Don't even go with random as a viable loot system =)  It's not!<br />

Do a guild poll/vote.  Let your people decide what they want.</div></div><hr />

Our top tank has like 8.3k and 1400AC :P and we've killed most stuff before tier 3 bosses. Are we gonna need some serious gearing up before we take on the likes of Bert and rztw?</div></div><hr />

I dont trust officers that much<br />
<br />
That says something abour your officers, or you. Mostly it just means your officers would hafta be more open and have more info out in the open if you wanted to go award.<br />
<br />
Point systems can work if you have people who are commited to raiding. If your guild is more casual, or has lots of tradeskilling folks, points systems can alienate the non hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
 Bingo. Rather than being 1 guild of 70-80 hardcore every day raiders we are 3 guilds of about 90 combined regular players. Probably 30ish hardcore every day raiders. 20-30 who play pretty often. And a bunch of casual people who raid a couple times a week. None of the guilds operates like a traditional hardcore guild. None of us actively recruit, much less recruit based on class. A DKP type system would really screw us up. But with our spiffy DB every member can log in and see who got what and when easily.<br />
<br />
 We didn't used to have such a nice tracking system, and all too often questions would come up. &quot;Why did so and so get that over this other person?&quot;. Then our bard officer chick would hafta dig through her huge binder that had all our awards in it hand written to give dates and crap, which no one else could see for themselves. Once the gnome tinkered up the DB for us those questions pretty much disappeared. <br />
<br />
 I would strongly suggest a public(to the guild) tracking list if you decide to go award over DKP. Course, if you go DKP yer gonna have a nice visible tracking list anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 No. None of our tanks broke 9k when we downed RZ. Hell I think top 4 were all right around 8600 if that. But you are definately gonna have a harder time with RZ than someone better geared. Not sure where your guild specifically is at, but if farming VT is an option I would suggest it.</div></div><hr />

I watched a guild on my server award (using DKP system) their first Gold Runed Mithril Knife (4th best dagger in the game atm if you didn't know) to a BEASTLORD to put in his offhand... because he had more points than anyone else.  Best dagger they have ever gotten, and it went to a beastlord.... criminal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josephian</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm gonna have to agree with Grendon.  Straight DKP can be just as retarded as /random if you have selfish players, and really, what raiding guild doesn't?<br />
<br />
Had a shaman (or any non-warrior) in my guild asked for SoD, my guild leader would have had a not so gentle discussion with the player no matter his DKP standing and if the guildleader wasn't happy with the discussion, /gr would soon follow.   Not that this ever happened, because everyone understood that it would.  <br />
<br />
We use a combination of DKP and Loot Fairness Council ruling, where the LFC not only looks at DKP but also the scale of upgrade, last time a loot was awarded, recent raid attendance and usefulness to a particular class among those who asked for said item.  We've had 0 problems with this system ever since we implemented it during SoV when all those 100 hp/mana all/all items started dropping in NToV.<br />
<br />
Though I must admit, it was probably a very easy transition for us since we were using LFC prior to NToV and DKP just speeded up and streamlined the loot decision process for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toga</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those last few points are right on the money..<br />
DKP is a great way to fairly  spread out loot to a guild.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
It is a terrible way to gear up tanks and also encourages greed over common sence. Our guild has a cleric with 3 elemental class haste items, yet melees STILL trying to find a decent haste upgrade. <br />
If you can get a system with DKP plus officer approval that would be best IMO. When Shaman004 bids on that haste cloak you've been waiting on because it has 100 mana and 10 all resists , let the officer veto his bid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well DKP works terrifically if you dont have absolute retards in your guild, like how someone above mentioned a beastlord looting a Solro dagger before the rogues have them.<br />
<br />
Im in the same guild as Granthor and Olafsky, we use pure DKP.  BUT people use common sense in bidding also.  <br />
<br />
When we started doing rallos zek and Blades of War started dropping, no shadow knights or paladins or rangers bid.  Its just common sense.  When Reinforced Mephit Talons started dropping, no rogues bid.  Again common sense.  When Ifir's dropped, only rogues bid.  <br />
<br />
As long as your members arent twits and have half a brain and a shred of decency and common sense, DKP works fine.  Like Grant and Olaf mentioned earlier 8 of our 9 active warriors are over 10k HP's.  The only one NOT over 10k yet is me, and according to our database that gives the percentages everyone plays in the 4th most active of the 9.  This should show you that we are all pretty much on the same level.<br />
<br />
Our guild is very civil to one another, if people know someone could really benefit from looting an item, they wont bid.  The loot in our guild is very well spread out, and this is using DKP.  If you have loot whores or dicks that buy anything and everything and try to bid on items that are clearly for a specific class, even if they are multiple class listed, perhaps you should evaluate if you really need em in the guild.  <br />
<br />
Stuff like Blades of War, Ifirs, Reinforced Mephit Talons, etc etc etc, if people use common sense, then DKP works just fine.</div></div><hr />

Like Grimmlokk said, you can get by RZ with less, but you will have a harder time. The real problem will come when you start going for loot droppers in the EPs. At 8600hp your warriors are going to be taking a serious beating. A lot of AA helps, but you will definitely want to gear up before attempting the gods.<br />

They still &quot;payed&quot; for them, just got them first ... worked pretty good I think.<br />

Im sure once we drop RZ the MTs will get BoW before other warriors again, which is a good path, since those need them first IMO.<br />

In response to your question, once you hit 65, the raiding world opens up to you.  If you chose to join a raiding guild, and you work on your AA points, your hitpoints and armor class can easily skyrocket.  <br />

If you check out some of the magelo's of the warriors that post in this forum, you will see some of the gear that is coming out and they are getting from the &quot;end&quot; game.  Also you can gain nearly 500 base hp just from exping for AA points.  <br />
<br />
So i guess the answer is, once you are level 65 and you're in a raiding guild and aquiring gear and points from the upper end of the game, thats how peoples HP and AC get so high.  <br />
<br />
By the way, 10k hp is buffed, the max hp possible without buffs is like 8500.  And thats only if you've whored every time drop thats come out =P<br />
<br />
Most hp anyone has is around 8k even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haste items = melee / hybrid first... the basic haste items (CoF, CoM, RBB) are 0 cost.<br />
<br />
Vengeance - Melee / Hybrid first<br />
<br />
FT - Caster / Hybrid first<br />
<br />
EB, TB and FB etc... BoC, BF, BoW, Aegis of Earth are all warrior only.<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty much up to your RC's to decide...</div></div><hr />

<br />
However guilds that do this seem to implode a lot, or go through several incantations. Several guilds on povar that have huge member turnovers come to mind hehe. I dont think its much coincidence that they to have a officers assigned loot system.<br />
<br />
My guild uses a DKP type system which tends to spread out the items amound everyone. Everyone earns points for attendance and items are auctioned to the highest bidder. <br />
<br />
The plus side is their is much much less drama. Very rarely do people argue about loot assignments. Makes for a much more stable guild. <br />
<br />
The down side is rarely a casual player who has hoarded their points for the past 6 months will walk away with a very top of the line item which is effectively wasted. Also some heavy raiders tend to spend up big and actually do worse in terms of loot compared to more moderate raiders who spend more wisely.</div></div><hr />

Not too great, but definitly not shabby.  My guild does DKP, and imo, the loot is very fairly divided (Even though there is always that one person that logs on once a month and complains because of no loot).  I have seen tons of items that would be an upgrade for me, yet I have passed.  Why you ask?  The other tanks (besides one or two) in my guild are moderately equipped, but I sit about 1k over all of them in HP.  Call it &quot;whoring DKP&quot; (as someone once told me), I call it &quot;evening up the warriors&quot;.  I don't want the healers to get too accustomed to just healing the top warriors of the guild.  I want all of our tanks to be near (within' 300hp) of each other.</div></div><hr />
