<br />
I had 14g at the end of the evening.  After making a run to Ironforge and doing 8 skill ups on blacksmithing, half with iron I had mined for myself, half I'd purchased from the auction house, and then buying the coal to smelt it all into iron, I ended up with 1g and some change, even after selling my made items back to the vendor.  I still need 5 more skill points just to be able to make the items for smithing armor specialization quest.  And I've already managed to scrape together 80 of the 120 mithril bars needed for the three quests from Galvin the Ancient that gets you the ornate mithril plans to be able to make the items required for the specialization quest.  So I have 40 mithril bars to go in the first quest, and a pretty significant number for the second quest, all of which get fed to NPCs.  Lovely.  And I wonder when I'll have gold enough for a horse.  Not until my 50s I imagine.<br />
<br />
On another topic.  I tried the elite named panther in Stranglethorn Vale tonight, solo.  I have 5 levels on him and he's green as can be.  He still nearly waxed me.  I charged in using a 38 DPS 2handed axe and used heroic blow fairly frequently, after a few sunder armors.  If I hadn't had retaliation as a fall back position, I would have undoubtedly been making a corpse run.  How other Warriors are defeating even or one lower elites with predictability, I have no idea.  I find it hard to imagine to be honest.  My Warrior has 2700+ AC unbuffed and 2500+ HP.  Most of my focus in skills has been in DPS, with only a little in fury and protection.  Perhaps that's my problem, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hit 38, went back to see what new skeelz I got.  For a sum of 2g7s each, I have Thunderclap, Slam and Pummel available.  Thunderclap I use fairly frequently, but I don't use it for damage, I use it for the slow and for aggro.  So 10 more damage to me isn't worth 2g.  Slam is utter fucking garbage, so I can save 2g there, and Pummel I just don't see the point to.  If I need to shut down casters, I defensive stance (for revenge stun), Concussion blow and shield bash..there's no point for me to be fighting casters in Zerker, so that's a waste of 2g too.  So right there, I saved myself 6g this morning.<br />
<br />
After making a run to Ironforge and doing 8 skill ups on blacksmithing, half with iron I had mined for myself, half I'd purchased from the auction house, <br />
<br />
See, this is something else I'd never do.  My smithing is 205 right now, has been since 36 I believe.  I've got shitloads of mithril, iron and heavy stones in the bank, and I've never bought a single bar..there's just no point.  Minerals are WAY too common to be spending ridiculous prices in the auction house for  them.  You can get a stack of iron bars in under a half an hour in some zones.  Save some cash, cut out the middle man, do it yourself.  Sure, might take more time..but what are we in a hurry for?<br />
<br />
And I've already managed to scrape together 80 of the 120 mithril bars needed for the three quests from Galvin the Ancient that gets you the ornate mithril plans to be able to make the items required for the specialization quest. <br />
<br />
Word around the campfire is that Armorsmithing is a fuckin joke currently.  Save the mithril and go for Weaponsmithing instead.  You make 8 weapons and tada...weaponsmith.  No 120 mithril bar bullshit.<br />
<br />
I have no idea. I find it hard to imagine to be honest. My Warrior has 2700+ AC unbuffed and 2500+ HP. <br />
<br />
You using 2h or shield?  Seems kinda low since I can foot 2700ac pretty easily with sword + board.  Takes longer to kill shit, but I end up with more health left over usually.<br />
<br />
Also, in an earlier post you mentioned the constant need for upgrades.  Not sure what you mean by that, but I'm hoping you're not buying them in the AH.  It's definitely not needed, especially if you're a smith.  The auctionhouse is pretty much the biggest joke in this game.  The Bazaar, it is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm helping to outfit my guild while I'm about it.  So yes, I could take longer and do it slower.  But I'm already 45.  I really don't want to be 50+ before I finish my specialization quest that I get at level 40.   And much of the gear I get as drops gets offered up to the guild first and to the auction house only after it's been rejected as not needed by guild mates.  So yeah, I run a little lean.  On the counter balance though I do get some help with minerals from some guild mates and occassionally something gets offered through the guild that's an upgrade for me.  Of course that isn't too frequent since I'm one of the top two or three highest level characters in the guild currently.<br />
<br />
And I've read that armor specialization isn't so hot right now.  But I had commited before I found that out.  And from what I gather you can't untrain one specialization and go train in the other because once you've made the choice, the other NPC won't have anything to do with you.  So I'm pretty much stuck on the course I've chosen.  The price of making what superficially looks like a good choice without complete information I guess.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, you could farm instances and sell those items and save up for your horse.  A guild buddy soloed one of the lower lvl instances and jsut sold everything he picked up.   He had his horse within 2-3 days.<br />
<br />
I had enough for my horse around lvl 35, mainly due to me selling blacksmith items.  Check the AH for plans from time to time and pick up the rare good ones.  If you are the only one making them, you can set your price.  For example, I went from selling Green Iron Haubarks to Jade serpent blades, and now Im on Mith Shield spikes.  When the materials cost 2-3 gold to make, and you sell them for 6-7 g each, it adds up fast.  You could effectively sit at the AH when you log on or log off and make a profit inbetween logging in and out of the game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the Ornate Mith gear is pretty awsome.  +% crit and +% dodge is pretty good as a berserk warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty far behind the curve.  Needless to say, I'm not the only one making anything, so the auction house ends up being a loss of deposit and a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Low level instances don't seem to be too useful either.  You just can't clear gold fast enough, at least the times I've done it.  2 or 3 gold from a full inventory isn't that great when the grey weapons that drop in SM and Arathi and such sell for 40-50s each.<br />
<br />
I'll probably just end up duoing SM with various people for a couple days, bust out the horse and grind on to 60.  And after seeing the ridiculous ingredients on the Truesilver BP and the pretty lame ass Truesilver gaunts, I think I'll be going Weaponsmith.  Well, that and the fact that I don't have to throw 120 mithril bars into the shitter too.</div></div><hr />

120 mithril bars ? Hahaha, you only wish 8(<br />

The ingredients on the truesilver bp are not that bad actually, you'll easily get everything except the black pearls while mining the mithril for the mithril order quest and the pearls sell for 40-100s in the AH on my server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sooo....back on topic  :p <br />
<br />
Vikken, I'd say that for the most part WoW is not plagued with any of those problems you mentioned.  I am playing a 38 Night Elf Druid and a 22 Human Mage.  I find the game insanely fun. <br />
<br />
1.  Soloing is always do-able and the experience is rewarding since people should always be mixing their soloing with their questing - even if the mobs don't garner a ton of exp, the end result of the quest likely will.   I can believe that soloing with a warrior class may be more difficult, but I don't think it would be along the lines of EQ2 solo difficulty (then again, keep in mind that the highest level character I got in EQ2 was lvl 7!).  I can tell you that some classes solo with far greater ease, but that has always been the case.  My druid solo's beautifully.  My boyfriend's paladin is a regular solo champion. I often see hunters and warlocks soloing.  <br />
<br />
2. Quests are fun, interesting, often rewarding, and often soloable.  I know that the quests tend to be the same (gather, kill, explore), but there are often twists put into them that make each interesting to me at least.  Personally, I love the explore ones or the ones where you have to click on world objects.  I'm not sure why I'm so tickled by that, but I am.  :p   Being able to solo quests is also great.  In a line of related quests, the last ones will probably require a partner or a group, but there is such a plethora of quests from all over the globe that you can complete solo ones any time you can't find a partner.  Also, I've noticed that as we gain levels folks in WoW are much keener on grouping up to complete quests (and the system really rewards grouping for quests since everyone can loot a peice on a named mob, for instance).  This makes it not painful both because you can easily fill your time with solo quests while waiting for a partner or group to come along and because you can complete the quest with the group relatively quickly.<br />
<br />
3.   The classes in WoW are unique, which is good, but there is no holy trinity (at least not by level 38).  At least three different classes can tank (Warrior, Paladin, and now with the direbear changes, Druid), at least two classes can heal (Priest and Druid, usually also Shaman and Paladin), several classes can CC (Druid, Mage, Priest, Hunter, Warlock, Rogue), and most all classes have some utility that differs from everyone else.  That said, I would have personally liked even more variety in class makeup...but what can ya do? <br />
<br />
4.  Having played beta I'm sure you already know that you can always help other players in this game and they would never lose the reward for the encounter unless you managed to &quot;help&quot; them before they attacked the mob.  <br />
<br />
5.  Travel...ahhh....I'm growing to hate travel in WoW.  My Druid can get around relatively fast because she has Cheetah form and she can bind near Stormwind, yet still get across to the other cont. fast since she can Teleport to Moonglade with rides to Auberdine.  Running around on my Mage is just painfully slow.  At 40 this all changes and I haven't personally had the money problems that others mention.  Since around level 30 I've hovered around 35gold, and I'm paying to train up Leatherworking on my druid and tailoring and enchanting (ug) on my Mage.   Then again, depending on the class you pick, you'll never have that problem anyway.  Warlocks and Paladins get a quest mount at 40, undead Mages also get that mount, Mages can teleport around by 40, Hunters get cheetah form for themselves and others by 40, Druids get cheeta form. <br />
<br />
<br />
So far WoW is going strong and I don't see the end coming any time soon.  I do wonder about the viabilty of high end play.  But you know what?  I and my friends are having a blast right now, which makes the present monthly fee more than worth it.</div></div><hr />

So I'm pretty much stuck on the course I've chosen.  The price of making what superficially looks like a good choice without complete information I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm in pretty much the same situation but I don't seem to be having money woes.  I'm THE highest level char in my guild by 11 levels atm and am 47, I've sold mabye 3-4 actual pieces of gear in the AH, and thats usually because its a piece that someone in my guild won't be able to use for 20+ levels.  I smith and was done with all 6 of the ornate quests by level 44, the three in STV by 42, I've always kept my smithing ahead of my level, often being able to make gear 2-3 levels before I can acutally use it.  I had my mount almost as soon as I made 40, I had to borrow 15g from a pally friend, but was able to pay it back in less than a day.  <br />
<br />
You must be fighting the wrong mobs and mining in the wrong places.  I've never once bought ore from the AH, in fact I've sold probably 4-5 stacks of iron, no mithril though since I use so much of it.  I'm getting close to having to buy Truesilver from the AH but thats only because I make gear for both myself and a pally friend without charging him, though HE'll probably eat some of the cost for the TS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some things I've done that mabye account for the difference in experience . . . <br />
<br />
I've never ever bought myself gear in the AH, all my gear is drop, quest, or smithed.  Gear changes so quickly in this game, it slows down around 40 but even then I'm changing pieces of gear fairly regularly, theres just no point in buying gear that you're most likely going to replace fairly soon.  Being a CB player probably helps some in this regard since I know where the good quests are, but thottbot has a pretty good system for looking up gear and finding out where it comes from.<br />
<br />
I dedicate time to JUST mining, I have several different spots that I can go to mine mithril and iron before that, SoS is great for iron, theres 3-4 different deposits you can hit within small distance of each other, mithril has similar spots as well.  Also in this vein, don't pass veins by, even though the only things I make with iron anymore are counterwieghts and an occational shield spike, I always stop for iron veins, I can either use it to make gear for guildies or if I get too much sell it at the AH for 3g a stack.  The only minerals I skip are copper and silver.<br />
<br />
Finally if I'm going to grind I always kill humanoids, humanoids drop the most straight cash and cash items such as vendor trash and green gear, also alot of humanoid areas tend to have chests these can yeild cash items as well.  If you're in your 40's the humanoids in Tanaris are great for this, Wastewanders and the pirates all drop cash, vendor trash, and mageweave fairly often, as well as the occational green item and there are usually 2-3 chests spread between these two areas unless they're heavily camped at the time.  If you're still needing cash for a mount, several days of slaughtering these mobs should make you the money you need fairly easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any hints on where to get mithril, truesilver, or thorium?  I doubt any of us are on the same server so we shouldn't really run into eachother.  I know the higher you go, the more plentyful ore gets.<br />
<br />
When I was talking about instances, I was refering to the lower lvl ones.  If you are lvl 40+, doing the Stockages should yield some pretty fast returns.  You could solo thru there in no time, get out of the instance, sell your warez, then run back in (you have to reset it though).  SM is a bit higher than normal and takes a little more time to clear.  Were going for cash here, not exp.<br />
<br />
Also if you know any paladin friends, they should have plenty of cash to spare.  They get free mounts so they don't need to spend 90 g on the training or the horse.</div></div><hr />
