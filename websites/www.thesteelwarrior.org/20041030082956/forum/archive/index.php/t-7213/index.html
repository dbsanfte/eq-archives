<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ducky222</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey all, i am new to this board, but i just created a gnome warrior, yes a gnome for tinkering, the only ts i didn't have, and was wondering what kind of armor  and weapons to twink him with... nothing ofver 1k per piece though, because i don't have boatloads of money, about 20k totall. would really appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is on the assumption you have no interest in doing the newbie armor quests.<br />
<br />
Change the rings to the 6/65 Velium Fire rings<br />
Crustacean Shell boots legs and helm<br />
Crafted BP might be better than Rygorr, but not a ton if you already own the Ry'Gorr<br />
If not Crusty helm Skull Shaped Barbute<br />
Spider Fur Belt<br />
Cotiere General Cape<br />
Chipped Velium Amulet or Clattering Bone Necklace for neck<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes or Death Mask of the Elysians for face<br />
35 HP player made earrings<br />
Some variation on Dragonwing mantle for shoulders<br />
<br />
I went with the very budget items mostly. There are a couple of better cloaks for more PP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ducky222</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, did some changes, now what should i use for a weapon. what 1 of all kinds, no more then 2k per weapon please.<br />
<br />
 was thinking: blood point, centi ss, blackened alloy bastard sword and copper hammer of striking( yeah i know, broke my own rule, but can take my 59 druid and some friends and go get it hehe) or delitfull orb for the 1hb<br />
<br />
my new thoughts on gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1023524) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since they fixed the recommended level bug on weapons, you'll want to avoid weapons with a rec level like the chos and orb.  You may want to get them and bank them for later use.  At low levels, you don't really need proccing weapons anyway, and if you just have to have a proc, gnoll hide lariats are big fun to tank with, especially in caster heavy zones. (I used to always have a pair with me when tanking in Crypt of Dalnir).  When you get to the level where procs become more necessary for holding aggro, something with a ykesha proc, frostbringer, venomous axe of the velium brood, or black blade of tormenting are all decent lower end aggro weapons that will work until you're high enough level to use the droga combo.<br />
<br />
Edit:  For a really cheap 2hand slasher, a Mithril 2hander is hard to beat for a twink.  Decent ratio, haste, and sells for about 50pp last I checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you were just going to make a warrior for tinkering I would just mainly focus on the weapon. Get a strong weapon with low delay that has no rec/req on it, such as swiftblade of zek, black acrylia blade (14/22) or something similar.</div></div><hr />
