Question: If I get a single solid group together, could I take down: Dozekar the Cursed, Eashen of the Sky, or Dagarn the Destroyer? I'll have a few more equipment upgrades before I go (Lvl 61, Stonewood bow, Steel Ring of ER). Just thought I'd ask to see if this is suicide :D <br />

Never know until you try though.</div></div><hr />

Certainly they are all single groupable, but you'll need a very solid tank first of all.</div></div><hr />

Need a decent tank+2 decent healers and DPS for him. Me and my friends use to 2 group Eashen,Aaryanor, Ikiatar and Vyemm. then we Would 1 group everything else(9.5ktank,2 8kish mana clerics, Rogue, Bard, and Druid). It is easy if you know what you are doing..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely yes, he doesn't hit as hard as North wing named. If you want an easy named to tank, try Telk or Gozz in west wing.</div></div><hr />

Doze procs an AE DD/Debuff every 15-30 seconds... don't have the time to look up the exact timer on it :P</div></div><hr />

He has high MR. At level 60 I think you'll need a shaman to get slow to stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing you have to remember, if you kill Dozekar he only drops tears for quests. The named in the same wing drop symbols. You will need ally (if I remember correctly) faction with dragons in order to complete the quests. Now, if you do happen to get some good tears/symbols and then go kill in North wing, you will trash your faction. It will be double work to complete the Dozekar quests. So, it's best to finish up any of the Dozekar quests you want and then go play in the North wing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">West wing will give faction hits too, will it not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been thinking of taking a group of friends in to take down Dozekar.  I read that he is indeed slowable, hits low but fast untill slowed. Thinking since I can 1 group a BoT Named, this guy is in fact doable.<br />
<br />
FYI, I buff to over 8K fairly easily with 1600 AC.  This includes Tribute and Virt/7/BBS/Rathe combo.<br />
<br />
Makeup of group would be: 65 Warrior [Me], 65 Cleric (FT8), 64 Warrior, 66 BL, 65 Druid, 62 Cleric.  Alternate could be 67 Monk (EP Geared) if I can get him to come. <br />
<br />
I figure it could be done, but I figured I'd ask the wise people here at TSW. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are gonna have a hell of a hard time slowing him without tash or malo.  Might want to have your spare melees bring a tash stick, but with no way to lower MR your BL is gonna have a whole lot of resisted slows (and and probably tank for a while).  With two clerics you can probably tank him unslowed for a while, but without a lot of AA and FT they are gonna have mana problems before it's dead. If you can bring a chanter along it will go much smoother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could prob find a Chanter around somewhere.  My group knows each other well too, so there aren't gonna be those kind of slip-ups.  Thanks for input.<br />
<br />
PS: Tash stick is a good item to have in the weapon bag then?</div></div><hr />

You should be ok tanking Dozekar, I did him when I was similar in hp/ac to yourself.  However, my group makeup is a tad different:<br />
<br />
at the time, 65 war/clr/dru/enc/mag/nec<br />
<br />
My stats for fighting him are below, but keep in mind I have a war and 2 rogue pets backstabbing the whole event, plus 5-6 necro dots (I didn't keep them on 100% of the time, I'd say every 5 minutes I'd redo them).  I would have the enc only slow/debuff, clr/dru on heals, mage would chain nuke to oom then med up to repeat later.  My druid would chain nuke if cleric mana was ok and I was nearing the 50% point.<br />
<br />
Unslowed, it would take a good chunk of mana out of the cleric/druid, but the modrods and manadumps would help that.  Keep in mind he's going to be a long fight.<br />
<br />
Dozekar the Cursed <br />
This mob [Summons] [Enrages] [Casts Spells] <br />
Max Hit 900     Ave Hit 406     DPS 147 <br />
Max Spell 400     Ave Spell 400<br />
Average 20 min 17 sec to kill      Average Total HP 373,945 <br />
I've spanked this mob 23 times out of 27 encounters<br />
<br />
His AE is:<br />
Silver Breath <br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 400 <br />
2:  Cancel Magic(9) <br />
Casting Time: 0 Recast Time: 12 <br />
AE Range 300 <br />
Target Type: PB AE<br />
Cast on you: You feel your skin freeze. <br />
Cast on other: Someone's skin freezes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnie</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've 6 boxed Doze since soon after POP came out.  One little trick for pulling him that I came up with.  Use a char with eye of zomm (or get a tinkered one), and open the door to his room.  Then you can stand on the steps and shoot and arrow at him.<br />
<br />
fight him on the wall with the healers behind a corner to hide from the AE.  For 1 group of non-EP geared people, expect a 30-40 min fight.</div></div><hr />
