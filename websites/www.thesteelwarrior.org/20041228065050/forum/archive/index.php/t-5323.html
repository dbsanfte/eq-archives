 I get a fluury message once in a blue moon and was wondering  what can i expect to see from it once i cap it out and move to the PoP flurry enhancer?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant remember flurrys &quot;procrate&quot; offhand. But there have been alot of 8 hour+ parses posted(you could try to search for some of Torrins) which included flurry rates. Expect to &quot;proc&quot; flurry less than a normal proc would proc in mainhand. So less than 2 flurries pr minute(and this is with the flurry skill maxed), as far as i remember without looking it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry pretty much sucks unless you put a ton of aa's into it. I can tell you for sure that putting all of the aa's to get maxed flurry 6 were some of my better spent aa's, though. Definately no regrets but don't look back... Max it, or you'll never see good results. It basically sucks through flurry 3, but once you get into 4-6 it starts getting good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thought Flurry had a chance to trigger on a successful triple attack, and that that chance went up with the extra AA.    Am I wrong? <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Flurry only works after a succesfull double attack, and has nothing to do with triple. Triple and flurry can both occur in a single round ( obviously with the respective rarity of triple and flurry both of them happening at the same time is a rare occurence ).<br />
<br />
This is from extensive parsing of a slow 2handed weapon using flurry 6 with no punishing blade AA. <br />
<br />
Evidence for only working on a double :<br />
<br />
Single hit percentage didn't change from flurry 0 to flurry 6.<br />
There were zero occurences of a triple attack with a flurry message. <br />
<br />
Evidence of triple and flurry both occuring independently :<br />
<br />
A small proportion of 5 hit attacks with flurry message ( compared to the large bulk of 4 hit attacks with flurry messages ) in roughly the same ratio as double -&gt; triple attacks. ( roughly because we are talking about a miniscule fraction of attacks here ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raging Flurry - the PoP Flurry upgrade says in its description that it makes flurry have a higher chance to fire if you land have a triple attack, but as others have pointed out you can get flurry at 59. Also I'm sure I've seen rounds where I've flurried and only had 3 swings - could be wrong about this tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might have missed on your first attack, hit on second, then triggered flurry, or might have hit on first, second, then missed on one of the two flurry attacks is my guess :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A mob riposte also looks like a triple on casual inspection because the hit appears before the riposte message does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which to get first between Flurry 1 or PB3? <br />
<br />
Right now I am working toward Flurry 1 ( have CF2, on the way to CF3) but if I end up getting a SEWS some day should I stop progressing to Flurry to get PB3 first? I have PB1 already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">our offensive aa's really don't do much alone, but combined with one another add up rather nicely.<br />
<br />
I bought PB3 first and then worked on Flurry. Flurry 1-3 didn't seem to go off much, but 4-6 seem to make it go off much more often.<br />
<br />
dual wielding i flurry alot! probably because of the added swings.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, i can't really tell you which to do first because alone they don't do alot, but combined, they are great. Just get them all! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll keep going toward flurry then. If / When I get a SEWS or BoW I will probably get PB3 before finishing flurry because of the reduced point cost. It also depends where I am in the rush for flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay....<br />
<br />
I have Flurry, PB, Ferocity Maxed out and here are the results based on 81 minutes of actual fighting.<br />
<br />
2.65 Flurries per minute.<br />
<br />
But it is true to not to expect anything dramatic like that until you have flurry maxed out along with some other offensive AA as mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats odd, Torrins 8 hour parses show around 400 flurries pr set, which is 0.83 flurry pr minute. <br />
<br />
But those were unhasted, so I guess maybe flurry doesnt work like procs do and instead scale up with haste? <br />
<br />
Was your parse with onehanders or twohander btw giantone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urgetakill da Ogur</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, you should get Ferocity, Punishing Blade, then Flurry in that order. Ferocity works ALOT more often than Flurry does, BP and Flurry can be interchanged depending on if you use a 2hander as your main weapon. At least when i got Ferocity i noticed the biggest increase in DPS over Flurry. But yeah, once you invest the AA's to get every single Flurry AA then it becomes much much more viable, almost like Double Riposte.<br />
<br />
Urge<br />
:hat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urgot_the_ogre</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Urgetakill. Flurry is a great skill but you need to spend alot of points to max it before it becomes really usefull.<br />
Ferociry and PB(if using a 2 hander) will do more than Flurry, for much less points.<br />
<br />
Hmm btw, Urgetakill da Ogur.. That name sounds familiar... =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did two parses for proc rate, and included flurry information.  It is posted in the proc rate thread, but the relavent information was:<br />
<br />
Parse 1<br />
Katta Banker from behind. Ornate Greatblade (2hs - delay 23).<br />
<br />
No buffs. Worn 41% haste. 1286 Atk. 203 Dex.  Parse length: 293.7 minutes (just under 5 hours)<br />
<br />
PB 3, Ferocity 3, Flurry 1, Ingenuity 3.<br />
<br />
94 Flurries (.32 flurry per minute)<br />
<br />
<br />
Parse 2<br />
Katta Banker from behind. Primal Velium Battle Axe (2hs - delay 44).<br />
<br />
Only buff was avatar - I procced it before starting, so it was on constantly during the parse. Worn 41% haste. 1461 Atk. 286 Dex.<br />
<br />
Parse length was 5 hours 41 minutes and 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
PB 3, Ferocity 3, Flurry 1.<br />
<br />
70 Flurries (.21 flurry per minute)<br />
<br />
discussion<br />
Flurry rate obviously scales with weapon delay, unlike procs.  The more you swing, the more you will flurry.  <br />
<br />
If this was not the case, we would see similar flurry rates with the two weapons (or a higher rate on the primal 2hs if stats like dex matter).  Instead, we see the Ornate Greatblade (much faster) having a much higher flurry per minute rate.<br />
<br />
When I get a chance, I will go back through both logs and determine a &quot;number of swings per flurry.&quot;  If dex or the other stats that avatar boosts up matter, then the primal two hander should require fewer swings per flurry.  If the stats don't matter, then I would expect the number of swings per flurry to be the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is bullshit.  Ferocity does next to nothing.....9 points for 2-3% DPS.  You didn't notice shit because it's not noticable, and it's within margin of error in a parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rogan</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anybody know if CE affects flurry proc rate ?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Individually, none of our offensive AAs are all that spectacular but as others have said if you get all of them they do combine for a significant boost.  When I got my BoC/Blackout combo initially I had zero offensive AAs and no vengeance gear.  I averaged around 60 DPS with that combo.  <br />
<br />
By the time I turned my BoC back in I had vengeance 49 and all of my offensive AAs except for finishing blow (which I don't plan to ever get).  That boosted my DPS with the exact same weapon combo to about 100 DPS.  I'm not sure what percentage of that boost was due to the ATK boost and what percentage was due to the offensive AAs but that's still a 40% boost in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Vengance 49 is +245 atk, and 245 atk is roughly 24.5% increase in dps.</div></div><hr />
