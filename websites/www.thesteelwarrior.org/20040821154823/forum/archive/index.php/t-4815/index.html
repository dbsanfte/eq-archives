<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Until this patch I think I only used this disc once, but I was under the impression it made you immune to melee dmg for around 12 seconds.  Now, reading the description on the tome it says that it increases your ability to evade melee dmg, or something along those lines.<br />
So anyone with experiance tell me if it's total melee immunity or just higher evade %?<br />
<br />
Just trying to decide which disc between that and Furious is going to be my &quot;shit hits the fan disc&quot; :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it increases your melee avoidance to a point where the mobs cant hit you anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you look at the spdat Charge for example is like increase your melee skills by 10000%.  Likewise Fortitude increases your defensive skills by 10000%.  It's a pretty cheap way for never miss/never get hit but they serve their function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Azrael is correct.<br />
<br />
Technically (from Lucy):<br />
Fortitude Discipline = &quot;Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by 10000%&quot;<br />
Furious Discipline = &quot;Increase Chance to Riposte by 10000%&quot;<br />
<br />
I've hardly ever used either myself either, but I would think Fortitude would be best used when not facing (read: running from) the mob, whereas Furious would be the choice when actually facing the mob since you can't riposte attacks from behind. There may be other circumstances where one is preferential to the other, but I haven't thought of them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One allows you to do damage (from the ripostes) in addition to not being hit.<br />
<br />
One allows you to not get proc'd on while you're not getting hit.  (AFAIK, mobs cannot proc on a miss)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">(AFAIK, mobs cannot proc on a miss)<br />
PCs can proc on a miss, but NPCs can't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">NPCs do not proc on misses if they're using innate procs.  If they're wielding a weapon that can proc (i.e. Velium whatever), they can proc normally on misses.<br />
<br />
Furious would stop procs too provided you're facing the mob too since a mob can't proc on a riposte (it's the same as a miss).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ya as phantron said.....<br />
<br />
NPCs cant have innate procs proc on a miss (but they cant have weapons that proc on a miss)...<br />
<br />
and cant proc on a riposte......<br />
<br />
reason being is a riposte is zero delay...<br />
<br />
procs rate is adjusted by delay to be a constnat Procs per minute...<br />
<br />
since riposte is zero delay, the chance to proc is zero</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">NPC innate procs aren't like the PC procs on weapons.  Being slower doesn't make them proc more to make up for being slower.  For NPC to proc on you they have to hit you, and they can't hit you when you riposte... at least that's how I'd expect the system to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd have to disagree to a certain extent.<br />

I was in CoDecay 2-boxing another Cleric. Corrupted Pusling was pulled.<br />

At 20%, Corrupted Pusling turned away and tried to run (It was snared btw).<br />
<br />
Cleric whacked Pusling facing it. Pusling riposted one of Cleric's swing, and proc'ced that Disease/Poison stuff.<br />
<br />
Seems mobs &quot;can&quot; proc on riposte.</div></div><hr />

Errr, you're right but that's not what we're talking about. Mobs can not proc if YOU riposte THEIR hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Furious when mobs hitting from front.<br />
Fortitude when getting hit from behind. <br />
 Both will save your life, just know where the mobs are.<br />
<br />
 No brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea I've used furious when a mob was enraged.  I was worried it would be like crossing the streams in Ghostbusters and crash the entire server or something...but actually it just negated all the hits on both sides.  So it will let you plow through enrage without damage but other than that it's a null effect.</div></div><hr />

I've hardly ever used either myself either, but .  <br />
<br />
I hadn't used them either before they split the timers...but now...it's great!  Effectively this gives me something to use on a bad pull in ldon if I don't have defensive up.  I also use it when tanking named mobs.  Try em out....they are definitely useful now that they have separate timers.  (reset time is a bit long, but in about 10 hours of playing they've already saved my xp groups a few times)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">reset time is a bit long <br />
<br />
Have to agree.   Be also nice if you cancelled an ability 1/2 through youd have half the reuse time.  Or something... I cancelled an aggressive cause it SUCKS endurance and my reuse time was still the same length.<br />
<br />
If I have to pay the endurance to use an ability I feel as though I should NOT have timers.   This is just my opinion and may not represent the opinions of others.</div></div><hr />

The best description of that situation any human being could have conjured.<br />
<br />
Hats off to the 5 min of laughing that caused.</div></div><hr />
