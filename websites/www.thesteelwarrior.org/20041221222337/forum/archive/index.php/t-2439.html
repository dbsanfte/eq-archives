We had one drop for us, a rogue looted. No warriors were interested, I expect because none of us have seen publicity for it here. I figure it is more of a DPS weapon, than any kind of real aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyone use this and have opinions?</div></div><hr />

None of our warriors have bought it(but they mostly have BoW or SeWS anyway).</div></div><hr />

I doubt it's much aggro, I almost asked for it so that I'd have a good DPS non-aggro weapon.  Went to a monk though, and war got the SEWs.  We're in Time, but we have almost no BoWs.</div></div><hr />

Nice proc rate most of the time, too, which is nice for exp groups.</div></div><hr />

He said, if it proced, on the occassion, he did get aggro. So far, he likes it and it seems to be a common drop off of the ring events. I may get one for a good offhander.</div></div><hr />

One of the funnest weapons i ever had.</div></div><hr />

We do the ring a lot for SEWS and our other guild warriors actually do seem to already have these.  Nice for DPS and the rune doesn't hurt in AE fights.  I think all of our monk/bst have these now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im sure it wasnt the BBB alone that pulled aggro off the BoW warrior unless the warrior was not attacking or he was stunned or something. BBB generally doesnt tend to pull aggro unless u taunt. the proc doesnt generate enough aggro to pull off enraging blow.<br />

<br />
When not MTing in a normal raid, while clearing, I would general pull aggro off the MA, wether they are using BoW, duel EB, or EB and FB shield. Of course, this is with hammer and bloodfrenzy. Doesn't seem to matter what hand I have it in and I do not have ambidex yet.<br />
<br />
When MTing I had much less success, though not on clearing, rather on the PoE gator. I'm going to sum that up to the AE slow though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Mallet in offhand, its delay cuts down on the number of ripostes, while cranking out some seriously nice DPS. The Rune proc helps generate aggro as well, along with the well-known aggro capabilities of BF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope - I was there with Cere - entire raid going full bore into TZ on RZ encounter, knight BBB procs - dead knight. The MA had a BoW he has 350 aa's and usually mobs stick to him like shit to a blanket.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling the knight was using a 1 hander for the rest of the raid. I also would love this weapon - I kid of think of it as having a weapon with 300 hps on it - I suppose it depends how often it procs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when I first got my BBB I used it whenever I wasnt tanking for DPS but I found that if I engaged straight after the MT and got an early proc I'd go splat and I found that if the MT went down I always went down next every time.<br />
<br />
If you give the MT a good 15 secs before you engage its really rare to pull agro but unless you are tank #2 in the line up I wouldn't use a BBB against raid bosses as a DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh wolveren; just that TZ/RZ was the most painful in regards to regaining control once it starts to go awry.. out fathead MT with the blade of war is downright devastating in regards to keeping aggro and the SK mentioned with the BBB can nearly always pull aggro off him and the SK turns to pulp.... i've seen the SK do it on more fights than just that one.<br />
<br />
Eoden's closing sentence i whole-heartedly agree on. The BBB is just too much aggro for anyone other than MT/RT/SA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a BBB whenever I cant risk using a BoWar but still want to do some dps.<br />
<br />
It doesnt have snap agro to it really, you'll proc 3-4 times before the mob turns, and if you see that happening it's easy to back out for a round or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danadur</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use a BBB as my main weapon and on raids when im not MTing and when i am MTing. i can hold aggro with it but it doesnt snap like Raaj said. much more relyable than BoC imo. ive only had a mob turn on me a couple times tho when im not MTing .. it doesnt happen frequently.'<br />

The only mob in the game that I don't use a BoW on when I'm not tanking is Time Tallon.  Every other raid I got the BoW out wether I'm 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in tank loop.  I don't seem to have a problem getting aggro by accident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have in moment 3 BoW Tanks ( one its me :D  ). When I'm not MT I am using GSot4W. Real good in damage. When MT died I am one of the first choices for the next target of the mob.<br />
<br />
The other 2 MTs are using a BBB when not tanking, but it seems that wiith the GSot4W I am higher in the aggro then they are with their BBB.</div></div><hr />
