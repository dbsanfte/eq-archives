<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, not really a gripe; but it's hard to learn how to play the game again.<br />
<br />
For those who are wondering ( well, just for clarification really ); I play pretty much on Test Server now due to time restraints. I started playing there pre-testbuff; and now that Kia is level 39 ( magelo at left ) and everyone around me are /testbuff's; I'm feeling &quot;stuck&quot; at a game where I am needing to show these guys how to play the game; or finally just realise that I can NOT play the game where I was used to plowing through mobs like I used to with Shikarii. <br />
<br />
So, the scenario...went on my first LDoN mission with my little group. Level 35 bard; level 32 enchanter; level 40 rogue; level 32 cleric; and a level 39 berserker along with myself. It was fun running across BB to the camp ( it was night-time; and most of the group died running from PoK portal ) so our first CR was quite fun ( Much thanks to those level 65's who dragged us to the GFay zone and ressed us; and especially to the pally who let me loot my new weapon off a commander ) and finally the sun came up and we got to start our mission. We picked a Hard collect adventure; and figured we'd do okay. <br />
So...off we run to GFay; run to LFay...that @#$$#%^^ unicorn kills our enchanter. Bastard :D. So, we drag them to the entrance of our LDoN and res him. Cool.<br />
 <br />
Into the dungeon we go. First pull I pull in ( 3 bats and a rat )....whooo enchanter wakes up; cleric runs in circles going AIEEEEEEEE; and in the end we make it throuh okay. Cleric asks me &quot;do you know how to pull? why so many?&quot; So; I say &quot;oh it's okay; just assist me and we live&quot;.... so, next pull incoming :D. 2 Bats. Not so bad. Enchanter is starting to like this; and now enchanter yells at cleric to stop running around like a chicken with no head. We plow through them; and the cleric says &quot;let the bard pull&quot; and I weep a little than say &quot;okay&quot;.<br />
<br />
So; we finish our collection with 7 minutes left; single pulls the entire way ( bard did a good job too )...but I guess learning to slow down and remembering that you're not level 65 and a killing machine isn't as easy as I thought it would be. <br />
<br />
Especially when toe-to-toe with a Sand Giant in S Ro waiting for the AC; but that's a whole 'nother story :D</div></div><hr />

 says it all. Everyone should learn to be a n00b again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i had an &quot;oops&quot; moment on my lowbie mage who had ran through a mass modrod in pok, clicked it a touch too early after rez, had 2 corpses then :P<br />
<br />
fun with friends, plus we got to say &quot;omg look how easy they have it these days&quot;, &quot;back when i was young this level took me 2 weeks&quot;, and all that &quot;uphill in the blizaard both ways barefoot with our siblings tied to our back and we liked it&quot; stuff  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I buy that really, is it that the game is different at a low level or is it that the people you were playing with didn't have the same experience as you?  When I started the game, I raise a L50 ranger w/a group of people, same 5 people grouping with every day.  We hit 50 in the first 3-4 months of the game and got bored.  So we all restarted as 'evil' races to see the side of the game we missed.  And all 5 were L1 darkelves of a totally different class.  The experience at the low levels was not all that different then the experience we had at the 'end game' of the time.  Mobs hit for big percent of life, tactics and care were required, and we still worked well together knowing how others would react to the situation.<br />
<br />
Had you taken a group of 5 of your former guildmates on that LDON, I'd bet you'd still be pulling 3-4 mobs knowing the chanter would have them mezzed, and the cleric would keep everyone up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite this incident with a crackhead cleric, the lower level game is rather different, especially for a sub-30 warrior. Try taunting mobs off a druid when you're wielding an 8/25 1h and your taunt skill is 17 =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Mourningloree Not sure I buy that really, is it that the game is different at a low level or is it that the people you were playing with didn't have the same experience as you? <br />
<br />
Little bit of both :D I remember talking to brutul that night while he was tailoring and telling him &quot;the bard has no haste song WTF&quot; and &quot;i got augmentation for haste WTF is that? =)&quot;<br />
<br />
so yeah, the game kinda is the same; but i got spoiled by my former guildmates and took a lot of things fo granted lie ..umm .. not asking for heals; buffs out the wazoo; clerics not running in circles; charmed pets; about 6000 more hit points myself and EB; .. the stuff we all come to know and rely on at 65 :D <br />
<br />
It was fun; actually. I just felt like I kept putting my old hat on and forgetting that my group didn't have the average of FT40 blahblah and 5K mana pools and stuff :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I've found a bit of alt-playing can be a lot of fun, especially if you actually play, rather than just PL. <br />
Some guildmates of mine took our 20-somethings to Splitpaw one day last week. We're fairly serious about not being stupid, but outside of that it was a significantly more relaxed evening than normal. We weren't really buffed or twinked, and some of showed certain signs of having recently been mules. I saw that one guildmate wasn't looting and I sent him a tell suggesting he loot up and he laughed and pointed out that he had &gt;400K in the bank and could probably pass on the phat fine steel l3wt. Then a little bit later he noticed that his character didn't have any pants on (&quot;hmm. I must have sold them at some point&quot;). That hardly ever happens on any raids I go on with my main, heh.<br />
In some ways, yeah, the game is the same: good players tend to be good whether they're playing their main or some baby alt; if you're playing and not being pl'd or fantastically twinked into invincibility, then yep, the mobs can still kill you and yep, you have to pay attention.<br />
Nevertheless, playing a baby alt is also certainly a different kind of fun from the kind I have when I'm playing my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a level 28 rogue that I recently dusted off for the first time in I don't know how long and did an LDoN.(been focusing on my warrior more and more as I progress through the many phases of 65).  I can't explain how much fun it was to be able to coast along and not have to worry about who the mob was beating on. <br />
&quot;Man, that ranger is getting his ass handed to him...../shrug, at least it isnt hitting me.....&lt;backstab&gt;, &lt;backstab,&gt;..............&quot;<br />
Went a long way towards relieving the tedium of tanking all the time.</div></div><hr />

Happened to me at Gym class once tho ... I'd borrowed an extra large sweatshirt (down to about mid-thigh on me, nearish to the knees) from someone, and completely forgot that I was only wearing my jock strap until my ass hit the cold floor of the basketball court. :o  Good thing no-one noticed - until, as I was heading back out and the teacher yelled *Where do you think you're going?* I shouted back *I forgot my shorts!*.<br />
<br />
Levelling alts is a hoot, it's almost a different game.  The risks are lower (pulling in 5 is less likely to wipe a party at 30 than it is at 60), but you also have less tools to use.   It's even more fun than my first pass thru the lower levels, as I have a better sense of the game mechanics and can pull some tricksy maneuvers I wouldn't have thought of that first time as a 20-something.</div></div><hr />

Usually I just say sump'n like *I can't do anything if yer gonna kite aggro but drag yer corpse - the MOB can stick to you like glue, but I will not be able to /follow it.  Lemme know if you want  me to pull aggro, by standing still.  That's stand still for *YES, PULL AGGRO*, and run around for *NO, DRAG MY CORPSE*.</div></div><hr />

My 27 shaman was in an LDoN hard collection the other day with a cleric, a ranger and three (!) warriors.<br />
One of the warriors asked the following questions:<br />
What is riposte?<br />
Which is better, slam, bash or kick?<br />
Why aren't you pulling (asked of the ranger, who was good, and who had been doing the pulling)?<br />
Ranger's answer: Because cleric is OOM and the shaman is dead and we're all beat up?<br />
<br />
Then I get a tell from ranger: I guess &quot;heal&quot; is an advanced tactic at this level because it has two syllables.<br />
<br />
We won anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye. I waited about half an hour from the time the warrior asked the questions until I answered them. That way I was calm. <br />
It gave me time to remember that it took me like a week to get from level 8 to level 10, during which time I tried to practice both slam and bash (carefully switching from no shield to wooden shield and back again each level) even though I was a Barbarian, lol.</div></div><hr />

If you want to try out a new class, what's easier than getting an instant level 25 with a full set of gear and going on some dungeon crawls.  I might do it myself but it seems like there's always something else to do.</div></div><hr />
