Also have dedgerex flintforged cudgel... wondering if that will be better to offhand and mainhand bloodsworn?<br />
<br />
This is my wife's character and Im trying to get her well equipped. She will be MT for our regular group of Shaman Cleric Rogue Bard Warrior. <br />
<br />
We arent rolling in cash, but have about 120k. Trying to get the most bang for buck in upgrades. I know her sta is kinda low. But when you consider that we have a shaman buffing 80 sta everytime she is on, then it can be 80 below cap. So at level 65 that would be 200 I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks.</div></div><hr />

With the money you've got available, you should have lots of options to choose from in the bazaar. In terms of Bang for Buck, I recommend the Architect's Bejeweled Chestplate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23154). It's easy to find and should be available for less than 20k.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing for agro.  You are better off with the CHoS and the SoTBS.   I really cant see too many upgrades that would be a huge improvement.  I would try to pick up a planar bow of some sort, Featherwood, Obsidian Wood, etc...<br />
<br />
Other than that, you could either try to save for a Helm of Zek,  or you could just do LDoN's when you get to 60 and then Hard missions when you get to 65 to get upgrades.  As it stands, you pretty much have the best buyable gear, aside from the Helmet of Zek and a new BP.<br />
<br />
While you *could* buy Earrings of Engagement, Cloudy Ring of Pnuematic force, etc...the gains would be pretty minisucle for the amount of cash you spend.<br />

Yeah Plan on getting Stonewood Compound bow when she gets up to 61.  Since sta isnt an issue rallos zek would only be a 20 hp upgrade. I also have Architecths BP for her... it is on the bard at the moment because she gets more hps for demented. She will have architechts when she gets a few more levels.</div></div><hr />

All said and done, it would be 32 or 33 AC more when you equip it, and that should be enough to push you over whatever cap you are at.<br />

Good point! thanks for the advice. I should have sold this helm for 40k and tried to save up for Rallos one</div></div><hr />

What AC should she be aiming for at level 65 tanking in BoT and Ldon's ? We will be trying PoV at 55</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Add some defensive AA's and decent hp to that and you should be able to get through hard ldons, too. Easy ldons you shouldn't need to worry about @ 65 in general with a 1/2 awake group.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I made a profile at 65 for BoT and she should havfe 1215 ac unbuffed. <br />
<br />
<br />
check that...<br />
<br />
 HP  4461/4461 <br />
AC  1217 <br />
<br />
With ND3 PE1 and PD3 That bumps her up to 5195hps... is that decent respectable for a non-raider non-serious player?</div></div><hr />

( prob considered kraptacular armor now )<br />
<br />
for the non raider; your aa's will help bump your toon up. but 5195 is a good base to work off of.</div></div><hr />

Going to try the Exe Trial in PoP for PoV access. Think this warrior will be able to do it? Have a 54 bard, 54 war, 54 rogue, 65 shaman, 65 cleric</div></div><hr />

Updated magelo with a WTB type thing. Do those look like good choices, any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

I think we're going to wait for prices to come down a bit from the craziness of OoW</div></div><hr />
