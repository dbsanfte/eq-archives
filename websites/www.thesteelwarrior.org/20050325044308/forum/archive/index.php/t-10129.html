<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing EQ2 since release, and while its a good game, I still have my memories from the WoW stress test which keep haunting me.<br />
<br />
How's the game coming along so far? I'm looking for opinions from active WoW players. This isn't the outhouse, so try and keep the EQ2 vs EQ vs WoW stuff to a minimum. I'm interesting in your like and dislikes about the game. so really, anything not specificly class related is game.<br />
<br />
I've had plenty of time to play EQ2, and while I tihnk its a good game, I remember my time in beta with WoW. Maybe it was just the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase, but I just remember that game kicking ass. I had similar hopes for EQ2, but the game changes so much post 20, that I'm not sure this is the game I want to play. For reference, heres a few things to keep in mind that I don't like about EQ2. I've played a hunter to 22 or so in beta, pre-talents and EQ2 and WoW play very similarly up to that point. I'm just wondering if WoW takes the same direction at the higher levels as EQ2 does.<br />
<br />
So, here's my biggests concerns with EQ2, mostly post level 20:<br />
<br />
1. Soloing is insanely difficult. Solo encounters are few, and the xp rewards are nearly non-existant. It was possible before to solo green and blue group encounters for nice, but not stellar xp, however they patched it so that a)group mobs are much more difficult and b) what was blue before (and a very tough battle mind you) is now green or grey.<br />
<br />
2. Quests aren't all that great, granted the xp is much better than EQ quest xp was, but you have to drag a full group along to complete even the easiest ones. Quests rarely use solo encounter mobs as objectives, even though they easily could. What happens is that the quest turns green before I am even able to complete it for lack of groups to drag along for the quest.<br />
<br />
3. There is essentially only 4 classes, so all the sub-classes kinda run together within the same archetype.<br />
<br />
4. You can't help other players without them giving up all rewards for the encounter. I can't even taunt a mob off a dying noob unless the break the encounter.<br />
<br />
5. Travel is a pain in the ass. I spend more time running from group to group than actually getting xp most days.<br />
<br />
6. I feel like I have to level up so I can do what i really want to do...quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that many of you haven't played EQ2 so you may not understand all that I was talking about, but really I'd just like to hear how the game is after you've gained a few levels. Does it change much after 20, 30, 40? I've been raiding, to try and garner some excitement out of EQ2, but I'm beginning to think that either I'm just in a really bad level range or the game is going in a dirrection that I don't agree with. I like to group, occasionally, but I can't stand being forced to. In EQ2 I have to be grouped for 90% of the quests that I've come across, and I've done over 175 different quests last I checked. Does soling change significantly in WoW as you level is up, is my main concern, though I would like to hear any of your opinions, good and bad, about the game right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing WoW since release, and I'm having a blast.  I'm trying to remember how I felt about EQ when it came out, and I think I've gotten more of a &quot;wow&quot; factor from WoW then I did with EQ.  (and I really liked EQ when it came out)<br />
<br />
My main character in WoW is a hunter (32), and I've also got a warlock (16) and mage (6).<br />
<br />
A few thoughts on WoW:<br />
<br />
1.  Xp is faster when soloing, although a fast group can do ok - especially in instanced dungeons.  <br />
<br />
2.  I haven't worried about xp...I have to much fun just playing the game and I know eventually I'll hit 60 and raiding and such.<br />
<br />
3.  I miss having a chat window for each person I'm talking to...on the whole, most people seem less chatty then in EQ.  (probably due to the next 2 points)<br />
<br />
4.  The pace of the game is much faster then EQ.  By faster I mean mobs spawn quickly so there is no such thing as camping.  Also, quests are generally small/short, so I go in, do the quest, then run back to the NPC to find out what they want next.  <br />
<br />
5.  Related to #4, there is almost no downtime for things like regenning hp and mana.  (as an example, on the Blizzard boards I read a post about a high level mage whining because it took 24 seconds to go from no to full mana  :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
6.  The quests are well thought out and tie into the lore of the game.  Also, it's pretty obvious what the quest giver wants, and roughly how to find it.  (although actually accomplishing the task can be difficult)<br />
<br />
7.  Very little death penalty - you lose a little time and some durability on items.  This makes me much more likely to experiment and see what I can do as opposed to being super cautious because if I die I lose 2 hours (or more  ;) ) of xp.<br />
<br />
8.  It's a new game and there is downtime as they work out the kinks.  I think they've extended the trial period by 3 or 4 days to compensate the players.  My total down time is probably less than 10 hours - of course this will vary significantly depending on when people like to play...I don't usually get in until 8 or 9 PM EST, and by then any issues are normally resolved.<br />
<br />
9.  I've also run into a few bugs (got a problem with stabled pets atm), but nothing I can't work around, and not significantly different from EQ today.<br />
<br />
10.  Travel is slower then with port stones in EQ, but I don't mind it because of the transport methods.  (boats, zeps, bats, wyverns)  Once you open up the flight paths, travel isn't really an issue - again, not for me because the method is very cool, and has a good immersion factor.<br />
<br />
11.  I can't define exactly why, but I like tradeskilling in WoW - and I hated it in EQ.  Maybe it's because I can make items that are generally as good or better then what I see as drops from mobs?<br />
<br />
If you liked beta, my recommendation is to give it shot...the first month is free, so you'd only be out the purchase price if you decide it's not for you...and you can get to higher levels in a month to see what that aspect of the game is like - if you want to concentrate on levelling (or just play one toon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW still rocks.  Im a 42 Human Warrior named Lore and Im kicking butt.<br />
<br />
1) Once you hit lvl 40, its just amazing.  You get a horse to travel around in, very fast and very awsome.  I got MS (Mortal Strike) which bumped up my dps a LOT.  I was able to take on same lvl elites solo.  We get plate armor, which is a huge increase of AC and stats.<br />
<br />
2) Tradeskills are nice, Im wearing a LOT of stuff that I made (Blacksmith).  The economy is good too, player made stuff is used a LOT.<br />
<br />
3) You can solo or group, up to you.  I usually only group for elite quests or instances, makes them a whole deal faster.<br />
<br />
4) Not sure how you are in PvP, but its awsome.  Ive been ganked a few times, have ganked others, its all in good fun.  As long as you dont take it personally, its very exciting and rewarding to kill the opposing faction.  I dont attack all the Horde I see, have actually saved some.<br />
<br />
5) Though Im about 18 lvls from the lvl cap, theres SOOO much more game I havn't seen and need to explore.  Once I finish that, they should have put in the Battlegrounds and other stuff like Hero classes.  <br />
<br />
All in all, its the best game Ive played in a long long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had plenty of time to play EQ2, and while I tihnk its a good game, I remember my time in beta with WoW.

<br />
Slam your head in the car door repeatedly like Homer did to Barney in that Simpsons episode for knowing full well that EQ2 was gonna suck, WoW was gonna be better, and still purchasing that fine product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's rather amusing to me is every single one of your eq2 concerns were concerns that I had in eq2's beta...and they have not gotten any better.<br />
<br />
My concerns for wow have not yet been proven true or false and even if they are true the game is just plain FUN...something eq2's creators forgot about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a level 45 Warrior in WOW currently.  And while much of what other people have said is true, I find that as a Warrior it is not as true for my character.<br />
<br />
1.  Soloing is doable, but fraught with difficulties.  Warriors miss enough that occassionally an even con will kick the crap out of me when normally I would own it.  While some classes can easily solo mobs that are two or three levels higher, as a Warrior I'm very much limited to no more than two levels higher and then with a fair amount of risk.  If I should get an add, usually I'm toast unless I have retaliation available and that's on a 30 minute timer.  And casters are a serious problem.  Shamans and Warlocks can put a serious hurt on me even when a level or two lower.<br />
<br />
2.  For the mount that a poster above was ranting about, I'll have to scrape together something like 100g, so I've been told.  And at 45 the most I've seen at one time is about 25g.  The constant need for gear upgrades and money spent on smithing means that getting that kind of gold together isn't going to happen for a level or two.  Meanwhile, unlike Paladins who basically just talk to an NPC at 40 to receive a mount or Warlocks who have a fairly easy quest to get a mount, I'm walking.   Which means just traveling from one place to another takes a pretty long time, particularly as places to hunt get further and further apart.<br />
<br />
3.  Down time is a problem with the Warrior class.  I'm basically bandaging or eating after every single battle when soloing, to regen health.  While it is far far better than EQ, that still means that I'm usually stuck in place unable to move for 10-30 seconds after every fight.  Previously I could bandage on the run so I could at least be moving, getting to safety, or scouting for my next target while I regened health.  But a recent patch has made it so that you have to be standing still to bandage, which causes me to stand around more.  Yes, it's better than EQ, no it's not as good as for say a hunter.  I play a 21 Hunter as well, and down time for him is perhaps every 5th or 6th mob, if that.<br />
<br />
4.  I can't fight elites solo.  Pretty much any elite that is still green it going to beat the crap out of me.  If they're 6 or so levels lower than me, I will probably win, but it's almost like fighting an even con.  And any closer in levels and the risk goes up significantly.  A 0 to -2 elite will own the crap out of me, period, end of story.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I pretty much endorse and agree with what most people have said about the game. It's an excellent game.  In many ways better than the EQ I remember.  And one that will probably hold my interest for a long long time.  I just hope they make a few adjustments to Warriors at some point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, I can usually solo elites up to a level below me or so as well, at level 42.  However, that being said, elites also have a wide range of cons.  Some elites are damn easy for their level, others are pretty difficult.  A good example of an easy elite was Besseleth the spider in Stonetalon Mtns.  She was 21 or 22 I think, I solod her at 20 and it was quite easy.  Now, at 42, there are some 36-37 ogre elites in Alterac Mtns, that I have a tough time fighting.  At the same time, there is a 42 tiger in Stranglethorn that isn't very difficult.  Same as before, undercons and overcons abound.<br />
<br />
For myself, when I'm tired of questing and such and just feel like some mindless grinding, I've found that the fastest route of exp is going after mobs 2-4 levels below me.  The reduced exp is more than made up for by the fact that I have no downtime.<br />

<br />
Obviously you're doing something I'm not.  Perhaps if you'd care to give some examples of the elites you're talking about.  Because I'm talking about things like the elite trolls in the highlands and the orcs in the alterac mountains.  What elites are you finding to be so easy and what tactics do you use that seem to make them so?  Because as it stands, elites beat the crap out of me.  So please, enlighten me.  I'm listening.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  I use the very &quot;1337&quot; strat of running up, yelling &quot;BOOO!!&quot;, and smacking the stuffing out of whatever.  Check first for nearby adds obviously, then just run up and do your thing.  For myself, I start with charge, then sunder armour till I have at least 3 in, then any debuffs/stuns I can use, depending on what's available and rage.  If I can I also use rend.  I always make sure all my self-buffs are ok and not going to run out (AC, sta, sta/spirit from food, agi, sharpening/weightstones on weps, etc).  By the time your HP hits the 60 percent mark, you'll know if you have a shot of beating the mob or not, and that's usually enough time to bail if you don't.<br />
<br />
Also, I like to take my healing potion early in the fight.  That way, if the fight drags on longer than you expected, and you get an add near the end, or shortly after, there's a good chance you'll be able to take another potion if needed, instead of getting whacked by an add because cooldown from taking a potion later in the fight hadn't expired yet.<br />

Do you find one does more damage than the other?  And are you specialized in protection or DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using duel wield or 2handed weapons?  Do you find one does more damage than the other?  And are you specialized in protection or DPS?<br />
<br />
I use a 2H weapon, not because I inherently think it's any better than dual-wield or 1H and shield, but simply because it's what I prefer, and as well because it was the best weapon setup I was able to find.  I used my talents to build what I considered to be a soloing warrior, as that's how I like to play.  The majority are in defensive, with the rest in arms, and none in fury. By that, I took any talent that I thought would help me to solo, as opposed to being in a group.  For example, I don't have the defensive talents to build agro while in def stance, or improved bloodrage, etc.<br />
<br />
-edit- I just logged in to note, and my talent build is; in Arms; Deflection 5/5, Improved Charge 1/2, Tactical Mastery 2/5.  In Defensive, it is; Anticipation 5/5, Shield Specialization 5/5, Toughness 5/5, Iron Will 4/5, Improved Revenge 3/3, Concussion Blow 1/1, and Improved Shield Bash 2/2.<br />
<br />
 Also, I just finished the mithril order quests for blacksmithing, and the reward for that is a trinket that summons a very nice purple/epic 1H mace, which lasts for 1 hour with a 3 hour cooldown.  As a result, I picked up a shield in the AH, and am going to be trying out that combo as well, to see how that compares to using the 2H'r.  On a side note... does anyone know of a way, using macros, to switch from a 2H weapon to 1H + shield?  I had read on a WoW board somewhere, where some guy had mentioned he could do this without the screwing around of equipping and un-equipping while fighting. However, I can't find the post where I read that anymore, and can't find any other info about that.<br />

<br />
that's all there is to it.  Going from 2h to dual wield or sword and board to dual wield is a little more involved, but not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And with the lastest patch any caster upto level +2 should be meat. I actaully perfer fighting casters (or warrior mobs :-/). For casters get into Beserker and heve pummel. Caster DPS sucks in melee and the have crappy armor. Just interrupt their casting with pummel (you should stop about 1/2 their spells). That makes casters toast.<br />
<br />
What is geting to me is the training cost. 42 got me 2 new skills at 3g92 EACH. <br />
<br />
And I ambegining to  find the need to really have a real cooking and fishing skill. Thought eating humaniods still helps.</div></div><hr />

8g doesn't bother me.  If you do instances, 8g comes fuckin quick as hell.<br />

For the horse, on the other hand, I need 85g in 2 levels..and I don't think that's gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had 14g at the end of the evening.  After making a run to Ironforge and doing 8 skill ups on blacksmithing, half with iron I had mined for myself, half I'd purchased from the auction house, and then buying the coal to smelt it all into iron, I ended up with 1g and some change, even after selling my made items back to the vendor.  I still need 5 more skill points just to be able to make the items for smithing armor specialization quest.  And I've already managed to scrape together 80 of the 120 mithril bars needed for the three quests from Galvin the Ancient that gets you the ornate mithril plans to be able to make the items required for the specialization quest.  So I have 40 mithril bars to go in the first quest, and a pretty significant number for the second quest, all of which get fed to NPCs.  Lovely.  And I wonder when I'll have gold enough for a horse.  Not until my 50s I imagine.<br />
<br />
On another topic.  I tried the elite named panther in Stranglethorn Vale tonight, solo.  I have 5 levels on him and he's green as can be.  He still nearly waxed me.  I charged in using a 38 DPS 2handed axe and used heroic blow fairly frequently, after a few sunder armors.  If I hadn't had retaliation as a fall back position, I would have undoubtedly been making a corpse run.  How other Warriors are defeating even or one lower elites with predictability, I have no idea.  I find it hard to imagine to be honest.  My Warrior has 2700+ AC unbuffed and 2500+ HP.  Most of my focus in skills has been in DPS, with only a little in fury and protection.  Perhaps that's my problem, I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all about choices really Glat.<br />
<br />
I just hit 38, went back to see what new skeelz I got.  For a sum of 2g7s each, I have Thunderclap, Slam and Pummel available.  Thunderclap I use fairly frequently, but I don't use it for damage, I use it for the slow and for aggro.  So 10 more damage to me isn't worth 2g.  Slam is utter fucking garbage, so I can save 2g there, and Pummel I just don't see the point to.  If I need to shut down casters, I defensive stance (for revenge stun), Concussion blow and shield bash..there's no point for me to be fighting casters in Zerker, so that's a waste of 2g too.  So right there, I saved myself 6g this morning.<br />
<br />
After making a run to Ironforge and doing 8 skill ups on blacksmithing, half with iron I had mined for myself, half I'd purchased from the auction house, <br />
<br />
See, this is something else I'd never do.  My smithing is 205 right now, has been since 36 I believe.  I've got shitloads of mithril, iron and heavy stones in the bank, and I've never bought a single bar..there's just no point.  Minerals are WAY too common to be spending ridiculous prices in the auction house for  them.  You can get a stack of iron bars in under a half an hour in some zones.  Save some cash, cut out the middle man, do it yourself.  Sure, might take more time..but what are we in a hurry for?<br />
<br />
And I've already managed to scrape together 80 of the 120 mithril bars needed for the three quests from Galvin the Ancient that gets you the ornate mithril plans to be able to make the items required for the specialization quest. <br />
<br />
Word around the campfire is that Armorsmithing is a fuckin joke currently.  Save the mithril and go for Weaponsmithing instead.  You make 8 weapons and tada...weaponsmith.  No 120 mithril bar bullshit.<br />
<br />
I have no idea. I find it hard to imagine to be honest. My Warrior has 2700+ AC unbuffed and 2500+ HP. <br />
<br />
You using 2h or shield?  Seems kinda low since I can foot 2700ac pretty easily with sword + board.  Takes longer to kill shit, but I end up with more health left over usually.<br />
<br />
Also, in an earlier post you mentioned the constant need for upgrades.  Not sure what you mean by that, but I'm hoping you're not buying them in the AH.  It's definitely not needed, especially if you're a smith.  The auctionhouse is pretty much the biggest joke in this game.  The Bazaar, it is not.</div></div><hr />

I'm helping to outfit my guild while I'm about it.  So yes, I could take longer and do it slower.  But I'm already 45.  I really don't want to be 50+ before I finish my specialization quest that I get at level 40.   And much of the gear I get as drops gets offered up to the guild first and to the auction house only after it's been rejected as not needed by guild mates.  So yeah, I run a little lean.  On the counter balance though I do get some help with minerals from some guild mates and occassionally something gets offered through the guild that's an upgrade for me.  Of course that isn't too frequent since I'm one of the top two or three highest level characters in the guild currently.<br />
<br />
And I've read that armor specialization isn't so hot right now.  But I had commited before I found that out.  And from what I gather you can't untrain one specialization and go train in the other because once you've made the choice, the other NPC won't have anything to do with you.  So I'm pretty much stuck on the course I've chosen.  The price of making what superficially looks like a good choice without complete information I guess.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, you could farm instances and sell those items and save up for your horse.  A guild buddy soloed one of the lower lvl instances and jsut sold everything he picked up.   He had his horse within 2-3 days.<br />
<br />
I had enough for my horse around lvl 35, mainly due to me selling blacksmith items.  Check the AH for plans from time to time and pick up the rare good ones.  If you are the only one making them, you can set your price.  For example, I went from selling Green Iron Haubarks to Jade serpent blades, and now Im on Mith Shield spikes.  When the materials cost 2-3 gold to make, and you sell them for 6-7 g each, it adds up fast.  You could effectively sit at the AH when you log on or log off and make a profit inbetween logging in and out of the game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the Ornate Mith gear is pretty awsome.  +% crit and +% dodge is pretty good as a berserk warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty far behind the curve.  Needless to say, I'm not the only one making anything, so the auction house ends up being a loss of deposit and a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Low level instances don't seem to be too useful either.  You just can't clear gold fast enough, at least the times I've done it.  2 or 3 gold from a full inventory isn't that great when the grey weapons that drop in SM and Arathi and such sell for 40-50s each.<br />
<br />
I'll probably just end up duoing SM with various people for a couple days, bust out the horse and grind on to 60.  And after seeing the ridiculous ingredients on the Truesilver BP and the pretty lame ass Truesilver gaunts, I think I'll be going Weaponsmith.  Well, that and the fact that I don't have to throw 120 mithril bars into the shitter too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sooo....back on topic  :p <br />
<br />
Vikken, I'd say that for the most part WoW is not plagued with any of those problems you mentioned.  I am playing a 38 Night Elf Druid and a 22 Human Mage.  I find the game insanely fun. <br />
<br />
1.  Soloing is always do-able and the experience is rewarding since people should always be mixing their soloing with their questing - even if the mobs don't garner a ton of exp, the end result of the quest likely will.   I can believe that soloing with a warrior class may be more difficult, but I don't think it would be along the lines of EQ2 solo difficulty (then again, keep in mind that the highest level character I got in EQ2 was lvl 7!).  I can tell you that some classes solo with far greater ease, but that has always been the case.  My druid solo's beautifully.  My boyfriend's paladin is a regular solo champion. I often see hunters and warlocks soloing.  <br />
<br />
2. Quests are fun, interesting, often rewarding, and often soloable.  I know that the quests tend to be the same (gather, kill, explore), but there are often twists put into them that make each interesting to me at least.  Personally, I love the explore ones or the ones where you have to click on world objects.  I'm not sure why I'm so tickled by that, but I am.  :p   Being able to solo quests is also great.  In a line of related quests, the last ones will probably require a partner or a group, but there is such a plethora of quests from all over the globe that you can complete solo ones any time you can't find a partner.  Also, I've noticed that as we gain levels folks in WoW are much keener on grouping up to complete quests (and the system really rewards grouping for quests since everyone can loot a peice on a named mob, for instance).  This makes it not painful both because you can easily fill your time with solo quests while waiting for a partner or group to come along and because you can complete the quest with the group relatively quickly.<br />
<br />
3.   The classes in WoW are unique, which is good, but there is no holy trinity (at least not by level 38).  At least three different classes can tank (Warrior, Paladin, and now with the direbear changes, Druid), at least two classes can heal (Priest and Druid, usually also Shaman and Paladin), several classes can CC (Druid, Mage, Priest, Hunter, Warlock, Rogue), and most all classes have some utility that differs from everyone else.  That said, I would have personally liked even more variety in class makeup...but what can ya do? <br />
<br />
4.  Having played beta I'm sure you already know that you can always help other players in this game and they would never lose the reward for the encounter unless you managed to &quot;help&quot; them before they attacked the mob.  <br />
<br />
5.  Travel...ahhh....I'm growing to hate travel in WoW.  My Druid can get around relatively fast because she has Cheetah form and she can bind near Stormwind, yet still get across to the other cont. fast since she can Teleport to Moonglade with rides to Auberdine.  Running around on my Mage is just painfully slow.  At 40 this all changes and I haven't personally had the money problems that others mention.  Since around level 30 I've hovered around 35gold, and I'm paying to train up Leatherworking on my druid and tailoring and enchanting (ug) on my Mage.   Then again, depending on the class you pick, you'll never have that problem anyway.  Warlocks and Paladins get a quest mount at 40, undead Mages also get that mount, Mages can teleport around by 40, Hunters get cheetah form for themselves and others by 40, Druids get cheeta form. <br />
<br />
<br />
So far WoW is going strong and I don't see the end coming any time soon.  I do wonder about the viabilty of high end play.  But you know what?  I and my friends are having a blast right now, which makes the present monthly fee more than worth it.</div></div><hr />

So I'm pretty much stuck on the course I've chosen.  The price of making what superficially looks like a good choice without complete information I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm in pretty much the same situation but I don't seem to be having money woes.  I'm THE highest level char in my guild by 11 levels atm and am 47, I've sold mabye 3-4 actual pieces of gear in the AH, and thats usually because its a piece that someone in my guild won't be able to use for 20+ levels.  I smith and was done with all 6 of the ornate quests by level 44, the three in STV by 42, I've always kept my smithing ahead of my level, often being able to make gear 2-3 levels before I can acutally use it.  I had my mount almost as soon as I made 40, I had to borrow 15g from a pally friend, but was able to pay it back in less than a day.  <br />
<br />
You must be fighting the wrong mobs and mining in the wrong places.  I've never once bought ore from the AH, in fact I've sold probably 4-5 stacks of iron, no mithril though since I use so much of it.  I'm getting close to having to buy Truesilver from the AH but thats only because I make gear for both myself and a pally friend without charging him, though HE'll probably eat some of the cost for the TS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some things I've done that mabye account for the difference in experience . . . <br />
<br />
I've never ever bought myself gear in the AH, all my gear is drop, quest, or smithed.  Gear changes so quickly in this game, it slows down around 40 but even then I'm changing pieces of gear fairly regularly, theres just no point in buying gear that you're most likely going to replace fairly soon.  Being a CB player probably helps some in this regard since I know where the good quests are, but thottbot has a pretty good system for looking up gear and finding out where it comes from.<br />
<br />
I dedicate time to JUST mining, I have several different spots that I can go to mine mithril and iron before that, SoS is great for iron, theres 3-4 different deposits you can hit within small distance of each other, mithril has similar spots as well.  Also in this vein, don't pass veins by, even though the only things I make with iron anymore are counterwieghts and an occational shield spike, I always stop for iron veins, I can either use it to make gear for guildies or if I get too much sell it at the AH for 3g a stack.  The only minerals I skip are copper and silver.<br />
<br />
Finally if I'm going to grind I always kill humanoids, humanoids drop the most straight cash and cash items such as vendor trash and green gear, also alot of humanoid areas tend to have chests these can yeild cash items as well.  If you're in your 40's the humanoids in Tanaris are great for this, Wastewanders and the pirates all drop cash, vendor trash, and mageweave fairly often, as well as the occational green item and there are usually 2-3 chests spread between these two areas unless they're heavily camped at the time.  If you're still needing cash for a mount, several days of slaughtering these mobs should make you the money you need fairly easily.<br />

I doubt any of us are on the same server so we shouldn't really run into eachother.  I know the higher you go, the more plentyful ore gets.<br />
<br />
When I was talking about instances, I was refering to the lower lvl ones.  If you are lvl 40+, doing the Stockages should yield some pretty fast returns.  You could solo thru there in no time, get out of the instance, sell your warez, then run back in (you have to reset it though).  SM is a bit higher than normal and takes a little more time to clear.  Were going for cash here, not exp.<br />
<br />
Also if you know any paladin friends, they should have plenty of cash to spare.  They get free mounts so they don't need to spend 90 g on the training or the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a level 45 Warrior in WOW currently.  And while much of what other people have said is true, I find that as a Warrior it is not as true for my character.<br />
<br />
1.  Soloing is doable, but fraught with difficulties.  Warriors miss enough that occassionally an even con will kick the crap out of me when normally I would own it.  While some classes can easily solo mobs that are two or three levels higher, as a Warrior I'm very much limited to no more than two levels higher and then with a fair amount of risk.  If I should get an add, usually I'm toast unless I have retaliation available and that's on a 30 minute timer.  And casters are a serious problem.  Shamans and Warlocks can put a serious hurt on me even when a level or two lower.<br />
<br />
All melees suffer from the miss rate problem when dual wielding, as a warrior go 2h its just plain better.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  For the mount that a poster above was ranting about, I'll have to scrape together something like 100g, so I've been told.  And at 45 the most I've seen at one time is about 25g.  The constant need for gear upgrades and money spent on smithing means that getting that kind of gold together isn't going to happen for a level or two.  Meanwhile, unlike Paladins who basically just talk to an NPC at 40 to receive a mount or Warlocks who have a fairly easy quest to get a mount, I'm walking.   Which means just traveling from one place to another takes a pretty long time, particularly as places to hunt get further and further apart.<br />
<br />
Don't spend so much money on professions, etc.  Honestly there's no need!  I broke 100g at level 33 or 34 *solely* from skinning and selling everything I skinned.  After you hit 40 and get a mount its fast and easy to gather enough mats to skill up a real profession so don't bother with smithing until after you have your mount.  Also don't spend lots of cash on items, be a bit frugal and its easy to get the 100g.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  I can't fight elites solo.  <br />
<br />
You're not supposed to. :)</div></div><hr />

I did that to SFK a few levels ago and just wasn't bringing home a whole lot of cash out of it.<br />

You're not supposed to. :)<br />
<br />
Well mabye you're not supposed to, but given the right talents you can solo elite casters.  At 43 I could solo the lvl43-44 elite troll casters in Tanaris.  I run a defensive talent build (http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=9979) most importantly with 40% Stun Revenge and Concussion Blow.  I start with charge and use the rage to shield bash the first cast, then I dump any extra I have and switch to defensive, I use Concussion blow to stun away the first cast I can't Shield Bash away, then using Revenge as much as possible sometimes forcing it with a Shield Block if I'm having a bad run, with all that I mabye take 2-3 nukes max and finish the fight with anywhere from half health to almost dead, but its doable.<br />
<br />
Don't spend so much money on professions, etc. Honestly there's no need!<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly, the only money I've spent on smithing is one or two dropped plans I really wanted and a few pearls for armor/weapons I was making for myself.<br />
<br />
Any hints on where to get mithril, truesilver, or thorium? I doubt any of us are on the same server so we shouldn't really run into eachother.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there are probably lots of people that read here but don't post, I already have enough competiton in my regular spots as it is, if they become common knowledge it'll just get worse.  I WILL say that the best way to find these is to look for out of the way places even in regularly populated zones, especially areas that are rocky/craggy, this generally doesn't include caves since those are usually well known.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So for a few questions of my own, what level and where are SFK and Wailing Caverns?  and does anyone know how tearing through these lower level instances compares to killing humanoids a little lower level than you in open areas such as Tanaris?</div></div><hr />

Shadow Fang Keep is in Silver Pine Forest, far west side.  It's level 22-28 elites<br />
Wailing Caverns is in Barrens, really pretty place near the Oasis. Same level as SFK.<br />
<br />
Reason I like instances &gt; &quot;killing humanoids a little lower level than you in open areas such as Tanaris&quot; is no other people.  Jump out of instance, re do it, go at it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tried this shit out this morning, and we disagree.<br />
<br />
Shaman netted 2g with a full inventory out of WC.  I did SFK and netted 2.5g.  Took me about an hour to plow thru SFK and fill up my inventory.  Some simple math on the 70g I need for my horse = 28 hours of farming.  No fuckin thanks.<br />
<br />
In an hour and a half in Arathi I made almost half a level and gained 1.9g.  I'm not seeing how it can pay to farm low level instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally broke down and bought WoW. I'm reminded how much I hate low level characters. Good news is that I can't decided what I like to play more. I'm mostly jumping around checking different servers and class/race combos until I get something that I like. Current lead character is a Human rogue. I've rolled a hunter and warrior as well. Warriors are fucking awesome at low levels, you almost have to try be trying to die. Hunter hasn't changed much since beta. I never played a rogue in any game before, but the stealth really fits my exploration style, although at times I do find myslef fighting my way in  somewhere when I could just be stealthed. Old habits dye hard I guess.<br />
<br />
I started with a druid in EQ and a warlock in wow, and mostly caster types in other games, but I don't like being so frail, so i don't think I'll go that dirrection. but really it comes down to soloing, Are rogues still the solo machines they were in beta? Its seems like every level that my rogue makes his dps gets better and better. At 10, most mobs even 2 or 3 levels above, don't last more than a few seconds.<br />
<br />
So what, in your guys opinions, is the best soloing classes. I know hunters can solo, but I don't think Bow dps, even with the pet, keeps up to rogues at higher levels. At least that was my impression from beta.<br />
<br />
Any good servers I should check out. I'm not big into PvP, but I'm willing to try most anything once.</div></div><hr />

Despite the issues folks have with the class I'm having a blast.  The nature of the game hasn't really changed as I level, although of course you do start to encounter harder mobs, different boss fights in instances that require different strategies etc.   There are still great quests, some I can do solo, some I can't.  Tradeskills are fun as you can actually make stuff you'll use!  I can solo easily, although Warriors are not the best soloers we do really well imo.  Dunno.  Not having any of the issues getting up in levels in WoW as you seem to be detailing out in EQ2.  That being said there's still a TON for me to see, and a lot of the battelgrounds and high end raid content has not been put in the game yet.  So only the future will tell, but at least from 1-44 its been a great game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After being a bluebie EQ player since last century and getting beaten in duels by every other class, it just took me 5 minutes reading the manual to decide that I want to play a warrior on a PvP server. Unlike the hell holes that were the EQ PvP servers, WoW PvP is very amazing and tons more interesting than EQ PvE could ever be. I can go on saying how exciting WoW is, but I'll summarize a few things I like about the game.<br />
<br />
Btw, my warrior is a level 33 on Crushridge server, Tradeskill = alchemy, herbalism. Secondary skills = Cooking, First Aid.<br />
<br />
Things I like about this game.<br />
<br />
- No &quot;Loading please wait&quot; screens (YAY!) .. I can traverse the whole world without having to see that again and again and again.<br />
<br />
- The phat lootz! I have never really grouped for exp grinds or quests (except for elite quests) and I have managed to acquire a rare 2hander and other single weapons, three rare armor pieces etc. Really, I say good riddance to the 8 hour long raids and all the DKP hording bs. I have savings worth 20 gold right now, and i think thats quite good for a level 33 warrior who has been constantly upgrading and learning skills from trainers.<br />
<br />
- No mob/rare spawn/named camping. You can get uncommon (green) and rare (blue) items from what we called 'trash' in EQ. It seems to be random.<br />
<br />
- The ability to solo creatures that are two levels higher than me. And elite creatures that are green. I almost soloed one of the elite quests in stockades when I found a group and did all stockade quests with them. I have soloed almost all the way to lvl 33 except some occasional groups with friends, and beaten many a horde players in alone or grouped scenarios.<br />
<br />
- Tradeskills are actually useful. The breastplate i'm wearing is rare and was made by a player blacksmith. I can make heal potions and +armor +stats potions that are useful. I make good money selling greater heal potions and elixirs of defense.<br />
<br />
- Health regen is very useful so far. My gear gives me lots of +Spirit (like 75) and I regen in a few seconds, just enough to get ready for the next kill. I rarely use food/bandages.<br />
<br />
- Tradeskill and quest items are easy to acquire. If you have group mates and they are doing the same quest everyone gets the quest item drop independantly, you dont have to wait.<br />
<br />
- Quests are fun and good xp. The best way to level and acquire actually useful rewards. Unlike EQ where you have to wait months for a quest, gather raids, spend days camping the rare spawn, or like the belt of the four winds quest that almost all of us could never complete. I have soloed every single quest uptil now except elite quests.<br />
<br />
- No need for CR's or other players to rez you, every zone has a GY where your ghost will spawn. You run back to your corpse and click 'Resurrect' .. lol. No exp/gold penalty. Infact you get exp bonus everytime you spemnd time logged off from the game.<br />
<br />
- No more exp grinding or mindless hacking at creatures for hours. You can play when you want and as much as you want without having to spend hours putting a group together and all that bs.<br />
<br />
- The sound effects are cool, the music. In EQ I always had music off and had mp3's running. When I'm in Duskwood I don't wana miss the spooky ambient environment. ;)<br />
<br />
- The graphics are great and the game runs smooth on my 2 year old computer and a 56k connection. My guild tabard is amazing. :)<br />
<br />
- PvP is actually good. No penalties for dying, no one can grief / corpse camp you since your ghost can just come hide somewhere near and click rez from afar, or alternatively, you can take a rez at the GY. If you're deep in enemy territory you can take rez and gate out. Your opposing side cant send you tells, cant say anything bad to you because what they say appears in a different language. You can however, learn each others languages by knowing what those words mean, if you're that crazy. I just yell 'kek' when i kill in pvp, kek = lol in orcish.<br />
<br />
- The combat system is good. Use of abilities like overpower, execute, retaliate, battle shouts, heroic strike, its cool. You can get a lot more improvement from just talents than all the AA's from all EQ expansions combined. I like the range of choices in everything.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to put it short, everything we disliked in EQ is non-existent in WoW. I haven't played EQ2 and a friend bought it, but me and everyone else who used to play EQ refused to buy EQ2, due to our experience with EQ1. And after reading the original poster's comments, it makes me sure I made the right choice afterall.<br />
<br />
There is currently only 1 problem with WoW though, and its very irritating. That is the Blizzard Downloader that will run for the whole night just to download 20 mb worth of patch data, because it used peer to peer and i think its seriously broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an hour and a half in Arathi I made almost half a level and gained 1.9g.  I'm not seeing how it can pay to farm low level instances.<br />
<br />
AH the items instead of vendoring them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AH the items instead of vendoring them. <br />
<br />
It hasn't netted good results for me.<br />
<br />
The only things that I personally would consider using out of an instance are bind on pickup.  The rest of just is seriously..just fuckin trash.  On top of that, I've had absolute piss poor luck getting any results out of the auction house, and I just end up losing deposits.  Clearly it's not because the price is too high, because people tell you what they want to pay and you sell it to them.<br />
<br />
The auction system in my opinion is a piss poor excuse for the bazaar in EQ.  It requires a lot less lag, and doesn't require you to be online, but the results and the cost to do so, are far inferior.<br />
<br />
Edit : Just logged in and the 30.2 dps 2h I found yesterday was happily returned to me in my mailbox.  I think I'm 1 for 8 now on AH shit.  Fuck that game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AH is difficult to judge regarding what will and won't sell.  Basically it takes some knowledge of what's pretty commonly available at that level range and what is somewhat hard to acquire or better than average.  If it's common, it's vendor trash for sure.  If I check the AH and there are already half a dozen of them on sale, typically it's not worth my time.  If it's hard to acquire it might be worth trying to AH it, once.  Only if it's a blue or purple item are you almost certain to have a sale.<br />
<br />
And as you go up there will be more of a market, because people aren't leveling as fast and therefore they're changing gear within their range more frequently.  If I'm going to go from level 20 to 25 in two or three days, I'm not likely to worry too much about upgrading my gear a lot in that time frame.  I might make a change at level 20 and then another at level 25, but not much in between.  If I'm going from 50 to 51 in that same time period, I'll start paying more attention to my gear.  I think most people are like that.<br />
<br />
Also people need to put buy out prices on their items.  In 8 hours a lot can happen.  And I don't know about you, but I'm not particularly inclinded to want to camp the AH waiting to out bid any of my competition.  Nor am I inclinded to want to have to interrupt what other things I may be doing to pop over to the AH and up my bids.  Many times if there is a buy out price and the current bid isn't too much under that, I'll just pay the buy out price, because it saves me time and annoyance.  People who expect to just have bid prices are probably in for a rude shock, not everyone is interested in bidding.<br />
<br />
However, overall I agree with Haass, the AH can be a huge money sink with very little return, if you're not very careful about what you bother to try selling.  I made that mistake early on and learned from it.  Either vendor the trash or give it to a guild enchanter for disenchanting, you're better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the AH the first time for the elemental (whatever) I've piled up from killing elementals.  I set the price at the default and the buyout at either 2 or 3X the default prize.  Managed to sell 2 elemental earth, and the 19 elemental water and 7 elemental air were no go.  Though one nice thing is that I can now store the extra stuff in my mailbox from a failed auction for 30 days.<br />
<br />
Obviously one example don't prove anything but I don't really see AH as a useful way to unload what you got.  I seriously doubt you'll be able to make much, if any, out of some generic X's whatever of the Y.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you put something up in the AH ask yourself, if I were such and such level how much would I likely spend on this item?<br />
<br />
I usually only sell about 1 in 3 items I put up for sale.  The things that don't sell I just eat the deposit and vendor.  However, the money I make by reselling that one in three items easily offsets the deposit lost on the items that don't sell.  Yesterday I sold a level 30ish green 2H sword for about 1.5g, would have sold to a vendor for maybe 60s.  Blue stuff goes for bucks in the AH.  I sold a blue 2H level 30 hammer for 3g.<br />
<br />
Oh, and be sure to search on the item you are selling first.  If there are any like it, set your minimum bid below the other item.  Also don't set your buyout so high, make it about 50-75% over your minimum bid or higher if it's a blue item.  Don't expect to make a lot on green items...  but you can sell at a higher price than you'd get from a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I have to ask myself whether I'd buy something like that before putting AH I'd never put anything in the AH.  I decided to give AH a shot hoping I was wrong.<br />
<br />
If I'm going to just sell it for 1.5X vendor cost it doesn't seem like it's worth the trip (time moving = time could've been spent getting $) and I think you get charged 10% desposit fee too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can earn more money than you'll get by vendoring on many items. Unlikely that you'll get filthy rich, but more is more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found the AH useful tradeskill items but thats about it.  I'm gonna out level any gear I buy at this point anyway and the real good loots gonna be (hopefully) bind on equip from top end bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does AH take your deposit whether or not the sale was successful?  If it does, it'd seem like if you misjudge and put a reasonably expensive item on AH and it didn't sell, the deposit alone would set you back more than the money you could make via AH from other sales.<br />
<br />
Seems like too much to second-guess the market especially since the market does some pretty strange things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the deposit is generally very low, especially if you don't auction an item for more than 8 hours. really selling for 24 hours hasn't helped or hurt my sales over the other two time options.</div></div><hr />

Quick easy way to avoid trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah has been really hit or miss for me too.  Some things have sold well, but I've had a whole string of things returned to me which I then just vendored and so made less money on.  I did notice that the Heavy Mithril Breastplate which I skill up smithing with, sells decently.  I put two up, got two sales.  But I also put a buyout on them, and priced them very competitively vs. the market, so that could also be why.  I also agree about asking yourself if you'd use the item.  Some items, such as chain that's tailored to Pallys/Warriors but is like level requirement 39+, and I know there's better plate out there, I won't even bother auctioning.  Same with weapons.  If I get a drop but I know that other better weapons are easily attainable, I'll just vendor it.  18 gold away from a horse now at level 45!  Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haas, always set a buyout and lowball the price.  Some stuff won't sell, for example post 40 mail just won't sell on alliance (only hunters can use as war/pallys have gone plate)...high agi leather gear will always sell to rogues, etc, etc.  If the item's uber I may double the default price, if its good I set it at 50% over default price and otherwise I just vendor it.  The key is use buyouts though, selling through auction is a waste of time and money.<br />
<br />
And yes the AH was designed by a retarded gerbil, someone needs to be fired over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it's common sense to use buyouts, that's why I haven't mentioned it, and have gotten the advice to use them.  Trust me, all my shit has a buyout because I see clearly how annoying it is without one, and it still hasn't improved anything.  I don't place them at ridiculous levels either, so I dunno...</div></div><hr />

I broke 100g at level 33 or 34 and had almost 50g left when I bought my mount at level 40.</div></div><hr />

I had read on a WoW board somewhere, where some guy had mentioned he could do this without the screwing around of equipping and un-equipping while fighting.<br />
<br />
exemple : we keep the first two slot of the 4th bag free for switching weapons<br />
<br />
going from 2Her to 1Her + Shield<br />
/script PickupInventoryItem(16); <br />
/script PickupContainerItem(4,1); <br />
/script UseContainerItem(4,2); <br />
<br />
going from 1Her + Shield to 2Her<br />
/script PickupInventoryItem(17); <br />
/script PickupContainerItem(4,2); <br />
/script UseContainerItem(4,1); <br />

note : cosmos adds newmacro such as /stance [#] (#=1/2/3 for Battle/Deff/Berzerk) that can be added at the end of the weapon switch.</div></div><hr />

Check the census:  WoW census (http://www.wowcensus.com/realm_stats.php?realm=hellscream)<br />
<br />
Horde outnumber Alliance 10 to 8 (or 5/4) on your server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the census:  WoW census (http://www.wowcensus.com/realm_stats.php?realm=hellscream)<br />
<br />

<br />
Any idea how accurate that data is?  The reason I ask is it shows close to 1 million subscribers...which seems high.  (or does that include European beta testers?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are about 1 million characters, not accounts.<br />
<br />
Consider even FF11 has 2.5 characters on average in Japan and it costs $1 for each character beyond the first one, it's not exactly a stretch to assume the average player has at least 2 characters.  Now obviously wowcenseus isn't able to capture every player in WoW but 500K subscribers seems like a reasonable guess based on the # of observed players.<br />
<br />
From what I know WoWcensus simply does a ton of /who (since /who is limited at 49) to cover the entire server (e.g. /w 1 troll shaman and so on) whenever someone runs it and then updates the people it pulls to the database, adding any new person it sees.  This won't get everyone on the server, obviously, but there's no reason to believe that the alliance just happens to be all on whenever anyone runs WoWcensus so the alliance to horde ratio should be pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />

Wow.  Interesting information, if correct.  From my own anecdotal experience, I'd certainly concur that hunters far far outnumber paladins on the Alliance side.</div></div><hr />

It seems they tally their population via cosmos.  The UI program Cosmos sends them data and it counts alts as well.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is wrong.  The census just runs a /who script.  It'd be stupid to do anything else to determine the number of players.</div></div><hr />
