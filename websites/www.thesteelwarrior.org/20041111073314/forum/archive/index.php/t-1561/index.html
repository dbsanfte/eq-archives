<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackbelly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker and have learned TONS from the people here - so first, I want to say &quot;thank you&quot; to everyone for all the help in making Blackbelly the warrior that he is today.<br />
<br />
Just as an idea to fix taunt, what if SoE replaced the &quot;Taunt&quot; button for warriors with an &quot;Engage&quot; button.  Same refresh timer and everything, just a different, warrior only, skill.  Engage would be successful in putting the warrior on the top of the Hate list say 80-90% of the time.  The downside is that warriors could only &quot;Engage&quot; one target at a time - meaning that the warrior couldn't just hit engage on all the mobs that come into the camp and let everyone else just AE the mobs (AE slows, AE nukes, etc.) - so when fighting mutliple targets everyone would still have to stay on their toes and watch things like healing aggro, proximity aggro, etc.<br />
<br />
I understand that SoE doesn't want to trivialize end-game encounters, but if they can make mobs immune to charm and mezz surely they could make mobs immune to &quot;Engaging&quot;.<br />
<br />
This would fix a number of things, firstly it helps with the DPS issue - instead of having to get weapons that proc &quot;aggro&quot; generation spells we could get weapons that are great for DPS (Fleshgrinder, SoD, etc.).  <br />
<br />
Secondly, it makes warriors a viable group member again - we can lock down mobs and kep them on us the whole fight, that combined with the impressive DPS that we can add to a group now that we don't have to lug around Aggro Generation weapons anymore should really help us out.<br />
<br />
Alright, well, that's my idea - please rip it to ribbons. ;) <br />

You mean couldn't, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok, and what exactly does this change from the taunt skill?<br />
<br />
or just a higher success rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seems like just a higher rate, yes. In my opinion, as long as knights have spells, we won't have their snap agro. So I say just beef up the warrior's defensive capabilities naturally, not through AA or Gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the major problem is exp groups...<br />
<br />
unless we increase warrior defense by ALOT.. ie, virtually able to solo xp mobs in tier 2-3, our inability to snap aggro will still make us undesireable compared to knights...<br />
<br />
increasing defensive abilty helps us most in solo/raid encounters. Only by giving us great utility or snap aggro will it help us in exp groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackbelly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok, and what exactly does this change from the taunt skill?<br />
<br />
<br />
With Taunt, when successful, you are moved to the top of the aggro list.  With &quot;Engage&quot; you are always the highest aggro on the list - regardless of what anyone else does.  Enchanters can tash, slow, cripple, stick their tongues out at the mob and then have a seat at BADGUY_01's feet - but as long as the warrior is engaged the mob doesn't move.<br />
<br />
IMO, warriors don't need snap aggro - that's what knights and paladins are for; something goes bad there need to be someone who can instantly get aggro.  It appears that SoE wants those people to be Knight classes.<br />
<br />
I also have a question:<br />
<br />
<br />
unless we increase warrior defense by ALOT...<br />
<br />
<br />
Why can't we increase warrior defense by a little bit, but also increase our offense by a bit.  The end result being that we're a better class - though nothing too extreme gets done.<br />
