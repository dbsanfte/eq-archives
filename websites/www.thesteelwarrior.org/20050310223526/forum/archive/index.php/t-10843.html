Ive seen it many times being military but figured my Brothers/Sisters here might get a kick out of it...<br />

<br />
MURPHY'S LAWS OF COMBAT<br />
<br />
1.   You are not a Superman<br />
2.   If it's stupid but works, it isn't stupid<br />
3.   When in doubt, empty your magazine<br />
4.   Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than you<br />
5.   Never draw fire, it irritates everyone around you<br />
6.   Never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder<br />
7.   If your attack is going really well, it's an ambush<br />
8.   No plan survives the first contact intact<br />
9.   Don't look conspicuous - it draws fire  (This is why aircraft carriers are called &quot;bomb magnets&quot;)<br />
10.  If you can't remember, the claymore is pointed toward you<br />
11.  Try to look unimportant - they may be low on ammo<br />
12.  All five second grenade fuses will burn down in three seconds<br />
13.  If you are forward of your position, the artillery will fall short<br />
14.  The enemy diversion you are ignoring is the main attack<br />
15.  Recoilless rifles -aren't<br />
16.  Suppressive fire - won't<br />
17.  Friendly fire - isn't<br />
18.  If the enemy is in range, SO ARE YOU!<br />
19.  The important things are always simple<br />
20.  The simple things are always hard<br />
21.  The easy way is always mined<br />
22.  If you are short of everything except enemy, you are in combat<br />
23.  When you have secured an area, don't forget to tell the enemy<br />
24.  Anything you do can get you shot, including doing nothing<br />
25.  Teamwork is essential, it gives them other people to shoot at<br />
26.  Make it too tough for the enemy to get in and you can't get out<br />
27.  Incoming fire has the right of way<br />
28.  No combat-ready unit has ever passed inspection<br />
29.  No inspection-ready unit has ever passed combat<br />
30.  Ambushes never draw the enemy, NDPs do<br />
31.  Tracers work both ways<br />
32.  Beer math is:  two beers times 37 men equals 49 cases<br />
33.  Body count math is: two guerrillas plus one portable plus two pigs equals 37 enemy killed in action<br />
34.  The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire<br />
35.  If you take more than your fair share of objectives, you will have more than your fair share of objectives to take  (precedent generates expectations)<br />
36.  Radios will fail as soon as you need fire support desperately<br />
37.  When both sides are convinced that they are about to lose, they're both right<br />
38.  All-weather air support does not work in bad weather<br />
39.  The bursting radius of a hand-grenade is always one foot greater than your jumping range<br />
40.  The only terrain you actually control is the terrain covered by your two feet<br />
41.  Man-portable designated equipment never says how many men<br />
42.  The law of the bayonet says the man with the bullet wins<br />
43.  REMFs are everywhere<br />
44.  Precision bombing is normally accurate within plus or minus one mile<br />
45.  Professional soldiers are predictable, but the world is full of amateurs<br />
46.  The best tank killer is another tank; therefore, tanks are always fighting each other and have no time to fight the war<br />
47.  Murphy was a grunt</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehee...forget Im posting with a bunch of civilians.  NDP = Night Defensive Position.  Basically a semi-fortified bivouac for a patrol.<br />
<br />
REMF, has been de-coded.   :D  Basically it is an insult for a HQ soldier.  Someone who never goes forward or has never heard a shot fired in anger.<br />
<br />
My favorite is &quot;If the enemy is in range, so are you.&quot;...also another favorite, though not listed is, &quot;Tracers work both ways&quot;.</div></div><hr />
