<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any info on how to Mauradon to share?<br />
Whats this staff/key quest to do?<br />
<br />
There are 3 &quot;entrances&quot; into Mauradon.  Two are actually &quot;zone lines&quot;, the third is used by obtaining the staff.<br />
<br />
The two &quot;zone line&quot; ones are in the Purple and Orange(?) caves.  Each side leads into a different section of Mauradon, but they eventually connect in the middle.  There are a couple of bosses in each section which are needed to make the staff/key.  Once you have that, you can head to the area where they connect and head to another boss (Celebras) who you need to kill, but who will then give you the Staff.  Past the waterfalls behind him is the &quot;harder&quot; part of Maraudon, with a bunch of other areas and bosses to slay.<br />
<br />
Once you have the Staff, you can go to the little alter behind the first Kahn (Kolk?) and use it, which will open a portal to the area just past the waterfalls.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Any bosses have any special trick/difficulty to watch for?<br />
<br />
Any particular need for certain classes/skills to succeed?<br />
<br />
Any potions/items best to stock up specifically on before entering?</div></div><hr />

RE: Princess<br />
<br />
Have Nature Resistance Potions for anyone who needs to be in melee range fighting her.  Have your Hunter use Aspect of the Wild (sp?) for the +45 or so nature resistance.<br />
<br />
RE:  Patrols<br />
<br />
Have a Mage handy to AE all the lil trash mobs that spawn out of the larger stones.  Also Patrols may wander into rooms where you are fighting 4+ mobs already, so keep an eye out.</div></div><hr />

I have the gems from 1,2,3,5, and have seen all of them in the same areas in various groups, but I have not seen the fourth. As a 53 warlock, I'm pretty much done with Maraudon aside from princess runs, so I'd like to finish the Patriarch's Instructions quest off asap.<br />
<br />
Basically, I just need to know if Maraudos is in the orange, purple, or any other section.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

Any significant difference with the patch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lanslide now can throw you(as he always could) except now, there is a good chance you'll get bugged and won't be able to move afterward.  Happened to 3 out of the 4 folks in my party last night.  We were caster heavy, and the warlock got aggro and was smart enough to move the mob over to me once I stated I couldn't move(luckily the bug din't effect him), so I regained aggro and we got the kill pretty easily, but it ended our run before we could drop her.   As neitehr me, the preist nor the mage could move from where we landed after teh knockback.  Also,  there was no effect shown in my buff bar that would account for it<br />
<br />
Since she has a similiar effect she can proc, I'm guessing the bug may resurface with her as well.  So, either there is a new root aspect to the knock back, and the interface is bugged to not show it, or the effect it's self is bugged.<br />
<br />
<br />
I waited for about 5 min before stoning out, and never did regain the ability to walk.  So I doubt it's a legitimate effect.</div></div><hr />

A guy in one of Justar's instances used a growth potion, grew, and then couldn't move.  He was summoned across the room and still couldn't move.  Camping out fixed the problem.  Might recommend that if you have the issue again.  Definitely sounds like a nasty bug.</div></div><hr />

Warlock summoned me but still couldn't move.  I had to camp out and come back before it would work again.  I could jump, sit, and spin around, but not move from my position at all.   Sounds like a strange bug.</div></div><hr />
