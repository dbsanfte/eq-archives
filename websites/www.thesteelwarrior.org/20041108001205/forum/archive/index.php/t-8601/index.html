<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melanii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I've been a frequent reader of this forum for a long time, but have never posted to it. The reason being, the questions I want to ask have usually been asked by others before me and in most cases have also been answered.<br />
<br />
On this occassion I haven't been able to find an answer to my question and am now seeking the wisdom of others.<br />
<br />
I play a Female Barbarian Warrior on The Rathe and have a full set of Kizrak's Armor (i.e. Ornate Plate Armor). Why is it that Female Barbarian Warriors don't look like their Male counterparts? Females look like they are wearing Chain Armor, whilst Males look like they are wearing Plate Armor.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm pretty sure it's not just my PC or installation of EQ. When I am just standing in POK chatting to friends I frequently receive /tells from other players who want to donate PP in exchange Shaman buffs. This can get really annoying!!  :mad: I use a Greatstaff of the Four Winds which doesn't help matters.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed any light on this difference? Is there anyway to change this? Does anyone know if the models are going to be updated as part of the forthcoming graphics engine upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Due to my graphic limitations, I dont have Barb models turned on, but, did you try equipping other Plate armor and see if the graphic changes?. If so, maybe its a problem with Kizrak's graphics and Barb females. If not, could your graphics files be corrupted?.<br />
<br />
Im not sure which exactly are the graphic files Im afraid, but at the EQ Tech forums, there's a thread about missing/corrupted armor.<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=26978<br />
Thats the link :)<br />
<br />
I would try deleting the EQDX9 DLL on the EQ folder and maybe your EQGAME.EXE (in case you suspect files are corrupted) and they will get repatched.<br />
<br />
Also, I downloaded last week the last Nvidia drivers (61.77? cant remember) and they were acting awkwards with EQ, with missing armor and messed up dyes, and I had to downgrade to their prior drivers, just to toss up some more info that can be useful :).</div></div><hr />

I still miss the awesome look of the old engin Steel Plate BP with its gold inlay.</div></div><hr />

What?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kokonut Pye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Barbarian female plate BPs sort of look like chain...but you look like a shaman because you're wielding a staff, and Vindi BP (plate graphic) is a very popular Shaman breastplate that's usually used for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Melanii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A big thank you to those people who replied. Now that I know a plate breastplate is supposed to look different on a female barbarian warrior I'll stop looking for the cause of the visual difference. Oh, and by the way, the difference probably also applies to ornate plate boots because they look dofferent too.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to equal opportunity?? I hope SOE creates new models (no bugz please) and includes them in any future graphics upgrade. I'd like to think that my warrior could wear a proper looking breastplate and boots, not some pansy looking alternative. If I had wanted to look like that I would have worn chain-mail.</div></div><hr />

Why? According to your magelo, if it is anything near updated. You almost have a full suit of armour with plate graphics.  I have a full suit of plate and it always appears as plate :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Next topic... why are kylong shinguards chain graphic? My Barb is full plate (minus helm graphic) except his pants look like freaking leather (I'm tinted orange).  And my ogre SK looks like a hooker in fishnets (tinted black).  They REALLY need to do some graphic changes to certain items... I feel like a ranger =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For a certain percentage of beggers, it really doesn't matter what you look like.<br />
I've been asked for SoW and heals many many times--while holding two weapons and wearing plate armor (w/plate graphics).<br />
Twice--yes, twice--I've been asked if I would give my mainhand weapon away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For a certain percentage of beggers, it really doesn't matter what you look like.<br />
<br />
Ya, and that percentage is 100.<br />
<br />
I hate tards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never understood why a plate only piece of armor looked like chain :p and Half Elves's chain looks Zebra like... it was hell in guild chat :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You could be a troll wearing full plate, with a skelly pet, and a huge fricking sword and still get asked for ports. Beggars are idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its not up to date but yes, all plate *laughs* some people honestly did not know vah shirs were able to be warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lykke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Im a female Ogre warrior and my plate armor has also changed looks. Looks allmost like it was chain spottet with plate wanna be look.<br />
<br />
But we Female Ogre Warriors have allways looked bad, we dont have the nice helm Graphics that Male Ogre Warriors have.<br />
<br />
I have read somewhere that all the female chars (design) was created by RL-females. Looking a Female Dark Elfs I have a hard time to belive that :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i had this issue on one of my computers since i 2box, i saw chain instead of plate on my war, was the EF items that where doing this, it showed plate on one puter and chain on the other, it accually cleared up after i update EQ, did a full update with the patches and also updated my graphics drivers and it took care of the white faces and skin and also it took care of the chain look so maybe need to update your OS with microsoft.com or update your video drivers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Melanii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I run XP Pro on my EQ workstation. It has an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video card. Before I posted my question on this forum I installed the latest video drivers from ATI and tried the camp / reload with and without gear on but nothing changed. From what people have told me I don't think there is a prolem with the graphics. The graphics between a plate armor wearing male and female barbarian are supposed to be different. I would simply like to have a plate armor breastplate that actually looked like plate armor breastplate.  I guess I just live with it until the models are updated or I stop playing EQ.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Repthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">barb  male  warr(full plate)  useing a vdd.<br />

....heya  bro  can u hook me up whit  c3  plz im in a hurry .. *shakes head* <br />
<br />
some ppl  just  not bright</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Pictures of Barbie chicks in chain and plate :<br />
<br />
They do look distinctly different... if you are experiencing so many ppl asking you for SoW / Focus etc then I really hope the people doing the asking arent your friends.<br />
<br />
Seriously, don't blame the artists, blame the dumbing down of the game and the increasing stupidity of the average player.<br />
<br />
Edit: thx allakhazam for the pics cos I was too lazy to get my own</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, they do all look distinctly ugly.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's what people do, they equate ugly to SoW.  So naturally any new model will trigger the reflex action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Doesn't matter if I am on my warrior in full black and purple plate or on my druid in green leather.  I get asked for 9 and soe all the time on both chars. =x <br />
<br />
/bird people who think all wood elves are druids or rangers!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've been asked for SoW while in Full Raex and wielding a BoW, has happened to a halfling warrior in my guild aswell, in the same setup.<br />
<br />
I blame armour dyes though.  I doubt many people these days realise what the actual colour of various suits of armour is.<br />
<br />
In the past if it was in green or brown it was probably a druid or ranger, if it was in purple it was a cleric.  Warriors went from crafted blue to cobalt blue to either warlords blue or myrmiddon brown, usually with a black / dark grey BP.  SKs wore blood red or deep purple, paladins wore baby blue, bards were a mess of pale green, bright blue and sickly yellow.<br />
<br />
Now its generally either pink or black, or a mixture of pink and black and the only way to tell if someone is uber or a noob is by thier weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mercolin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">This all seems funny to me, because I have a 65 shammy and never get asked to buff or SoW anyone. Most of the time I have Anon off too. I guess some people just don't get it, lol.<br />

<br />
Yeah if someone had armor all the same color and texture then you KNEW they were a somebody.<br />
<br />
I still dislike the whole dye thing.<br />
<br />
P.S. I think the barb plate looks nice of females.<br />
<br />
P.S.S. Hell was being a half elf on a CR back in the orginal game (pre Kunark) &quot; duuude buy a sow?&quot;</div></div><hr />
