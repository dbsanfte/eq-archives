<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">keep in mind the people i was with were assholes that loved to use leet speak and curse, so thats why i was so faul mouthed with em<br />
<br />
ok, i waited a few days hopin it would happen again but i was wrong.... let me start from the ummm... start? heh<br />
<br />
Last week i was in LDoN and a STA augment dropped(keep in mind this was NBG) so i said whos in?<br />
<br />
bard says &quot;me&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot;me&quot;<br />
chanter says &quot;me&quot;<br />
i say &quot;what the fucking bloody hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
the cleric and chanter say togeather at once, &quot;whats wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
so i said &quot;you ass hats wanting STA&quot;<br />
<br />
cleric says &quot;everyone needs hp&quot;<br />
chanter says &quot;im not max sta yet&quot;<br />
<br />
so im thinking, fucking dick heads and i say &quot;Hp isnt important to your class, you can run around holding up your robe to avoid damage, and let me fuckin tank, only people that should be in is me and the bard&quot;<br />
<br />
cleric and chanter say &quot;we all need hp lewt whore&quot;<br />
so i said &quot;excuse me? you want me to start rolling on wisdom and intel?&quot;<br />
<br />
chanter and cleric say &quot;we already max'ed those out&quot;<br />
i said &quot; not my fucking problem&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot;what do you need it for you prolly have max sta&quot;<br />
chanter says &quot;fuck you im in&quot;<br />
i said &quot;i only have 205 asshats&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot; !! &quot;<br />
chanter says &quot; oh shit hahah i have 265!&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot; lol, you sure dont tank that bad for 205, you gota be lieing&quot; <br />
i said &quot; its AA's asshat&quot;<br />
<br />
so cleric and chanter said &quot;ok we are out you need it more&quot;<br />
<br />
/ran 1 2<br />
gerick rolled a pair of magic dice they came up at 2<br />
<br />
%@(#&amp;* went to the bard :/<br />
<br />
i say &quot;grats&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
part 2 of my insanity!!<br />
<br />
We had killed trak, and he dropped the 41 percent haste cloak.<br />
<br />
i tell the raid &quot;who is in&quot;<br />
a bunch ask to be in, then i notice 2 casters tryin to get in on it, keep in mind this is a 12 str 12 wis 12 intel 13 ac 41% haste cloak or around that.<br />
<br />
i said, ok what are you to thinking<br />
<br />
one of em says i can use the intel, other says &quot;oops nm&quot;<br />
<br />
i said &quot;excuse me but i can go in the bazaar and get you something like this for 3k with out you having to gank the melee classes here out of haste.<br />
<br />
 i mean honestly here is 12 str and 13 ac and haste i can use in my daily job, and a hybrid can use the caster stats on it(which were put there FOR hybrids to make it easyer for them to augment the caster side of their job, since old world items where 1 or the other most of the time)<br />
<br />
then a pally said that she though casters should get in to not just melee's and hybrids (did she forget she was a hybrid??)<br />
<br />
so i said again &quot;rather than just getting the shiny thing you see at first sight, you could quest for something better, or you could spend maybe 5k on 2 or 3 items and have just as much mana in the end, keep in mind that your intel, wisdom and most of your focus effects stack, in that you can have flowing thought on many items that you use and it adds up, be considerate of the classes that dont have it that easy, since haste only uses your best haste item + a haste spell, its not like i can upgrade my MAIN abilitys as easly as yourself, and i think most of the hybrids and melees agree.<br />
<br />
or i said something close :D but basically the raid leader told the casters that this wasnt their turn to roll :)<br />
<br />
i guess what this rant is about is how many casters dont think about their counterparts in the melee and hybrid realm, like NBG is whatever suits them at the time, i had seen the casters get giddy over on their class boards at the thought of being able to roll agenst us for tomes so they could sell em, like we did something to deserve that shit? and my group shows its true there to, they spend their time behind the tank or running around holding up their robe, yet they think they need to max their STA? and while i can see why someone might think that 12 intel on a cloak means its for a caster, but it had haste, that is almost exclusive to weapon users! and as for the people i was grouped with, they are the reason i do not like people who think that everyone is or should be just as uber as them, god i hate pickups</div></div><hr />

I also lost the only 12 hp aug I've ever seen drop to an enchanter.<br />

It's ok. I still get giddy when we wipe out. Because I know that those 12 hit points ... they won't save that moron.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All classes need hitpoints, especially also clerics and enchanters. IMO its kinda closeminded to call every non warrior a moron when he wants a sta augment. on raids they are also exposed to AE DDs and AE DoTs, they may get hit while doing their job by adds or whatever, and it isnt just &quot;those 6 sta&quot;, because the 40 HP YOU get from &quot;those 6 sta&quot; wont make a difference either.<br />
The difference is made by alot of items that end up over time.<br />
<br />
If you want 12hp augments, stop ignoring chests btw.<br />
<br />
About the cloak, thats why pickup raids with morons are a no-no. Not like the cloak is really a good haste item nowadays with its shiny 0 hp. 41% haste is no longer needed really if you group with haste classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Trondir, <br />
<br />
The asshat had 265, he had to get planer advancment to do that, dont tell me he wasnt a selfish asshole, more over he has rune's to protect himself, mes, and dire charm, he has MANY tricks to keep himself from being hurt, warriors (and most other weapon users) dont have the benefit of any of that, and dont sneeze on 41 percent haste, not all of us have epic'd chanters to pall around with, and if what you do most is pickup groups you have to put up with &quot;come as you are&quot; and expect to be carrying extra weight,<br />
<br />
As for hp i can sell my old cloak and my soulscream belt and get a nice belt that will make back all of the HPs i lost using the trak cloak, that is if i had won it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need hps as well.  He has 265 sta... and?  So what if he had to buy PP to get that.  That doesn't mean that it isn't useful to him.  Hps are universally needed.  Blame SOE that our most useful stat is also one of the most important for EVERY class.  Soon endurance effects should be on items, and those you can bitch about if casters get.  It isn't the casters fault that other stuff doesn't help you, yet your stuff helps him.<br />
<br />
As for the haste item, casters shouldn't be included in that, which is probably why the raid leader made it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something to keep in mind all you defenders of the downtrodden casters who need hit points too ...<br />
<br />
At this juncture in the evolution of Everquest ... due to recent patches ... Melees now get MORE out of a stamina augment than a caster does.<br />
<br />
How is this possible you may be wondering?<br />
<br />
Casters merely get Hit Points from a stamina augment.<br />
<br />
Melees, however, get HIT POINTS ... and ... ENDURANCE.<br />
<br />
So, nowadays, when a caster rolls against you for a stamina or an agility augment, you'd be &quot;wise&quot; to point out to them that they're not only taking hit points (or AC in the case of agility) away from you, they're taking your &quot;MANA&quot; away from you too.<br />
<br />
I guess however you could argue the point that casters may be able to JUMP one or two more times with enough STA augments.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like dex and sta augs.  Even fully buffed I'm not anywhere close to max in either.  But I always ask if any melee aren't maxed first.  If there is a melee not maxed then I pass.  If the melee are already maxed or say they are close and get over max with buffs then I roll.  <br />
<br />
Most people are a lot more likely to pass on upgrades in a friend / guild group then they would for total strangers.  Keep that in mind and define &quot;need&quot; before you even zone into ldon when in pickup groups.<br />
<br />
A few casters probably will roll against you for the tomes.  I think it is horrible and would never do it but then there were some melee who did roll against casters for parchments when PoP first came out too.  Anything that can be sold can be considered a cash item.  Again only solution is to determine before anything drops what the rule for the group is going to be.<br />
<br />
I believe in need before greed and think it is sad when I find myself in a group who doesn't.  But blaming all casters is as silly as the guy who says warriors loot everything before the mob hits the ground just cause he was in a group with one or two jerks who happened to be warriors.  There are bad people in every class but thankfully there are many more good ones which is why I keep playing.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just so we don't start talking about how great the fucking cloak of piety is, it's 34%, not 41%. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I happen to think you whine far too goddamned much too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your right its not all of em, but a fair majority of them are this way, str, dex,sta and agi are all factored in to endurance, im sorry if you like to take a few extra hits but lets examine your roll... which is to NOT get hit, to AVOID damage, damage avoidance can be bottemless if the player is skilled (kiting, aggro managment) my job is to USE the HP to do MY job, which is to take damage.<br />
<br />
when your HP is static and full almost 90% of the time, and mine is jumping from 40 to 100 percent between ch's ALL of the time, my need is obviusly greater than yours, hence need before greed, or need before want, meaning what you want and what you need to have to play is 2 very differnt things, having 30 less hp here and 40 there wont hurt you to much, but it adds up and is very important for the fighters of the game<br />
<br />
heh, this is the outhouse hass, i dont tell you how much you can shit, dont tell me how much toilet paper to use</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, you wanna start, here we fuckin go.<br />
<br />
1.  You're a fucking dipshit.  You know the ONLY stats that matter for almost everyone once they get to level 65 and have a decent set of gear are HP and AC?  That's FUCKING IT.  NOTHING ELSE.  No one gives a flying fuck about dex, or wisdom, or intelligence or what have you because IT'S ALL POINTLESS AT THAT LEVEL.  You know how long it's been since my shaman ran outta mana?  I can't fucking remember the last time, and I'm willing to bet any caster with their fucking head out of their ass can't either.  With FT, KEI, MC, Bard shit, Beastlord buffs, Blessing of the nine and whatever else they got these days NO ONE RUNS OUT OF FUCKING MANA.  MANA POOL IS IRRELEVANT.  What keeps you alive is how many fucking HP you have, and since most casters are elves with low stamina, STAMINA IS STILL USEFUL TO THEM.  You're a goddamned retard for thinking you're the only one that needs it.  You got shot down and you're crying about it because you didn't think your argument far enough thru.<br />
<br />
2. The cloak of piety is ABSOLUTE ASS for a warrior.  For someone who is bitching so fucking hard about HP in the first part of, he sure is happy to throw that argument away as soon as it doesn't fit his purposes.  You would be better off with a soulscream and a heiro than you would with that cloak and ANY waist slot.  Amazing how your HP &gt; all logic conveniently goes down the drain when you want to be a whiny bitch about how many people are competing with you on items.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you're a fucking loot whore who tried to make up some lame justification and you got burned on it.  I hope you learned your lesson and maybe you'll keep your fucking mouth shut from now on when you don't know what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haass did you ever stop to think before you unloaded, that maybe.... just maybe there still might be some people who fail easy LDoNs because they have to take a med break, people that have tried hardmode and wiped out on the third pull?<br />
<br />
i mean its easy to shit on people like myself where gear doesnt flow like water quite yet, then again im sure i dont devote my life to EQ as much as you do eather so that is kinda my fault, or maybe it has something to do with you raiding more, again my fault, but to some of us, this shit DOES matter, it may not matter to you, but it does to others.<br />
<br />
maybe haste doesnt mean much to you since you DW, but i use a 2 hander, so i dont hit the haste cap of nothing lower than 10 (i think thats it) and id be happy to get a little haste in exchange for a little HP, my magelo hasnt been updated in quite some time so dont go off of that :D<br />
<br />
also it comes down to what can i attain with my currect guild, friends and pick ups, i can attain augments, a out of date haste cloak, and some LDoN points not a whole hell of alot but its not to bad for me, but this comes back to what i was saying, just because mana flows like wine when you are with your friends, doesnt mean its the same for everyone else<br />
<br />
---<br />
now id like to qoute a passage from the book of haass<br />
<br />
 You know how long it's been since my shaman ran outta mana? I can't fucking remember the last time, and I'm willing to bet any caster with their fucking head out of their ass can't either. With FT, KEI, MC, Bard shit, Beastlord buffs, Blessing of the nine and whatever else they got these days NO ONE RUNS OUT OF FUCKING MANA. MANA POOL IS IRRELEVANT.<br />
---<br />
<br />
doesnt matter what your shaman can do haass, what matters is what the ones im with can do.<br />
<br />
KEI, MC bard shit BL buffs? well shit you must love having the perfect group in a box! i wish we all had that much of a nice life!<br />
<br />
mana pool is irrelevant? that in itself sounds stupid<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
another passage of sage words<br />
<br />
<br />
What keeps you alive is how many fucking HP you have, and since most casters are elves with low stamina, STAMINA IS STILL USEFUL TO THEM<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
no shit skippy, and since im the tank, i take the fucking damage not the elves with the weak arms and wimpy armor! maybe with a little less room for error(look up over nuking, slowing to early etc) they will fucking learn to assist the MT, wait for me to call that i used incite, and be smart players! if they were ment to take hits they would have fucking plate armor Dipshit!(did i sound like haass when i said that? no? ah damn)<br />
<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
another passage from the grand book of toilet paper<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a goddamned retard for thinking you're the only one that needs it. You got shot down and you're crying about it because you didn't think your argument far enough thru.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
did i say i was the only one that needed it? no i said i needed it most out of EVERYONE in that group, if they are to the point where they have to use AAs to boost their cap and i am not, i am hurting for stanima a HELL of alot more than them, its like saying lets give a tax break to the poor, oops it applys to the rich guy to so the poor guy saves 30 and the rich guy saves 3 hundred!<br />
<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
one last enlighting passage before i go to bed<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The cloak of piety is ABSOLUTE ASS for a warrior. For someone who is bitching so fucking hard about HP in the first part of, he sure is happy to throw that argument away as soon as it doesn't fit his purposes.

<br />
---<br />
<br />
the cloak is ass for warriors? for yourself maybe, for me, its good as gold, there are times when im not the MT, and im just there for damage that i can swap it out, did you stop to consider that?<br />
<br />
you can not tell me you dont swap items around for their effects or spells when you have a wooly spider silk net and a bandaid press in your magelo, as well as cobalt greaves, a fungi tunic ( im sure you dont tank in that, prolly for when your soloing correct?)<br />
<br />
HP isnt greater than all if your not the MT in a group, i end up on both sides of the warrior duty so i need to have gear for both sides.<br />
<br />
shooting insults like dipshit, fucker and all that other crap(like whiner) doesnt make you look smart, and talking down to people and being overdominering doesnt make you look important stop tryin to be furor(you can not match his greatness).<br />
<br />
furthermore about insults before you even start your gears into motion to reply to this, i talked to that group with the same respect they gave me and eachother<br />
<br />
(ps, maybe having the same insult/tone thrown back at you will make you relise how fast you went from throwin in your 2 cents to complete ass, this is my rant and if ya dont like it TS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so what it really comes down to Gerick is you are upset that your group didnt award things to you on NBG as you felt you needed the sta aug the most despite everyone else having a legitimate need for it too?<br />
<br />
Was it a guild group or pickup group? sounds like a pickup due to you comments in the original post about not knowing each others gear / AA situation well, and if its a pickup group that is doing NBG its no one else in the group's problem that you are still at the stage where you still fail easy LDoNs and gear doesn't flow like water.  If a caster thinks they need that stamina aug enough to roll for it when its called NBG then thats their perogitive and the way you whinge odds are they arent going to ever want to group with you again so they aren't going to get any benefit out of conceeding it to you because of your perceived greater need.<br />

Hey Trondir, <br />
<br />
The asshat had 265, he had to get planer advancment to do that, dont tell me he wasnt a selfish asshole, more over he has rune's to protect himself, mes, and dire charm, he has MANY tricks to keep himself from being hurt, warriors (and most other weapon users) dont have the benefit of any of that, and dont sneeze on 41 percent haste, not all of us have epic'd chanters to pall around with, and if what you do most is pickup groups you have to put up with &quot;come as you are&quot; and expect to be carrying extra weight, <br />
<br />
Why the hell do you mention dire charm ?  Runes also dont work vs AEs that are DoTs, which unfortunately are almost ALL PoP raid AEs these days, very few unresistable DDs left.<br />
Mez? comeon, the reason he is getting hit is the mob RESISTED mez in the first place.<br />
<br />
Also you know that caps raise to 280 for casters at 65 as well? <br />
<br />
You dont know much about casters, it would help alot if you realized this. Casters have almost no tricks to keep themselves from being killed when a raid mob hitting for 1k+ decided to hit them. The only thing that will save a casters is having enough HP to survive the 2nd round as well because then the first heals might land.<br />
I dont sneeze at 41% haste. I sneeze at a cloak with low AC and 0 hp. Haass is damn right to say you are a lootwhore when you demand a sta augment over everyone and the next day you want a 0hp cloak<br />
<br />
NO ONE RUNS OUT OF FUCKING MANA<br />

<br />
The Cleric / Chanter had every right to ask for something that gives them HP - In fact, it's smart of them. They are after all the classes, along with Shamans, that gets hit on when your taunt fails.<br />
<br />
The only classes which can be argued should never get hit in a group with tanks in it, is Wizard, Magician, Beastlords (unless they are slower), Druids (if not healing), Rogues and Rangers. In other words, classes on DPS duty. A Slower / Healer support class must calculate with getting hit now and then - And if you get hit, you should have as many HP as you can get .. Rune or no Rune.<br />
<br />
If your Healer dies, it doesn't help much to have you at max STA, right ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I don't know what to tell you there.  I really only say that I'm sorry you haven't found people skilled enough to spend time with on this game, I wouldn't wish pickup groups on anyone.  See, I don't group with idiots.  My guild doesn't exist to farm &quot;Phat loots&quot; or get to the elemental planes or anything like that, it exists so that I can go /w all guild and pick up ANY 4 people and go hit any zone in the game and know that I'm not gonna die because someone leveled up in PoP and got to 65 before he learned how to play his goddamned character.  People getting you killed in fucking LDoN normals?  Jesus christ man, time to find some new people to hang out with.<br />
<br />
<br />
 mean its easy to shit on people like myself where gear doesnt flow like water quite yet, then again im sure i dont devote my life to EQ as much as you do eather so that is kinda my fault, or maybe it has something to do with you raiding more, again my fault, but to some of us, this shit DOES matter, it may not matter to you, but it does to others. <br />
<br />
I don't raid at all.  Period.  The biggest thing I've ever tanked/killed was my guild's first run at Dozekar a couple weeks ago.  That's it.  I don't have any elemental loot, I don't have anything that you can't obtain with cash or 1 group.  I don't even spend as much time in EQ these days as I spend on this message board verbally assaulting people.  This game is NOT that hard anymore.  If you've got gear problems, you're not putting forth any effort, because what I can do with 6 people, ANYONE else can take their guild and do.  Get off your ass and do it or stop bitching about how much your gear sucks.  If you'll notice around here, I'm not really that well equipped.  There are a lot of people sporting Vindi BP's, or hell, look at what you've even got...a goddamned great staff of the 4 winds.  I think that's just a little bit harder to obtain than anything I've got in my bag of tricks pal, since I dont trust enough healers in the game to keep my ass alive against a miniboss in BoT.<br />
<br />
maybe haste doesnt mean much to you since you DW, but i use a 2 hander, so i dont hit the haste cap of nothing lower than 10 (i think thats it) and id be happy to get a little haste in exchange for a little HP, my magelo hasnt been updated in quite some time so dont go off of that  <br />
<br />
THERE IS NO MINIMUM DELAY.  Haste for me is the same as haste for you.  So there ya go, again, you're being selfish.  Or maybe you're just uninformed and you don't know you're being selfish.  It's looking like that's the case right now.<br />
<br />
doesnt matter what your shaman can do haass, what matters is what the ones im with can do.<br />
KEI, MC bard shit BL buffs? well shit you must love having the perfect group in a box! i wish we all had that much of a nice life!<br />
mana pool is irrelevant? that in itself sounds stupid<br />
 <br />
<br />
My shaman is fucking TWO BOXED.  Do you understand what that means? that means while I'm pulling, and killing shit, my shaman is standing up.  She ain't doing jack and shit, except malos, slow, epic DoT, keeping my group happiliy Avatared and tossing in a nuke or a DoT once per fight.  Do you know what a REAL shaman can do?  When I decide to put Haass down for a nite and play only Cagna, my group's XP rate doubles.  I'm not fucking kidding, shaman are that goddamned unbeliavable.  If you can't find a shaman who knows what the fuck he's doing, then once again, I'm sorry you haven't figured out how to make good friends yet. <br />
<br />
And as for the rest of it, are you fucking kidding me?  Go to PoK.  Sit there with your channels on for 5 minutes and YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO WILL GIVE YOU THE BUFFS I JUST MENTIONED FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF CASH.  Perfect group my ass.  From what I read on the other forums and the bullshit whining i see going on in PoK, getting 32 mana regen per tick standing is not fucking difficult these days (15 kei, 8 prot nine, 7 for beasty crack, 1 standing, 1 solstice earring).  You're telling me you group with people who can't figure out this simple concept?  Once again, I'm sorry....<br />
<br />
no shit skippy, and since im the tank, i take the fucking damage not the elves with the weak arms and wimpy armor! maybe with a little less room for error(look up over nuking, slowing to early etc) they will fucking learn to assist the MT, wait for me to call that i used incite, and be smart players! if they were ment to take hits they would have fucking plate armor Dipshit!(did i sound like haass when i said that? no? ah damn) <br />
<br />
Of course they're not meant to take hits fuckwad.  That doesn't mean you want your casters running around with 45 hp so they get killed by any mistake that happens.  Ever grouped with a chanter who has like 1200hp unbuffed?  They go thru arcane rune like Anna Nicole Smith thru a truckload of Twinkies.  These are the people that you want to be grouping with?  Sounds like you're setting yourself up for failure.  Even if you had 10khp, if your fucking cleric has 3khp with Virtue up and pulls aggro on an unslowed add while he's healing your ass, he's going down and that's it, good nite, fun time is over for you.  Time to start thinking beyond your little stat screen there.<br />
<br />
did i say i was the only one that needed it? no i said i needed it most out of EVERYONE in that group, if they are to the point where they have to use AAs to boost their cap and i am not <br />
<br />
Here ya go man, if you learn nothing today, learn this.  EVERYONE'S STAT CAP GOES UP TO 280 AT LEVEL 65.  That means it's okay for a chanter to have 265 stamina, and perfectly reasonable, WITHOUT SPENDING ANY AA'S.<br />
<br />
the cloak is ass for warriors? for yourself maybe, for me, its good as gold, there are times when im not the MT, and im just there for damage that i can swap it out, did you stop to consider that? <br />
<br />
Right.  So you're gonna carry around a RBG for when you're tanking and a cloak of piety for when you're not?  Who are you fucking kidding dude?  We ain't the people you group with, that fucking RBG is gonna be on your trader before Trak's corpse is cold and you fucking know it.  You're just backpedaling to try not to look like a dumbass, and it's not working.<br />
<br />
you can not tell me you dont swap items around for their effects or spells when you have a wooly spider silk net and a bandaid press in your magelo, as well as cobalt greaves, a fungi tunic ( im sure you dont tank in that, prolly for when your soloing correct?) <br />
<br />
What the fuck are you talking about?  I have fucking UTILITY items in my bags.  They are things that allow me to do what I otherwise could not alone.  That wooly net has been sitting in my inventory for like a year now, waiting for a point where I'd say &quot;Hrm, for some reason, no one in my group can root but I want to split these mobs.&quot;  The bandaid press is there so that when I die, I can actually do something useful and contribute to the healing of my group instead of sitting around like a bump on a log.  The cobalt greaves exist so I don't have to bug other people for an invis, and the fungi tunic is just universal.  If you're not tanking and wearing anything except a fungi, you're just a fool.  Why make your group heal you when you can HEAL YOURSELF?  None of that is anywhere near the same as &quot;No, I need a better haste item so I can swap it out when I'm just doing damage.&quot;  That's one of the funniest things I've heard in awhile tho, good job.<br />
<br />
shooting insults like dipshit, fucker and all that other crap(like whiner) doesnt make you look smart, and talking down to people and being overdominering doesnt make you look important stop tryin to be furor(you can not match his greatness). <br />
<br />
First off, I was being a dickhead to people like you long before I even knew who Furor was.  Secondly, when you're acting like a disphit, I call you a dipshit, and you sit around here and whine and cry about shit more than anyone.  Be happy I just decided I've had enough of your crap today and not 800 posts ago like I should have.<br />
<br />
Oh, and just to show you what kind of a hypocrite you are, so you can see it -- <br />
<br />
furthermore about insults before you even start your gears into motion to reply to this, i talked to that group with the same respect they gave me and eachother <br />
<br />
so i said &quot;you ass hats wanting STA&quot; <br />
<br />
 so im thinking, fucking dick heads and i say &quot;Hp isnt important to your class, you can run around holding up your robe to avoid damage, and let me fuckin tank, only people that should be in is me and the bard&quot;<br />
<br />
cleric and chanter say &quot;we all need hp lewt whore&quot;<br />
so i said &quot;excuse me? you want me to start rolling on wisdom and intel?&quot;<br />
<br />
chanter and cleric say &quot;we already max'ed those out&quot;<br />
i said &quot; not my fucking problem&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot;what do you need it for you prolly have max sta&quot;<br />
chanter says &quot;fuck you im in&quot;<br />
i said &quot;i only have 205 asshats&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot; !! &quot;<br />
chanter says &quot; oh shit hahah i have 265!&quot;<br />
cleric says &quot; lol, you sure dont tank that bad for 205, you gota be lieing&quot; <br />
i said &quot; its AA's asshat&quot;<br />
<br />
Boy, no wonder you get so much respect.  When you figure out your story, feel free to try again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eoden, if you would take the time to read it closly you noticed i said that it was me and the bard that should be in, never did i say &quot;it should only be awarded to warriors!&quot; i did say however, melees, hybrids, weapon users, fighers, however the heck you wana put it.<br />
<br />
my logic comes from the line of thinking that if a 15 sta 30 hp 20 mana item drops, with a required level of 60 that normally the only people that would give a damn would be the melee and hybrids, now i do relise that sta augments are alittle differnt because they fit on exisiting gear but the stat in the first place, has almost always been a fighter classes best friend, not the finger twitcher, just because you no longer have to pick from mana or hp doesnt mean you should get everything you can, i mean that is like saying &quot;i should eat everything on this table at thanks giving because its there, i shouldnt stop when im full&quot; the paralell here was that the caster was close to hitting his cap, and would have had to RAISE it to continue being a stanima whore, and he was in one of the best guilds on our server (magister) and they are ornate and elemental work, well above the standard player, killing everything in tactics for fun etc.<br />
<br />
also part of the reason that there is such a huge differance between haass's groups and mine is healing efficancy, meaning he is easyer to heal thanks to a large amount of HP, and a ungodly amount after he is buffed, the only way for me to get my groups healing efficancy up is to get myself more hp for when im the tank, if im not the tank /shurg ah well<br />
<br />
to trondir<br />
<br />
why did i mention direcharm? its an escape method, a way to avoid damage, you send forth a pet to take damage for you.<br />
<br />
and yes your right, runes dont stop dots or aoe's, but then again im not here to help the guy get 30 hps so he can get time flagged, and top off his sta before i even break 220<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You dont know much about casters, it would help alot if you realized this. Casters have almost no tricks to keep themselves from being killed when a raid mob hitting for 1k+ decided to hit them. The only thing that will save a casters is having enough HP to survive the 2nd round as well because then the first heals might land. <br />
<br />
hitting for 1k? why not try and play correctly? how about waiting for the MT to call for assist? how about putting down the romance novel and watching your toon? as for surviving a round that should have never even started, buffs can take care of that.<br />
<br />
if you did not know your endurance bar is effected by your gear+base, meaning yes, all the sta i can get from a buff will help my max endurance but my pool will be larger if i get it to max with out a buff, plus there are many times when im not with a shaman or bst(not to sure on this, its what the a few of the warriors in emar said when i asked them, asked 4 or 5 of em about what they have learned from using it)<br />
<br />
I dont sneeze at 41% haste. I sneeze at a cloak with low AC and 0 hp. Haass is damn right to say you are a lootwhore when you demand a sta augment over everyone and the next day you want a 0hp cloak <br />
<br />
there are times when im not the MT, about 50 percent of the time im not, when im not the MT my job is to NOT get attention some of the casters out there should learn that, i am talking about groups here, and hell, even on raids when im not the MT, i could still use it to boost my damage because i can survive the AoE with out much of a problem<br />
<br />
more about the AoEs, they dont always land eather, whats wrong with using some resist gear during a raid? to diffcult to get a frog crown, some 10 to all resist potions, some resist cake? recuit a few bards into the guild, use the resist song, boom problem solved for the most part, just gota worry about the unresistables (there arnt that many of those)<br />
<br />
as for the hste percent, everyone argues about what percent something is, normally i go with the general consensis, which used to be 41% before lucy came around, and i dont like to use the lucy site on a raid, then i would be a loot whore<br />
<br />
anker, we rolled because me and the bard had a need for it, the cleric and chanter saw it as &quot;something nice they would like  to have&quot; <br />
<br />
to become a better group tank i need hp, the less i have the harder it is for me to be healed, raiding aside, for a caster there isnt really a direct relation between their ability to nuke and their hp, and their hp doesnt normally effect the pace of the whole group, my hp does.<br />
<br />
my healers dont die, most of them know how to pace themselves and its hard to let them die when i have incite, taunt, kick stun(i know its minor but it can stop them from running after them)<br />
<br />
haass for the sake of charity, how the fug do you get the cash for ornate? you see i may seem like a big bad lootwhore but if i was, id have cash in spades, id have more ornate, but i really mean it, where does all you cash come from? high hold keep? rathe mtns?<br />
<br />
now i have tried to get ornate thru grouping, but you know luck is agenst me when it comes to rolls, that cleric i was with must of had a third arm, cant imagine why he would need 3(i know he had 3 because i have been in groups where he won them, i was really tempted to tell the group how much of a dick he was)<br />
<br />
the GSoFWs was fairly cool to get, was on a excellent pick up raid. i sit in BoT all the time waiting for groups or raids, and a chance to roll for some ornate legs or something agenst 20 other people or more heh, needless to say ill prolly have 100 notchs on my belt before i win anything else, but i tell you, that monk i won agenst sure was pissed :D<br />
<br />
id like that SoD more than i would like my 4 winds staff but maybe thats me being an oddball again.<br />
<br />
about the minimum delay, there was one at some point because it crashed the combat engine, or at least thats what i was told, so i didnt want it to be selfish<br />
<br />
and its nice that your shaman is so good, i wish you played on my server so i could leach some xp from you but sadly that isnt the case.<br />
<br />
as you know, i said we have problems in LDoN easy, meaning if we have someone die, they just cant go run and get new ones, and then worst of all we have asshats that go afk while we get other people in the group and while we pick a adventure, so thanks to them, we have 20 min or more burned off their timers, and not many buffs last the 3 hours it can take to do some adventures, now i know BoT is a bit better because you can go get some buffs, but i dont always get BoT groups, id love to but i do not. having half the people i group with not willing(or even thinking)to get that 32 a tick regen does suck, and pick ups suck because most of the good players have friends that they adventure with.<br />
<br />
sadly alot of my old group members play their alts all the time, and ask me to start one, but i really dont want to grind another toon to 65 and then throw it in a cubbyhole untill someone needs a res, or a KEI or a port, thats just not what i want to do.<br />
<br />
heh your right,  most   casters do need hp, but the 2 im talking about were on the opsite side of the spectrum, there is a point where someone should be content with how much STA they have depending on their class, and that dip had more than me, unbuffed! theres something not right about that, even he backed down on wanting in when i told him how much i had<br />
<br />
about the RBG and the CoGP i would swap them out, who are you to say i would not?<br />
<br />
and again, you dont use that fungi to tank, you use it to recover hp when your not doing much, such as after a res, while soloing for cash, etc<br />
<br />
i wouldnt use the cloak to tank eather, so both of them function on the condition that we are not the tank at the time of use, whats the diffrance? and yeh i would be a dumbass to not use it, but then again i cant even get 45k for a ornate helm, how the hell am i gona buy a fungi<br />
<br />
about being a hypocrite, i treat others the way im treated, and i showed you the same respect you gave me, i was just telling ya it made us both look like asses but at least you admit it<br />
<br />
 I was being a dickhead to people like you long before I even knew who Furor was</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there was a point to picking up anything but +hp augs, you might have a valid point.  Everyone needs hp, and for augments, hp &gt; everything else (cause you can put the lore everything else augs on your bracers + gaunts). Chanters, clerics and shaman go splat more than anyone else.<br />
<br />
You can get every buff you would ever want by spending 2 minutes in a ldon camp trading buffs your group can cast for buffs other people can (or by spending a little cash). You could even just ask, most people I know will c3/brells/single sta/focus/virt/ect if you can ask nicely enough (I brell more people in camps during &quot;resting&quot; time then i buff my own groups)<br />
<br />
Dont forget the buyable, non lore, 10sta augments... might be better for you than saving up 2x that for 20/40 hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cloak of Piety (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=1627) is 34% haste. Seriously though, you only need 30% haste since both Shaman and Enchanter can give you 70% haste buffs nowadays. And since your RBG is already 27% .. that's only a 3 % difference, so switching out isn't so important.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, get your guild to go and beat up Gorenaire in Dreadlands, she can drop the Runed Bolster Belt (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=11601) which is 31% haste, which will put you at the 100% haste cap 99% of your EQ playing time. It even have a respectable +10 STA. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the lowest delay these days ?<br />
Well, as far as my memory serves me, this is how it goes :<br />
<br />
There's no longer a limit, it was removed with the Velius expansion when they went over to having all numbers represented as floating point type numbers instead of integer type numbers, which allowed for better precision, since they had problems with rounding numbers when going under 10 delay, which was the cap back before the change.<br />
<br />
Also, at the same time they started to send HP updates and such down in %'s instead of integers, which actually improved connection speeds, since they could use smaller integer numbers (bytes to be precise) than before. And it allowed for monsters with more than 32k HP.<br />
<br />
However, the MOBs also gained the ability to get really low delays, hence why Rallos Zek hits at about 1 delay when unslowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for who should get the STA augments ?<br />
<br />
---- EVERYONE ! ---- <br />
<br />
Especialy if they have managed to cap out their main stats already, then there's pretty much only STA, HP and Resists left to work on, if you want to advance your character.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I can see how it is frustrating for you.<br />
But that shouldn't stop others from advancing their characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, like every week you start a new thread titled &quot;My thoughts on XXXX&quot;  No one gives a shit.  Your thoughts are fucked up, and quite honestly it doesn't sound like you're a very good EQ player to begin with.  Might wanna spend a little less time flapping your gums and a little more time reading and maybe people won't think that way of you.  The fact that you're concerned about fucking swapping haste items because you're unaware of how much haste is really applied to you in a typical group and the fact that you still think of things like a 10 delay rule proves you HAVEN'T been reading.  You haven't learned shit in 800 posts around here, and that is giving you the impression of being a fucking dumbass.<br />
<br />
Then you come here and bitch about how you can't get any HP augments in your shitty groups because everyone else needs HP to survive your suck ass tanking most likely, and we find out that you really don't understand what other classes need or what as well.  Then you try to justify your loot whore attitude by trying to rally support against the big mean Haass who told you that you're a fucktard.  Face it dude, you're fucking wrong, you made an ass out of yourself and you got caught in it.  The best thing you can do right now is shut up and learn from the ordeal.  Or you can continue to try to argue it and Trondir and I are most likely going to continue to shove logic up your ass until you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i wont comment on the trak cloak, as if there is hybrid classes present, they are &quot;need&quot; before anyone else &quot;greed&quot; because of the haste and the stats. not even warrior would like to roll on it.<br />
<br />
but for the sta aug, i would say, everyone need STA.<br />
be it a silk class, or a plate class, they are in need of STA until it is capped. saying the warriors / bards are &quot;needing&quot; it more than others are just &quot;greed&quot;, imho.<br />
<br />
i can understand the frustration that the cleric calls u &quot;lying&quot; about ur sta, but it is not a reason to deny him from rolling on the sta augment. same deal to the chanter, he wouldn't know u only have 205sta while he already has 265sta.<br />
<br />
in short, NBG = the greedest and the most unfair method of distributing loots imo. everyone that pay effort on it, everyone should have the rights to take a bite from the pie. if ur group/raid members are mature (and familiar with the game) enough, their courtesy will tell who needs what most, and will pass loot when needed. rolling and saying NBG is not a very good way to go, while it is a very fast way to break up friendship. :)</div></div><hr />

haass for the sake of charity, how the fug do you get the cash for ornate? you see i may seem like a big bad lootwhore but if i was, id have cash in spades, id have more ornate, but i really mean it, where does all you cash come from? high hold keep? rathe mtns? <br />
<br />
Who says I fucking buy my gear?  I fucking camp what I can.  I camped Kael with a single group when Veterans were still yellow to me and fucking assbeat machines.  I got a full suit of Thurgadin and we moved to HoT.  Midway thru farming that, Heraldic came out and I made a smith and skilled him up to 250 before the smithing nerf.  I supplied a HUGE portion of the server with Fierce Heraldic while the other major smith on the server was trying out new recipies for EQtraders.com.  I made over a million plat in a month's time because I was smart enough to forsee a profitable venture.  My group of friends and I were working on BoT access when they opened the planes.  It was only a matter of time before we were in there anyway.  How did I get my ornate?  I fuckin stripped some of it off the giants I killed and bought the rest with the pieces we got that we didn't need.   You fuck around in LDoN and bitch about 6 sta augments, but in the meantime, some of us are doing private groups in BoT and walking out with 4-6 ornate molds a nite.  You assume everyone buys things from the bazaar, but you give no thought to where it comes from.  It comes from people like me, and that's how I have cash to afford things like SoD's.<br />
<br />
sadly alot of my old group members play their alts all the time, and ask me to start one, but i really dont want to grind another toon to 65 and then throw it in a cubbyhole untill someone needs a res, or a KEI or a port, thats just not what i want to do. <br />
<br />
Then it's time to get some new friends.  That's the biggest step you have to make in this game man, is figuring out who is your friend and who has the same goals as you do and dropping the people who don't.  There was a huge faction in my guild that was always playing twinks and always rolling up new ones and not spending much time on their mains to help the guild out.  That group is now gone, and we're far better off for it.  Everyone works hard and everyone busts their ass to make their main characters as strong as they can be so that we can move on to bigger and better things.  If you want to move up, you need to find people who think the same way, or you're always going to be stuck in those dead end LDoN groups with fucktards who couldn't find their way from Freeport to Guk if they had a map and a lighted path to follow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes i do bitch quite a bit, but thats because im still in the stutter steps of 65+ meaning im still having to pinch out everything i can in order to get better.<br />

more over i kinda like LDoN in that i can someday afford some of the royal sand attendant armor (a pipe dream in my current gear)<br />

as for being a dumbshit about EQ in general, i keep aggro, i stay alive i do my job as a tank, i may be crass, and i may be rude to those that show me the same, but i play my class well, i dont like to wave my dick around but i do get complements on how well i do considering what i use, then again they are from the same pick up groups that i hate with such a vengance</div></div><hr />

why did i mention direcharm? its an escape method, a way to avoid damage, you send forth a pet to take damage for you.<br />

and yes your right, runes dont stop dots or aoe's, but then again im not here to help the guy get 30 hps so he can get time flagged, and top off his sta before i even break 220<br />
<br />
Awesome, Direcharm pets pretty much NEVER take agro. They are NOT a defensive skill, please tell any random 65 enchanter DC is a defensive skill, he'll laugh at you for 5 minutes. Stop thinking what stuff might do, and accept that you dont know it. Ask a friend enchanter.<br />
<br />
News : these people are not in your LDoN group to get YOUR sta maxed either. Everyone has their own interests. Nobody plays EQ just to help YOU.<br />

hitting for 1k? why not try and play correctly? how about waiting for the MT to call for assist? how about putting down the romance novel and watching your toon? as for surviving a round that should have never even started, buffs can take care of that.<br />
Ok Clerics shouldnt heal till assist is called, shamans shouldnt slow, ench shouldnt mez and tash. Righto boy. Alot of non tank classes get agro on raids due to their JOB, and buffs ? wtf, you should be able to tank without buffs by that logic. No boy, it all adds up. buffing a 1500hp enchanter will not take care of him getting agro for tash. He WILL die.<br />
<br />
<br />
when im not the MT my job is to NOT get attention some of the casters out there should learn that<br />
You think you play this game better than anyone else? I'd love to see your face when you get a tell from a cleric at your bind point &quot;You said I shouldnt get agro when not MT, well healing is agro&quot;<br />
<br />
more about the AoEs, they dont always land eather, whats wrong with using some resist gear during a raid? to diffcult to get a frog crown, some 10 to all resist potions, some resist cake? haha its easy to tell you arent raiding EPs. Sorry but nobody is going to take 100 hp items out for some statsless resist gear, because THEN they are truely fucked when the stuff lands anyways. Also, most items you wear are already top or close to top in resists with a very few exceptions. It just isnt enough when you arent fully equipped with really good gear!<br />
<br />
Besides resisting -350 is very hard, -400 is next to impossible. (if they arent actually flagged &quot;unresistable&quot; like Blazzax I guess.)Sorry, but thats the resist mods you fight against in EPs. Even when maxed with a bard to 5fucking00. The only AEs I can resist constantly with close-to-maxed resists is Ofossaa  and Earth Croc</div></div><hr />

there are plenty of clerics who can heal, and plenty of shaman and enchanters that can do their respective jobs with out getting in aggro hell, dont know who you group with, with the system like it is now, i can pop fort and then stonewall, meaning, i have 12 seconds with out melee damage, that is more than enough time to establish aggro on a raid, incite, taunt and a decent proc is all you need most times, in a group things dont hit hard enough to require it right off the bat.<br />

very funny, a guess your taking me to letarly (sp?) i mean getting aggro to the point of turning it off the MT, im sorry i had to explain that for you<br />

Since Stamina now affects both hit points AND your endurance pool ... there is an issue with casters seeking to obtain the stamina augments before a melee or even a hybrid (they have discs too).<br />

Everyone wants raw hit points.<br />

And Sony would probably not wreck the game if they made the stupid 12 hit point augment a tad more common. Right now it's like 1 in 30 adventures or some such nonsense.<br />

Then why the hell are they even grouping with you?  They don't deserve rewards for their work simply because they've invested more time in their character than you have?  They aren't there to equip you.  I swear, this is exactly what most of EQ is turning in to.  People who expect others to do everything for them.  They expect hand outs from those who worked hard just because those who worked hard have been successful.  The sta aug could be just as important to them if they do fights where they are required and there is an ae or anything else that might damage them (adds, resisted mez on cc mobs, heal aggro from offtanked mobs, aes, traps and room spells, and the list goes on).<br />
<br />
there are plenty of clerics who can heal, and plenty of shaman and enchanters that can do their respective jobs with out getting in aggro  <br />
<br />
You really need to get out more before you insist that others can avoid aggro all the time.  There are times when they must do what they have to do, even if it means getting aggro.  One of the biggest complaints on this board was fighting mobs that hit hard enough they had to be slowed on inc.  It can't always be avoided, so every class needs hps to save them.  Add in the fact that many mobs ae, some of which are unavoidable.  They need hps to live and do their job, it's that simple.<br />
<br />

You may know how to play your character, that I do not know one way or the other.  But you've proven repeatedly here that you do not understand the needs of other classes, or what things are like at higher parts of the game.<br />

All you are proving is that you are not only ignorant, but also immature.  Ignorance can be helped, and we have tried to do that by explaining that it is just as important to them.  Immaturity is something that we can't help with.  I feel sorry for anyone who has to group with you.</div></div><hr />

see the captive coin slave necklace i have on my magelo?  it almost rotted because the casters tryed to say that it wasnt a melee item (better than what i had before) and tried to come up with any reasoning under the sun to stop me( it would have rotted if i hadnt gotten it off the corpse and told them to bitch about why i shouldnt roll on it once we had finished the adventure)<br />

Let's put it this way then, shall we?  I'm a tradeskiller.....and a troll....so therefore, I must have a greater need for INT and CHA augments than the silly wizard and enchanter that already have theirs over 200, aye?  STA is our mana pool.  NBG means greatest need...obviously, his is the greater need.  <br />

Wanting to win a decent cloak on a damn raid (which he didn't win if you'd read a bit BTFW) is certainly not loot whoring.  I have 1200 AC unbuffed and I have VERY good gear for a non-raiding warrior.....I would consider using that cloak.<br />

The only garbage in this thread is from Gerick and people like you sir.  I don't play fucking casters, I play the toons you see, period.  I know that my shaman would have about 300 less HP if it wasn't for the stamina on her gear, and since Cannabalize 5 takes 1924hp (I'll fucking spell it out for you too...ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR), she needs every last goddamned HP she can get to avoid one real big mess should the shit hit the fan right after she hits that button.  You're telling me I don't need HP?  You're off your rocker. <br />
<br />
You don't think enchanters need HP?  When I pull a pair in BoT and he gets a sleep resist, if Arcane rune didn't have a full 1500 hp in it, my enchanter fucking dies, and he's got over 2500hp unbuffed.  But you're right, he doesn't need HP.  Hell, we shouldn't even bother buffing that guy because it's just a goddamned waste.<br />
<br />
How about you guys stop fucking talking about how smart you think you are and actually play something that requires more skill than a LDoN normal adventure and maybe you'll learn a thing or 2 about what's important in this game.  I said it before, and I'll say it again...the only thing ANYONE worries about once they have a halfassed decent set of gear is HP and AC.  If they're worried about anything else, they're a dumbass, just like you guys are for thinking there is anything else to worry about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldn't run out of endurance if I tried, the discs don't fucking refresh fast enough.  Shut the fuck up with this bogus argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Endurance as mana is important. And so stat augments are important. On another thread here, someone points out that 1 point of a stat, like sta, turns out to be 2.5 endurance. So a 6 STA augment not only gives the warrior hit points, it also gives the warrior 15 more endurance.<br />
<br />
That may not seem important you NOW ...<br />
<br />
But what about next month? When the &quot;Openings&quot; system goes live?<br />
<br />
What then?<br />
<br />
That 15 endurance could be important then.<br />
<br />
Melee endurance is akin to mana. And as the game progresses (remember, a new expansion with new skill tomes is on the way) it will become more and more important for melees like warriors.<br />
<br />
STA is now just as important to a warrior as INT is to a wizard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck doesn't have halfway decent stats these days?&quot;<br />
<br />
The person who doesn't have halfway decent stats is the person who would WANT the STA augment in the first place. In Gerick's instance, it turns out that the caster had 60 more STA than him. So Gerick doesn't have the stats, meaning he'd need the STA augment more than that caster.<br />
<br />
The flipside of the argument is, he'd also get just as much endurance from a DEX augment as he would a STA augment. And I'm sure Gerick's passed on some Dex, Str or Agi augments before. I know I have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a fucking focus and quit crying.&quot;<br />
<br />
If that logic applies to Gerick ... the reverse applies to the caster. They can get a fucking focus too, and quit their crying. So why would ANYONE need the sta augment?<br />
They can also get a fucking Clarity and quit crying about their mana pools. So why would they need INT or WIS?<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't run out of endurance if I tried, the discs don't fucking refresh fast enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bullshit. You can run out of endurance easy. Even with 305's across the board. Try it for once. CHAIN your timer 1, timer 2 and timer 3 discs together on one mob. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up with this bogus argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh. It's not bogus. And once openings go LIVE, it will become even more apparent how bogus an argument it isn't. And when the new expansion comes out, it'll become even less bogus.<br />
<br />
You, as a warrior, are now TIED to your endurance pool.  You may not feel it yet. But you will.<br />
<br />
And a warrior DEFINITELY gets more out of a STA augment than an enchanter ever will because of this. Thus, casters who fight melees for endurance boosting augments are doing the melees a disservice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My endurance pool is what...2800 or so?  I've never dropped below 40% endurance, even using Incite liberally and Fellstrike/Charge whenever I remember that they're ungreyed.   You drop that far using thunderkick?  I fucking doubt it.  Worry about the opening system when and IF  it ever goes live.  Right now, you have nothing to worry about as far as endurance goes.<br />
<br />
You've been spouting the &quot;Stats are our mana&quot; shit for a week now, and it's been annoying me since the start.  If this was still the original EQ and fuckin DE rogues started off with 60 str and 60 sta, you'd have a point, but this game is so mudflated now that there really is no reason to be crying over 15 endurance that you can't possibly be using anyway.  I'm sure you're gonna keep on doing it tho, and that's your perogative.  But seriously with shaman buffs, what are you NOT capped on with your stats? Saying that stats are useful now just because they're used for something still isn't entirely accurate because by the time you should be concerned about such things, your str, dex, and stamina should all be max or close to max, and if you've got any version of Avatar on, then it all just became moot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It's ass because everyone needs HP. And who cares what they have now? If I get a +6 STA aug and can drop it in the right slot, I can go get something to replace my (insert here) with something with an AC increase or without a HP loss.<br />
<br />
 It's also ass because the usual horde of 65/300+ Caramellos have to come blasting the poor guy who actually needs STA augs. I mean seriously, take 5 seconds of your EQ life and remember that time when you weren't 00bah_Virtual_Badass_01.<br />
<br />
 Lastly, it's ass because Endurance isn't like mana. Hah. I can think of a good, lessee, Magician, Necro, Shaman, Enchanter, Cleric, Druid, ummm, 6 non-melee classes who still got stuff that can do damage while they're OOM. Thing is, the more endurance I have = more time under discs, more Incites to throw. As it stands with my Magelo, I can pop Defensive and have about 35% of my Endurance pool when it goes - that's enough for about half of a Fortitude. Anything that gives me an extra half second even under discs, I'm gonna grab.<br />

I know a few warriors who claim that their weapon procs more than 2 times a minute, doesn't make it true.  Everyone should know by now that unless you've got a parse to back it up, you don't know shit.<br />
<br />
I said in one of the threads shortly after the patch that it seemed like I had around 2800-3k endurance or so.  Later on, someone puts it together in the bunker that 1 stat point = 2.5 endurance.  I run the numbers of the 280's that I have constantly because I have avatar on the entire time I'm in EQ, and hey hey...2800.<br />

All I am saying is that everyone has the right to stamina if they are not max, because hps are required for everyone.<br />
<br />
and hey, why shouldnt i get intel, wisdom or cha <br />
<br />
For one, they always need hps, no matter the situation (unexpected aggro does happen), not just tradeskilling.  Two, I get DI cast on me a lot, thus I actually do roll on cha augs, without arguement against it.<br />
<br />
IF an aoe goes off((one that wasnt stopped by kick stun or pallys)and they were to damn close) i might not live thru a second ! <br />
<br />
Most ae's can't be interupted, and some are bad enough that they can kill / put in low health aggro casters that haven't put a lot of work into hps.<br />
<br />
I can't even read thru half this garbage. He had a legitimate gripe and all you ubers with super equipment want to bitch at him so your casters don't get left outta the STA augment rolls? <br />
<br />
Legitimate gripe?  He was acting like a childish loot whore.  Also, I don't play any caster, my only alt is a 52 rogue that I don't even play.  As for equipment, I don't see why the equipment of posters matters in an arguement about whether or not casters need hps as much as we do.<br />
<br />
STA is our mana pool <br />
<br />
It's not a mana pool.  Casters only have their mana to rely on for actually doing anything.  We don't rely on our endurance pool.  It is useful for incite and discs, but we can do most of what we do without it.<br />
<br />
and now our MANA too! If I tried to take your Shammies mana you'd scream bloody fucking murder....so don't take mine! <br />
<br />
It's NOT A FUCKING MANA POOL.  We do NOT rely on it to do the majority of our job.<br />
<br />
It's also ass because the usual horde of 65/300+ Caramellos have to come blasting the poor guy who actually needs STA augs. I mean seriously, take 5 seconds of your EQ life and remember that time when you weren't 00bah_Virtual_Badass_01. <br />
<br />
Only one person was blasting based on gear.  That is hardly a horde.  I'm not sure who exactly you are talking about either.  Not one person who lists their magelo in this thread has 300 aas.  I only saw two people who even have elemental armor.  So thats only two who can even be really considered as uber.<br />
<br />
Partha just grab that hit point item even if it has flowing thought and see what the casters say..... <br />
<br />
I guess I must have missed it, but where is the endurance regen on a sta aug?  Not like it even matters since the large difference between a mana pool and endurance pool, they are not that easily comparable.<br />
<br />
Oh, and EoE is usable by war / bard / ranger / rogue.  Someone probably had an anger aug on it which would make it be listed as war only.</div></div><hr />

your telling me that cleric use their hitpoint in almost every single aspect of what they do? hps are the ENCASE they get hit, its not a sure thing, and this was a bitch about groups, that 6 sta augment didnt drop on a raid you know.<br />
<br />
if we get to the point that the cleric and chanter are gona die then i fucked up because i couldnt hold aggro or they fucked up because they over did something, normally the reason someone dies is because of a fuck up(as far as casters are concerned, no caster dies because he went to tank a yellow, got down to 30 percent and then finding out that the cleric was on the toilet, that happens to fighters)<br />
<br />
and you think that extra hp( lets say they have 400 extra hit points from augments) if gona let them live long enough? that is pissed away in 1 or 2 hits, and you do get interupted when your being hit, so really whats it going to help? there is such a thing as frutile, this arguement for example<br />
<br />
fighters need it more than casters, end of story anyone that debates this is a dumbass, there is a big reason we have more hp, plate armor and big swords, and casters have high damage nukes and no protection, its called balance ya know</div></div><hr />

Yes, actually.  Listen, since no logic is getting through your thick skull. CASTERS NEED HPS ESPECIALLY AT THE HIGH END.<br />
<br />

<br />
Casters do get hit by aes you dumbfuck.  Are you always tank?  Do you really need that hps when you aren't?  By your &quot;logic&quot; since you may not be raid tank all the time, you don't need those hps either.</div></div><hr />

NBG = Need Before Greed<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
In pickup groups basically &quot;need&quot; is pretty much always defined by &quot;would you use it on this character.&quot;  In other words, you are rolling to use for yourself not to twink an alt and not to sell.  THAT is how most people define NBG.  There is no variations of who needs it most.  Anyone that can and WOULD use it can roll in a NBG group.<br />
<br />
I voluntarily pass on melee oriented augs (str/dex/sta/agi) unless all the melee in the group pass (which happens often) and then I roll because none of those stats are anywhere near maxed for me.  But for you to say that I don't need them is a bit wrong.  I would use them and get benefit from them.</div></div><hr />

 I've had hybrids get all ass on me because I put myself in for a fucking Face Mask of Frozen Mana when it was a clear upgrade for me. Too many non-pure Melees have the idea that if it says +MANA on it, it disqualifies WAR ROG MNK. If that was Gerick's bitch, I'd back him 120%. As it is, you want to use ridiculous examples.

Well, we'll see. We'll see in two months, when you crybabies start whining about how your endurance pool is so limited, once the new expansion comes out and has even more uses for your endurance pool.<br />

<br />
guess what im saying is that as far it goes in a group setting, you can still nuke with any amount of hp(other than 0 :)) but i can be a pain in the ass to heal with out enough hp, or i can cause the group to stop and wait for mana to get back up because im not very healing efficant<br />
<br />
and your right abou that +mana thing panth, i got all hell of the captive coinslave necklace<br />
<br />
and chum is right, in the future expantion they are adding new  AAs and discplines that are made in mind with the general theme that they will be used on each mob (like incite) and it may be overdone to the point where if you dont use it, you get raped.<br />
<br />
as well as there will be raid enounters where going furious, the fort, then stonewall will be required, the mobs that are out and about rightnow where made with the 1 discpline 1 dead raid mob ideal, now that they are unlinked there will probibly be alot of raids that are reliant on how the pure melee classes link up their abilitys (such as a timed event where group DPS is needed{spirit of rage} and then the end boss needs defensive, would really suck to have only half of defensive usable at the time because you where out of sta</div></div><hr />

<br />
No others helped. He didn't nuke the goblin at all. The damage you see in the parse are from the procs on his weapons. Here's his exact words:<br />
<br />
&quot; In fact, no pets or nukes were used at all. The one spell I cast during the fight is to refresh my damage shield. All the damage was the result of melee, procs or damage shields. I tanked the mob for the entirity of the fight. I did it mostly to prove I could, but also because the thought of soloing a dark blue mob through melee just tickles me somehow. &quot;<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter to me that it's plane of time geared mage.<br />
<br />

 The ONLY class I've seen with a mana bar that doesn't have a way to do any kind of damage after they're OOM is the Wizard. To claim that casters are helpless without mana is a bit disengenuous, provided they have half a clue what they're doing when they have mana in the first place.<br />

My original opinion was that NBG meant if a stat augment dropped priority would go to the class to whom it is the main ability for, ie sta for warriors.  However, as my equipment improves I find that I need the sta less and less.  <br />
<br />
A bard in a group I was in wanted the sta augment (I hold out for Dex and MR) and so did the necro.  The bard says &quot;You don't need hp you need mana&quot; to which the necro replied &quot;Son, for me hp is mana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, Haas, I do need Dex augments.  It  is one of my weaker stats and I dual wield with 4 procs.</div></div><hr />

More hps on chanter / clerics = longer your stupid tank ass lives when you get more then 1 mob as when the chanter / cleric get agro from resisted mez or heal they dont get low hp agro as fast or can survive rampage when they get on it, or if the mob AEs.  <br />

yes warriors use hps more regularly but get your head out of your ass and relize you will die ALOT more if your cleric has 2k hps instead of 5k unbuffed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How ironic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chained all your discs on all of your timers because you're a fucktard? &quot;<br />
<br />
It was a boss mob fight. The kind you're SUPPOSED to go full burn on. Fucktard? Or just someone listening when the raid leader says &quot;GO OFFENSIVE NOW&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Remember Haas, I'm still at raids for my offense. Kind of a hard concept for a warrior who's been beaten about the head far too often by dragons to remember these things. But monks ... they're still a DPS class.<br />
<br />
&quot;For someone who's played so fucking long you sure are certain that they're not gonna implement a completely worthless fucking system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering everything they've implemented THUS far has been useful, you'll have to forgive my optimism in this case.<br />
<br />
They have a track record with EXPANSIONS and new &quot;spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
And make no mistake, these are just melee spells.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't be wasting endurance on that shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it's as useful as incite you will be. But as I said, we'll see. Give it a few months, and see what shakes loose. In the meantime, you can go on acting like you're not a spellcaster now. Won't change the fact that there are going to be times where you ARE out of endurance and you CAN'T activate an ability.<br />
<br />
Nor will it change the fact that warriors get both hit points AND endurance from a STA augment. And an enchanter gets just hit points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pure melee are probably going to start whinging when pure casters start wanting to roll on tome's much like casters started to whinge when pure melee wanted to roll on parchments, though for most warriors this is simply going to come down to the calibre of players we group with.<br />
<br />
As a warrior I have never contested a parchment despite having a 65 caster alt who until recently had alot of spells missing, however I have argued a few warriors right to roll on them.  <br />
<br />
In a pickup group loot is either going to be handled by rolling or by NBG and that should apply to all loot, not NBG on parchments and all roll on ornate for example.  I lost enough RBG's to casters in seb back when I was desperate to upgrade my haste item that I'm not at all sympathetic to casters struggling to fill up their spell book, especially when they will want to roll should anything else sellable drop whether it would be an upgrade for any melee in the group or  not.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse as I mentioned above its going to come down to who you group with.  I don't do many pickup groups and when grouped with friends they will pass on tome's to the pure melee in the group just as we'll be passing on spells to the casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scuse me for spending my money on gear that lets me a) hold agro and b) take the hits instead of a fungi. <br />
<br />
You misunderstand me.  If you have a fungi tunic, it's purpose is to counteract damage you tank when you're not tanking the mob -- IE Ripostes, errant spell damage, AE's.  When you don't need the AC, then use the regen to it's full advantage.  If I'm not tanking, the fungi is on, period.  It's just another tool in the bag, and that's what I tried to explain to gerick.  A 50k tool, but a tool none the less.<br />
<br />
And as for people whining around here when they lose rolls on tomes to casters, expect me to be right in the middle telling them to shut the fuck up.  There isn't a double standard around here, just a difference of opinion.  Some people don't roll on parchments and expect tomes to be handed to them.  Other people compensate for the idiocy in pickup groups and just expect to roll on everything.  As for me, I only group with friends, so it's a non issue.<br />
<br />
I don't think your whining thread is going to be as fun for you as you'd like with about half of us laying the smackdown on the greedy half of the board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man. Some of you group with some pretty messed up people, imo.<br />
<br />
I've yet to buy a piece of ornate armor. It's all been need before greed rolled. (Which means I've yet to roll on anything other than leather sleeves, leather wrists, leather boots and leather cap, all items I needed as upgrades at the time).<br />
<br />
I've never rolled on a parchment or a rune, except that one time when parchment number 7 dropped (was a good day for spells, heh). I lost the roll btw. And didn't care.<br />
<br />
In my one group of close friends, we'll go farm Sol Ro Tower for XPs or whatever, and when ornate drops that none of us need, we sell and split the profits down the middle. Cause we're all friends.<br />
<br />
Who are you people grouping with?<br />
<br />
The last thing I worry about concerning new tomes is who'll beat me for them when they drop. Heh. <br />
<br />
What I worry about is whether or not they're skills actually worth using. (And I'm trying to keep a positive outlook on that, cause, man, I've spent a year being bitter about nerfs and melees and all that, and it wasn't constructive).<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and Haas, I understand you disagree with me on the sta/endurance/abilities thing. Eh, it happens. Don't worry about flaming me. It's the outhouse. I expected the flames. I wouldn't have replied if I didn't expect some heat. Just the nature of the forum.<br />
<br />
And you're right. I could be totally off on the new &quot;enhancements&quot; yet to come. They could totally suck. And then endurance could be a non-issue.<br />
<br />
I don't want them to suck though. So I'm a keep hoping. And keep looking at how useful Incite and some of the disc changes turned out to be.<br />

Granted i probably didnt join any pickup group with Lejina in at least the last 2 years, but i did with my wizard when i level'ed her. That was common to see group members going &quot;Parchment droped&quot; and you would see the pure melees rolling right away and that was still when etheral were still hot shit. I could care less and im not bitter, her spellbook was complete before creation, this isnt my point.<br />
<br />
What im saying its you already have peoples whining for the more absurd things here, thinking they deserve some special treatment from complete strangers in xp groups, and this is only about sta augs.<br />

If it turns out the casters rolling on tomes become a common thing, i hope the few folks with some common sense here wont stop their crusade, cuze the whiny retarded bunch will give a sad show.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't run out of endurance if I tried, the discs don't fucking refresh fast enough. Shut the fuck up with this bogus argument.<br />

I can.  I am a 65 ogre warrior with unbuffed 240 sta and maxed with my PP1.  So 99% of the time I am killing, I am at 285 sta.  I tank, I *always* MT for my guild, and even with our little guild, I can and do run out of End.  Try the AL for once.  My end ran out on him and I could not do another defensive / stonewall.  I could not incite, I couldn't do anything but taunt and hit.<br />
<br />
Just because YOU don't run out of end doesn't mean the rest of us do.<br />

just like aggro is a concept, and just like mana is, these concepts CHANGE, and with an expantion looming around the corner i can ASSURE you it will change, they will be adding +endurance and +endurance effects, the reason you might ask? because its gona become alot more endurance itensive</div></div><hr />

Ya, didn't I see a post where he casts a stamina drain on the tank now? Good fucking example.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea...YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHAIN ALL YOUR SHIT JUST BECAUSE IT'S UP. <br />
<br />
Going full burn and running out of endurance just makes me laugh at you, it doesn't make me see your point any better.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Hi.  Have you actually taunted a higher end mob?  You are starting to sound as stupid as the people you rant about. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO KEEP HITTING INCITE.  Ever fight mobs with a knockback?  See wtf happens to your agro there.  Taunt fails too much and even with people controlling their agro SHIT HAPPENS.<br />
<br />
Generally, you dont have to hit incite much, sometimes you do.  You pissed me off on this one.  <br />
<br />
-----<br />
Your endurance pool is set. Learn to ration it or run the fuck out. When you run out, don't bitch about it because you fucking caused it by using up all of your mystical energy to perform that feat and now you have to rest awhile. What part of this fucking concept don't you get anyway?<br />
-----<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop being a moron and thinking you know all there is to know.  I normally agree with a lot that you say, but in this, you are wrong.  <br />
<br />
You say that in groups, your casters never run OOM, maybe you need to learn to group better.  If you are doing something RIGHT you will run OOM.  Why?  Because you are hitting your max.  If your casters have mana then you are being slow, therefore not getting what you could be getting.  <br />
<br />
Fucking moron.  Get it straight.  You aren't right on this (not the sta aug loot issue.)<br />
<br />
You can, and will, run out of end on big encounters that last a long damn time.  Have you ever actually tanked a single mob for more than 3 minutes?  Ever had a 45 min fight on a single encounter?  try it first then get back to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On that note ... and in keeping in the spirit of this forum ... when was the last time you all had to stop your chain pulling, smooth as silk XP group for a med break?<br />
<br />
Anyone? Anyone?<br />
<br />
It seems more and more these days, spellcasting is getting away from the same penalty that skill using seems to be heading towards.<br />
<br />
What's up with that now?<br />
<br />
Where did the limitation/penalty go for being mana dependent?<br />
<br />
I remember back when I was a youngster, I was grouping the orcs in Highpass (hoping upon hope for Shralok to spawn). It was fast, furious and fun. And we'd have to take periodic med breaks.<br />
<br />
The other day I was in an XP group in Sol Ro tower, and the only breaks that were taken were restroom or smoking breaks.<br />
<br />
But to be fair, since Sol Ro is still an exclusive zone which means people who get there have a lot of good gear usually ...<br />
<br />
The last time I was in a valor group (about two or three weeks ago), there were no med breaks there either.<br />
<br />
What has happened to the penalties and limitations of being spellcaster?<br />
<br />
Discuss. Have fun.<br />

<br />
I am not agreeing with the original poster about the sta aug being only for warriors.  I am also not agreeing about the hate item.<br />
<br />
I am also not stating that that end pools aren't large enough.  I am, however, stating that you *can* run out of end during a normal encounter.  You *can* run out of end without using chaining incite.<br />
<br />
Before the changes, if you had a long fight, you could defensive...wait the 10 min and defensive again.  However, now you cannot.  Yes it actually does make a big difference.  If you have a small guild, with someone low DPS and low on healers being able to defensive twice during a long fight was actually quite big.  Now, you cannot necessarily do it.  I was tanking Lady N the other day in NToV and I was able to do it twice, but because of the stun I was having to hit incite to maintain my agro, and I was not able to get a full reuse of the second defensive.<br />
<br />
I was not chain inciting, I was using what I was used to using.  I never once used any disc other than defensive and only used incite on a rare occasion.<br />
<br />
<br />
For my own little rant:<br />
<br />
There is a major, major, difference I see between caster mana and melee end.  We cannot have ours buffed, and we cannot get an endurance regen spell cast on us.  There is no Paragram of Spirit (however it is spelled) for end.  There is no manasong for end.  IF we do go out of end, we aren't useless, but we lose a lot of abilities that make us tanks.  If casters go OOM, ok, they can get it back quickly because of twitch, KEI, manasong, PoS, etc etc.  We pure melees, do not get this.  On END draining mobs, we lose a lot of our &quot;warriorness.&quot;  Our one defining skill is the ability to tank, ala Defensive / Stonewall.  If we cannot get do our task because our end is gone, then we are a low dps melee with high hps.<br />
<br />
We can try and use taunt, but it is unreliable at best (even though I love the new taunt).  So, personally, and take that as you will, I love and hate the new disc system.  On long fights, it can be great or it can be terrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what you're not getting, and here's where this all ties in real nicely.<br />
<br />
You're bitching about a +6 sta aug because it not only gives you HP, but also increases your endurance pool.  Fine.  Now we got dipshits who insist that on their 45 minute raids, they run out of stamina.  Hello McFly?  What are your stats on these 45 minute raids?  Oh my fucking god, if you're half the tank you claim to be they're fucking maxed because mine are maxed and some of you people are so fucking superior to me because you're a fucking cog in a raid guild.  Don't have a primal?  I'm sure you've got a shaman standing around, don't you?<br />
<br />
So now that your stats are all maxed, what does that do for you?  I'll tell you, jack and shit.  Wanna know something else?  Why was the first flowing thought item put in the game?  Because increasing your mana pool BECAME FUCKING POINTLESS.  All a huge mana pool does is allow you to go full burn for longer.  In the end, a wizard with 3k mana kills just as fast as one with 6k mana except for the first fight, all because they regen exactly the same amount.<br />
<br />
So now you can use your discs all you want, it doesn't matter, because once you're missing endurance, you're at exactly the same spot, stamina aug or no stamina aug.  Once you've run dry, that's it, you're out.  It takes another 7 ticks to get back enough to get an incite back AND NOTHING YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW WILL FUCKING CHANGE IT.<br />
<br />
You wanna whine about new expansions?  Whine when they come out, because you don't fucking know jack shit about them any more than I do, and whining about shit that isn't even happening currently is bullshit.<br />
<br />
Now Gleb, you think you can play with the big boys?  Think again<br />
<br />
Hi. Have you actually taunted a higher end mob? You are starting to sound as stupid as the people you rant about. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO KEEP HITTING INCITE. Ever fight mobs with a knockback?

<br />
Generally, you dont have to hit incite much, sometimes you do. You pissed me off on this one.  <br />
<br />
So you're telling me that you were incapable of holding aggro on any high end mob right?  Shit, we gotta get on the Batphone to Fires of Heaven and Township Rebellion about this, apparantly their warriors didn't actually tank shit before Incite was in the game.  Thanks for the heads up man, I wasn't aware of this.<br />
<br />
You can, and will, run out of end on big encounters that last a long damn time. Have you ever actually tanked a single mob for more than 3 minutes? Ever had a 45 min fight on a single encounter? try it first then get back to me. <br />
<br />
Don't get pissed off at me because you think tanking a mob for 45 minutes is fun.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, there's a difference between running out of mana and rationing it.  Your casters are rationing their mana if they're constantly OOM.  They ran out if you have to stop killing so they can med.  Taking med break =/= rationing your mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First - they aren't grouped with you to equip your loot whore ass, they would use it also, so it is as much their right to go for it as it is yours.<br />
<br />
Second - they don't have to fuck up to need hps.  Especially since you said they were in a Time guild.  HELLO, they have to live through AES.  Yeah, you do your job while you tank, but they do their job while getting hit by aes.  Get it yet or do I need to use smaller words?<br />
<br />
Third - Yes not all mobs ae, so there are times when they don't get hit, but then again there are times you don't tank.  So if you ever have to be in dps mode, then obviously you don't need the hps as much, by your &quot;logic&quot; anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If you're not 65/100+, they're still there. If you're not VT+ geared, they're still there. Insane itemization has reduced all of that, but that's NOT a majority of people in game nowadays.<br />
<br />
 For lower gear/levels people, the biggest reduction in penalties and limitations has been Focus gear and FT. Fortunately, most casual players don't get beyond FT4 yet, so there's still some limits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why was the first flowing thought item put in the game? Because increasing your mana pool BECAME FUCKING POINTLESS. All a huge mana pool does is allow you to go full burn for longer. In the end, a wizard with 3k mana kills just as fast as one with 6k mana except for the first fight, all because they regen exactly the same amount. <br />
<br />
Remember how long ago, in the beginning (close enough) there was this spell called Clarity?  We are at the beginning of end and we have no clarity equiv.  I think that I have a RIGHT to complain about this, esp in THIS forum.<br />
<br />
I thought before that you said that you couldn't run out of end?  Now apparently it is finite and I should deal with it?  <br />
<br />
They applied that concept to your endurance pool. At the moment, it is finite. Fucking deal with it. Jesus goddamned christ, I swear it's like teaching a level 8 wizard mana conservation because he's only soloed his whole life and thinks he needs to go full burn on every fucking ability. <br />
<br />
This is two completely different things.  Jesus, many of us were level 65, 60, max leveled for long, long before there.  We were used to being able to defensive every 10 minutes.  I like the new changes, but all of the sudden there is a new system that is taking away my end and I cannot (possibly) regen it fast enough to do it again.  So now all of the sudden I can only hit taunt and pray.  There are times when you have to chain defensive over and over because mobs just hit too damn hard / clerics need to conserve their mana as much as possible.  What then?  Even conserving you CAN run out of end.<br />
<br />
I couldn't run out of endurance if I tried, the discs don't fucking refresh fast enough. Shut the fuck up with this bogus argument. <br />
<br />
Oh, I guess you different.  Some how the rules of endurance regen are different on your computer.<br />
<br />
So you're telling me that you were incapable of holding aggro on any high end mob right? Shit, we gotta get on the Batphone to Fires of Heaven and Township Rebellion about this, apparantly their warriors didn't actually tank shit before Incite was in the game. Thanks for the heads up man, I wasn't aware of this. <br />
<br />
There is a major difference here, those two guilds are uber, that is their focus, and I am not in one, nor do I really want to be in one.  Therefore my weapons, and gear, aren't as good.  The second being, they never had to deal with this problem when they were tanking AL.  As far as I know there are no PoP gods who sap endurance.  So incite or not, you cannot even do any of your discs let alone incite as the fight progresses.<br />
<br />
<br />
And who the hell thinks tanking a mob for 45 minutes is fun?  Did I ever ANYWHERE state that?  Stop inserting words into my posts.  I never once said that.  <br />
<br />
I don't raid at all. Period. The biggest thing I've ever tanked/killed was my guild's first run at Dozekar a couple weeks ago. <br />
<br />
I now call in question your real ability to argue this point of end regen and tanking of bigger mobs.  Sorry, but if most of your experience is related to tanking for exp groups, there is a hell of a lot of difference.  Normal exp grinding, I don't even run near OOE.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, there's a difference between running out of mana and rationing it. Your casters are rationing their mana if they're constantly OOM. They ran out if you have to stop killing so they can med. Taking med break =/= rationing your mana. <br />
<br />
Now wait a second, I thought you said that if your casters went OOM they sucked.  What happened to that?<br />
<br />
You know how long it's been since my shaman ran outta mana? I can't fucking remember the last time, and I'm willing to bet any caster with their fucking head out of their ass can't either. With FT, KEI, MC, Bard shit, Beastlord buffs, Blessing of the nine and whatever else they got these days NO ONE RUNS OUT OF FUCKING MANA. MANA POOL IS IRRELEVANT. <br />
<br />
So which is it?  Rationing or having their head in their ass?<br />
<br />
<br />
Going to stop this now, since like you said to Wu earlier, I like you and don't want to hate you.  You mainly have good stuff to post and are a smart, albeit hostile, poster. <br />

Gerick's a loot whore, because he wanted to NOT roll against an enchanter for a stamina augment. Gerick, who's gear is lacking, and probably NEEDS the stamina augment.<br />

&quot;Which ones do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
The limitations I refer to are running out of mana from time to time. The whole having to ration thing Haas is talking about. Caster rationing USED to be much more restrictive and a much bigger penalty they faced. But over the course of the many expansions and the dumbing down of the game ... it's simply not like it used to be. Downtime for spellcasters THESE days is usually, as I've noted in my anecdotes, only brought on by having to go to the restroom or answer the phone or get a drink of water.<br />
<br />
I haven't had to sit back during an XP group for an OOM/LOM med break in ages.<br />

All that person wanted was an EQUAL right to something he would use, was an upgrade, and he helped earn.

Their gear doesn't matter if they would use the item, in a pick up group, and haven't looted other items already.  Yeah, they have good gear compared to him, but what about compared to what they fight?  Since they are rolling, they could use more for doing what they do.  You surely don't expect a Time geared person to go around equiping people they don't know when they could use the stuff as an upgrade?  Seriously, like I said a while back, you people need to stop expecting others to just hand you everything and actually accept that others (even with good gear) are working towards upgrades too.<br />
<br />
To them, they need more sta, and gerick needed more sta, and anyone else who wanted to roll needed more sta.  They have a need for it as much as he does, yet he is demanding that they don't get a shot at something they could really use.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you know all about me don't you!  Listen you pathetic loot whore.

The entire point is that you were trying to deny them an equal chance at an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Since you brought it up, and accused me of being a loot whore like yourself, I'll explain how I do things.  I only roll on items I would use, and often turn down items I would use that were minor upgrades.  I don't do pick up groups at all, mainly because of immature children like yourself who think the world revolves around them.  Instead I group with these things called friends, you should try getting some sometime.  All loot is done based on who would use the most.</div></div><hr />

But you go and call Gerick a loot whore on one hand and then say that the enchanter with 60 more STA in a higher end guild who's gear shits all over the tanks is NOT a loot whore?<br />
<br />
Maybe we have different opinions as to what constitutes a loot whore.  Ok, not maybe but obviously.<br />
<br />
You have a chanter or cleric who sees a sta aug drop which they would use - is an upgrade to them and as such when the group comes to deciding who should loot they choose to roll.<br />
<br />
You have a warrior who feels that he has inferior gear to these players and because he is the tank he has a greater need or greater right to this same item and thinks they should defer the drop to him.<br />
<br />
The chanter/cleric in this group haven't suggested Gerick shouldn't roll, they are happy for him to have a fair shot at the aug.  Who is the loot whore again?  <br />
<br />
Why is a caster labeled a loot whore just because they want a shot at a bit of loot they helped get and would use simply because a melee wants it too?  <br />
<br />
By the same logic a warrior is a loot whore if he wants to roll on a cha aug if there is a chanter there who wants it too because surely a chanter has more need.  Is a hybrid is a loot whore if they want to roll on a parchment when a pure caster still needs the spell? - pretty similar circumstance also.</div></div><hr />

Is a hybrid is a loot whore if they want to roll on a parchment when a pure caster still needs the spell? - pretty similar circumstance also<br />
<br />
I don't see the similarity there, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The justification used earlier by Gerick was that only melee and hybrids should roll on the sta aug as their role was to get hit and the other members of the group shouldn't be getting hit and therefore don't need the additional HPs as much.<br />
<br />
By the same logic, a pure caster needs a full spell book more than a hybrid as their role is solely the casting of spells rather than occasionally casting spells and where this new loot system of (Greatest)NBG is applied a pure caster should get a parchment ahead of a hybrid.<br />
<br />
Admittedly its stretching the logic somewhat but when NBG becomes Greatest Need Before Greed where do you draw the line?</div></div><hr />

You mainly have good stuff to post and are a smart, albeit hostile, poster.  <br />
<br />
Gleb --<br />
<br />
You're confusing skill with game limitations, and altho you did a whole lot more work trying to fuck with me than anyone else in this thread, it's clear you missed the point there.<br />
<br />
I can have a finite amount of mana, and still be intelligent enough to use it correctly (IE : not run out).<br />
<br />
I can have a finite amount of endurance, and be intelligent enough to not run out and bitch about it.  Like it or fucking not, endurance was A GODDAMNED UPGRADE for your sorry ass, and we got people bitching here that it wasn't good enough.  &quot;Man, I can only chain furious, then defensive and then I don't even have enough left over to do stonewall, this sucks ass&quot;  Dude, a month ago, you wouldn't have been able to do JACK AND SHIT other than defensive once every 9 minutes, and now you want to be able to do everything at a whim.  It's quite obvious they want you limited.  Know your limits, work with them, and fucking figure out how to ration it, or run out and be a warrior without his special skills for awhile.  That's the tradeoff.  It's the same with manapool, if you're fucking intelligent, you don't run out of mana, you don't need med breaks.  You can constantly be at 20% and be driving your group's kill count thru the roof and it doesn't mean that you're out of mana.<br />
<br />
Second, everyone seems to think they need to incite like 45000 times on raids.  Fuck that shit.  Go look at some posts from this past summer.  NO ONE bitched about fucking aggro on raids, that's not what Incite was added for.  On raids you've got everyone working together to make sure that YOU have aggro.  You get a headstart, you're standing closer to the mob, hopefully you've got some aggro proccing weapons working for you after a few seconds, no one burns until you've got an established aggro lead.  Warriors don't have any problems when everyone is working on the warrior's aggro.  Incite was added to the game to help the situations out where warriors had the hardest time...the initial seconds of an XP group mob.  Read it again so it's clear for you.  Warriors had no way of generating their own aggro on demand in an XP group and THAT IS WHY INCITE WAS ADDED.  It was not added to help your fucking raid out.  If you want to use it on a raid, be my guest, but you do not fucking need it, and warriors DID NOT fucking need it on raids for 5 years now, so chaining Incite on raids just makes me think that you're either asking to run out of endurance, or just have a shitty raid.<br />
<br />
Like I said, nice try twisting my words around, but it's not gonna work.  I know what I'm saying, and it's the same thing I've been saying all along.  If you know what the fuck you're doing, you shouldn't be OOM, out of endurance, whatever.  If you're an idiot, then yeah..you're probably gonna run out and come here and whine about how unfair it is.  How about we go back to the old system huh?  No discs except defensive every 9 minutes, maybe that make you happier?</div></div><hr />

If they WOULD USE the Orb and you wouldn't, then by NBG, then you wouldn't roll. If they would simply sell it, then you should all roll. Augs are no drop, people don't roll unless they will use, so your analogy doesn't work. Everyone needs STA, get over it.  <br />
<br />
i saw the chanter today, still using what he was before, and to clarify, are you saying that a person should have the chance to say (random number here) 4 items in a row and screw out everyone else? even if they are selling it?<br />
<br />
also so they need these HP augments for (from what most of you say) raids that help only their gear, me being a better warrior, who is easyer to heal, helps anyone and everyone im with, just thought id point out another reason why its more usful to me...<br />
<br />
a loot whore to me? someone who rolls on items that are going to sit in a bag or bank and NEVER get pulled out for use, someone who is guiltless about winning more than 2 things in a row and feels slighted when asked to wait untill everyone has had a blue dimond, someone who has never heard or thought of an item, seeing it the first time and wanting to be in on the roll for something shiny, and then selling it, a lootwhore is someone who wants EVERYTHING for themselves, all i wanted was some GOD DAMNED HP, if i won that augment i would stay out on everything else for the rest of the day untill we each had 1 prize to take home<br />
<br />
and haass, your telling me that FT was added because big mana pools dont mean much past a certain point,<br />
<br />
um if i have 4000 mana, and im on a horse and i regen 32 a tick VS. 3000 mana and 32 a tich, person B will still run out of mana, and so will person A, but person A can afford to ration out more than person b (more damage in the same time space) and person A will regen mana, as will person B as they are firing off spells, but the in the time it takes person A and B to go OOM, they would have regen'd mana at a rate of 32 a tick, meaning 4000 mana, plus regen'd mana(person A) would be able to ration out more mana in the same timespace (more damage in the same amount of time) tell me again the woes of how useless mana is when you pool gets bloated, ill grab a tissue and put out a candle for the poor forgottan casters</div></div><hr />

Need before greed does not work in pickup groups.  Open roll works, it's the only thing that's fair.  How the fuck is your group supposed to know that you're not time geared, but just brought out the pussy gear just to win rolls based upon &quot;I need it?&quot;  They don't.  Just as you don't know their own personal situation and can't tell them that it's not fair for them to roll on things they helped earn.<br />
<br />
Comprende?</div></div><hr />

LoL.<br />
<br />
I can't believe I just read that.<br />
<br />
Now you make me want to go camp Crescent armor and Shiverback. See if that tactic works.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a chanter or cleric who sees a sta aug drop which they would use - is an upgrade to them and as such when the group comes to deciding who should loot they choose to roll.&quot;<br />
<br />
With 265 base stamina, a 6 stamina augment is NOT an upgrade to anyone. Including an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Remember Haas' earlier point about getting some buffs and shutting up? I think it also applies to the enchanter who it seems not only walked away with the STA augment BUT also a delightful orb of forgotten magic that is probably STILL for sale on that person's bazaar mule as they are now flooding the market.<br />
<br />
But Gerick's the loot whore? <br />
<br />
Riiiiiiight.<br />
<br />
As Hussar said ... there's a reason why I also  tend to group with my friends a lot. So crap like that doesn't happen to me often. And when it does, it's easy to ignore.</div></div><hr />

Could have been buffed, we dont know, do we?<br />
also, getting 305 stamina unbuffed is a goal some people want to achieve. if you're fine with getting crap buffs every raid to max stats you failed to max yourself this is fine, but as one shaman on our raid already says<br />
&quot;Send tells for focus, for sta, spend DKP&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's late. The only response I have for that is ... it's a pretty weak rationalization.<br />
<br />
And doesn't at all sway me from thinking the enchanter is just as much a loot whore, for the exact SAME reasons that everyone thinks Gerick is a loot whore.<br />
<br />
The enchanter, who rolled on a STA augment AFTER winning a delightful orb.<br />
<br />
As Hussar stated in one of his posts:<br />
<br />
&quot;Their gear doesn't matter if they would use the item, in a pick up group, and haven't looted other items already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, this enchanter already looted OTHER ITEMS.<br />
<br />
&quot;if you're fine with getting crap buffs every raid to max stats you failed to max yourself this is fine,&quot;<br />
<br />
You have what, 14 buff slots?<br />
<br />
I myself use a max of 12, and that includes illusions and junk buffs. What the heck are you getting at here Trondir?</div></div><hr />

You have 12 buffs? add SD, add VoQ and add BoR. now you have 15. THat leaves zero room for ANY Healing over time, which is badly required in EPs to counter some AEs, that will cause DoTs to overwrite your first buff.<br />

Because there are no &quot;new&quot; spells past Rallos Zek that enter the game. So I know what buffs are needed now. They don't change.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have 12 buffs? add SD, add VoQ and add BoR.&quot;<br />
<br />
Read what I posted Trondir. I said I have a maximum of 12 buffs. That INCLUDED junk buffs (of which VoQ and BoR tend to be) and ILLUSIONS.<br />
<br />
Manage your buffs better Trondir. That's all I can say.<br />
<br />
That enchanter CAN INDEED do a raid WITH a STA buff. I know many enchanters who raid with Boar up. They even have illusions up. They're not selling themselves SHORT on buffs.<br />
<br />
So what is it you're using that you are having trouble fitting a STA buff into your window?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 Grim Aura (Clicky)<br />
2 Shield of the 8th (Clicky)<br />
3 Nine<br />
4 Kazad<br />
5 Gallantry ... it's quite dubious that an enchanter would want this buff. <br />
6 Focus<br />
7 Boar<br />
8 Avatar ... WHY would an enchanter want this buff?<br />
9 Vallon ... WHY would an enchanter want this buff?<br />
10 Druzzil<br />
11 Seasons ... this buff is only needed on SOME encounters.<br />
12 Replen ... another dubiously useful buff on anyone NOT standing in AE range.<br />
13 Thorns ... WHY would anyone BUT the tank want this buff?<br />
<br />
Your buffs ... and a level 65 enchanter's buffs can indeed differ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And to keep this all in perspective, consider THIS ...<br />
<br />
The only person I've seen complaining about BUFF SLOTS and BUFF management on a Level 65 Enchanter in Time Raid guilds, is TRONDIR.<br />
<br />
And he's doing it to JUSTIFY an enchanter with 60 more base stamina than Gerick needing a 6 STA augment, on the WEAK premise that the enchanter wants to max out unbuffed STA to make raiding more EFFICIENT.<br />
<br />
Which means he's only doing it as an extreme hypothetical, simply because he doesn't want to grudgingly admit that MAYBE the ENCHANTER ... the same enchanter who walked out of this encounter with TWO LOOTS ... is just as MUCH of a loot whore as Gerick is/was.<br />
<br />
What's more reasonable people? That an enchanter you never met in a pickup group is just as greedy as anyone else?<br />
<br />
Or that this enchanter, who's suffering so much in gear he outstrips a warrior, NEEDS 6 more points of stamina so he can manage his buffs better the next time his guild takes on Quarm?<br />
<br />
This is how far off track this discussion has gotten. We've got WARRIORS listing their BUFF SLOTS figuring out how an enchanter fits a stamina buff into the mix.<br />
<br />
Before responding, think about the last raid you attended. Were the enchanters in your guild complaining about buff management?<br />
<br />
Mine don't. And their stamina isn't maxxed.</div></div><hr />

So, you first say that we shouldn't talk about caster buffs.  So a warrior posts his buffs (not implying anything at all about enchanter buffs), and you get on him about that.  Make up your mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's far more likely this enchanter, who walked out of the encounter with both a Delightful Orb AND a STA augment ... is just as greedy as anyone else you meet in a pickup group.<br />
<br />
And that going off on this stupid ass BUFF tangent, which was TRONDIR'S idea, is pointless.<br />
<br />
What do you think Hussar?<br />
<br />
Is the enchanter just as guilty as Gerick? Or is it more likely what Trondir says? That the person is having a hard time juggling buffs at a raid and can't juggle Boar into the mix?<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, Haas, is right. Gerick started this post, whining. And as such, I'm not defending him, per se. He brought the attention, and thus flames on himself. <br />
<br />
I'm just saying, we all know this scenario.<br />
<br />
A pickup group.<br />
<br />
With strangers.<br />
<br />
And someone who doesn't need the items at all walks out of the group with like half the haul for the night.<br />
<br />
It doesn't bug me much, because like many of you, I spend most of my time in game with friends. Who don't do that kind of shit.<br />
<br />
But I don't think the enchanter here is all that &quot;innocent.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
To walk away with 2 pieces of loot with others not getting an item is the same as what gerick did imo.  He might not be that bad if he was used to group like mine where augs and real loot are completely seperate and his train of thought might have been stuck on the old way.  Or he could have been one of those people who roll on every piece of loot no matter if he won things earlier.  We really don't know at this point.

<br />
Its also about him getting shitty over some roll for a cloak that he was going to use as a situational haste item also.  Fark, sure you might not be happy about a caster rolling on it, but if I was a melee / hybrid who would have used that cloak full time for haste then I'd be even shittier about you wanting to roll NBG so you could have a DPS haste item aswell as a tanking haste item.  Pots, kettles and loot whores.<br />
<br />
Personally I can't wait till I dont need a stamina buff, its such a PITA as it is having to make sure you click off every buff you dont need as it gets MGB'd - C5, SD, BoR, that cleric faster spell casting one, DMF cos our necros all went and got MGB just to piss us off, FoE cos the army of druids is upset about only having one spell to MGB between them etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll keep it simple for ya Trondir:<br />
<br />
1- I can and will see 305 unbuffed. So kindly shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
2- You should manage your buffs better. So kindly shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
3- You don't know the enchanter in question. Odds are he was just being as greedy as Gerick, and your wild THEORY of buffs had nothing to do with it. So kindly shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
4- The buffs you have to MAKE room for, a pure caster and a pure melee simply doesn't. So kindly shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
5- There are quite enough buff slots for most of us to deal with easily. The ONLY person here bitching about needing a STA augment because of buff mismanagement is you. So kindly shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
God you're an idiot. It's REALLY simple to grasp why the enchanter wanted the STA augment.<br />
<br />
Because he WANTED it. Because he wanted 6 more unbuffed STA. Because he wanted a delightful orb of forgotten magic. It's either the person is a greedy loot whore, or as was previously suggested, and thought tradable loots and augments didn't count together. Either way, your theory about buffs has the remotest change of being correct.<br />

It's still irrelevant if that caster was a loot whore anyways. He has the very same right on the aug was gerick</div></div><hr />

Right on Rag.  I am starting to feel this way myself.  A guild group is different but I don't know how many times a caster has needed a spec (because he was missing one or two spells) and was in the bazaar two hours later making 10-15k on the dupe he just got.  <br />
<br />
haha, sorry im not that interested in the rest of the discussion although FA (or even an SoP if it isnt available) and CoR are two of my favorite buffs.<br />

i don't see where the shortage of endurance is either.  i was tanking agnarr the other night  from about 76% health until he was dead when the first tank went down and managed to aetaunt, furious, defensive and then later in the fight defensive again and then finish up with fellstrike right before enrage :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh ya, Gerick, yer a whiner.  There we go, back on track.  <br />
<br />
heh funny you should say that, most of the people insulting me only did so because they followed suit with you, as standing near you makes them feel safer, imo i think your one of the few flammers that do so by themself, right away with out waiting for back up to make it all 1 sided, i just have to laugh at everyone else who comes in and spouts their shit ONLY after you have said something, and only when they dont conflict with you.<br />
<br />
this thread wasnt about what classes i think should and shouldnt get STA augments, untill you all turned it into that, this was about a time enchanter and his cleric friend being overly greedy and the things compounding my hate for asshole in general, this post was all about venting and since im came to the outhouse, i expected people to bitch back at me, but you said something about what the chanter doing is no worse than what i did, what the hell did i do but walk away with nothing gained?<br />
<br />
the thing is you cant judge need be for greed all that well because anyone can say they need something, but you can tell who is full of shit really quickly, like when you see em the next day using the same weapon they had last time you saw them(meaning the orb must not have been needed)<br />
<br />
as for how it came in i already explained, do you lack reading comprehention? i dont follow people around to make sure they are using what they win, like i said i just happend past him, hard to forget the name and dye job of an asshole you put on your ignore list.<br />
<br />
by the way a friend of mine just got into the GoD beta, to start with, all i can say is that you will start caring about endurance, and the second thing i will say is berserker arnt even 20% complete, i took a hour drive to learn how gimp they are hahaha, i dont think they will be balanced or finished at GoD launch<br />

While that may be, I'm also one of the earliest posters to hit the boards in the mornings too because of my overnite schedule, this means that I tend to hit threads before everyone else even wakes up, thus they HAVE to reply after me, whether they're jumping on a bandwagon or not.  It's okay to voice your opinion after someone else has voiced theirs on a medium such as a messageboard. It doesn't necessarily make you part of a bandwagon.<br />
<br />
Plus i'm not afraid to tell you what I think of you.  This is a fucking internet message board..what are you gonna do? Tell my mommy?  If you're too pussy to tell people what you think of them on the internet, it might be time to schedule some self confidence classes or some shit.</div></div><hr />

Two time characters now and who are not maxed in sta?<br />
After this it's pretty funny...<br />

but i can see the point of a caster wanting that to use, which is what i thought that chanter was going to, i was wrong.<br />
<br />
Not only you are greedy, but totally dumb and clueless of other classes need and roles ( hello a &quot;time enc &quot; in need of the orb and not hp ? lol... ), and I would say about even your class ( haste issue cloak ).<br />
 <br />
To the people argueing about buff slots,   how can you forget BoR for a caster ( just an exemple ) ? .<br />
<br />
And if indeed it was a time character ( can happen to not have max sta but still laughable that you add this so late, and after the &quot;orb&quot; thing ), boar buff = one slot totally useless for quarm for exemple, and a couple hp more or less can make the difference on this fight, so they really have to be max in sta.</div></div><hr />

I doubt there were many who were just following Haass.  Want to know why so many came?  You sounded like a loot whore bitch.  A large amount of people saying so doesn't mean they were followers, it could just mean you were wrong and most people saw that.

No, I just don't trust you enough to believe that what you said was true, since it was added so late when you were losing the arguement.  It just sounded too convenient to me, especially since you were calling him a loot whore yet didn't mention that he already got loot earlier?<br />

Overly greedy?  They wanted an equal shot at an upgrade for them.  And even IF the enchanter did get an orb, the cleric didn't, so how is it greedy to want an equal shot?  As for why it turned into who should or should not get a sta aug, YOU are the one who said they didn't deserve an equal shot since they were casters.  YOU were the one trying to keep others from getting loot they would use as an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

why didnt i say something sooner, because i honestly thought the enchanter would use it in day to day life, unlike the STA augment that may be useful in 10 percent of that toons entire time played</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerick the problem with NbG is that in a Pickup you have to make clear rules about stuff.<br />
<br />
This could sound like. When someone got a piece he is out until all got one piece or he can roll but had to give the other back ... <br />
<br />
The second problem is the definition of Need.<br />
<br />
There are several classes wo do need as much HP as possible. When you reach the cap in STA you spare a buffslot ( never enough of them on a raid ) So for an enchanter with around 250 Sta there is a way to go to max it. In that way he is in need of each point of sta.<br />
<br />
When you as a tank &quot;only&quot; have around 200 Sta you need that stuff also - maybe more in an objektive way then he did - but thats only a quantity question.<br />
<br />
Didn`t remember if I wrote it already in this threat but I am always rolling on charism augment ( no success until now ) against these bards and chanters.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, that stamina augment is not useful for you even 10% of the time either. <br />
<br />
How many times have you been healed with less than 36hp?  That stamina augment only means something to you if you get healed with 35hp or less left.  After that, it's just another slot on the magelo, even for a tank there bud.</div></div><hr />

Well, there was this one time (4th dungeon of the night iirc), when the cleric started getting sloppy.  He has a bad habit of waiting until the pull to drop a CH ... right after the pull.  Iono why ... at any rate, a bad pull comes in and I see I'm gonna drop fast and I'm howling HEAL at the monitor and go furious, etc ...  nuffin.  I see the CH macro, and I know it's gonna be *painfully* close, but I hit the ground.<br />
<br />
For 1/3 a second ... I fall, the camera shifts to that *You dead now Joe!* overhead shot, the CH lands, and I bounce back up still swinging at the MOBs.  The party survived.  If I coulda picked out 35 HP seperately from the rest, I woulda kissed 'em :D.</div></div><hr />

&lt;&lt;My shaman is fucking TWO BOXED. Do you understand what that means? that means while I'm pulling, and killing shit, my shaman is standing up. She ain't doing jack and shit, except malos, slow, epic DoT, keeping my group happiliy Avatared and tossing in a nuke or a DoT once per fight. Do you know what a REAL shaman can do? When I decide to put Haass down for a nite and play only Cagna, my group's XP rate doubles.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
do you realize what you just admitted to the board haass? you admitted that your shaman contributes only half his keep to the group but gets his full split of experience. my term for this is &quot;experience leeching&quot; and its why i refuse to group with anyone who 2-boxes. ive always suspected i was getting cheated when ive done it in the past but now i have the testimony of a high level that i was right all along. only pulls half his weight haass? shame on you for cheating your group of experience like that.</div></div><hr />

First off, i think Gerick is a moron for thinking he needs the STA more than anyone else.  Secondly, after hearing about the aug and the haste cloak, i also think he is the loot whore.  Lastly, if the way he handled things was exactly how he said, i also think he is an asshole.<br />

Haha what a schmuck you are. Yes, it's better not to exp at all because you cant find a slower instead of grouping with a 2boxer.<br />

I'll tell you what dumbass.  You find ANY similarly geared group you want of random fucktards that you call friends, and you slap together a group and put them right next to mine which consists of <br />

1.  Me<br />
2.  My 2 boxed Shaman with a full spellbook (not a fuckin piece of shit wanna be shaman who doesn't have any spells they didn't loot)<br />
3. My Warrior friend<br />

5. My rogue friend's 2 boxed druid.<br />
6. My rogue friend's 3 boxed Enchanter.<br />

And you watch as we not only trump your XP rate, but we handle pulls that would make your fucking cleric gate.  You see, I'm one of the few people on this board who never bitches about pickup groups, and yet I'm 65 with 170aa's and some of the best tradable gear in the game.

<br />
There is an order to the EQ world, and that doesn't make YOU a loot whore, it just means you have a clue about the mechanics of the game.<br />
<br />
If I am in a pickup group and I get even a wiff that there is someone who wants to loot whore and grab an item they don't need, I force a general roll off and high roll picks. Then there is no debate; this is why I prefer to play with people I know, which by controlling the slower and/or healer for a group I can usually do :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My secondary character is a cleric (no I didn't buy him off ebay, I levelled him up from Jan 2000 my own GD self the hard way, I know how to play a cleric, thanks). I play my main and have the cleric macrod up well.<br />
<br />
95% of the time I perform as well (or better than) most single box clerics. So if I am performing my role, who is getting cheated with exp?<br />
<br />
Heck I play with other duobox people all the time, if they want to... and further if people don't like to play with me when I am duoboxing, I don't begrudge them that; it's a free world in EQ :)<br />
<br />
Lets face it, there are some camps in EQ that are so tediously easy that any moron can duobox easily - PoV comes to mind.<br />
<br />
There are other things harder - like hard ldons - but I am good enough to do those and I do all the time. But that's just me, and its my combo -<br />
<br />
Melee (monk) on main box, cleric on second.<br />
<br />
I tried duoing a mage - too complicated couldnt do it efficiently, even a shaman can be more complicated.<br />
<br />
A cleric is very easy to play as a second char in a duo. Nothing personal to clerics (like I said he was my main originally so I can appreciate playing a cleric main).<br />
<br />
If someone wants to duo like a chanter, necro, mage, beastlord, or one of the more 'robust' pet and casting classes then they got to have better reflexes than me. But again - its a free world baby.</div></div><hr />

hope you are taking your blood pressure medicine haass. you seem to get wound up really easy. i dont doubt you are an expert warrior just like im an expert druid. but im only a &quot;capable&quot; warrior not an expert. just dont like grouping with 2-boxers thats all.<br />

When you say shit like my shaman only contributes 50%, well that's just straight up bullshit.<br />
<br />
You see, my shaman contributes the most important thing anyone could ever contribute, and that's Avatar.  Avatar alone on every melee in the group will smoke the living shit out of any other support class DPS.  Just because i'm not standing around on her meleeing like some weak motherfuckers or cannabalizing constantly in order to pound out yet another massive 925 nuke (I know, l33t eh?), doesn't mean she doesn't contribute.  The other thing she contributes is a full spellbook, and believe me, that's rare amongst your level 65 gimps these days.  &quot;Oh nos, focus iz too expensive, Quiescence is too expensive&quot;  Stop fucking XP'ing in Plane of Valor and maybe you can afford something.<br />
<br />
I've actually had a few non guildies join on my XP grinds lately, and I've heard secondhand from people they were talking to while they were with me that I was pulling too fast for them and they didn't have time to do anything.  I had a beastlord complain he was OOM the whole time and didn't have time to buff him or his pet.  Ya, sorry you don't have mana to give yourself an agility there pal, here, take an avatar and shut up.  I'll tell you what buffs you need.<br />
<br />
I've been 2 boxing my shaman for about 3 years now.  Last year I got an invite from one of the 2nd tiered guilds on the server on EACH character after one of their officers saw me mowing shit down.  This guy had zero idea I played both, and in fact, I didn't offer that information until about a week later, then they decided that I had to choose a main character for loot purposes.  Well fuck man...you couldn't tell the difference for a week but now that you know it's not kosher?  Assuming everyone is some gimp who can't control his main character let alone his 2nd isn't going to go over well with me.  I fully understand that the majority of people playing this game fall into that category, but calling me out and telling me that I do when you've got jack and shit for credibility on the subject isn't going to elicit a good response there pal.</div></div><hr />
