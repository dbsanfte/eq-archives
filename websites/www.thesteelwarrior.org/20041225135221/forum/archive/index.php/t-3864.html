<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakanina</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, I'm new to the boards and there's a lot to look through here, so if there is someplace already I can read about this, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Here's the deal.  I'm a 51 Warrior.  My weapons atm are Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood (not that great, I know) and Defender's Lightblade.  Haste item is SCHWs.  Rest of my gear is on my Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=687244&amp;resize=true) if you care to see.  I have a piercer and a 1hb (check the tailored large bag on my Magelo if ya want) but they're not that good either, so I use the 2 1hs's when I am supposed to MT.<br />
<br />
I was in Hate fighting at the zone-in tonight with a 50 SK, 62 and 58? druids, 55 chanter, 54 shammy, 60 wizard.  The SK was pulling, I was trying to be MT but it kept bouncing.  This SK seems to know a lot about aggro and how to control it.  He said he was not using spells and we were trying to use the distance thing (I was closest to mob), but he was still able to steal aggro from me.  He even switched to an Ebon Mace and his 1hb skill was 55 he said.  His haste item is Sporali Gloves, which he said mine was higher.  Other than that, we had all the same buffs from our group.<br />
<br />
Now he said he was watching my damage and that I was doing more than him.  He also cast his aggro increaser spell on me (Voice of the Shadows I think it was called).  The chanter was going to HV me but it wouldn't stack with the SK one and she wasn't used to using it so she gave up.<br />
<br />
He couldn't figure out why he kept stealing it.  Perhaps it had to do with the higher level casters?  Perhaps I just am bad at it? /shrug  Perhaps the SK really doesn't know what's what?<br />
<br />
I wasn't mashing taunt when I had aggro, but did keep pushing it when I didn't.  I was trying to tag with an arrow as he pulled but didn't always hit.  One suggestion he had was to swap the weapons, but the DL in main and the VAotVB in off-hand; I thought it was better to have the proc in main hand, but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
I really don't have a problem with letting other people tank, but when I am supposed to do it, I want to do it the best I can!<br />

<br />
 One, he was hitting his taunt button as well.<br />
<br />
 Two, you were having a really hard time with the RNG. Yes, that does happen.<br />
<br />
 Three, he or you might not have had the distance quite right, or you/he might have been lagging, so the server would report the wrong position.<br />
<br />
 Also, keep the Axe in main hand - not only does it proc more from the main hand, you get more swings with it, therefore more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From other posts on this same board I can say that mainhand generates a lot more aggro than offhand, and if he was wielding ebon mace (9/18?) mainhand I could see him taunting over a 11/24 mainhand the times you didnt get early procs in.<br />
<br />
Also from the same post it says that the aggro from a common one groupable 2hb in BOT, the  41/31 one with a proc is more than most 1h combos up to plane of time.<br />
<br />
There is another good 2hb out of BOT, a 31/30 with a stun proc, its only like 500p on Rallos Zek server and we usually price our weapons high.  You could try saving up and getting one of those.<br />
<br />
I know my old MT seemed to do better with the 31/30 than with his 1h weapons (12/19 with 160 fire proc and 12/19 with stun proc).<br />
<br />
Try that 31/30 weapon out maybe it helps.<br />
<br />
Also some of the problem was probably from him pulling, first aggro (pulling) on the mob gives a rather large hate bonus assuming the person is actively continuing to generate hate (also from this board).  But due to circumstances I dont think you coulda solved this without him FDing 3 or 4 times per mob before he engaged it.  <br />
<br />
That could have also been a lot of the problem.<br />

<br />
The 31/30 weapon you're talking about is the Greatstaff of Thunder.  It sells for about 300 on my server and is a huge bargain when you consider how much aggro its proc generates.  It won't do quite as much damage as other weapons you might try but it can hold its own in the aggro department.<br />
<br />
Also, the post above is right about intial pull aggro.  One feign spell, though, would go a long way to reducing the SK's aggro.  Even if the feign failed to mem wipe the mob the SK would miss a few attacks, further reducing his relative aggro.  Hey, it works for monks, right?<br />
<br />
On a tangent, a recent thread here indicates the strong possibility that aggro per swing is based solely on the damage rating, damage bonus and delay of the weapon.  Whether you hit or not, get a critical or how much damage you do seems to make no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hakanina - First off, the others are right.  The Greatstaff of Thunder will do a much better job for holding aggro and it is sub 1K on all servers now, terrific weapon for the price.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question as to why, ask him what he was pulling with...?  I am guessing he was pulling with Siphon Strength or something along those lines.  If he was pulling with anything other than proximity, cancel magic or an arrow shot, then he is getting both the First Aggro bonus (which remains throughout the fight, UNLESS he successfully feigns or someone mem blurs) AND a large batch of hate from the debuff he used to pull with.  In that type of situation I would either suggest tagging off him feigned, or ask him to pull with the cancel magic line/an arrow (zero residual aggro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakanina</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the fast responses!<br />
<br />
One of my druid friends told me about the Greatstaff, she said someone was using it in her group and was able to hold the aggro through her heals.  She actually picked one up for me last night, she saw it for 220p.  It's required 55, though, so I got a ways to go, but it'll give me time to get my skill up as that is the one that I lack.<br />
<br />
I asked him what he was pulling with, and I don't remember what he said, but it wasn't an arrow and it wasn't cancel magic.  If I got a successful bowshot on the pull (before he melee engaged), the mob would turn to me, but still wouldn't stay on me during the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was the SK dotting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakanina</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He said he wasn't casting, and I thought I said that above.  So unless he dot'd to pull, then no.<br />
<br />
This wasn't the whole night, btw.  I think he noticed how hard a time I was having and stopped doing a lot of things to try and see if I could keep the aggro.  But even when he stopped casting and switched to the weapon he was bad at, he would still steal it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a Great Staff of Thunder when you turn 55 but don't worry about it for now since you can't use it.<br />

The best way to reduce your problem with agro is to get a copper hammer of striking (about 10k) which procs at level 1.  The copper hammer in main hand will help agro immensly. If you plan on tanking in pop, you will also need a lot more hit points than you currently have so start replacing a lot of that gear you have with stuff that has more hit points.  Right now you are going to run a cleric out of mana really fast and its a wise investment to do it.<br />
<br />
For now a CHoS will take your agro to a whole other plane and you won't believe the difference.  10 k is really not a lot to get at 51, you can kill Felwith guards inside the zone if you don't mind faction hits and make 10k in a few days if you have to.  I think the level 40 neriak guards drop fine steel too if you don't like Felwith hits, just it will take a little longer.<br />
<br />
Eventually get a sword of the bloodsworn for your off hand and your agro holding ability will be much much much better than it is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you cannot afford a Copper Hammer of Striking yet (like me!), I reccommend a Sarnak Warhammer (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6613).  It is also a stun based proc, will generate nice aggro, and help you to skill up for the day when you CAN afford the Copper Hammer of Striking. It procs at level 46, and it costs rougly 1K on Tarew Marr, when I see one.<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188)  procs at level 1, and is running about 6K cheaper on Tarew Marr than the CHoS.<br />
<br />
The recurring them is &quot;Stun Proc&quot; ;).</div></div><hr />

Cheap aggro weapons ...  <br />
<br />
I used a Barnacle Covered Axe (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40029)  from about level 45 -  52 (offhand at the end, with the Sarnak Warhammer in main).  While it isn't the bestest aggro weapon in the game, for 100 plat in the bazaar, it's hard to beat.  I was quite happy with it, and it was a noticeable improvement at the time from my Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood.  And, dual wielding axes was just too cool for words :D.<br />
<br />
I've also read good reviews of the Black Blade of Tormenting (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25091), which is pretty cheap.  Never used it tho.<br />
<br />
Silken Whip of Ensaring (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5643) also helps me hold aggro, tho it's much easier with the Sword of the Bloodsworn in the mainhand and the snare whip in off ;).  I keep mine, for utility purposes mostly, or when the druid in my group is being botted by me.</div></div><hr />

Total cost of greatstaff of thunder = 500p<br />
Total cost of those 2 x 1hers = ~50k<br />
<br />
Thats the real kicker right there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real kicker is that before BoT opened up and the Loot Table was adjusted, the GSoT was rare as hell and sold for 30-50k. Check back a month or two in the Bunker Section before BoT opened and you will see people paid their left nut for GSoT.<br />
<br />
I got mine for 35k about 2 months before BoT opened and loot was adjusted. I couldn't believe my luck to find it so cheap. After Droga was revamped I camped Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn for 2 days, and we got a few for me and the group. They were selling at the time for 50k each, but I wasn't about to let my &quot;mini-SoD's&quot; get sold for fear of loot nerf in Droga.<br />
<br />
After a lot of testing I bagged them and still weild the GSoT. This is under order from my wife ( cleric ), my shaman friend, and my Elemental Flagged buddy who slums with us cause we have fun. I pulled them out the other night just to double check if it was my technique or something, and after 2 hours the rogue told me to &quot;wield that fuggin' GSoT&quot;. It saddens me that when we do Forge/Tables ( South BoT) than when GSoT drops people roll to see who gets the 'booby prize'.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm keeping mine and slapping Anger III on it until someday affording a BoC, then I will recamp the CHoS for offhand, and Aug them both. I go by gut feeling and group command when it comes to aggro. A shaman will never try to spare your feelings, but instead give you the verbal smack-down for having a better aggro weapon in the bag ( GSoT in my case) but instead wielding something that is getting them smashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in Hate a few days back (our chanter got their epic piece drop on the very first reavener - lucky SOB). <br />
<br />
Anyway, 54 at the time and wielding Anklesmasher/Frostbringer for agro.  I was 2boxing my monk as puller, who would FD as I tagged for agro switch (fun being puller/tagger/MT by the way while 2boxing).<br />
<br />
I noticed agro in Hate is something wicked.  Every, and I mean every slow that landed had the mob taking off towards the chanter.  I could hold agro with this group in nearly every other zone, but Hate must be coded wierd in terms of agro - I've never struggled so hard to maintain agro.  Even after procing several times and slowing at 50%, the chanter still got agro.  Thank heavens we were out of there in an hour - it was really a nightmare.  <br />
<br />
Don't know if anyone else has experienced agro issues in Hate - but your info makes me scratch my head.  It could surely be the initial agro thing coming into play.  If your SK was pulling with a snare spell, that could explain it more.   You'd have a wicked time trying to taunt off a SK pulling with a DoT snare with those weapons. It just sounds like your weapons just couldn't make headway over the SK's initial agro + DPS.  <br />
<br />
Solution?  Well, better weapons of course would help.  Your current setup is questionable for agro even under the best of circumstances.  If you can go from your currently level to 55 and use that GSoT, you'll be golden from there.  Problem is you have to suffer through a few more levels first.  I really like the Frostbringer for agro pre-55.  It's not awesome, but it's better than what you have.  If you really want to go cheap, you could try a Black Blade of Tormenting.  I've tested agro as about equal to a Frosty, and normally you can find them dirt cheap in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
On a side note - in Dulak over the weekend, I used my new CHoS/Frosty vs. a non-casting SK who was wielding some meaty 2HS with a 270DD proc on it, and had zero agro problems - none.  Was my first trial with that CHoS and boy was I impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a SK as my main and I have to say, we have to try hard to not generate a lot of agro.  I agree with the posts that the SK in your group should be pulling with cancel magic, arrows, or just straight proximity.  If he is using ANYTHING else (taps, dots, debuffs, whatever), no warrior with comparable gear is ever going to hold consistant agro against him.  Also, he should ALWAYS feign just before telling you to tag the mob with your bow.  He should then stay down until you have landed a couple rounds of melee on the mob.  After that, you both need to use proximity to control agro and he shouldn't cast or taunt for the remainder of the fight.<br />
<br />
Also, he was using an ebon mace, which is a 19/24 one hander.  That alone generates a fair amount of dps agro.<br />
<br />
I don't want to start a holy war but agro is the defining characteristic of the SK class (hit points are the warrior's defining characteristic...whether SOE has balanced that correctly is not something I want to talk about, since I'm on a warrior board, hehehe).  Anytime a warrior is trying to hold agro over a SK, you are trying to do something that he is naturally better at so you both need to use every trick you have to make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get 54, get a GSoT, time your taunts for after big spells like slow and snare, and I'll guarantee that unless you get unlucky as hell with the RNG, an SK (assuming parity of gear/levels/aa) will have a hard time pulling aggro off you once you have it.  (sometimes getting it initially will still be a pain, again, depends how lucky you get with the RNG).  And accept the fact that a paladin will still take aggro off you at will if he's willing to spend the mana required to do it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banuk</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tell'em to pull with cd and leave attack off until you have it for a few seconds(3-7 should do it) alone, then just proximity from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brax</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also play an SK, and it is most likely that he was pulling with a snare or a tap, which can generate some good initial aggro.  However, he needs to learn to know when to take aggro and when not to.  A well played SK knows these things, and has just as many ways to clear his aggro as he has to gain it.  Casting a spell from the Voice line will increase the aggro that the warrior gets for each action taken against the mob, and feign death is always the fastest and easiest way to clear aggro and let the MT take it over.  I know when I'm not MT it's not just the MT's job, but also my job as puller (when I am pulling)  to make sure that he gains aggro and I lose it as soon as I get the mob to camp.  In certain cases (IE in places like BoT where slows and such have to be quickly placed)  when I am pulling, I will hold aggro until all necessary spells are in place (usually around 10 -15 seconds, which takes on most occaisions one complete heal to me) while the MT builds up aggro greater than the casters will have, then FD to clear mine and allow him to take over.  But needless to say (I apologize for my rambling) he was doing something very wrong in the case you were involved in, and needs to rethink how he plays his character, so don't worry about what you were doing, I'm sure you would have held aggro flawlessly paired with a well played SK (But that comes with time).  Good luck to you in the future, and keep on tanking.</div></div><hr />
