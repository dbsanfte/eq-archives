<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I can't get to any other site ( if it's ezboard ) because of firewall issues.  Anyone want to go over some of the changes here and what they thought of it? I hear the Maestro quads for 1100 and frequently procs a 1500hp lifetap....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So they revamped the zone or just made another half??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they rebuilt the zone from scratch. necro boards have a few words on it, no ezboard, so try necro.eqclasses.com ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I work for a software design firm so they probably have quite a few EQers world wide.  Because of this they have pretty much made it impossible to access any site with &quot;eq&quot; or &quot;games&quot; in the name and all ezboards.  I was using babblefish as a back door to the eq sites I wanted to see but they must have gotten wise to this because now babblefish and other translation sites are blocked by the firewall.<br />
<br />
Oh well no biggy, if I am really interested I can always look it up at home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've *heard* Maestro has been upgraded to a tier 3/4 PoP-type mob, with quads 1k+ and the VS 1500 LT.  Inny is supposedly MUCH more powerful too.<br />
<br />
Let's just hope they modified the loots to be inline with the new difficulty of the mobs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Off topic, but to the previous poster- I have the same problem at work with filters, so I setup a proxy server at home.  If you've got a server at home, you can get a proxy off kazaa or whatever for free, or there are a load of them released under GPL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ibash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How were you using Babblefish as a backdoor portal. I am interested in by passing my proxy as well.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The new hate has most of the old mobs and lots of new ones it has level 60 mobs to level 64 mobs the named seem to be 65 with maestro being 70 or 75 any inny being 75 I haven’t got any loot yet off the common mobs but I can verify I got a decrepit hide off a drake last night. exp seems also to be good off the 60+ mobs. I am hoping to get some loot off the 60+ common mobs soon but not holding my breath :) not sure if I can take minis now that their level has been upgraded to 65 but ill find out shortly.<br />
<br />
the look of the new hate is pretty nice also an upgrade to the old hate graphical wise.<br />
<br />
Also the hand is in maestros hall and fairly easy to solo pull as I accidentally found out last night by getting too close to a wall hehe.<br />
<br />
oh as with the old hate you can still cast through walls up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, feel like I'm hijacking this thread ... but content filters piss me off, so I have to answer the question.<br />
<br />
Ibash - I don't know about babblefish, seems to be a development site.  However, you can use http://www.anonymizer.com or any of the other web-based anonymizers out there.  I'd figure out what all you have available by searching google at home for 'anonymizer and browsing', to avoid the filters at work while looking for an alternative.<br />
<br />
Only, problem is many of those sites are also filtered, which is why I ended up setting up my own proxy server.<br />
--<br />
<br />
On the topic at hand though, I'm glad they didn't fubar the Hate piece for average warriors looking to get their epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh another note there is no little hand now just the big angry one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roehm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hate was something it has not been in over 2 years, fun.<br />
<br />
Maestro was an intersting fight. His loot was bumped up in accordance with his difficulty. 15/19 slasher with 150(160?) Poison DD and stats/hps was the only loot I paid attention to.<br />
<br />
Hate is also something it has never been, beautiful.<br />
<br />
We bopped along killed all the nameds and tried to spawn Inny but quit early as it was an off night and people were leaving to see the 10pm Wed showing of the Matrix.<br />
<br />
Over all, I give it a thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How is the experience for one group?  Comparable to Elemental Planes exp?  Or is it much much worse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aside from new textures and new mobs, is the basic layout of the zone the same as it used to be?  Just curious if the old maps still have any validity.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just wondering.... the hand of maestro for the epic, before, you were supposely to kill maestro to spawn his hand, right? now you have to kill the NEW maestro to spawn it? Cause if thats the case... well, might as well pic 1 mob of all the other epics and make it harder =/ I mean, if Maestro is supposely a tier 3/4 mob now, theres *no* chance that a guild that its on tier 2 can do it, right? So whats the point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't jump to any conclusions yet. In the past when they have revamped Fear and Hate, they moved the old god loot down to the minis. I wouldn't be surprised if something like this happened, at least eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">little bit off topic, but Apothes, where did you get those gauntlets? I think I want a pair for my monk.....=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bought them cost me a pretty penny 150k they drop off king tormax.<br />
<br />
as to the hand ther eis no little hand anymore just the big angry one it pops all by it's lonesome no need to kill maestro.<br />
<br />
I am not flagged for any pop zones but the 61 to 64 mobs seem to give good exp for me at 60.<br />
<br />
the layout is totally different it is indoor now so no SoW horseys ect. and there is only one floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually as far as I remember, even before the revamp there were 2 different Hands of the maestro. One would spawn upon maestro's death right at the corpse and just sit there non aggro till attacked. But a second one would spawn right at the organ on a seperate timer, not associated with maestro's death.<br />
<br />
I know I have killed 2 hands a couple times in back to back fights.<br />
<br />
So from all I have heard the new Hand is just a seperate mob with its own respawn timer, in a room outside of the new maestro. Of course having obtained my epic finally about the time PoP was released. And having been the MT for every raid that one of the epic parts dropped, I always considered the Hand as one of the easier pieces to get. I lost rolls on it 5 times before I finally got mine, and still saw another half a dozen warriors get theirs after me, and had mine for well over a year before finally finishing the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mini-Hijack here:<br />
<br />
What forces are needed for the Hand?  My guild has about 5 warriors who are getting close to this part of their epic.  We can get maybe 3 groups of lvl 46+ put together for the raid.  Our MT would be a 56 warrior with a few pieces of Champions armor and our primary healer is a 60 cleric.<br />
<br />
We just did the Kael Arena last night with 4 groups of lvl 40+  After we worked out a few issues with waiting for the call to assist things went pretty good.  We even got the 2 Protectors of Zek and Kallis down on our last cycle before we packed it in for the night.  Not much for loot though, 1 silk glove and a BBoT plus quite a few helmets.<br />
<br />
Would we have a chance if we can put together this sort of raid again or do we need more numbers/higher levels?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well the hand does not appear to have been upped in dificuty (havent killed it yet but died to it when I accisdently aggroed). and last time i did the hand did him with 2 and a half groups he not that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just did PoH on Drinal this morning and it's MUCH better. Talk about fixing agro. The zone-in is safe (if you don't wander). The building that Maestro is in, and all of the zone that I have seen, are both quite beautiful. Anyone who has ever taken any kind of &quot;Art in Architecture&quot; class will wish they could just walk around Hate a bit and look at stuff.<br />
<br />
We went in multi-guild with 3 or 4 groups, I'm really not sure of levels or classes, at 55 I was MA. And being the only warrior I won the Hand of the Maestro by default. He spawns in a room outside of the room containing the Maestro and conned red to me, although he came with an add he fell fairly quickly and didn't seem to beat me up as bad as some of the more common mobs in Hate. I'm not sure of his repop time, but getting to the hand and killing it was not very difficult.<br />
<br />
We had a smart monk pulling, and as it was my first time being MA in a raid-type situation I do not believe I got anyone killed...which is nice. I like the new Hate and I'm really looking forward to seeing a map of the place.<br />

<br />
My guild attempted him last nite (i wasnt there) and got their asses handed to them at least 5 times with 70 toons on the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;I'm sorry Rex but i dont beleive you MT'd the new Maestro at lvl 55 and lived...even if u had godly dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would be skeptical too, if only he had actually said that is what he did.<br />
<br />
Now, I certainly believe he tanked &quot;Hand of the Maestro&quot; which is what he claims. Seen it tanked with less.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slagfest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">point taken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah my guild was there night before last and got owned several times by the Maestro. <br />
<br />
I wasn't able to make it but our MT claimed max hit under defensive was 900. Combined with early claims that max normal hit is about 1100, makes him DEFINATELY an evasive mob.<br />
<br />
Other info:<br />
<br />
At 75% he spawns two hands on the bench by the organ. While they are alive the Maestro regens insanely fast.<br />
<br />
At 40% 3 banshees nearby become targetable that weren't previously. They cannot be charmed or mezzed but can be rooted. At the same time an AE Mana Drain starts firing every few seconds.<br />
<br />
On my guild's second try they killed off the Banshees but they respawned a few minutes later and a wipeout followed. Rooting or offtanking seems to be best.<br />
<br />
It's quite possible that he does something else later in the fight too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Spinetwist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Blah. I have no idea why you guys care about the hand of Maestro or anything to do with the War epic. The war epic is complete garbage in comparison to Pop mobs and the hate on the red blade is easily resisted. Crash the epic back to Kunark days. Its TRASH.<br />
<br />
That being said, is the loot in Hate all the same? Seems unfair to give nameds a boost but give the same loot. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No there is new loot on maestro and inny not sure about the mini bosses yet but there are some new ones so I assume they aslo provide new loot tables with some onld loot on them also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;the hate on the red blade is easily resisted. &quot;<br />
<br />
I think it's been pointed out many many times in the past on the other board ... (in response to something you may have actually posted, IIRC) ...<br />
<br />
Resists STILL get aggro.<br />
<br />
Why just last night, in Skyfire, fighting fire resistant mobs, my level 52 warrior was peeling aggro off of the 60 rogue with ease. All it took was a red blade proc, even though the proc was always resisted.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic being junk is certainly a completely subjective debate. You either like it, or you hate it.<br />
<br />
But make no mistake, resists on procs, all sorts of procs which warriors have been forced to use ... from Frostbite to Rage of Vallon to Fury of Zek to Pique to whatever, they all still generate aggro when resisted.<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have a loot update if you all want a apoiler off the named. it is not warrior usealbe but it's a nice item I am currently dead up there but as soon as I can trez myself ( I am at work just have to fidn time to do it ) I can post the item if you all want :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">humm dont have a way to post pictures of the items guess I can upload them to magelo and then give pointers I currently have gotten 4 new items from up there. I will figure somethin out and post in a bit. I even have  even got a warrior usable item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Some of that loot kinda blows....figure they'd update drops with the whole zone :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Purexhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just killed new maestro last night, pretty fun fight I thought, not all to difficult either, quaded 1030, lifetap resistable with 500 or so MR. Loot was ok off him, but nothing spectacular, he dropped a decent caster robe and a 50hp vengeance earring.<br />
<br />
There is also new loot from some of the newer mobs in the zone, we got a cloak of scales which was half way decent from a normal mob in the zone, although I cant remember which. We gave inny a shot also, just to see what the revamped version was like, he seemed pretty tough, we werent able to make it past 2nd wave, since we had no clue what to expect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Apparently Inny now drops a 36/30 2hs with Enraging Blow and pretty nice stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I very much doubt the hate portion of a red epic proc will take hold on a resist given the fact that it's a modifier. Just as with any other modifier, like say a frostbringer proc and its AC debuffer, if the spell is resisted it does nothing. That isn't to say that the red epic proc resist itself doesn't give any agro, just that it's probably 1/10 the agro of what it would be if the proc landed and increased the hate of the monster.<br />
<br />
And are you serious about that new Innoruuk 2HS Brutul?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I finally got a chance to go up and take a look around. I must say I am VERY impressed with what I saw.<br />
<br />
The zone is absolutely beautiful. They spread out the 1st floor a lot, now there is room to crawl. They also fixed the pathing and wall agro issues as far as I could tell. Not one single suprise train all night. The trash mobs where still pretty easy, but I suspect they are well tuned fora level appropriate raid. It seems like they are targeting the 58-63 crowd in a raid situation.<br />
<br />
Maestro of Rancor is stout. Don't go up thinking you are going to do this guy with 2 groups, not gonna happen. I won't completely spoil it, but itis now a ring style event. He does quad for 1100 and he is immune to slow. Spells do land if you pick the right element and controlling the spawns as the event progresses is super important. Loot was very good for the effort. You can see the INT caster pants and killer 1hs that dropped in the thread I posted in the Bunker.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we started our mini raid at 1 a.m. so we weren't able to get to Inny, but we will certainly be going back to see how hard he is now.<br />
<br />
Overall SOE did a great job with the changes I have seen. Hate is now a viable raid zone and not nearly the PITA it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">when i had nothing to do, and was bored and curious, i would get a port up to Hate and solo.  You seen any paladins up in PoHate soloing?  Or these mobs up here not soloable anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>simplee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">From what I've seen after three trips up there...<br />
<br />
Unless you want to hit Maestro or Inny, it's pretty much a grind zone.  Cash and loot drops have been cut drastically, so it's no longer the cash cow that it used to be.  On the plus side, they've cut the cost to get up there by half as well (reagent only costs ~50pp now).<br />
<br />
I have yet to fight Maestro or Inny, but comparisons that I've heard thus far are that Maestro is about the equivalent of AoW, and Inny is similar to the elemental gods.  Thankfully the loot drops have been upgraded!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Maestro encounter is chanlenging and I thought fun that invlved all the people on the raid. Other then that this zone lags a bit too much now.</div></div><hr />
