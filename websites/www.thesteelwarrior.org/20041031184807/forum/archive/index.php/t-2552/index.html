<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im just curious....lucy lists the proc on Blackout as follows:<br />
<br />
Terrifying Darkness<br />
Effects:<br />
Decrease Hit Points (HP) by 100 per tick over 1 ticks<br />
Stun<br />
<br />
Im wondering if the way that's worded affects agro since my old GBoS has a similar proc.<br />
<br />
Force Shock<br />
Effects:<br />
Decrease Hit Points (HP) by 171 (L20) to 179 (L24)<br />
Stun<br />
<br />
The wording of terrifying darkness makes it sound like a 1 tick dot, but with Ingeniuty3, it crits for 200.  Im just curious what would be the best setup for raid agro since I'm mainhanding a BoC.   Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have a gbos so I can't directly compare the two, but I wouldn't worry about the wording on the blackout proc.  It is great aggro when it procs.<br />
<br />
The two weapons are probably very close to each other for aggro and either one should be a great offhand compliment to a BoC.<br />
<br />
I would probably go with the Blackout over the GBoS because I think the 15 ac and 10 stamina on it is worth more than the extra 10 HPs the GBoS has.  If aggro is the same (and I'm betting the two are very similar for aggro) then you might as well look at the stats... and 15 ac is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use a blackout, and consider it a very good aggro proc. The stun, I beleive, is zero seconds... IE, no melee effect, but can interupt casting. It doesn't matter, since it's a pre pop stun and the stun part is immune on the mobs I normally fight. But it still seems to draw aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SSharlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used a blackout back in the day and it was a VERY GOOD taunting weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The for the repsonses so far!  Here's a quick twist although I think I know the answer.   Haven't done much testing but since the Blackout procs significantlymore than the BoC, with all offensive AA's maxed except PB3 (since I havent been using a 2hander) would it benefit me any to have the Blackout in mainhand and the BoC secondary for raid agro only?  I know the dps would go down.   Im guessing prolly not since it goes against conventional wisdom of 1. faster wep in MH for damage bonus and better ratio wep in offhand, and 2. Best proc in MH since it will go off more.  Just curious if the increased frequency of the Blackout procs would compensate while the offhand EB proc could back it up.   Like I said, prolly not, but was wondering if anyone tested this and what their results were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kenelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Blackout's proc used to be a DoT.<br />
<br />
They changed it to a DD + stun but didn't remove the duration (kinda like red/2h epic).<br />
<br />
They must have updated it though...<br />
<br />
Currently Lucy shows it to be an instant effect...meaning Ingenuity would work with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I currently use BoC/Blackout as my aggro set up.<br />
<br />
Even in offhand the blackout procs a ton.  And due to the speed of the weapon, id keep it offhand.<br />
<br />
22 delay, so it goes in offhand over my BoC, also because i want a greater chance of EB to proc.<br />
<br />
Before i got my BoC, i kept blackout main hand, and didnt have any probs with aggro then either.<br />
<br />
all up to you, but i find it works better in offhand as a compliment to another high aggro weapon</div></div><hr />
