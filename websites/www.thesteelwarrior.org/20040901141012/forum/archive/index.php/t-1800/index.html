<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone.  I was running my alt through The Overthere and came upon some good race quest NPCs along the beach heading east from the PoK book.  I talked to them and received some kind of quest where the barbarian there is looking for information about a shapeshifter that has infiltrated the Brook of Di'Zok in Chardok.  I've searched all the websites I can think of and none of them seem to have any info regarding this quest.  <br />
<br />
Has any else seen these people?  Maybe I'm stupid and they've been there all along?  I'm not willing to rule that possibility out yet....  So if it is an old quest, anyone know what the reward is?  Or if its a new one, anyone have any leads or know anything about it?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, I appreciate any information you have.  Something about this really stirred up my curiosity.  <br />

Follow it up and let us know. Or check the loose ends link in the quest thread, in The Library. Somewhere in there are some links concerning quests / mysterious NPCs and happenings.</div></div><hr />

Looks like they belong to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe it corresponds to the CHardokB zone they added for a short time.  Or the newly revamped zones of Druga and Nurga</div></div><hr />
