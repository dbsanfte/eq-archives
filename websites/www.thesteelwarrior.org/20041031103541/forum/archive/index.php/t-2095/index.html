<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zangif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pardon me if a comparison has been done before on this site, but I wasn't able to find one searching for Crimson Darkscale.  I recently created a Troll Warrior and Ogre Warrior and have been levelling them both with left over equipment from previous alts since I didn't want to spend the money on an alt that I didn't know I would like or not.<br />
<br />
At any rate, they are both nearing 45 now (yes, I'm still undecided between the both, I love my Ogre's Unstannability but hate the fact that when I do a /who all ogre warrior it has so many returns; and I love my Troll's regen and relative [to the Ogre's] scarcity/rarity, but hate being stunned :p) and so I was looking to having a friend do some crafted armor for me.<br />
<br />
This is where I found out that for Ogres and Troll warriors of Rallos Zek, there are two choices: Crimson Darkscale Armor (also able to be worn by SK's) and Fierce Heraldic (also able to be worn by Bards) which I'm sure all of you are aquanited with by now.  Since I was bored at work, I drew up a simple table in Word with the stats of both sets and what I would gain and lose by going with a full set of each.  Please note that I included Wisdom, Intelligence, and Mana for the sake of completeness.  The results are as follows:<br />
<br />
With a full suit of Crimson Darkscale (two bracers):<br />
+353 AC<br />
+40 STR<br />
+15 STA<br />
+15 DEX<br />
+10 AGI<br />
+645 HP<br />
+10 vsMg<br />
+10 vsFire<br />
+10 vsCold<br />
+10 vsPos<br />
+10 vsDis<br />
+5 INT<br />
+10 WIS<br />
+215 MANA<br />
<br />
With a full suit of Fierce Heraldic (two bracers):<br />
+327 AC<br />
+10 STR<br />
+10 STA<br />
+40 DEX<br />
+35 AGI<br />
+830 HP<br />
+10 vsMg<br />
+10 vsFire<br />
+10 vsCold<br />
+10 vsPos<br />
+10 vsDis<br />
+5 INT<br />
<br />
So if I go with Crimson Darkscale I gain 26 AC, 30 Str, and 5 Sta over Fierce Heraldic.  However, I lose 25 Agi, 25 Dex, and 185 HPs (not including intelligence, wisdom, or mana into my final tally since they are as a whole irrelevant to a warrior).  When I looked at the two armors from this angle, it would seem to be that Fierce Heraldic is the clear winner, is it not?  Only one piece of Crimson Darkscale had the same HPs as Fierce Heraldic (the vambraces both had 60 HPs) and all Crimson Darkscale pieces have 2 more AC than their Fierce Heraldic counterparts.<br />
<br />
So I guess, this long winded post was all the result of my boredom at work and curiosity between the two armors for my newbie warrior; all to come to the conclusion that to me Fierce Heraldic is vastly superior because of the big amounts of raw HPs I gain from going with it instead of Crimson Darkscale.  However, I might have missed something somewhere in all of this and I'd really appreciate someone giving me any input on the situation.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all and I'm happy you made it to the end of this post without falling asleep.<br />

PS - Wee, first post :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't compare sets, compare pieces; if you're worried about looks, buy some dye. And remember only a grandmaster (or close) smith of the appropriate race can craft these armors. Only humans can make heraldic and only ogres can make darkscale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Obeareaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wear sum ub both... makez best combo I tink...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, like I dont exactly remember offhand but I believe crimson darkscale sleeves are superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah I was gonna say...why hold yourself to a certain set...mix and match to get the best results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zangif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I feel like such a n00b for asking these questions, thanks for helping me out.  I was wonder how you &quot;rate&quot; armor, ie how do you determine +5 STA is &gt; +20 HP or something to the likness of that.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any input from someone who's done a comparison of each piece of Crimson and Fierce Heraldic that knows which piece is the best of each set.  Also, I don't know which haste I'll be using (wether back or belt) since I know I'll have to replace the Custom Cowl of Mortality I borrowed from my main.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zangif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also, does anyone know about how much each piece would run now a days?  Or does that vary a lot server to server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well each Stam is worth 6 hp's pre 255 cap.  A lot of warrior's get to about 210-220 stam and concentrate on +HP items (I do).  Reason is that I group with a shammy or Bst 98% of the time and they have stam buffs.  If I was maxed stam, I would gain no bonus from their buffs.  So I leave my stam a bit lower and use a lot of +HP gear.<br />
<br />
That ensures that my HP is as high as it can go.  As for Crimson vs Fierce, go piece by piece.  Fierce is gonna win most of the time because you dont need +mana on any of ure armor.  Plus Int and Wis are useless to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">humm, <br />
<br />
back or waist will normaly have a haste item unless you have one for a oddball slot. normaly were the non mele stats are stuck as well.<br />
<br />
you cant realy go wrong with either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i saw most items of fierce in the bazaar on veeshan for 2 to 4 K with the BP being 6K this weekend, I did not see any bracers for sale. I almost bought a set for my warrior</div></div><hr />
