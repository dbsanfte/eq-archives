<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqkiros</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on a T3 Connection at my College. I have a decent computer setup.<br />
<br />
Ok my problem is no matter how much I upgrade my computer seems it never makes that big of a difference. Not zoning or anything, I did find that when I turned on all my graphics and put my res on high it did speed it up a bit, vs all graphics off and low res.<br />
<br />
But I am in a Alliance Guild, 2 guilds formed to 1 that work together on a nightly basis, well we use a chat channel for most of that. Guild leader loves to give me a hard time about it im not getting in trouble or anything, just frustrating that I miss alot of chat.<br />
<br />
When I first log in my channels are working fine, 5 mins later No channels at all, Im droped and I cant get back into them until I zone or relog. Now I thought it was my firewall thinking its blocking the port, but if that was the case why could I get into them at all in the first place, I have tryed getting a new NIC card, new Cat5e Cable, New everything I cant think of and still ... no go. :(<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem, and if so Figured out how to fix it??<br />
<br />
I tryed going threw the sony help thing online and talking with a tech, and I just got rushed threw and said it was my ISP and left. Thats on 2 different occasions now, when I mention it they just drop me and dont want to talk about it.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be appricated, Also im running WinXP Pro.<br />

Open the port for both UDP and TCP packets.<br />
I can sadly not remember the IP for the chat server, but its inside the IP range that are listed for the EQ game servers.</div></div><hr />
