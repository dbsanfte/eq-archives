<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here is my situation...<br />
<br />
Incite in slot 1<br />
Melee Attack in slot 2<br />
Slam in slot 3<br />
Taunt in slot 4<br />
<br />
For some reason I find that if I do my normal finger roll, and press 1,2,3,4 in fast succession, auto attack fails to start. Not Always, but a good amount of the time. Does anyone else notice this?<br />
<br />
It seems like there is a refresh or some kind of cooldown on incite, or am i just imagining things?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a kitty, so I don't have slam, but I remapped &quot;~&quot; key to be melee combat. I made 1-ranged combat for pulling, 2-taunt, 3-kick, 4-Incite.<br />
<br />
My finger roll goes &quot;~&quot;,2,3, and only hit Incite if my opening attack doesn't get agro, whether taunt failed or not (sometimes a stun kick works also). I will then save incite for after tash/malo/slow if I need it.<br />
<br />
And, yes, I skip 1 without even thinkig about it, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed that after Inciting, you cant use a hotkey for like 1 sec, since sometimes (I use Incite as Ctrl+1), I wanna kick (#3) right after Inciting and it says I cant use that hotkey yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bet it is the same effect as casters get when they have to wait for their spells gems to 'lightup' after they cast, since Incite is considered a 'spell' (try sitting and hitting Incite :) )<br />
<br />
My personal opinion, Incite range should be way smaller, I don't really like the idea of being able to pull with it. If you wanna look at it from a RP point of view, how can I get close enough to a mob to yell profanity at it, but it can't see me till I yell? :) Anyway, just my feelings on it :)</div></div><hr />

I was in Lguk just getting some cash and I went to use Healing Will then while that was going I clicked on a potion for DS and it canceled out my Healing Will Discipline?  Weird</div></div><hr />

I was farming faction for Chardok the other day, and they hit just hard enough to need a heal now and again, but on this occasion, I was by myself. So, for a test, I turned off attack while he was beating on me, then hit healing will. Everything was going fine, then I made a reposte roll....off goes HW...grr.<br />
<br />
Basically, any action beyond sitting, standing, or running cancels it...only thing I wish they would do is lock out the key while attack is on, in case I fat finger hotkeys.</div></div><hr />

For the first person in the thread, make a button, /do 1 then on the next line /do 2 or what ever your taunt slam key is. Saves you a hot key slot.<br />

PS yes I'm a taunt smasher. But its always worked for me and I continue to get /tell Your the best pickup warrior we have ever seen, messages. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyyn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually if you watch and hit Incite while Autoattack is ON, you will see a couple 'you cant use this ability now' messages , ( you are loosing swings ). Seems to be only like half a sec, but it does lock out all other functions, so your Incite then autoattack roll would fail ocassionally.</div></div><hr />

I also use incite on every mob. I can do it on every mob and keep my sta up.  although I am usaly out of stamina by the end of an adventure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harthina</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer to Taunt before I use incite.

<br />
While that sounds reasonable, in practice I find this a bit problematic.  Taunt doesn't put you very far ahead of the top of the hate list. So if taunt is the only thing giving you aggro (Which of course it's not because you're attacking and bashing/kicking/slamming/whatever) then as soon as someone else looks at the mob funny you lose aggro again.  And if that happens to be right after you've hit taunt, then you have 6 seconds before you can reasonably expect to get aggro back.  (even longer if taunt fails, or the caster has low HP aggro by then) And for those poor fragile casters, 6 seconds worth of beating is probably going to mean death.  <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the fight, I use Incite/Kick/Disarm (I don't have slam, and I don't use a shield, I use two proccing weapons), and save taunt for when I lose aggro to a slow or a nuke.  True, Incite by itself is less than slow aggro...BUT...between incite, it's aggro over time element, and they hater you're building with your attacks, there's a good chance of holding aggro even once slow lands.  <br />
<br />
Remember though..aggro management depends on the entire group.  if you've got a chanter or shammy slowing on the pull, or other casters nuking or DoT'ing on the pull, you are going to have a very tough time getting and keeping aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah seems like you can't activate anything right after using Incite for like one second(or half a second). <br />
<br />
That includes Autoattack, other disciplines and kick/slam/bash. <br />
<br />
I died once already because I used Incite and clicked defensive hotkey right after. I died by the time I realized defensive was not active &gt;&lt; <br />
<br />
Got used already to this little flaw. So I activate discs/autoattack first and use Incite after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed you cannot AT when the incites effects are still in use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why he said he prefers to taunt prior to using incite. An incite after a successful taunt gives you a sizeable boost over the top.<br />
<br />
As for hotkeys, I think my setup is probably a little out of the ordinary. I mapped all my hotkey keypresses to the numpad. I'll try to do a crappy little diagram here:<br />
<br />
1 2 - -<br />
3 4 - -<br />
5 6 - - <br />
7 8 - 0 <br />
9   -   <br />
<br />
The first 8 hotkeys are mapped to the 8 keys on the left half of the numpad, 9 is on the big '0' key, and 10 is on the big 'ENTER' key. I originally did this shortly after making a bard. It's easier to twist songs with my right hand on the numpad while doing moving around with my left hand (I use WADS for movement), but then I realized it's just plain more convenient and more comfortable with all my characters' keys mapped like that.<br />
<br />
Here are how my keys are setup for the typical xp group.<br />
<br />
~ = Autoattack<br />
1 = Incite<br />
2 = Kick/Slam<br />
3 = Range<br />
4 = Taunt<br />
5 = Defensive<br />
6 = Furious<br />
7 = &quot;/g Incoming with [ %T ]&quot;<br />
8 = &quot;/g I am engaging [ %T ]&quot;<br />
9 = /assist, /shield (to shield my target's target)<br />
0 = /assist<br />
<br />
I have a separate page for raids which is mostly the same except the incoming and engaging macros echo it in /g /rs and /say, and the engaging key adds &quot;ASSIST ME NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
It might sound weird, but I like my numpad hotkeys. For one it's easier to visualize the hotkey bank on the numpad rather than in a horizontal line on the regular number keys. Hard to explain I guess. Try it out if you like.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt before incite, incite before taunt, it depends on the group.<br />
<br />
If your group needs you to pull aggro on the incoming, you have to use incite for that.  Incite has some range, taunt does not.  So, if they are complaining that I don't get aggro on the incoming, I incite on the incoming, and then taunt when and if necessary.<br />
<br />
If I'm on a mob that is already in camp, it's taunt first, then incite.<br />
<br />
I've been seeing a fair amount of failures on taunt lately, I'm not sure why that is, but it's a bit annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShaikYerbooty</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finger roll, heh heh, how quaint!  I used to watch my girlfriend run her warrior like that.  It's a wonder she doesn't have arthritis....<br />
<br />
I use my top two hotkeys.  In the first is a social called &quot;Taunt&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've mapped &quot;Taunt&quot; to Combat Ability key 1, &quot;Slam&quot; to key 2, &quot;Disarm&quot; to key 3.<br />
<br />
My &quot;Taunt&quot; social is:<br />
<br />
/doability 7<br />
/doability 8<br />
/doability 9<br />
/loc<br />
<br />
On the second hotkey I keep my Provoke-line discipline.<br />
<br />
I simply play my &quot;Taunt&quot; key rhythmically, like a Bard twisting a song.  I can hit the Provoke discipline first or second, as required.<br />
<br />
I have a second page of hotkeys identical to the first, however I've modified the &quot;Taunt&quot; social on that one.<br />
<br />
I've mapped &quot;Beg&quot; to ability 1.<br />
<br />
The second &quot;Taunt&quot; social is:<br />
/doability 7<br />
/doability 8<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability 1<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
I'm still experimenting to determine if Begging generates as much or more aggro as Disarming.  So far it seems just as good, but gotta be careful when with a chanter, because it can leave you in attack mode after mob death.  Lose focus and you might break mez before you mean to.<br />
<br />
I cannot think of a single-social method for using begging, taunting, slamming *and* disarming.  I may setup a two social system for that one day.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I only use the page 2 macro in good groups that are just cruising along.<br />
<br />
I use the backslash key for Autoattack, and that is the only remapped key I have.</div></div><hr />
