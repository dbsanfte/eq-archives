<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a ton of hard ldons over the weekend, to help someone farm points. I ended up pulling and tanking with an alt chanter doing the mezzes. Worked great but before breaking mez I did alot of taunting to try and keep down how much the chanter got hit. After about 4-5 of them I noticed a huge difference in Taunt success if the chanter distanced himself from the mob. Everytime the chanter was one room over, I never failed with taunt. <br />
<br />
I would like to see if you guys could try this out, see if you have the same success with it I did. I know range has an effect on agro, but it seems to have a huge effect on taunt success. Anyone, maybe it was random luck, maybe it works. This seems easy to parse if some has the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have another question that I guess comes from your question. I remeber reading test on Taunt a while back well before the fail message was every added that talked about the theory that Taunt would raise you to the top of the Hate list on success but that it seemed to have a cap that if the top hate list person hate was so much higher than yours that Taunt can not get over it in one taunt so my question is, is that true? and if it is, then is that what makes you fail Taunt or is it the skill just does not work when you fail? If you fail because Taunt can not get you over the chanters agro in one taunt then ya moving to the other room and standing might make it easier cause that might have some degree of lowering his agro before you taunt especially the standing part. So anyone have any thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />

However, &quot;temporary hate&quot;, such as sit aggro, low hp aggro, or undead proximity isn't accounted for wrt to the amount of hate you can gain from a taunt.<br />
<br />
I believe kavhok went on record here saying that the only things affecting taunt success are your taunt skill level, your level, and the level of the mob.<br />
<br />
Personally, I want to find the time to do some more tests, because  it sure SEEMS like against mobs with lots of hate for someone else (eg trying to taunt off a stunning pally) I'm more likely to fail a taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, he said that just recently. I agree with sit/low hp/undead radius agro, but whether or not the enchanter is in the room while taunting is stretching it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to the first post. I find that if I taunt until I don't get a fail message in hard ldon, I get aggro 99% of the time. I've had a few wierd cases where i didn't seem to, but I've gotta chalk it up to a remez or debuff landing JUST after my taunt. Sometimes I break mez, and they run to the chanter or debuffer if they're sitting, so i try to remember to call the break a couple seconds before I actually do it so they can stand up. Sometimes somebody gets smart and roots the mezzed mob which can mess stuff up, too.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried having the chanter stand far away, but my experience has been that the 60% success rate for taunt is about accurate for taunting hard ldon mezzed mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In any situation, Hard LDON,GoD, Eps, etc., all you need is one sucessful taunt and you can break mez and hold aggro without the mob going to the chanty.  You can throw an incite in there too just to be safe, but I've done it without inciting and its fine.  Problem is sometimes it takes awhile to get that one sucessful taunt hehe.  I'm not so sure about range, as my chanties won't go that far away!   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks man, but really. I know you how taunt and incite works. What I said was that when the chanter was a good distance away from the mob, my taunts would work first time, everytime. Atleast during the 8 or so hards that I did last weekend.</div></div><hr />

1- Taunt<br />
2- Incite<br />
3-Attack<br />
4-/shield mezzer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First time every time?I find it hard to believe honestly.I've never noticed a taunt success rate  change based on the chanter's or previous aggro holders distance.I know for a fact I can break a trash mob outside of LDON and watch it run long distances to the chanter if no one gets aggro.Tests would be kewl. I don't see chanter distance making any differance on taunt success rate tho it would mitigate aggro a lil against your follow up hate production....er if it doesm't run outa range hehe.<br />
<br />
Otheyum,distance can mitigate aggro especially on big mobs in certain environments,but, taunt doesn't work like that.Occaisonally,lag in my chat window causes problems.There are probably incidents of bugs as well.However,regardless of how much hate someone has built up on a mob if they cease aggro generation before I get a successful taunt and the mob is not rooted closer to them...then a successful taunt gives me aggro everytime.Until the mob blurs or someone builds hate anyhoos.<br />
<br />
A warrior could proc eb on a mob for half an hour and disengage having it mezzed.If you successfully taunt you will be placed above him on hatelist at that moment.HOTT won't show this until break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when doing 65 hard LDoNs or even regular hunting I will usually only tuant once and incite before breaking mez dont forget the high level mez's have a chance to memblur so chanters are fairly safe.<br />

<br />
suc taunt<br />
incite (hope mob moving dosent make hair trigger other melee break mez)<br />
bash/kick<br />
attack<br />
<br />
most of them one of the melee will jump early when the mob moves when incite lands.<br />
<br />
