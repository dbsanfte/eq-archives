<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is my first post, so if this is in the wrong place, just say so, so that I know for later :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am currently duoing my level 54 warrior with my wifes 54 shaman in Dulak's Harbor, which is going very well, but I need to move out of there soon, and many of the places I have checked out, I have found to be more and more difficult to take the beatings things dish out.<br />
<br />
In dulaks, and many of the other places I have leveled in previously, I have required little to no healing from the shaman, unless I really mess up, because of the regen line of spells, coupled with my fungi tunic. The places I have been checking out (PoI, PoJ, Velks, Seb, and Natimbi) all hit hard enough to make it to where my fungi no longer floats my hp. I have sat down, and thought a while on it, and I was thinking that maybe I should trade my fungi out for a real breastplate. My thinking on this was that if my fungi heals me 150 hp every minute, then if a different breastplate will help me dodge and mitigate that much, or more damage per minute, than the fungi is no longer as good.<br />
<br />
For example, if I were to dodge one single hit for 150 every minute, and mitigate an additional average of... say 2 damage per hit taken. Lets say the mob usually hits every second, 75% slowed from shaman, that is 1 hit ever 4 seconds, or 15 hits per minute. 2 less for 15, 30 less damage taken, making about 180hp per minute saved, rather than 150hp per minute healed. <br />
<br />
I am thinking strictly for combat, obviously if I need to sit and regen, I can slap the fungi on, but I HATE downtime, and up until this point, I have never needed downtime. <br />
<br />
So yeah... this is just a really long way of asking if I should switch to something else, and if you feel it would be a good idea, please tell me some suggestions. I was looking at a http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31844, or maybe a http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17538, but I am not sure. Also, if you have any suggestions for gear that you would like to throw at me, go for it. I realize that my AC is low, which is why I want to switch to a new BP. I am also looking at replacing my helm and leggings. I was looking at a http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16985 for the head slot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you for any information that you can provide, and if you want my magelo, use the magelo link under where my avatar should be. It is 100% correct for my equipment and skills, just nothing else :P Thanks once again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. if you can get a magnetic BP then go for it otherwise ornate/royal att<br />
2. FH BP is a little bit better than hurricane BP<br />
3. the Diseased Skullcase is barely as good as yours so forget about it. go for the same as BP (FH or magnetic) or better get the Helmet of RZ if you have the cash.<br />
4. both your bracelet are very bad for your lvl. change them asap<br />
5. the kylong legs are not so bad compared to other slots.<br />
6. your range slot is as good as an empty slots so put sommething. (skill mod does nothing at all for tanking. at best you will dodge more but the hit/non_hit ratio stays alike so it doesn't matter. I mean, you dodge more but mob miss less so that they hit as much).<br />
7. forget about dex/agi aug/food your wife can buff you above 255 it's enougth.<br />
<br />
and yes, the fungi tunic isn't a tanking BP after lvl 40/50 so forget about it. your shamy wife will have to heal you during fight but it's ok if you have decent AC/HP.<br />
<br />
Note : we advise generally a full FH suit before lvl 50 and from lvl 55 we advise for ornate or equivalent (royal attentant, farwater) so you need lots of cash for a good lvl 55+ warrior. but if you do this you will really see the difference. <br />
and remember that magnetic is between FH and ornate, and that charged magnetic (same requierement) is above ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah; if you got a healer type than the fungi is overkill.<br />
hang on to the fungi tho for later when you're soloing greens for faction/coin/etc.and try to price up a real breastplate for your 50's ( look for somehting with more than 45AC, especially if you can grab a deity piece cheap ).but the two you have listed are great for your levels/playstyle and go with whatever you can afford. Magnetic being the top end choice for ya but, hell, Archiect's Bejewelled BP's seem to be dropping fairly well in price too on a lot of the older servers so just keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
use your bazaar search to sort by class/race and Armor Class. See what comes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the bracers and the range slot (And the skullcase, and more) is that I was trying to get to 255 in all my melee stats. Str and Sta were no problem, which is why I am actually looking for a different drink (Maybe QAT, not sure) And with my wifes IoS package, sta and sta could stand to be about 100 points lower, and dex about 50 lower, so I dont care about those stats, however, my agi is still not maxed. Even with Deleriously Nimble, I still only have 247 agi. That is the reason for the extra agi stuff. I know that the extra agi wont make that much of a difference, however, if I can keep the same, or get better ac and hp AND have the agi, I will be even more happy :P <br />
<br />
The Fetish of the Agile is going to stick to me for a little while, until I can wear my Stonewood Compound Bow at level 61 (At which time I will be doing 100% to AA's in Fungus Grove, which is why I have the bow, for the 35 vs disease, not to mention nice stats)<br />
<br />
As for the bracers, do you have any suggestions? I had looked at FH for them, but the FH bracers just seem so... understated... And yes, I realize that AC and HP are the most important to a warrior, however, I do not raid, and never have with any of my characters, and don't really plan to. If I do, it will most likely just be epic mobs, which hardly require the best AC you can get. I like to have my stats maxed just out of prefference.<br />
<br />
As far as food, what do you suggest? I had thought about Hero Sandwiches, and force feeding myself so that I don't eat them. Either than or 10lb meat pies... not sure.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you for your quick response and information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">without the fungi (-10 DEX/AGI) your stat will be way better, so as Shik said, if you can't afford the top (charged magnetic) anything above 45AC is good. FH is very nice but is old fashion (very few stats) so a architec BP or anything around will make you happy for the stats on top of the AC/HP that is requiered.<br />
<br />
if you aren't raiding just get AC/HP it will doe you better than AGI/DEX and after lvl60 getter some ykesha aug (125DD :) on top of the stun). sure maxed stats is nice but below lvl 60 it isn't that important.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : strange your post count is buged, it's stays at 1 even if you have to post in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the post thing is kind of wierd, esspecially since I double posted when I first posted this, so this was actually two threads, heh. Anyway, I will look into a magnetic breastplate. I actually forgot completely about ornate, but the ornate molds are just to expensive, lol. I also forgot that even if my breastplate doesn't have any agi, I still basically get +10... Thank you very much. As far as the weapon augs, I plan to get some, but I just reciently (about a month ago) got LDoN, but the exp was not very good, so I rarely do them. I might start working exclusivly iin NRo, just for the Royal Attendant stuff now that you have shown me that, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give fungi to your wife she can canni more and heal you more as well /wink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love to give it to her, so that she can cann better, however, she felt that ogre, barb and troll were &quot;not cute enough&quot; and therefore went as a Vah Shir... the only class in the whole game that CAN'T use a fungi, lol. Oh well. Anyway, do anyone happen to know the formula for AC vs damage mitigation? Or at least a rough esstimate of how much, on average, 200 extra ac would mitigate from a hit? If it is based % on the max hit... lets say... max hit of 200. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the AC impact on tanking is highly dependant on mob so it isn't easy to get it.<br />
generally we say 1AC=5 or 6 HP (raw AC). and you can say that 100AC will reduce dps by a little bit more than 1%. look in the library for a class comparaison for tanking.<br />
<br />
got it : http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5868<br />
<br />
from 1380 AC to 2271 AC and 15% shielding we have 22.2 dps reduction or 16.89% reduction. if you remove the 15% shielding we will have 5 more domage on each hit thus 5 more on avg. thus we get a 19.75 dps reduction from AC or 15.03% reduction which is 1.69% reduction for 100AC. and since they both maxed def AA it's close to be accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep your fungi until 60.<br />
<br />
So you're not breaking even anymore...big deal.  Toss a heal every once in awhile.  The fungi is still FAR more useful than any other BP until you hit 61 and have to start hunting in places that really hurt.<br />
<br />
I did what you're doing.  I have a warrior and a shaman who've been together since the 30's.  If I had to do it all over again, hell yes, in a heartbeat, I'd do it over again with Fungi's.   Until you hit level 61, it's the best BP in the game for you.  Other BP's only &quot;Heal&quot; (and by heal, I mean prevent damage) while you're in combat, and they also only prevent melee damage.  They don't stop spells, they don't stop DoT's or negative effects, and all of that shit is counteracted at least somewhat by the regrowth on the Fungi.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, look at it this way.  What's your wife's best heal?  What's gonna be her best heal soon?  Trust me, healing sucks ass as a shaman.  Chloroblast is bullshit, Kragg is bullshit, and it's not until you get Torpor at 60 that you can even pretend to be a healer.  You REALLY don't want to be opening that can of worms by losing 150hp a minute on the weakest healing priest class sub 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The FH bracers aren't *that* bad.<br />
Combined stats on your two bracers:<br />
AC 25, DEX 15, AGI 23, STR 8, STA 4, various resists 5, HP 35<br />
Combined stats on two FH bracers:<br />
AC 50, DEX 10, various resists 10, HP 110.<br />
<br />
If your Magelo is accurate, bumping your resists will do you at least as much good as the AGI you'd lose. And then there's the extra 25 AC and 75 HPs.</div></div><hr />

Just keep the fungi, it's gonna do a lot for you now, and by the time you need a &quot;real bp&quot; you can sell it and buy an ornate bp straight up with the money, most likely. Ornate BP is the upgrade ticket for you IMO. It's very good, and the clicky will be useful forever. Plus, you've got other slots that are worth upgrading.<br />
<br />
I would have killed to have more regen at lower levels, I love my 18/tick or whatever I have now, it's the closest thing to being &quot;self sufficient&quot; as a warrior. With shaman regen and good slows I can ALMOST tank BoT without needing heals now hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have updated my magelo now. I ended up dumping my two bracers, and getting a Fierce Heraldic Bracer, and a Crimson Darkscale Bracer. There was only one fierce for sale, so I had planned to hold off for another, however, the crimson darkscale had 2 more AC, at the cost of 10 hp, and since it was said that 1 ac to 6 hp, I figured that it all worked out. As for the BP, I plan to save up for the ornate mold, but in the mean time, I was just going to grab a FHBP. <br />
<br />
I looked at the Architect BP, but because of its recommeneded level, I could not get better ac out of it over the FH, and since I will switch out the BP soon anyway, it made no sense to buy it. Only problem is, is that it was a little late, and I botched the buy, and grabbed a FINE heraldic breastplate, lol. Damn guy had them side by side, same price, and they look the same, graphically and name wise. Oh well, now I am currently attempting to sell it, and I am going to buy the FHBP once it is sold, since I know that I don't need it quite yet. <br />
<br />
I was thinking of doing some LDoNs, not so much for exp (which sucks in the LDoN) but for anger augs, and an FT aug for the shaman, and maybe work on getting a Royal attendant peice or two, which is why I decided to get a BP right away, since I don't want people to look at me sideways when I show up to tank with a fungi on :P Anyway, thanks for the advise people, you have been a great help! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srogue</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Haas too.  The stuff you should be fighting at level 50-60 shouldn't be laying down so much damage that it would matter much by having more ac and stuff from a better BP.  Once you hit the 60s, are doing stuff like GoD, BoT, OoW whatever where the mobs are hittin for 600+, then yeah go for a better BP.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt go with ornate for a BP.  He duos/groups with a shammy exclusively, and the ornate click doesnt stack with the Focus line.  Charged Magnetic is the way to go.  Or upgrade other slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed, ornate click doesn't stack with FoS, but it DOES stack with IoS+dex+sta+FA so you can still get the stats boost from the shaman, and gain another 30 ac from the click. Shaman's dont get a real CH anyway, so total HP is almost meaningless when duoing with a shaman, and the ac boost from the ornate click puts it in the uber-bp range.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that you group at one time or another with or without the shaman, and at that point the regular BP would be more efficient than the fungi.<br />
<br />
If I bought a Fungi I would keep it, but I don't ever solo enough to justify buying one......... but if you solo HG's, Rockhoppers, or other greenies later in the game for cash or farming tradeskill items you will use it.</div></div><hr />

Ya know, I never noticed that I gained AC from clicking my ornate bp.. course im a monk and AC is almost meaningless :P  Maybe I should look before I speak.<br />
<br />
Though with 5 buffs instead of FoS he may run into buff slot issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Once he gets 65 and the wife gets FA, sltw, boar will be the only thing he'll really want to use anyway. Although shamans get an AC buff too, that nobody uses. I forget it's name.<br />
<br />
Until then,  he'll be fine for duo at least. With a full group, all bets are off though hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I primarily Duo, and occasionaly grab a third person for DPS, or get into an LDoN group. I am not allowed to level without her shaman though, kind of sucks, cause she does not want me to do anything without her char. In one way it is good, because I always have a shammy around, but in the sense that I have to two box when she is gone, it sucks :P Anyway, still trying to sell this damn Fine Heraldic Breastplate, most likely never going to happen though, and will just have to eat the cost. I still want some different legs though, because all plate, with chain legs just looks odd.... hell, all plate and chain legs and chest looks odd too... welll... actually, pretty much everything doesn't look good on an ogre, but full plate would still look way better, heh. <br />
<br />
Anyone want to throw in something about the weapons? I have actually run into agro problems on two of my LDoN's now. I found it odd that I actually lost agro several times, because I have always been told that CHoS and SotB make an excellent agro couple. However, I lost agro a few times to a pally (who was not stun spamming, just swinging, using a War Marshals bladed staff auged with heated blade) and also to a ranger, but that was usually cause he dotted it too fast from when it was pulled. Sadly.... we actually had out cleric pull agro (not from healing, the cleric was always at full mana, so she was actually up there meleeing). She had some kind of mace doing god knows what with a proc, seemed to snag agro every time it went off, lol. <br />
<br />
Anyway, aside from the obvious augs I should add to the weapons (I plan on the lifetap proc from MM, and a heated blade from NRo, until I save up for an ykesha, but I HATE SRo &gt;_&lt;) is there anything I can do for agro? Maybe a different weapon combo or something? And please, do not say BoC, I would preffer 30k or less, and as I stated earlier, I have no raid force, I MIGHT be able to scrounge up 2 groups of mid 50's, but that is really shakey (and I don't trust most of them to A: not steal the loot, and B: do thier job, lol)</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are you using taunt?  If you are spamming it, you're using it incorrectly.  Taunt is only to be used when you do not have aggro, because if it works the mob comes straight back to you.  Also, are you using the incite/bellow/whatever disciplines?  Those are straight hate added right away.  Usually when another class pulls, I taunt then incite right away and it usually gives me the attention right off the bat.<br />
<br />
As for the weapons, stick with the CHoS and the SotB until later when you can get a GBoS or another good no drop weapon.  How's your 2hb looking?  I remember when I was 55-60 I used a Great Staff of Thunder and it was insane aggro.  It was only like 100pp and worked so well.  If your 2hb is bad, buy the weapon and pump 10 training in to it and head off to PoI.  Just find a zone in group there and ask if you can beat on their mobs.  I spent a few hours here and was pretty much set to use it in a group.<br />
<br />
About those augs, I wouldn't bother personally.  If I was going to buy any, at least make it an anger II / III aug, or start saving for one.  I didn't get one until level 66 because it takes so long, but the long term effects of it are much better than a straight DD proc augment.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always use bellow when I am pulling, or as soon as the mob is within range of me if someone else is pulling. Usually in my grouping experience, a pally is our puller, since he will be soothing, and it just runs better. As far as taunt, I usually spam it and bash, unless I know someone is dropping a nuke, slow, dot or whatever, that has a good chance of grabbing agro. Such is with the shaman. When I pull, she drops a slow on it while it is still coming for us, this usually wont pull agro off my bellow, and then she starts casting envenomed bolt. I always save a taunt for right after she bolts, cause that always pulls agro when it is early in on the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if I am understanding you correctly, I should not use taunt at all if I already have agro? I can see saving it back, incase someone else drops an unexpected proc or spell, but it there anything bad about the taunt spam? I was told that it puts you 1 points of hate higher than the top person on the list, so if that is me, I basically just add extra hate to myself. Is this correct, or does it disregaurd me, and put me 1 points above the next highest if I am the highest? And therefore take away agro?<br />

In dire straights, I also often use beg, as I have been told it adds to agro. Not sure if that is just superstition or not, but it doesn't hurt, lol. I will also sit down if I really need something off the shammy right away. Usually /shield, then sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaqs</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back at your level, I used beg as well, and alltho we never did any real testing to see if it worked (we were a couple of warriors that were using it) we were all pretty convinced of its effect.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, beg seem to be designed such that the higher your skill is, the less agro you will generate :( - either that or they discovered that tanks were using it for agro and changed the hate generation part of it.<br />
<br />
One advice I'll give you is use arrows:<br />
If you're pulling, you pull with an arrow and will get a longer headstart on the run back to group / shammy, then use your bellow as soon as you clash blades with the mob.<br />
If someone else is pulling, you fire an arrow first, then at melee range fire Taunt, bash (maybe disarm /dont flame me now :p ), and then bellow - IN SAID ORDER! Reason being, that if taunt works you will get on top of hatelist (if you werent from the arrow) and the following actions will simply build up distance between you and 2nd on hatelist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, very good to know. I do not currently have disarm though, because I was told that it doesn't work. Is this incorrect? Or does it not work, but generates agro? And how much agro? I can see your point on the taunt thing though, I am basically just burning myself for hate by bellowing before taunting. Any idea about the taunting after I have agro though? Will I loose hate points, or still just gain hate points by taunting after having agro? If that is the case, and it will actually lower my hate down to 1 above the next highest, that might explain some of my agro issues.<br />
<br />
Edit add: Oh, also forgot. I got into the swing of using bellow as a pulling tool because of the fact that many things seem to be single pullable as long as I hit them with something that does not do damage. For example, if I throw something at things in dulak, I will pull a bunch, but if I bellow, or my wifes shaman pulls with a slow, we get single pulls, unless they are on top of each other, and sometimes even then. I had been told that pulling with non damage spells was a much better idea than pulling with damage, please clarify on if that is a myth or not.</div></div><hr />

At 52 actually, she WOULD have gotten PE, however, the spell is so rare, that i have never actually found it for sale, nor yaeths compendium 73 right. I was told by someone that they would go get the page for me, but would charge 30k. For 30k, I would rather buy flow stones for the extra 20 agi :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure folks will correct me if I'm wrong, but if i want the strongest possible aggro in the first round of a fight, the sequence will go like this:<br />
<br />
Case 1 (I'm pulling)<br />
1. tag mob with arrow<br />
2. Wait for mob in the location I want to tank it. (If long pull/good line of sight, might have time to tag incoming mob with arrow a second time)<br />
3. Get a round of melee in on mob.<br />
4. Use incite line.<br />
<br />
Strictly speaking, I'm not sure #3 is necessary; however, it looks a lot to me like you don't get the full hate of the incite line if you use it to do the initial pulling (before either tagging with arrow or meleeing). At level 55 you have to be tanking a very tough mob indeed for slow to have to land before the mob ever hits you. There are a number of classes that have better pulling tools than warriors do, but in normal LDoNs I prefer to do as much of the pulling as possible. And, in fact, much of a normal LDoN can usually be single or double pulled; a couple of times each adventure you'll come to a room with 4-5 dark blue mobs that will all come unless you have pac/split pulling class.<br />
<br />
Case 2 (someone else is pulling)<br />
1. Assist puller and tag incoming mob with arrow (assuming you have good line of sight on mob)<br />
2. If #1 does not get you to the top of the aggro list, taunt mob; if arrow does get mob on you, do not taunt.<br />
3. engage with melee<br />
4. use incite line.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, all of these things should happen very quickly; there shouldn't be a pause between melee engagement and the incite.<br />
The drawback to this is sequence is that if slow lands before you can engage mob, mob is apt to jump the shaman (because you haven't used incite yet). However, if you see the mob peeling off toward the caster, you can always incite at that point as it's an instant effect.<br />
If you have a low aggro puller (say, a bard) then it is easier to get the mob on you when it gets to camp, obviously. However, if you have a high-aggro puller (say, an SK) when you do take aggro you'll be much farther ahead of the casters. I've been in some very efficient groups with SKs, because they can generate big aggro, and can take a hit until i piggyback on their aggro. If you don't get into an aggro pissing contest with the SK, either of you can tank, you can ride his aggro, the group has offtanking, steamroll tanking, and named tanking all covered nicely.<br />
Obviously, it helps if the puller actually brings the mob to you, rather than to some random location in or near the camp. It also helps if your shaman stands right next to you during the initial slow. If slower wants to sit down after you secure aggro, she should back up a ways before sitting.<br />
<br />
Other aggro considerations:<br />
1. Do not use taunt if you already have aggro. The &quot;+ some small amount&quot; of additional aggro you get is trivial compared to the potential advantage of having taunt refreshed when you need it.<br />
2. If taunt and the incite line are both up and a mob turns from you, the proper sequence for regaining aggro is to taunt then incite. A successful taunt will regain aggro and the incite hate will sit on top of that. If taunt is unsuccessful, you still get the incite hate, at least. <br />
3. Disarm will put you on the hate list, but nothing more than that as far as I know. Forget it and begging.<br />
4. Sitting can help, but you have to be in trouble before it's a good idea.<br />
5. /shield &lt;your shaman&gt; will add to your aggro, I think, although I have no parses to prove it. If I were you and duo'd a bunch, I'd have it hotkeyed.<br />
6. You should always be the closest player to the mob when you are tanking the mob. Proximity aggro is free.<br />
7. The cases where you are losing aggro when another character's proc fires is probably just an effect of the random number generator. Aggro will often bounce to the first person who gets off a stun proc. If a cleric starts to melee with a CHoS or something, I figure that cleric is prepared to tank through multiple taunt failures on my part. If not, they'll generally decide to quit meleeing at some point during their run from bind point back to the group.<br />
8. You mention LDoN dd/lifetap procs. My baby 54 warrior just got the heated blade aug from N. Ro; given how few points you get in your mid-50s for an LDoN win, aggro augs are a long time coming, and the heated blade costs just 40 points. It's really a trivial proc, but it adds maybe +1 dps and some tiny tiny amount of hate, so what the heck? No one really tells people here to go get one, because it is trivial, but check the magelos of folks 55-64 ish and you'll see a few heated blades out there until the real augs are unlocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To emphasize: Disarm does nothing for aggro, other than aggroing the mob initially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good stuff here from Brabble. The only change for me is if I'm pulling, I don't wait for a melee round. I fire incite as soon as I can. I often tag the mob, and stand spamming incite until it hits, and THEN run back to the group. This lets the &quot;DoT&quot; portion of the incite add up more while the mob is running to me.<br />
<br />
What brabble suggests for when working with another puller is pretty much the best scenario for aggro efficiency. However, oftentimes your puller is being lame and doesn't run straight through you, so you aren't easily in taunt range. Or you're fighting stuff that will wax your puller in 1 round if taunt were to fail. In that case if my arrow tags didn't get aggro I go ahead and fire incite, and hope it peels the mob off before it gets to camp. It's not ideal, but it prevents anyone else from getting hit, and I still have taunt and /shield up if the slower gets aggro.<br />
<br />
Read and reread his &quot;other considerations&quot;. They're spot on. Don't spam taunt, use it only when somebody else has taken the top spot on the aggro list and you need it back. I'll add a few of my own, too.<br />
<br />
1. CHoS + SotB is a good combo. I used them at your level and did well. Try and get people to do LGuk ldons and save for at least a single ykesha aug for your mainhand.  I wouldn't buy anything else with your ldon points until you have one, although heated blade wouldn't hurt anything I guess. Ykesha is good aggro, adds dps, and is cheap. You can get Anger2 if you really want but most of us don't think it's as good.<br />
<br />
2. Make sure your dex is buffed as high as possible in a group. Take chanter haste, that werewolf form thingy or NDT if it's available, make sure you're wearing hos+dex from the shaman all the time. If you're less than 255 dex, your procrate is getting gimped.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, if you're still not holding aggro pretty consistently, people just need to be a little more careful, or they're significantly overgeared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My dex is 244 with just an HoS, however, I still force my shammy to always have dexterity on me as well, just to top it off. That may have changed a little now, since I have switched my bracers that gave me extra dex, but it still works out to always having 255 dex. I would say on a typical LDoN mob, I will proc about 5 times between my two weapons. That is of course just a feeling, often I get less, or more, and I have not kept track, or parsed or anything, but I would say anywhere from 4-5 on average. If I have not gotten agro from the pally yet, the first proc usually strips it from him, however, I have a very difficult time with the same said pally in the MM ldons, because he has a heated blade on his war marshals, plus the instrument of nife (maybe a new proc now, hell if I know) and when they start to proc, I often loose agro for a moment, but not too bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
And thank you very much Brabble, all good things to know. And yes, I have /shield &lt;shaman&gt; hotkeyed, heh. At my level and below, I have only had to use a few times, because she can actually effectivly tank when the mobs have been slowed (maybe not effectivly, but still pretty good) and her pet will usually take the agro off of her when she starts to back away. I usually only have to /shield if I get an unexpected add onto her, with her pet in on a different mob, or if her pet has generated proximity agro on a mob that would not have agro'd at that range on me. Even then that is not much of a problem, however, she often cannibalizes herself down to 50% before healing herself, and an unslowed mob is quite capable of taking that 50% away before I can gain agro, or get over to her.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you all for all your help, I am glad to finally have a place that I can get answers. I posted a few things at the casters realm, and like, 2 months later I get crap answers, or no answers at all, lol.</div></div><hr />
