I am in a guild. but we are still learning the ropes of raiding and as such most no drop planar gear and expensive planar gear etc is stil out of my reach. Would fierce heraldic greaves be worth the 14kto20k they are selling for on my server?<br />
<br />
Also i have GSoT and WMBS on my toon at all times. which is better? not really sure which to use and when to use it. thanks in avance for yall's suggestions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For your weapons question, use the GSoT when you are tanking and need agro.  When you aren't tanking, and need DPS, use the WMBS.<br />
<br />
The rest of your gear is decent, imo.  You ask if the FH greaves are worth it for 14-20k.  Well, by going to FH greaves, you'd gain 10 AC, 80 HP, 5 dex, and lose 3 sta.  That's a decent gain, imo.  FH cultural will last you until you and your guild do level/gear up, and start raiding higher planes and elementals.  On the other hand, if you spent those 14-20k and upgraded your face and feet slots to the FH cultural, you should save a few thousand pp.  As well, you'd gain 7 AC, 110HP, 5 sta, 5 dex, 5 agi.  Bigger bang for the buck there, imo.<br />
<br />
And of course, as everyone keeps saying, and you'll probably hear as well; keep grinding out LDoN points.  The gear available from there is very nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some little critiques for ya:<br />
<br />
Keep your shrouded medallion around for resists, but you need something with some hps on it. Some good examples of upgrades would be Clattering Bone Necklace and Amulet of Mummy Wrappings. Those would both serve well on your neck. Your Cobalt Boots need to be changed to something with hp without losing too much ac, 1ac to 5-7 hps is the formula you'd want to go off of for your gear I would think. Examples: Champion Boots, Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer (maybe, not sure on the AC), look around.. boots are tough. <br />
Maybe you are waiting for a new item or have something coming.. but you have no haste item! It is probly the best upgrade you could do right now. Every melee needs some kind of haste.. Increased Dps = Increased Aggro. <br />
No reason not to buy another FH Bracer.. you and I are in the same category of armors EXCEPT you can wear FH. Probly the biggest advantage being a warrior is being able to wear the FH Armors. They are designed with warriors in mind.. apparently not all warriors :P But FH is Cheap for the upgrade you can get. Stay away from the Bp as you can get better for much cheaper.. but if I could buy a 55hp bracer for the prices they are nowdays.. bah! Get FH Greaves while your at it. <br />
You are losing a bit by having no hp in your shoulder slot.. that could be 50hps easy without losing much ac.. Strength of the Elements would be a good quest to look into, along with Eyepatch of Plunder and after I am done camping Zefeer you should look into the Loyalist Shield of Honor. <br />
Darkwood Bow of Suffering would be a small little upgrade for ya.. If you sell the Nightmare Bow you'll have more than enough to buy a DBoS. <br />
Some easy upgrades that can get you up to 4k unbuffed!<br />
Hope it helps, feel free to shoot me a tell if you have a question about what I've been sayin here<br />

I had SCHW's but swapped them out for the new gaunts. i know i need  a new item haste but spent my whole wad on the ornate mold. im gonna hold off on the FH legs b/c they are not a great upgrade and i can spend that money better elsewhere. Like Zito said earlier, i can really spice up my HPs and ac by going to the above mentioned FH items.<br />
