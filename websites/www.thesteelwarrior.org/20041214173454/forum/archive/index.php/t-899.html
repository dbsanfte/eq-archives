Much to his surprise, Disarm was not on the list of available skills to train!<br />
<br />
Disarm was listed (and trainable) for Syndrae, my level 56 warrior.<br />
<br />
I created a new barbarian warrior and looked for the Disarm skill when I had the guildmaster training window open and it was not listed.  Can anyone confirm this as well, or are we missing something obvious?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The PoK and Neriak warrior guildmasters both had Disarm skill available for Syndrae.<br />
<br />
The warrior trainer in Gukta for the frogloks apparently did not have Disarm available.</div></div><hr />

I do most of my playing from PoK and take the books/stones to where I am going.  I know the Dwarf warior trainer in the upstairs of the building between the Kelethin and Kaladim stones trains Disarm.  Might want to try there.<br />
