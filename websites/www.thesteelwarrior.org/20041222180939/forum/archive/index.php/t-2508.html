That skill is muy bien.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I would get PE first because that will increase your already bought AA's of ND, CA, and CS. <br />
<br />
Then finish off ND2 and ND3. Then finish the LR line and do PD3. That should keep you busy for the next 50aa's.<br />
<br />
And yes AE Taunt is well worth the 5aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzo</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo, you can't be in the tanking rotation if you do not have AE Taunt. <br />
<br />
The path I would take is as follows:<br />
<br />
Run3 --&gt; Regen3/Sta3 (depending on race and how much you farm stuff) --&gt; ND3 --&gt; AE Taunt --&gt; CA3 --&gt; PD3 ---&gt; CS3 --&gt; PE --&gt; LR5 --&gt; ID5. Thats it for Defensive AA's. You can tack PP5 on to the end if you're an avid exp'er... the extra stat boost is nice. For offensive, I'd go for CF3 and Flurry3... at that point, you'll have well over 100AA and a Marshall title, though, so its far away.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, AE Taunt is &gt;the&lt; Warrior class defining AA. Get it ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh how could I foreget AE taunt?<br />
<br />
PE (get 6% in increase for 5 AA, can't beat that with a stick), ND2, ND3, AE (though its handy enough in XP groups to go before ND2-3), CS2, CS3 then have some fun. If you are MT you may want to think about keeping on the defensive, but I would get very bored with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE Taunt, ND2, ND3, PE.  I'd get LR5 before I got CS2 so after PE, I'd say work toward LR5 and PD3.  Also, throw in a few offensive AAs because doing all defense is boring.  Ferocity would be a good start and a level or 2 of PB if you use 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way I would send 3 AA for a 1% improvement on anything before completeling the arch defensive abilities. CS2-3 is 10 AA for a 8% increase in mitigation, where LR5 would be 15 AA fro a 5% increase in avoidance.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT Changed 7 to 8, as 3% + 5% = 8, no 7. Speeling should be my downfall, not basic math.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm... I was working toward LR5 before going back to get CS 2 and 3.  (Currently have LR3 and CS1).  After reading Kailyn's numbers though, I'm thinking I might be making a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I missed something, how do you figure LR5 is equal to 5% overall avoidance?  No numbers are supplied under the description of the AA, and I can tell you that I noticed a big difference between LR0 and LR5.  Which makes me think thats its certainly more than a 5% boost to avoidance.<br />
<br />
Where did you find that info, or did you just use comparison tests between LR0 and LR5 and figure it was 5%?<br />

I wouldnt take those numbers to heart; believe me LR5 is definately worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a best path to max defensive AA from ZERO AA (just the opinion of one runt):<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3 or Metab3 (for the stat-food lover /boggle)<br />
<br />
ND3<br />
AE Taunt<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
PE<br />
<br />
PD3<br />
LR5<br />
ID5<br />
SE3 (because getting stunned a lot less = win)<br />
<br />
Think that's 103AA points total. I'd reccomend doing PP after ID5 and before SE if you have important stats exceeding 280. If you don't cap out at 280 with buffs, then I'd hold off on PP until you do.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hrm, rereading my post it looks like Rex equates &quot;best&quot; with &quot;most linear&quot;...but I like order /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Because people on this board parsed it.  Do a search.  Kailyn is indeed correct.</div></div><hr />

You should check into Nightraids though for Behemoth fights. I forget who is flagged for PoT from our guild, but I have lots of friends we could team up with...</div></div><hr />

<br />
while this holds true for Luclin / Velious bosses, later in PoP you're gonna have a hard time relying on AE taunt for tank switching.<br />
<br />
bosses I know that can be AE taunted 100% of the time in PoP:<br />
Vallon Zek / Tallon Zek<br />
Grummus<br />
Manaethic Behemoth<br />
Saryrn<br />
Terris Thule<br />
Bertoxxulous<br />
Any boss in CoD HP cycle<br />
Pyronis<br />
Babnoxis the Spider Queen<br />
General Druav Flamesinger / General Reparm<br />
Arch Mage Yozanni<br />
Any boss in PoWater<br />
Almost any boss in PoEarth (see below)<br />
<br />
bosses (in my experience) that can be AE taunted but not reliably:<br />
Tanthisala Jaggedtooth (PoEarth)<br />
Aerin'Dar<br />
Rydda'Dar<br />
Criare Sunmane / Jaxoliz Dawneyes / Quavonis Firetail<br />
Magmaton<br />
PoAir Avatars<br />
Blazzax the Omnifiend<br />
<br />
bosses that I'm 99% sure can't be AE taunted at all due to Z-axis problem (make corrections if you have experienced otherwise):<br />
Mithianel Marr<br />
Rallos Zek / Rallos Zek the Warlord<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
<br />
oh look, I'm rambling again. carry on...</div></div><hr />

Rex<br />
<br />
ps- Lukus has several AA/charm-worthy flags...Calyn and Dondi may aslo, bunch of us did non-AA/charm hedge flag for PoNB earlier this week with DA. Nightraid = at night on weekdays, and I can not attend 99% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AE taunt is a great AA though, and would be worth it even if it was 15 points instead of 5.  I got ND3 last night and AE taunt is next.  I can't wait hehe, have missed it very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is some good information, Choppin, if it holds true. <br />
<br />
I should think that most people who are still at the AA stage in their career where they are considering PD versus AE versus other archtype AAs ... they are not yet fighting non-AE taunt mobs.  I could be wrong.  <br />
<br />
In my experience, which hasn't yet gone into the elemental planes, AE taunt is the single most important AA you can buy as a warrior in a tank line up.  Its good in experience groups when all hell breaks loose and you need to get four mobs off every other caster for a second, its good when you want to be able to show that fucking guildie SK that NO, THE MOB IS MINE DAMMIT, and its necessary when you want a fluid rotation on a raid mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I happen to think that you have to mix in some offensive AA's or your gonna run into aggro problems when the other classes have used alot of thier 100 aa into offensive . I chose to mix in some offensive and took CF3 and Flurry1 quite early on , and i never regretted it a bit , i find flurry to work very much like a proc , its the potential to do extra damage. Im not saying flurry is that great of an ability but its nice to have any extra help getting/holding aggro. Some level of tactical mastery and stalward endurance are also worth getting along the way imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slowmotionz</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your not a raid-tank for your guild I'd suggest ND3 then go for your offensive AAs (IE. CF3, PoP Crit 3, Flurry). Ofcourse dont forget to get AE Taunt thats way worth it. In XP groups you'll be fine unless your xping in Elemental Planes or some shit like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanlor</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am the main tank for my guild - I was also wondering.. with about 4500 hp unbuffed , how many extra hp will all the +HP AA give me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 + 2 + 1.5 +1.5 +1.5 = 16.5%<br />
<br />
4500 x 16.5% = 742.5 extra HP.<br />
<br />
Math class guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because I hate math, if I want to know what an AA will give me, I check it out on Magelo.  Yeah, maybe its not absolutely 100% accurate but its close enough and pretty easy. <br />
<br />
I've now started some offensive AA and its damn fun, but I still think the typical tank route ought to be HPAA and defensiveAA.  Even if you are not the main tank, your tanking abilities will be useful as add-tank or when the main tanks are all skipping out going to see American Wedding.  They will also be uber useful in exp groups.</div></div><hr />
