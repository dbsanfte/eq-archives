<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok the 5% quote was taken from  1 - 20 now 1 - 19 so 1 of 20 is 5%. however.<br />
<br />
what happened to the 20th DI?<br />
<br />
has the 20th DI been compltely removed from the equation<br />
<br />
or does a 20th DI hit now count as the 19th DI.<br />
<br />
ie: 1 2 3....18 19  or 1 2 3...18 19 19.<br />
<br />
<br />
because first off unless your AC sucks or your fighting rz or something you wont get hit for max dmg all that much. take Xegony, her atk sucks we parced it and i got hit for min dmg like 60% of the time. and only got hit forr max like 2% of the time.<br />
<br />
so for xegony i would have had a 1% mitigation bonus. BUT if 20 = 19 instead of being removed from the equasion then that 1% is moved to 19th DI and i would only have like 1/20th of a % mitigation change.<br />
---<br />
so if the change completley removed the 20th DI from the equation then your mitigation bonus is not 5% because no mob hits you for 5% straight across the board. the higher your ac the more min hits you will take.<br />
<br />
so the Mitigation % is based on your atk and the mobs ac.<br />
<br />
like I fought AoW the other day with 2487ac and he never hit me for a 1k  + hit. so that meens I got a 0% mitigation bonus. <br />
<br />
they should just give everyone inate 5% shielding</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not had the ability to do a real scientific test however since my old parses have wildly varying amounts of AC, or BoV =(<br />

 Note to Brenlo: Look into removing Aakla's mitigation bonus, 'cuz he's obviously too uber to need it.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, the magic of spreadsheets.  I did some back-of-the-napkin math, assuming a few different DIs.<br />
<br />
First I assume<br />
damage = DB+[RND*DI]<br />
<br />
Now, we don't really know what the heck is happening with the part of the equation that's in square brackets.  Traditionally, it returned evenly distributed numbers from 1 to 20.  Now I'm assuming they are jacking with the numbers that come out of it somehow.<br />
<br />
Here are 3 possibilities.. RND returning...<br />
1) from 1 to 19.<br />
2) from 1+1 to 19 (ie, 1 1 2 3 4 ... etc)<br />
3) from 0 to 19<br />
<br />
What I found, which is obvious with a little thought, is that the higher DI is, the more benefit we get from any manipulation of RND.  So a mob the a DB of 5000 and a DI of 5 will be a tough mob no matter if we're defensive or not, or have any new mitigation.  Conversely, a mob with DB of 100 and DI 200 would hit wildly and those hits would be very mitigatable.<br />
<br />
I found that methods 2 and 3 above yield virtually identical results, only differing I believe by DI/20.  <br />
<br />
<br />
  DB   DI   Avg   1-19  1+1-19  0-19<br />
 100    5   152    98%    97%    97%<br />
1000    5  1052   100%   100%   100%<br />
1000  100  2050    98%    95%    95%<br />
1000  200  3100    97%    94%    94%<br />
<br />
<br />
DB is the damage base, DI is the interval.  Avg is the average damage assuming pure DB+RND(20)*DI.  The next three columns show the percentage of the average damage using the specified method.<br />
<br />
What we see is that<br />
on line 1...a wimpy mob, the three methods yield 2%, 3%, and 3% mitigation.<br />
on line 2... A consistently hard mob yields us no mitigation.  DI simply doesn't matter.<br />
on line 3...A reasonable mob produces 2% to 5% mitigation<br />
on line 4...A bastardly mob produces from 3% to 6% mitigation.<br />
<br />
What it amounts to is that the higher DI with respect to DB, the more mitigation we get.  And that I don't see us getting anywhere close to 5% mitigation in any reasonable scenario using the 1-19 method.<br />
<br />
I did a little more doinking and have determined that, with the 1-19 method, 5% mitigation CAN NOT happen.  Looks like the resulting formula has a limit at 95.238%.  So the best we can possibly get is 4.762%<br />
<br />
Of course, all of this is in supposition that the base formula is still valid.</div></div><hr />
