<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey folks,<br />
<br />
firstly apologies if it doesn't belong here - please move to most appropriate forum.<br />
<br />
We're currently a PoP/VT level guild (RZ/Sol Ro away from full EPs), and field on average about 60 raiders (sometimes the full 72).  We're a family guild that raids, so have a few part timers.<br />
<br />
We do a lot of our raid discipline *very* well - raid leading is spot on, our CC/OT are excellent, our cleric rotations sound.  <br />
<br />
The one thing that we're having trouble with at the moment on our larger raids is PUSH.  The solution at the moment is our MT or RL barking instructions at people to balance push, but this is a solution that (quite frankly) is doing my head in.<br />
<br />
Do any of you have a suggestion on ways to manage push?  e.g. we were entertaining the idea of banning (suspending) all pets on trash and just bringing them out for named, also the idea of all knockback being banned etc.<br />
<br />
Need any thoughts that you guys have, as our current 'tell them where to go, tell them where to go, tell them where to go' isn't going to be a solution that has any life in it, and I would assume we'll be in danger of having our asses handed to us as we progress.<br />

<br />
MT can move mobs when appropriate.<br />
<br />
Cornering also elimintes the problem of pushing obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tubthumpa</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DP has actually been one of the problems, but I guess it's been one of communication - e.g. if RL says 'move mob to the north' then 2 DP monks + 2 knockback stun pallys do just that (cue benny hill music as it's pushed into the pile of adds just waiting for us).<br />
<br />
If that's the only solution, then I'll need to work on who does and does not use that and when.<br />

Sometimes seems like you lose some melee dps with this though from the moving around but just a guess.  Stick a few pets on the front and some tanks meleeing from the front/side to balance frontal push with the raid on the back.  Cornering allows the highest raid melee dps imo though if that's an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm providing information beyond your original question. While everbody likely knows this stuff, there are newer players and relatively new raiders. The difference between a zergling mob and a well oiled-raid machine is players being taught what is expected and practicing it until the number of instructions by the raid leader can be reduced. Players that do not follow elementary raid rules stick out like a sore thumb and are often the subject of private criticism - no one &quot;outgrows&quot; proper play.<br />
*******<br />
Pets:<br />
Pet owners are responsible for their actions and their positioning. Without belaboring the topic, pets can not intercept incoming mobs or interfer with the positioning of mobs. MT's will attempt to prevent pets from dying to enrage by not spinning the mob when it's enraged - pets should be generally behind or on the sides of the mob. If a pet is badly out of position, the owner should pull it out of the fight momentarily. The raid leader can declare NO PETS (KILL PETS) or NO SWARM PETS (only the Raid Leader or officers should ever SHOUT in a raid) as needed.<br />
<br />
Incoming:<br />
No one other than the pull team should be between the incoming mob and the MT. The pull team is responsible for bringing the incoming mob to the MT who should be front and center. The pull team should indicate when the MT (and only the MT) should &quot;tag&quot; a mob. To avoid Ping Pong (below), those who slow or debuff on incoming should stand near the MT on normal pulls.<br />
<br />
Ping Pong:<br />
Those casters prone to pull the mob away from the MT and where the fight is taking place should manage their aggro OR insure they are near the fight when casting a high aggro spell. Pulling a mob away from the fight should be announced by a shout of PING PONG and a private discussion with chronic offenders.<br />
<br />
Cornering:<br />
The Raid Leader can indicate that a mob will be fought in the corner by announcing CLEAR CORNER. No one should be in the corner and the path to it should be clear.<br />
<br />
Surrounding:<br />
SURROUND should cause 4 to 6 Warriors to move to the mob's front, Rogues to the back, and other melee to be on the mob's left and right. Monks should use Dragon Punch to offset mob movement and raiders can switch sides as needed. PUSH instructions, WALL warnings, and BACK OFF instructions should not be necessary. Raiders should be aware of mob movement and position themselves accordingly.<br />
<br />
Wall:<br />
Should a WALL warning be issued, all pets not between the mob and the wall must be recalled. All players capable of pushing the mob should get between the mob and the wall and all others should move to the sides or back off. Anyone that gets aggro should backoff and try to &quot;pull&quot; the mob away from the wall. A high aggro caster can assist by moving to where the mob should be and nuking.<br />
<br />
Walking and Spinning the mob:<br />
Idealy mobs should be held stationary, but this doesn't always occur. If room permits, the MT can &quot;walk&quot; a mob in a long oval path allowing for maximum DPS. When &quot;walking&quot; a mob, effort should be made not to change it's direction once it enrages, get oor of casters, or to aggro adds. When a mob is spinning, efforts should be made to hold it stationary. At a minimum this will slow the rate of spin and maximize DPS.<br />
<br />
Enrage:<br />
ENRAGE warnings should not be necessary.<br />

(many spells and especialy stuns have a solid pushback potential)</div></div><hr />

look for the post by Brokkah Narrow a bit down, very nicely written i think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cornering is the easiest way to avoid this.  Just back into the corner, insert thumb up butt and then run down to the store for more munchies.  (Its also pretty boring) <br />
<br />
In situations where you can't (or don't want to) corner, KEEP YOUR RAID BEHIND THE MOB.  This allows you, the MT, to steer.  If you have to keep the mob in place, just start rotating slowly.  As your raid tries to keep behind the mob, they have a tendency to lag a little bit.  This results in most of the raid being just to one side of behind the mob, moving to behind.  If you keep rotating, and your raid is on the ball, this will result in the mob rotating around you.  Its a handy way to tank in one spot w/o a corner.  It does require that your raid mellees have the kb/mouse skills to rotate around a point in space.  (sidestep one way, rotate back the other... in steps on kb, or sidestep one way rotate back the other continuously with the mouse)  <br />
<br />
You will inevitably lose some mellee dps this way.  And lazy rogues will hate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have to ask what mobs you're having trouble with as well.  Personally, if it's out in the open and the raid is pushing to much, I usually just rotate the mob about 60 degrees and get the bulk of the raid pushing from the side of the mob,  then they just sort of push it in a circle with me (more or less) stationary but rotating.  You lose some dps from your AFK melee vs cornering, but you can't always corner.  I don't have much faith in &quot;balanced pushing&quot; and I don't want to yell at people, so I prefer to just use my aggro to position the mob myself if possible.</div></div><hr />
