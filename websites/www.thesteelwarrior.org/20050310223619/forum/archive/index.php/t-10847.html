<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padawan</div><div class="date">03-05-2005, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your shammy is a Troll or Ogre do teh Snare necklace quest for him to make things alot easier if you havent already. ATM i would suggest doing the Sol RO Tower access quest and playing about in there, Decent Experience for those levels and Ornate Rune Drops are nice. Only problem is you will need to be able to tank 2 Mobs at once on the first round and slow them both quickly to survive, not overly hard as thats how i lvled my Shammy and Cleric up and they both ended up with some Ornate items.<br />
<br />
If this fails i would suggest Tactics if all 3 have access if not BoT once the other 2 are 62 for entry unless they have key quest done.<br />
<br />
Another good Zone is Plane of Torment if you want to lvl your Pottery.<br />
<br />
Nobles Causeway to raise your Draniks Loyalist faction  and get items for the OoW Tier 1 armor which is quite nice for all ur alts and yourself</div></div><hr />

<br />
He can't enter BoT if his unkeyed toons are 59...<br />
<br />
PoValor front cave / back cave might be a good spot.  PoStorms desert to do the alternate access quest for Tactics entry, then go xp in the pit.  If you find yourself unable to handle PoV, hobgoblins in PoN might be a good bet.  I 2boxed a 65 warrior / 50x wizard there while a friend played a 50x shaman, it wasn't too hard and not bad xp.  <br />
<br />
OoW missions might be a good place as well, found in Dranik's Scar.  Might be bad xp for your warrior but should be okay for the other 2 based on my limited experience there.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Also you can try to get the Diaku Raiders for the alternate access quest into Tactics.</div></div><hr />
