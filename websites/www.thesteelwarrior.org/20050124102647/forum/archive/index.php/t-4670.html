I'm at a bit of a loss as of what I should be looking for, relating to upgrades. I know the cobalt junk has to go, but I'm not sure exactly what to get to replace them. I imagine some items could also be replaced with something better, but...<br />
<br />
I'm not actually level 55 yet, last time I updated the profile I anticipated I'd get a group and get the last 20% XP I needed, and that hasnt happened yet. Also, that 6k in the bank is outdated. I've got about 97 plat right now. &lt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
I am currently guildless, so raiding isn't really an option. If you suggest items I can camp, I have a Shaman friend whos level 54 and would be willing to help out.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please. :cool:<br />
<br />
Quick edit: I don't know much about LDoN, mostly because I took a long EQ break and came back to start playing seriously again. If theres some LDoN equipments worth looking into that can be done with a reasonable amount of adventures (and no raid adventures either) let me know or give me a link to WAR LDoN info.</div></div><hr />

Just set up your class/race and slot you want, and search. Maybe limit by HPs or AC as well (if you get over 200 results it will truncate the list there)</div></div><hr />

I tried to take a look at your magelo, but it seems Magelo is down (surprise) so didn't see what sort of weapon you have. But a &quot;surefire&quot; weapon at levle 55+ is the Greatstaff of Thunder, I reckon you know of that one ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, without knowing what you have, it's kinda hard to say what to go for and you didn't mention what Race / diety your character is. :p<br />
<br />
But there's the Malovelent armor from Permafrost (Mir) that's pretty cheap on AP's .. like, 760 a piece.<br />
<br />
And then there's offcourse Racial armor, like Fierce Heraldic and such, which is very nice armor.</div></div><hr />
