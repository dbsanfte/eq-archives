<br />
I just signed up for the boards today. There seems to be a lot of wisdom (err maybe I should say HPs) amongst the warriors that post here. <br />
First a question on the the board itself. What is the direct link to this board and why isn't it posted on the Steel Warrior site itself. The forums link there still goes to the older EZboard, which I can't get to from work.<br />
<br />
Now, onto weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Haste items are so frustrating cause they usually have very little AC, STA, or HP. This being the case, I went with the Cowl of Mortality, which isn't terrible. Frustrated to find out it had a graphic =(<br />
When I moved over to it from the RBB, it left my belt slot empty, and I still haven't filled it. What would a good replacement be? Is it worth the extra 18k to get Heavy Rubicite, over the Fierce Heraldic?<br />
<br />
I haven't been too excited about my weapons setup. I had heard a lot about the Droga weapons and picked them up, but the GSoT still seems like it's better for keeping aggro. I would rather use Droga weapons due to the stats. Would it be worthwhile to get augments for them? If I use, them I typically have CHoS in primary. What would next weapon upgrade be from these? I was thinking I would upgrade Primary slot at some point and move the hammer to the secondary.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input and I'm happy to be on the board<br />
<br />
Always,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to the boards first of all :)  The best two possible upgrades for weapons atm I could see would be a Blade of Carnage which is damn expensive unless your guild can kill the AoW.  Also the Great Blade of Storms is nice and can be gotten with about 2-3 decent groups from Icestorm in BoT Tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">putrid belt is another option - its abuot half the price of the heavy rubicite girdle. not sure what the stats are on fierce heraldic.<br />
<br />
the GSoT v Droga weps for aggro is a bit of a close match. From my own personal usage i think the GSoT proc does do a bit more aggro but on the other hand you have one proccing weapon v 2 so it does all come out about square. Plus if u augment your 2 droga weps - thats 4 aggro procs v 2 for a GSoT, and assuming you go with anger III - thats a hella lot more aggro. Also, if your DPS minded, the Droga weps do a little bit more DPS than the GSoT.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next upgrade from a ChOS would be either a CHSD - from PoI dragon or a GBoS from icestorm in BoT. He drops the GBoS quite commonly - ive even see 2 drops on a kill. After that its up to the BoC (although the GBoS is comparable to BoC) and on to the SSRA aggro proccers.</div></div><hr />

I will have to start hitting LoDN more to get points for Anger procs. I've thought along the same lines, with 2 fast weapons being used, they should at least equal the GSoT, but the rogue I group with a lot says no way.<br />
<br />
I took a group to the slime pits in CT tonight and didn't fine the one that drops the Heavy Rubicite, came back and the price on the belt was down from 28k, to 23k, so I bought it. It added 112 hps, which doesn't seem too bad. I think everyone in the group would kill me, if I said we had to go back to that camp. hehe<br />
<br />
I will be giving you a tell Myst =)</div></div><hr />
