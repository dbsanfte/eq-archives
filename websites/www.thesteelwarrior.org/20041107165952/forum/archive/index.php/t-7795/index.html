<br />
After doing a lot of LDON, as a mage, I think one of my favourite group make-ups is NOT the usual boring single pull mezz...yawn yawn-type.<br />
On *easy* settings, having 3 or more melee players is MUCH better, faster and fun.<br />
<br />
Ok, basic point is to kill as many mobs as fast as possible in LDON. Killing 1 mob at a time is slow....pull one carefully....and you have to have a group set up just for that same old same old safe pull: 1 tank/1 mez/1 healer and who ever. But a huge amount of time is wasted on pulling and you have less DPs. If however you have say:<br />
<br />
3 plate melee(or high end ranger)/healer/2 others<br />
You can do MUCH better. You pull multiples and each is tanked, slowed, AoE nuked, AoE slowed...and nearly EVERYONE is doing DPs!<br />
<br />
A typically melee heavy group I may be in looks like this:<br />
1 warrior/1 paladin/1 ranger/1 cleric/1 shaman/me (magician 65)<br />
If you pull 3 to 5 mobs, keep them reasonably close, wizards, druids and mages can use RAIN spells, which are normally pretty crappy, but when you have multiple targets, rain spells can do a crap load of damage, or you can use point blank AoEs without needing AOE stuns because the melee's will be aggroing the mobs to heck.. All the while the melee are whittling down the mobs. Warrior for best tankage and AoE taunt, paladins for tankage/group heals some CC with stuns and root, rangers and Sks can help with pulls and somewhat better DPs...<br />
<br />
The end result is MUCH MUCH faster kill rates than standard pull/mezz. It's more risky, but more fun, and not suitable for Hard adventures unless you are truly uber. If the melee have AoE weapons, mmm!<br />
Group damage shields are also very nice in this system.<br />
So, when making a group up for LDON, why not try and get several warriors and try multiple mob killing?<br />
<br />
Something to think on?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or the other side of the coin is the group I was in a couple days ago with me, shaman,chanter, wizard and 2 mages. I pulled whole rooms and we just AE burned them down, did a kill 50 in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 shaman, 1 druid, 4 rogues - shaman tanks 3-5 at a time.  If you're on  Druzzil and have grouped with Lasgo, you know how he pulls in LDoN missions lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We normally run easies as five random melee and a shaman.  If you like you can throw a paladin or cleric into the mix in case of oopsies but really any semi-elemental crowd can chew through them like butter now.  We tend to run oog clerics/enchanters for buffs but even there it's not really needed.  Hell, I can tank the bloody things with a Shaman and I am certainly not well geared by any stretch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Done LDONs with just 2 paladins, a SK and me the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Atila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When they lowered the amount of people you can use i started to just 3 box them with Warrior, Rogue, Shaman and they seem easier than if you fill the group up.<br />
They usually only take 30-40min.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just did a hard ldon in Mistmoore this week with: <br />
<br />
3 rangers<br />
1 warrior (me) <br />
1 paladin <br />
1 shaman (healer and slower) <br />
<br />
(all 65) <br />
<br />
we did a 55 kill and blew it away in 59 minutes, no deaths and one named.<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, this shaman is my main healer for about 50% of the hard ldons I do, and I die less with him than anyone else, which I think is hysterical. <br />

I thought rain spells didn't matter how many target you had, hits like 3x 1 mob or 3 mobs 1x or any combo</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will still hit up to 4 (5 including yourself) mobs at once with all the waves. More than that, it starts spreading around the damage all funky like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought rain spells didn't matter how many target you had, hits like 3x 1 mob or 3 mobs 1x or any combo<br />
<br />
Only Shaman poison rain spells have this limitation. It will hit in 3 waves up to 4x. So it will hit one mob in 3 waves and be done, or 2 mobs in 2 waves and be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">doing ldons this weekend with necros as only form of slow or cc and doing pulls of 8 at a time in nro, rujark, and mm. its scary hehe<br />
<br />
me another war in my guild, cleric, dps /tm/dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have done the melee heavy group ( war/pal/me/mage/sham/clr), and we ripped through a slaughter 59 in 30 minutes.  Each of us melee were tanking 2 at a time, and the mage was AEing his little heart out.<br />
<br />
One thing we (my guild) really like to do is run all knight LDoN's.  Usually its me, and 5 pally's or 1 other SK.  We have only done this on normal settings as none of us have more then 2-3 ele peices and even less have any ele armor, but we have done it in every theme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that low end wizard rains do that also, so I assumed that all rains had that characteristic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">high end wizard spells have this limitation also, and it ALWAYS hits the caster if they are under it lol, bring your umbrellas!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarran Loreweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As a ranger I love melee heavy groups. The amount of DPS I am able to bring to a group increases indirectly with each melee because of attack buffs. My favorite setup is a shaman, a beastlord, myself, and a couple rogues or monks. No need for CC because anyone in the group can offtank. Shammy can heal and haste and slow crap, beastlords give us a little mana regen, and all the classes are capable of good DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've done melee heavy groups but it's not my preference.  I'd rather have a healer, CC, me, and 3 solid dps (rogue, wiz, mage, ranger in that order is my pref.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Masaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I still like 1 cleric 5 warriors all EP geared or better.  Love the 15 - 25 min wins and the 20-30 min afk breaks to go have a smoke while we wait on lock out time.</div></div><hr />
