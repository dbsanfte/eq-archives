<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possible I guess.  Long fight.  Guy in my guild did him a couple mornings ago with 11 so it's doable.  Good Tank, Cleric(maybe 2), Shammy, Chanter, and some DPS.  Not sure, been fek forever since I've done cursed.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot the Exiled DT's... so would need 2 tanks and CR one in between DT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exiled would be harder. If you can figure out DT distributation and still keep up, you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One grouped Exiled during PoP.<br />
<br />
Was 2 clerics, war, monk, rogue, mage, with a druid out of group, and 4 people playing the chars, so easily doable.<br />
<br />
Problem with one grouping cursed is he has really high reven and really high AC.<br />
<br />
Try with a bunch of necros and you'll do ok now I imagine though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do the Cursed script as long as you have two clerics, pretty much.  You need one to heal the tank and the other to rez/buff the party as they die.  Cursed is a hard fight all by himself, but the majority of the difficulty imho of this encounter is just getting to him with such few numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">any melee potime+ can tank exiled, just recycle tanks fast on him.  getting slow on cursed is the only really important thing, if you've got a slower, a tank, and a cleric, you could easily trio cursed himself, it would just take a year.<br />
<br />
i'd say tank, cleric x2, slower, dps x2.. make one of the dps a melee that's well geared, you win.  i did 1 group him at the end of PoP, it wasn't easy per se (cleric kept getting aggro after DT), but it wasn't hard either, just took a really really long time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, if you have a bard (which you should for cursed..) da song owns. under 6 people of course!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reghar1</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exiled is stunable, so have a paladin or 2 chain stun him and he will not get off his 20K DD.  It is not a DT and can be interupted.<br />
<br />
If you are going to  1 group the cycle I would reccomend 2 paladins to tank and wave heal.  Bard for Cursed to resist disease based AE charm. Rogue for dps, cleric and shaman.<br />
<br />
Cleric heals  MT, paladins keep the group healed, Bard keeps group from being charmed.  shaman keeps the mob slowed.<br />
<br />
I 2 grouped this cycle back in PoP at lvl 65 as welll and it wasn't hard.  Therefore I firmly believe a good group of lvl 70s could do this encounter.<br />
<br />
Glyphed is easy CR/MR resists for smal hp dot and AE FD.  Dain fight on steroids and fully debuffable.  Small Rampage.<br />
<br />
Exiled you DA pull and he is unslowable, but cripple is good.  His 20K DD is interupptable and goes off every 60 seconds.  if you time it right a bard DA song can bounce it, but just easier to chain stun him.  Basicly a Vindi fight otherwise.  FR/MR resists for the small HP Dot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cursed is the easiest of the 3, just alot of HP and flurries, but slowed a lvl 60 cleric with FT 15 could keep one MT alive.  Keep anyone without bard song away from him and you could prolly trio Cursed, just will take awhile.  DR/MR resists for AE charm and small HP dot.  Wave heals are awesome if one grouping this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glyphed doesn't rampage, all 3 named flurry though. Exiled DT is every 120 sec just like Shei in Akheva Ruins. Only one that has a DoT (that has ever landed on me) is Cursed. I've done this cycle without a bard and it's pretty easy to resist everything with just PoS, ToT, and GoD and my gear isn't even that great. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DA refreshes every 3 minutes though. Not once a minute. So, not like your going to be blocking all to many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Donno but the posters here are making it sound a lot easier than it actually is.<br />
<br />
1)  You need a real cleric if you're not qvic+.  At ft20 + manaclicker + c6 + mansong I'm able to roughly stay even on mana outside of evasive, i gain mana under disc.  This is with a potime tank.  A level 60 cleric alone can't heal it without mindwrack. <br />
<br />
2)  The dot actually does dmg.  It doesn't if you're doing it with 12, but if you're doing it with 6 and only a cleric healing, it matters, a lot.  Its not *that* resistable with 525pr, I haven't tried it after getting the aa.  The charm isnt an issue at all, if it is, you probably don't have the gear to 6man it.<br />
<br />
My impression after thinking about it a few times (I was planning on doing this... except i quit instead) is that caster dps may acutally be better, then you don't have to deal with heals (ae is only range 80 or something), and don't have to deal with the godly ac he has.    Would go slower than with melees but then you'd only need 1 healer.</div></div><hr />

Get as much DS as you can too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reghar1</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do any of you read the entire posts or just latch on to one thing without understanding what was written.  <br />
<br />
Besrikarle, Exiled is Stunnable, a lvl 63 mob at the highest.  He has a 20K DD, not a DT.  DA wont block DTs but will block a DD.  Even though it is not needed.  Time it and you can intterupt Exiled's DD with stuns.  The bard DA song is a safe fall incase something happens.<br />
<br />
Exiled is the only psuedo difficult part of of the cycle.  Paladins, 2 to be precise for a 1 group kill, can chain stun him.  <br />
<br />
Boy-, Healing for cursed is a joke.  The group make up I suggested had ample healing to be self sufficient.  You also want a rogue to pull the mobs behind the locked doors.<br />
<br />
Cursed maxes for roughly 950, a lvl 70 paladin that would consider single grouping cursed will have EP gear at least, which means the paladin is a 10K tank buffed; at least.  The rest of the group is similiarly equiped.  A level 60 cleric, back in Luclin Had a mana pool of  5Kish.  the heal rotation, back in luclin with 2 clerics on MT was a pause 35 before slowed and a pause 90 when slowed, with one cleric after slow.  would have to recheck numbers, but  a lvl 60 cleric with max AA, which  they would have if they were considering single grouping Cursed, could easily keep the MT alive with the Paladins wave healing for the group's health and added heals when needed from the shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
The original question was  if it was possible to 1 group the Cursed cycle.<br />
<br />
The answer is yes, one well played group could single group cursed.  With over 30 Cursed kills, I  thought about what works best  against Cursed.   the new paladin Wave heal with the appropriate AA heals everyone for over 1K, which is more then sufficient to counter the damage from the dot from his AE.  Lvl 70 with EP GEAR you will have max Saves with a bard song and ToT.  You will resist the charm 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
the cleric, who is behind a wall and not getting hit with the AE, only has to complete heal the MT.  which means he can go indefinetly  against a mob, which is fully slowable and only hits for max of 950.   remember the max was before  PoP AA.<br />
<br />
In a long fight a rogue, which you need to pull the Taskmasters, is better dps then a wizard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok here we go.<br />
<br />
Boy-, Healing for cursed is a joke.  The group make up I suggested had ample healing to be self sufficient.  You also want a rogue to pull the mobs behind the locked doors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well for one, you don't need a rogue.  Use lev and some imagination.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cursed maxes for roughly 950, a lvl 70 paladin that would consider single grouping cursed will have EP gear at least, which means the paladin is a 10K tank buffed; at least. <br />
<br />
<br />
How does hp matter at all?  As long as you have more than 9275 hp, the amount of hp you have matters zilch for this fight.  All that matters is you that you have enough ac that you don't have to ch that often.<br />
<br />
 The rest of the group is similiarly equiped.  A level 60 cleric, back in Luclin Had a mana pool of  5Kish.  the heal rotation, back in luclin with 2 clerics on MT was a pause 35 before slowed and a pause 90 when slowed, with one cleric after slow.  would have to recheck numbers, but  a lvl 60 cleric with max AA,<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, with luclin modrods, one cleric could heal it.   Again, why does manapool matter?  All that matters in a fight this long (20min+) is ft, you need to outregen its ch.  Last i checked ft 15 still isnt *that* trivial and i regard someone with that and max aa a 'real' cleric.  My point is and was you're not going to be able to get your friends alt lvl 60 cleric and win it like you sounded like.<br />
<br />
In a long fight a rogue, which you need to pull the Taskmasters, is better dps then a wizard.<br />
<br />
I'm not necessarily going to disagree with you there, but if you don't have 2 paladins, i think healing may be an issue, thus the caster suggestion.<br />
<br />
Is cursed one groupable? yes.  Is it a total walk in the park? No.  I'll be the first person to agree with everyone that its very doable, but you can't just walk in with 6 random people and win it like everyone seems to indicate.  He may not hit hard but in a fight of that length manaregen is everything, and not everyone has the ft20 to pull it off.  He is super easy with 12 so everyone thinks he's a joke (well he is) but it gets exponentially harder when you have to drop it down to 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reghar1</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize for coming off rude.<br />
<br />
Lvl, AA and Gear more then compensates for  Cursed cycle's difficulties.<br />
<br />
I agree a pick up group will not be able to complete the cycle, most likely.  Yet a group of people that know each other or know the encounter well will be able to.  <br />
<br />
In the original question he also asked what would I need to 1 group him.   Some of us stated ideas on how to accomplish this and honestly it is exteremly viable and not difficult. <br />
<br />
A cleric with FT 15, which was easy to accomplish in Luclin for a raiding guild, not to mention in today's OoW era, regened the mana needed to complete the fight.  10K hp, gives the cleric 2K extra HP, not including crits or focus effects.  HP to play with in judging how to heal Cursed.  Odds are the cleric in the group will be lvl 67+ with FT 15 over 5K mana pool, focus effects and AA to help crit heals.  Which at a pause 90, which was originally developed for a 7K tank against a slowed Cursed, will make the healing easy.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I never thought of using lev and terrain to pull the 2 mobs from behind locked doors.  I might try that while drunk  next weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an interesting topic <br />
<br />
I would say if you never did Cursed  a lot of times with a raid and therefore dont know exactly what to expect youd have trouble.<br />
Yes, you can pull Rhoth without rogue but it can be a real pia to get aggro, we never tried the lev thing tho.<br />
One thing to tell people who havent done this much is about the glyph FD.and gflux. If he gflux the tank across the zone and goes to your single cleric you can wipe your group right there.<br />
I had no idea it was a dd, not a DT. I'll try this next time. If your pally hasnt done it before, they can easily miss interrupting the DT , ,and again youll wipe.<br />
Its a good project, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gflux is negated by cornering glyphed. It's more of a knockback since it don't actually toss you up in the air more than a foot or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm planning to try this in the next couple weeks if I can ever find some time and him up at the same time. I'm thinking to try and do it with war/enc/clr/shm/brd/pal or something.  Maybe a couple more dps too, I'm not married to the 1 group thing, especially for the first try.<br />
<br />
Alla's says exiled is level 63. That means a level 70 warrior kick or bash should be able to stun him, as well as several pally, cleric, and enc stuns, right?  Lucy says the recast time is 2 minutes, and that it's instant cast. Does that mean he must be stun locked for the entire fight in order to prevent the 20k DD, or does he begin casting and take long enough we can watch for it with spell awareness and just stun the hell out of him every time we see it?<br />

It'd be fun to 1-group a bloodfrenzy while I can still use it legitimately :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
He meant finding the trigger up im sure.  With any triggered spawn, when someone references &quot;up&quot; they mean it can be triggered.  Like the Bert cycle.. youll rarely find Bert on track, but the Spectre of Corruption means Bert is up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Exiled, the DD is resistable.  Even during Luclin days it was so I imagine with the upgrades most have now that you stand a lot better chance of resisting it.</div></div><hr />

It's been quite a while, but I think I remember resisting this at times.  I could be wrong though... it's been several years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a level 70 SK, and I usually do the first leg of the  tanking because I can pull and position with HS without getting insta killed.  Normally, I live till he hits about 60% and the DD gets me.  However, I resisted the 20k DD 4 times during our last cursed run.  First time I actually tanked it down to 0% without dying.</div></div><hr />
