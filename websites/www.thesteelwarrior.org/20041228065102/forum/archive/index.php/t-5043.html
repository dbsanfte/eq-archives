He started out as an alt, but is slowly being played more since my main hit 65. I am not fully savy to the ways of warriors yet. I have a question about damage that I hope you could all shed some light on. I have noticed that a lot of warriors seem to do much more damage than I do. What determines how much damage you do? I know that the dmg listed on the weapon determines this, but what are the other factors? I understand that strength plays a part as well. I usedual wield 1hs mostly, main weapons being a Jagged blade of Mourning in the primary, and a War-scarred shortaxe in the off hand:<br />

Once those bases are covered, raising ATK with Vengeance items and regular stats is about the only thing to do. Getting levels also helps raise offense skill cap, which also means a lot to damage, since it raises your ATK. You will see increases again at level 51.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's about it.<br />
Well, and there's AA's too, but getting levels &gt; AA's<br />
<br />
<br />
In your case I would ignore Vengeance items and such, since they are much too expensive for you. Getting a nice Haste item would be a good thing, better weapons is also good ... and levels offcourse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">theres tons of things<br />
<br />
first off haste. what do you have? what do they?<br />
second skills. are they were they should? i'm guessing yes but make sure.<br />
third. delay/dmg. those aren't that good for the twinks now a days and anyone under 55 is usually twinks/alts. get a two handed weapon if not a couple.<br />
fourth. buffs. do you have buffs like haste/str<br />
<br />
i'm guessing it's 1 or the third. Those weapons are sufficiently lower standard then most of the twinks out there. and at 48 lower delayed weapons like Lamentations would out do them. but two handed is the way to go for2h</div></div><hr />

but its best to keep as many weapon skills maxed.<br />
<br />
looking at your magelo you have not haste item which would increase your DPS. get lower delay weapon for your main hand a lammy is good for that. off hand look for a high damage weapon dont worry too much about the delay.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilipputt</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback, I went out and got a par of schw and purchased a defenders lightblade and got a Lammy from a friend. I updated my magelo before posting this reply(hence the question for what haste do I have).<br />
<br />
I have been keeping all my skills up, except for 2hb, and I will begin to work on that soom. Again, thanks, all,  for your feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side not, definitely start working on 2hb as soon as possible. Otherwise I can almost guarantee that at some point you will go, &quot;Damn. I should have kept 2hb up.&quot; That's just how it goes.<br />
<br />
Now if you're comparing your damage to other warriors of the same level, the main difference is going to be weapon damage. If they're doing more damage, they more probably just have better weapons. Melee skills and Strength play a very small part. Another factor is damage bonus. Take a look at this chart at lucy. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html) For one handed weapons, the damage bonus is goes up with your level. On 2 handers, the player's level and the weapon's delay both affect the damage bonus on a weapon.<br />

As Anker said, &quot;Level level level&quot;</div></div><hr />
