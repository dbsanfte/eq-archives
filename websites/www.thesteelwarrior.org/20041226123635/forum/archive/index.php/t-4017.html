<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the balance issue between Knights and Warriors out there on all the boards I am starting to think Sony will eventually HAVE to do something about this......however given thier long standing answer about balanceing melee's vs casters  and their statements:<br />
<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
<br />
THis makes me VERY nervous as to what they are planning on doing and if they see our plight at all.<br />
<br />
IF this is all they do, then there is NOTHING to balance Knights vs warriors since Knights will benefit from this just as much as we do.  Given the ammount of Hoopla the Knight vs warrior balance issue is getting on ALL of teh boards.....is there any info about what they are planning to od to help us?  ARE They planning on addressing our issues?<br />
<br />
If ANY EQ Dev's or insiders (absor?)  are reading this....if you guys have anything planned to help warriors in thier particualr balance issues...could you please throw us a bone?  PLEASE .... Post SOMETHING to let us know we don't keep playing our warriors with false hopes that things will get better.  Your lack of response, your apparent refusal to look at our plight is getting so frustraing that many have stopped playing thier warriors in leau of playing other classes.  That works for them, but many of us can't .... we HAVE to keep working on our warriors because our GUilds depend on us to have the lvl's/aa to tank the mobs that need tanking.....so we CAN'T play other chars.<br />
<br />
All we are asking for SOE is a Straight up answer.<br />
<br />
Are you planning on helping us?   If so, what ideas do you have to help us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the only response we will get will be more passive-aggresive equipment based fixes.  <br />
<br />
E.g over the last 3-4 months:<br />
<br />
- Greatly increased the drop rate of GSot making it worth next to nothing<br />
- Added Droga cookie cutter agro weapons<br />
- Added LDoN Anger/Stun mods<br />
<br />
That is your response...nothing formal, no intrinsic class capabilities just more equipment based fixes leading to warrior &quot;generica&quot; (aka back to the future soon everyone will have an Exec Axe/SSoY).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, kinda reminds me of the days when all warriors looked the same because we were ALL wearing crafted, skull shaped barbute, and wielding 2 ssoy's, or an exe axe, or a mith 2h depending on the situation.  Only now it's GSoT and Droga weapons. (and we can at least dye our armor now so we all don't look alike)  :)  They really need to stop with the crutches and fix the damned class.  But it's easy to make a new weapon or a new proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ..... IF SOE is gonna make us Slave to the Random Number Generator and call THAT a fix(I call it a fucking bandaid) then they ned to do something to help with warrior proc rates.....as it stands now.... if were lucky we have solid aggro.......if not, then be prepared to wear out the taunt button reaquiring aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Effect: Taunt (combat)<br />
<br />
if i saw that on a weepon i think i would freek out and fall over dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't fall over dead.....but I may puke.   <br />
<br />
That weapon would get Nic-Named &quot;The masher&quot; as that is what it would simulate. That is,  a warrior that don't know how taunt works ....and is mashing the taunt button the whole fight.</div></div><hr />
