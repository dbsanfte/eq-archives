I have over 1400+ acumulated points in all the themes but the merchants will only let me see to 1150 points in all the themes. Im being told that i should be able to see much ferther than that. has anyone ever heard of this hapening? If so how do i fix this? I'm thinking i may have a file somewhere bugged or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you mean you've accumulated over 1400+ points in each of the 5 different adventure themes, then yes you definitely should see every item that the adventure merchants have to offer.  If, however, you've only accumulated a total of 1400+ points in all 5 different adventure themes combined, then it's a different story.  The adventure point merchants at each theme camp will only show you the items up to a cost of 1.5 X your AP for that theme.  In other words, if you have 1400 points total, and 800 of those are at the North Ro/Tak camp, the merchants at that Tak camp will show you items costing up to 1200 AP (800 AP X 1.5), even though you will only be able to actually buy items at that camp costing 800 points or less.  Until you get more Tak points and unlock more items, that is :p<br />
<br />
If however, you already know all that, and have over 1400+ points accumulated in each camp, but can only see items costing up to 1150 or so; then yup, you have a bug of some kind that I haven't seen or heard of yet.  Maybe try petitioning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have 1400 points in every theme, you should be able to see them regardless of how many available ap you have. So that is wrong.</div></div><hr />

My SK on the same account does not have this problem</div></div><hr />

Seems SoE tech support is at a all time low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;wrong&quot; as in &quot;it is not right that we should have such a bug thrust upon us&quot; i will agree. but it does indeed happen. its a benign bug since the problem goes away when you get enough points accrued to actually buy the item you want.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
you earn 510 points in butcher and buy a 10ac aug.<br />
you earn another 510 and buy another 10ac aug.<br />
you earn yet another 510 and go to the merchant and are distressed that you cannot see items higher than 600something :(<br />
<br />
do not fear. you cant afford it anyway. you only have 510 points. now go and earn another 1000 points ANYWHERE and come back to butcher to see all the items up to 1492 available for purchase. hence it is a display problem not an actual purchase limiting problem.</div></div><hr />
