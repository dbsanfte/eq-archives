<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am entertaining the idea of running a pickup raid on Inny soon. I am coming here to ask for any advice and assistance that you guys might be able to offer.<br />
<br />
I understand that Inny quads for ~900, AE rampages, and spawns adds during the fight. Here's my questions:<br />
<br />
Is his melee range larger than his rampage range? ie...RZtW<br />
<br />
What is the maximum number of adds that will spawn in this event? I understand killing all of the spite golems and mezzing everything else that pops until there are no more pops in the way to go...just wondering how many enchies I should bring along for this.<br />
<br />
Can you split him from the adds or do you have to offtank him until you get all the adds under control?<br />
<br />
The Evangelist...How should we deal with him? Offtank him until Inny is dead? Or switch our attention and kick his ass while offtanking Inny?<br />
<br />
Anything you might be able to help on would be great. <br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Evangelist wasn't a mob, as I recall, I think you can melee out of rampage range, and I'm pretty sure you have to tank him while adds spawn. The adds didn't stop spawning as far as I know. He also procs a knockback/dispell, so make sure to have a clicky up top and try to corner him somehow. Shrink was still all weird at the time, so I couldn't corner him and we had to do some bizarre version of wall tanking. We mezzed the casting mobs and mindwracked them while just killing off the golems, loaded up Inny with tons of dots and just whittled him down. It was a long fight. Good luck with it :)</div></div><hr />
