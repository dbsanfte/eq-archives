<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a strange experience in a Tak LDoN last night.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a wizard, and every time she cast a big nuke (Strike of Solusek, I'd guess) she got aggro.<br />
<br />
My weapons set-up: Great Blade of Storms, with Anger 2 on it, and a Cord Hilted Spike Driver.  I was inciting at the beginning of the fight on almost every mob, she wasn't casting until the mob was under 50% health, and each big nuke the mob would turn straight for her.  <br />
<br />
We had a lot of banter about it in group, the general consensus was that there may have been a zone bug.  It was strange, though, she says that she groups with warriors all the time and she never gets aggro as badly as she got it last night.<br />
<br />
My other thought was that I bought Weapon Affinity 1 yesterday immediately before that dungeon, and maybe WA 1 is screwed up somehow and it actually reduces, rather than adds to, procs.  I haven't parsed it though.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Does she have the concussion spell ?   The trick to playing any dps is to know how much damage you can do without taking aggroe.  But I have found many times these big nukers will sit right after casing and just about any mob will aggroe on em when they do that.   Did she snare as well ?  Does she use any weapon s that proc ?  My wizard has a weapon that procs tishani and when i assist main tank even though i was not casting I had noticed a few times accidently getting into melee combat and my weapon proccing and getting aggroe.</div></div><hr />

I was playing my wizard (65) in a BB LDoN a while ago.  Damn near every Time I sat to med the mob would pay me a visit. Prior to this adventure, I had rarely got sit aggro. I would normally nuke (Agnarr's) at like 60-70% mob health, wait a few secs then sit. I would then nuke again at like 40-50% mob health and once again to finish it off (depending on DPS). <br />
<br />
This worked well for me. With that adventure I got constant sit aggro on, I was  using the same procedure I explained above. I firmly believe it was a bug. We did another after that and I tested the sit aggro and not a bit of problem, Same group.  That bugged adventure was the most annoying one to date.</div></div><hr />

Your wizard just sucked, not your fault.</div></div><hr />
