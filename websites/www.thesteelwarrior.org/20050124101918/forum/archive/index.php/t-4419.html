<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510<br />
<br />
<br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com <br />
<br />
<br />
Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting <br />
Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes <br />
Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat <br />
Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill! <br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a combat example:<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window). <br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round. <br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills <br />
<br />
<br />
Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool <br />
Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills <br />
Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose <br />
Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters <br />
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. <br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat. <br />
<br />
Talk to you in the Live Chat! <br />

<br />
<br />
But I just hope we don't have to sit there staring for an opening, and it gives us 1 second or something to hit the button. It would be neat if you had ~7 seconds to be able to hit the button or something, but will be absolutely horrible if its needed instantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I'll have to make room for THREE more abilities on my main hotkey page, because its not already crowded enough...<br />
<br />
It also means that we MIGHT get aggro approaching a knight IF there's an opening near the beginning of the fight, IF we hit the button in time, IF we don't miss.<br />
<br />
It'll be different, it might even be fun.  But its not gonna fix our main problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we are given the ability to stun ANY mob at random oppurtunities throughout an encounter, but only from the rfont(ie...tanking the mob)...this could very well be the difference we seek in the mitigation levels, as well as be able to &quot;imbue&quot; our strikes with more aggro.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see how this plays out I think. I just really hope its not too little too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">guys while we are at the chat, please be sure to ask for more hot buttons. maybe this has its own window? like the pet window? im thinking it does<br />

10 to 1 odds it's spell gems that's used.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This looks pretty interesting to me. I am wondering what stat endurance is tied into, logically I have to think, str and sta. I am also wondering what items will have the endurance modifiers on them and what the modifier will be. They stated that the hybrids will have a limited endurance pool, so will that mean that endurance mods will only be on items pure melee can use? and will that mean that pure melee will have a large limit on thier endurance pool, similar to a 5k mana pool casters get? If they just slap endurance mods on a lot of all/all or multi-melee items, we run into the same problem that we have now, where hybrids get double bonus from items with high hp and mana. I wont be happy if the endurance mods come in the form of ldon pts that I have to buy. I wouldnt mind an aa skill that lets me regain endurnace faster.<br />
<br />
The tomes have me slightly worried, I see myself farming lowbie zones for them, like casters do for dropped spells. They should be no drop, so people can't farm them and sell them at ridiculous prices to melee and I hope they arent super rare like some spells.<br />
<br />
I do like the new skills, adds more depth to the melee class and as long as they don't have a high resist or failure rate the skills will be worthwhile. I'm not sure what to think about discs being moved to the new system, I mean will def cost us 1500 endurance and we wont have an endurance pool to do any other disc? But on the other hand I really like that some disc are being given seperate timers. I'd love to be able to use offensive disc without having to worry about blowing def. and I do hope they give us a seperate hotkey box though, my main page is full enough.<br />
<br />
For the first time in a long time, these changes have me excited about playing a warrior. I just hope they are as good as they sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see anything that indicates an ability to aggro on incoming or from a distance. It appears that the other two high survivability tanks will continue to have an advantage in this ability.<br />
<br />
The vulnerability opening is another random event. I don't see the ability to produce aggro on demand. We're still the RNG tank - Knights are not.<br />
<br />
I see nothing about giving Warriors a significant survivability advantage.<br />
<br />
/em Waves bye bye to MTing. Hello Fellow Hybrids Without Spellbooks (and the ability to cast spells on demand).<br />
<br />
Will this make Warriors more useful when not the MT? Probably. Its a good thing too, since we're going to have more of an opprotunity to not MT.<br />
<br />
The selection of combat skills and their effect is going to be interesting. Thus far it looks like Stun, Pink (or Cheek Cut), and Cripple. To give them exciting names they'd be Stunning Blow, Enraging Blow, and Crippling Blow. Mobs should emote when the effect is wearing off. Other possibilies include Blind, Deadly Blow, and Wedgie.<br />

wont fix the fact the enchanter has been dead since incoming.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if the rogue<br />
skill shroud will use the &quot;endurance mana pool&quot; that would<br />
be fun during a CR.<br />
<br />
Basically I see:  &quot;Congratulations your disciplines now require mana to use, and you can kick and extra time per fight, have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hopefully the aggro issue will be discussed during chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it says you can do one to get hate, and stun agro is decent, this is a wait and see it seems, but i will tell ya what, its gona very fricken fun at first :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If these thingies alone make me a real boon to a group even without knight-agro then I'm happy with it. But like Arative said, I'm worried about having to find things to get certain skills. Maybe not so much for myself being in a raiding guild but if some only drop from raid mobs then a lot of warriors might still get the shaft.<br />
Biggest advantage I see is it being easy to add and adjust things with this system, much like spells can be adjusted and added, finally we might get something out of expansions besides more hps/ac and new gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks pretty good imo, we will still have to wait for the real word on the 24th cause you really dont know what the rest of the abilities do.<br />
Im only worried about the hotkey thing. You cant add more hotkeys since there are only 10 numeric keys, if they add 'gems', ALT+# could be a solution.<br />
Anyway, this really looks interesting and might bring a lot of fun to play a pure meele :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thank god i still can remember how they worked in DAoC ( spec attacks ) ... like parries and riposte openings with some kick ass results.<br />
<br />
If I no longer am MT? So what   /ducks...... I lose experience on raids.....gimme group usability and i'm a happy clam. Let the Pal/SK's go MT until their heads fall off and it won't phase me in the least. It's about time us warriors ( as much as this will pain me to say ) break the CHrotation/MT/assist ME philosophies that have been drven in our heads for 5 years.<br />
Hybrids without spellbooks? you could call us that. I'd prefer it &quot;A REAL fighting machine&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velthak</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe its just my current pessamistic nature or mood i'm in, but i have a bad feeling this is going to be us staring at the screen for a box to pop up with a stupidly low timer in which we can do one of these attacks which will be completely random.  and it makes it sound as like we get these options while we are facing the front of the mob.  which means to me, they are useless when we aren't tanking, and yet the random nature of it really won't give us the extra agro that we should be able to produce.<br />
<br />
and then they will probably make the manuals tradeable and rare so not only do we have competition from each other to get it, but we have random_pc_01 camping them so they can make a killing on people buying them from him.  <br />
<br />
also, it seems to me that its giving us spells based on random...  i will wait to hear more of what they say, but as of now, i'm not super optimistic about it.</div></div><hr />

Seems very interesting and has potential.  Basically, we get the equivalent of mana.  If it is the way that I'm picturing it, our &quot;specials&quot; or whatever will be in the gem slot.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AGRYMCBASH</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the idea of special attacks interests me, and i would imagine the &quot;openings&quot; will occur with about as much frequency as a crit, meaning that dex will figure highly. with the tie to the aa ability that increases this occurence now being another 12 points i'll need to get before 56. however unless these &quot;special attacks&quot; by default gain the same amount of aggro that say a pally stun or sk snare grab, we are still gonna be relagated to the &quot;iffy&quot; protectors of the casters, and not really gain anything except maybe getting the twenty percent better DPS they think we get. does anyone buy that? that we get 20% better DPS standing there getting blocked, riposted and dodged for most of a fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK let me ask one simple question what in our past history with SOE would lead you believe that this is for the BEST, WHAT?<br />
<br />
  I saw nothing to lead me to think this will help with our problem of RANDOM aggro.   This is nothing more then give the tanks some new toys same as freaking shield.   Sorta makes me think of monkey testing , you know monkey see, monkey do.  Dumb tank see new icon on screen, DUMB tank get 2 sec to push buttom WOW am I one freaking happy tank or what.<br />
<br />
   Think of it this way we will have a RANDOM chance to get this ICON and then IF (BIG BIG IF) were smart enough to select one of 3 keys  we get another RANDOM chance for it to work and maybe stun the mob when all a knight has to do is push one button with NO RANDOM chance to get the SAME thing, my GOD are WE lucky or what?  Lets all get down and KISS the ground that SOE devs walk on!<br />
<br />
  Oh and we all know what lvl of mob and what zones to get this new thing(what ever its called) when casters get most of their spells from a vender.  BL's get ALL but 2 spells till 61 from venders, hmm, yep I cant wait!<br />
<br />
  Go read the knight boards, their already bitching about not getting this super new secret weapon.<br />
<br />
   Dont get me wrong I love my Warrior but I want the problems fixed not new tricks, I want to be a ONE trick pony not a jack of all and master of NONE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main concern is the number of hotkeys/gems we're gonna have to add... I have 2 banks of raid hot keys, having to add more will be a right pain...<br />
If it's gems thats gonna be even worse given my key layout...i use wasd and space for jump...if i need to move a little to position the mob(which is normal for balancing), press my taunt (cos they dont seem to have fixed that) etc and still try to find my alt key and press a number...its gonna be hell :(<br />
If i use my mouse to hit the gems, then given the lag that occurs on raids, i can see myself accidentally retargetting as i lag, and possibly breaking mezzes, or finding a new mob that others assist me on, and seeing the gater mob i was on vanish...it does happen.<br />
<br />
Also how long will we have to use the &quot;skill&quot;? With the amount of raid spam, and paying attention to what the mob is doing, i think i may miss a few of these &quot;skill&quot; windows <br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldve been happy if they had just fixed taunt and made it work...and increased our HP advantage over pallys/sks back to how it was..<br />
<br />
ah well lets see how it goes, but i can see it beinga bit of an arse.<br />
<br />
And yeah in the open chat, tell them to give us more hotkey spaces or something, or like a pet window...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 initial thoughts:<br />
<br />
1.  I bet we get a set of &quot;spell gems&quot; so we don't have to use existing slots.<br />
<br />
2.  I'm fine with no taunt change as long as the other stuff is balanced and fun to play.  Basically this means knights have agro lock and useful spells for the group, but can't take damage quite as well as warriors.  Warriors can get agro, just not lock it or get it at range (unless there is a new ability??), take damage slightly better, and ADD UTILITY to the group via our abilities.  Sounds balanced and good to me.  (and btw, I personally don't like the concept of agro lock...so I'm perfectly happy not having this crutch as long as I can offer other things to the group)<br />
<br />
3.  These are massive changes and there will be problems - bet on it.  This is not a bad thing.  Life is always (hopefully) 2 steps forward, 1 step back.  I'll never attack someone for trying to make things better, even if they ultimately fail.  I see Sony trying to make meleee balance better and that's a very good thing.  Have some patience and be productive in your responses.</div></div><hr />

One thing for sure, the warrior should have access to more &quot;specials&quot; than any other class<br />
<br />
I suspect that the monks will get a majority of the special attacks.  Warriors will get primarily defensive or aggro generation specials and rogues will get offensive style kung fu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it all comes down to the following:<br />
<br />
Given their track record, how much do you trust SOE not to screw it up?<br />
<br />
I mean, they've always had a massive myopia on crucial, seemingly obvious details- primarily with limiting cases, stacking, and scaling.<br />
<br />
For instance- *if* they give warriors a really good individual combat ability, how are they going to handle &quot;stacking&quot;- i.e. if it's good for ONE warrior, how's that going to impact encounters when you have a dozen of them?  Kinda like how manaburn was imbalanced initially, then eventually massively nerfed.  Anything good enough to be useful will have to be VERY situational, or it'll be &quot;abused&quot;.<br />
<br />
Other thoughts:<br />
-Would be damn nice if they turned &quot;+mana&quot; items worn by *pure melee only* into the new endurance stat, to preclude a massive re-equipping to &quot;re-optimize&quot; for the new melee system.<br />
-The &quot;best&quot; endurance items had better damn well not be hybrid useable!  PRAY for sanity with itemization, plan for stupidity tho...<br />
-sounds like they may be planning on using character flags to enable abilities, as opposed to &quot;spell book&quot; type scribing perhaps?<br />
<br />
Should be interesting, very curious what timeline they are thinking tho... i.e. weeks or months?<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As written, the only 'warrior issue' this will address is the 'what am I supposed to do when I'm not tanking apart from hit attack' question. This stuff is random, random aggro is what beats us out of the tank slot because Knights provide garanteed, on demand, aggro and utility. This fix doesn't come close to the same benefit precisely because wether you can or cannot help the group is beyond your personal control. Being able to stun or add hate is only really useful when you can do it at the time that it's most required.

The game is the way it has been for 5 years...I don't want more shit to do on my warrior, I just wanna stand there and hit autoattack like I always have so that I can play my fuckin shaman and actually contribute.  The only thing that's even halfway reasonable in that whole schpiel is them unhooking discs, and even then, they're gonna tie them to some gay fuckin bar that's not even in half of our UI's anymore.<br />
<br />
I don't need to do special attacks for more DPS, I don't need to stun things for &quot;A whole combat round!&quot; (OMG! So l33t, yes!), what I need is to fuckin lock shit down ON ME.  That's what I've always needed, that's the only goddamned thing I want.  <br />
<br />
Let me tell you how this is gonna go.  In order to learn these skils, you're gonna need those manuals.  In order to get those manuals, you're gonna need a large guild (Cough ANCIENT SPELLS cough) and even then, you're gonna be spreading 1 out per week per your entire guild.  This is the way it's always gone, this is absolutely no boon for anyone unless it's fuckin innate from level 1 and I make a hotkey on my new level 1 warrior for it.  If it's done any differently, it's going to be fucking useless just like every other change they try to make for us.  Yes, I do use shield, but i wouldn't NEED THE FUCKING SHIELD IF MY TOON WORKED PROPERLY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got to thinking about those manuels needed to gain the special skills and I realized that most likely the manuels would be dropped just like spells, got your common ones and your rare ones, but these manuels also give a lot of flexabilty to the entire level spectrum of the melee class. For instance, and this is a guess not knowing anything about way skills are distrubited, at level 12, a melee could get thier first skill, like super kick or whatever and it scales right on up to level 65. This would make the changes for all level of melee, not just those people in uber guilds. Although I would bet anyone that there will be special rare skills that do only drop uber mobs, this is SoE we are talking about after all.<br />
<br />
One other thing that caught my attention, was the line that said this new system will make it easier to add skills in the future. And since one of the major bitches on this board is that hybrids/casters get new spells ever expansion, I realized that this new system is providing a way for melee to get abilites every expansion, just like the hybrids. So this is addressing some concerns that melee do have.<br />
<br />
As far as the system as a whole, I'm in a wait and see mode, can't really make any judgements until I see what its like. It does seem on the surface at least, that it will give melee something more to do in the groups and raids, not the normal, hit autoattack, watch tv til mob dead. Although as soon as its on test, I'll be logging in my test war more and more tp try it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its not bang out balancing right here and now, its a system that will allow them to easily add new combat skillz in the furture as needs develope. I mean SOE has no incentive not to have all the classes balanced as well as they can, here is a system that will allow them to add or subtract from mellee quickly and easyily. I mean sure warriors say we are underpowered, but then there is not a single class forum board you go to where people are not requesting more power for their class.....</div></div><hr />

3.  These are massive changes and there will be problems - bet on it.  This is not a bad thing.  Life is always (hopefully) 2 steps forward, 1 step back.  I'll never attack someone for trying to make things better, even if they ultimately fail.  I see Sony trying to make meleee balance better and that's a very good thing.  Have some patience and be productive in your responses.  <br />
<br />
Maybe you're not familiar with our forums.  Here on the Steelwhiner we have no time for a patient, levelheaded attitude such as yours.  Although not a single one of these abilities has been announced yet, we already know that they will suck and make things worse than ever.  Now please stop interrupting our uninformed histrionics and post something about how Absor is a moron or you will have to find a different message board to make your intelligent but dramaless posts.<br />

But the point that stands out from this thread that cracks me up ... and maybe this isn't true of a lot of warriors but on my server it's certainly true of a LOT of them.<br />
Warriors complaining that the new toys they'll be given (and yes I agree atm I don't think it addresses the problem of warrior agro) might possibly be droppable items from mobs and hence sellable.<br />
On my server (again it might not be true of all servers but given the high practice of it on my server lends credence to the possibility that it's an accepted practice from a melee standpoint)<br />
etherals, spectrals etc tend to be rolled on by warriors even if there was a caster in group that needed it cause it was concidered loot .. and now i see warriors bitching that these possibly droppable things their class *might* need to be a better functioning class (again not saying this &quot;balancing&quot; thing will even do shit) might end up in the hands of *gasp* casters they rolled against on spectrals because they were &quot;loot&quot;.</div></div><hr />

My biggest concern, as an unguilded and casual player that isn't 65, is obtaining these 'tomes.' Those of us that don't have the luxury of an active raid guild will not be able to get items that drop from difficult/rare bosses.<br />
<br />
I can't say how you plan to implement these changes, but if they are No Drop and drop from bosses then a rather large segment of the player base will never see them. I do not think it's fair that a player would be excluded from their balancing simply because they don't have 50 people to help them achieve it.</div></div><hr />

Specifically because those details fully ironed out do not deal with what most warriors believe is the main problem (lack of aggro control compared) and which SoE did not aknowledge 'til recently (sort of). <br />
<br />
As a way to perk up melee combat this works fine - I'm sure this'll be of interest to monks and rogues especially. <br />
<br />
I definately think though that more specific thought (as hinted at in the information as possible additions) needs to be given to controllable on demand powers for warriors especially - particularly when attempting to control a mob (at least if you're really happy letting knights do what they do) but also for providing benefit to the group as a whole when they need and will appreciate it. <br />

Positive 'on command' stuff so a warrior actively contributes rather than depending like a leech on his group.<br />

Actually something pretty similar to this was the infamous &quot;sekrit infoz&quot; that caused so much drama and alienation of valuable posters a few months ago.   According to the little birdie that sang it in my ear, this was brought up back in early July.  They were calling it &quot;taunt energy&quot; back then.  Of course it was just a proposed idea at that point, and not wanting to be attacked by a pack of angry dogs, they didn't announce anything about it until they actually decided that it was a good idea and could be implemented.</div></div><hr />

If you mean more than 10 that you can see at one time… tell me, what keys would you press to activate them?  The 11 through 20 keys?  :) <br />

I'd really like to see some more slots, not necessarily pages, just 10 more.  Be nice with having more and more AA abilities that require activating and now this.  Be nice for those things you do from time to time.<br />

And you could even rig it up so people could set keys to trigger them.  I know that melees could easily set them to alt+#, since, well, no spells.  Lots of other keys that aren't used either.<br />

Basically with this system it sounds like you can still hit auto attack and walk off....but if you want to set yourself as an exceptional warrior then you will have skills that you can execute at the opportune times. Pure speculation here...but there could be some very nice aggro bonuses tied to each new skill. Maybe you can rack up bonuses for executing consecutive skill shots or something like that.. It could even be tied to time....maybe the oportunity window opens and the faster you react the more aggro it produces...etc etc...(I doubt that though b/c lag would be a major problem with that) Anyway, just a few thoughts, I mean we have no idea how this new system will work so lets wait and check it out...also note this is only or Rog's monks and warriors &quot;The pure melees&quot; so i am rather excited that this will be somthing that isn't given to the knights also.<br />

As I understand it, the system they hope to implement will be basically &quot;autoattack plus tactical options&quot;. So far as I've been able to discern (and I'll freely admit that I may be off base here), combat will allow for simple auto-attack, but that may not be the most efficient way to combat a foe. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's a pretty reasonable description. <br />
<br />
The idea is that you can just hit autoattack (or, in the case of a healer, mem one spell and hit a hotkey) if you want--but you definitely won't earn the reputation of being a skilled, tactical player. We're giving you the tools to excel at your craft and really distinguish yourself regardless of your archetype. <br />
<br />
How much effort you wish to put into making yourself an exceptional player is entirely up to you. <br />

Yar, ditto to what someone implied above.  We don't need &quot;11 through 20&quot; to map &gt; 10 keys:<br />
<br />
ALT + 1, ALT + 2, ALT + 3 ...<br />
CTRL + 1, CTRL + 2 ...<br />
SHIFT + 1, SHIFT + 2 ...<br />
<br />
Easy, peasy.  And, for that matter, I've got a number pad on the right of my keyboard that is doubling up on my hotkeys, and could have a whole new bank of keys on it instead.  On top of which - I don't use the number keys for hotkeys, I use the bottom row of the keyboard.  I got 26 letter keys ... a whole bunch of others ... Gimme more hotkeys, I'll map em all :D.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to reading the chat summary, hope it goes well for everyone.</div></div><hr />

The rants that the new combat system will be useless or doesn't address our needs without ever having seen it is just as dumb as the paladins screaming that the new combat system will mean a return to Kunark.<br />
<br />
Chill out for a bit and see what actually happens.  Then add rational commentary because no matter what, the system is going to have flaws.</div></div><hr />

well as it is my hot key boxes are set to bare minimums right now and all 10 are filled, what im asking is that the hotkeys be working into a setting like a pet buff box, and the place where the pet info used to be (hp) could be the flashing indicator...<br />
<br />
as for what keys would they be set to? well alt 1-10 is no use to me with out a spell bar, so those would work,  or if this is hybrid as well control 1-10 would also work</div></div><hr />

The chat is to give us a chance to answer any questions about the enhancement to the melee system.  Obviously I hope that it will help to resolve any doubts that folks have.  We probably won't get into wishlist stuff, if by that you mean lists of ideas for new skills for the enhancement.  Just send those to me directly.  There's no &quot;question&quot; to answer with a wishlist, so it makes for pretty boring chat text.<br />
<br />
 I posted that the chat was encouraged by the news that WoW beta &quot;might&quot; be open by the end of the month. The news of both came on the same day.<br />
<br />
Did it?  Cool.  But, well, how about going over to their site and complaining that they posted that info just to counter the fact that we announced our chat?<br />
<br />
While we are certainly interested in what's going on over in WoW development, we're don't have a spy sitting outside their windows reading their monitors with a telescope.  We plod along with our work on our schedule.  With as much stuff as both companies are doing, it's certainly likely that those schedules will mesh on certain days.<br />

Anyway, its a step in the right direction to adding fun to the pure melee classes and most likely will address some verstaility, utility and balance issues along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh please.  How about you go back thru the history of release dates and announce dates for everything you've done in EQ since uhh, like DAoC came out.  Basically every time another game comes out, you release an expansion or a major patch fixing things that were broken for ages.  You're far beyond fooling people with the &quot;meshed schedule&quot; idea.<br />
<br />
Didn't PoP come out at the same time as Shadowbane?  Either Velious or the Hybrid un-nerf patch came out when DAoC did.  We see this with your company time and time again.  In fact, the only time you seem to be proactive about fixing things in your game is when a new competitor shows up on the scene and you start sweating about all the people who aren't gonna pay for your game anymore.  Fortunately for you, they've all sucked.  How long you wanna bet the streak is gonna go?</div></div><hr />

Absor, to your knowledge are any of the current 'non-wishlist'  skills addressed directly at ranged/snap aggro issues?<br />

 Seriously,making a judgement on something before you see it is close minded at best.You can form an opinion based on this preliminary info release,but for cryin out loud dont form a dogmatic stance before its all out and implemented.I for one am glad they have overhauled the system,not just made minor changes.Otherwise most wars would complain &quot;it took them 10 mos+to do increase hp and make my taunt work??&quot;<br />
   Haass please spare us.Sure....they threw this whole idea together within a week or two :rolleyes: <br />
  See?proof some people will never be happy....yell for changes and no answers and then yell when they get them. Haass please for god sakes never get in a customer service job, you might actually understand what goes on, in the meantime you will be to busy pissing your customers off.<br />
 I work customer service for a bank,and when we get someone like you calling in we laugh about them after we finish HELPING them with their issue.Im sure Absor does the same.Its a game,no need to drop an f-bomb every other sentence because you cant have what you want when you want it.<br />
And yes everyone pays the same $$$ but you dont see all the rest of us reacting like overgrown children about it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I'll be sure not to get into customer service.  I tell it like it is, which is unfortunately not what a lot of people want to hear.  Believe me, I've got zero interest in dealing with fucktards like that on a day in, day out basis.<br />
<br />
I understand that some of you are still jaded about the fact that you think SoE is a reputable company with a great game, but the fact is that their product could EASILY be 10 times better and their customer relations could be too.  When I see people doing a halfassed job at anything, I get pissed off, and I've been seeing it for a LOOOOONG time.  If you choose to take with a smile, that's your perogative, not mine.  I expect more from humanity as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry Absor, but all you've given me with these proposed changes is a sense that there will be yet another time sink that I have to engage in in order to even be able to use the new system with any effectiveness. In addition, I'll have to do this to possibly, and I do mean possibly, fix things that are inherintly flawed with the warrior class to begin with. <br />
<br />
In addition, unless there is a massive change to gear already in my possession, it also means that any gear enhancements will have to be won with brand new gear upgrades. You could, of course, implement augmentations to make up for this, but then I'd have yet more of a timesink getting crap experience in repetitious adventures in one camp to get the specific augmentations I'd need as well as causing me to lose those I'd already worked for that would have to be removed with a solvent so I could add the new aug.<br />
<br />
There is nothing in this announcement that addresses, nor even pretends to deal with the ridiculous lack of difference between the hybrid classes and the pure melee classes in terms of tanking ability. There is nothing to address the appalling drop rates on class essential items such as Darkblades at the time level, or BoW's at the elemental level, nor the ridiculous itemization of most other items. We are completely dependent on gear to be even remotely effective, and yet that gear can only be attained by a handful of individuals who raid in a raiding guild. Even then, the drops are so few and far between as to make it difficult to get the guild to continue raiding the same content over and over again to get a few precious high agro weapons after a fair amount of the other drops are rotting. In over a dozen RZ kills in Time, we have yet to have 1 Darkblade drop. The other time capable guild has killed him over 30 times and has 2. Yet the mulitple drops of all the other class specific weapons have occured. Better than 50 percent of the characters on our sever are plate classes, and yet the drop percentages of plate elemental armor averages just over 30% for most guilds capable of getting it. <br />
<br />
It's this poor itemization that leaves Knights within a couple hundred HP of us to begin with, while having nearly identical AC, instant agro capabilities, spells, and the same mitigation/avoidance capabilities. These things, while anecdotal individually, taken together spell marginalization of the whole warrior class. When you have Paladins capable of tanking RZ or Quarm in Time, and Rangers capable of tanking RZ in Tactics (as one of the Rangers in our guild did last night), there is a fundamental flaw in the system. Nevermind that getting xp groups is becoming very difficult outside of guild groups...the Warrior class outright has no utility.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to try out this new combat system, (not that I really have much of a choice) but I have to say, Absor, that until you address the fundamental flaws in the class with respect to the hybrid classes, these changes smack of eye candy designed to keep the account dollars flowing until something like EQ2  comes along to capture our interest. I doubt SOE cares where the dollars come from, game-wise, as long as they come.<br />

EQ2 vs WoW is a much fairer comparison.<br />

<br />
Ya, and if EQ2 turns out anything like SW:G, that's gonna be a blowout.  Game that functions and has meaningful content &gt; game that looks pretty.  SoE has a hard time grasping that shit.  EQ doesn't need new graphics to keep up, they didn't need a new spell engine, the interface is reasonably good (it'd be better if they didn't render them all completely useless every fucking patch, but I guess that's as close as SoE gets to implementing something good on the first try).  What EQ needs to keep up is just to stop pissing people off.  Make your expansions WORK AND BE ITEMIZED (Fairly, no less) ON RELEASE.  After your expansions, take some time and fix some of the issues you were slacking on while you were working on the expansion.  What we need is for gameplay issues to be addressed (Like warriors are now the 3rd fucking choice for a tank anyone?), we do NOT need new goddamned gimmicks.  Gimmicks satisfy the mental midgets for a few weeks.  Fixing the game fixes the problem so it doesn't keep fucking snowballing.  No one asked for gimmicks.  We asked for the itemization to be looked at and for the aggro disparity to either be corrected by making knights worse tanks or giving us the same tools they have to generate it and making us better.  Either way, Warrior has to be &gt; Knight in terms of tanking ability in all situations, that's the way it fucking has to be for this game to function.  Gimmicks don't change that, and I doubt these gimmicks will fix that.  Why are we not comprehending that people?</div></div><hr />

Mana is originally from the Bible - specifically the book of Exodus.  It is the food that God supplied directly to the Israelites as they wandered in the desert for 40 years (none of them had maxed their sense heading and this was before the nerf).   So, its generic reference became 'food from heaven'.  It's not too hard to see how it eventually got adapted to its fantasy world usage. <br />
<br />
And, I have a joke for Haaass.  <br />
<br />
A man joins a monastery.  The monks in this brotherhood have to take a vow of silence, but they are allowed to say two words every five years. <br />
<br />
After five years, the man is called before the Abbot, and the Abbot says, &quot;Brother, you've been with us for five years and you may now say two words.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man says, &quot;food cold.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Abbot shrugs, the man goes back to work and another five years pass.  Once again, he is called before the abbott and once again he is given permission to speak two words. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;bed hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
He returns to his labors and another five years pass.  He is called before the Abbot, who tells him, &quot;Well, brother, you've now been with us for fifteen years and you may now say another two words.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man says, &quot;I quit.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Abbott responds, &quot;Well, I'm not surprised; you've done nothing but complain ever since you've been here!&quot; <br />

<br />
EverQuest is 5 years old now... and no other company have managed in surpassing the game yet..<br />
that clearly shows just how difficult and demanding this sort of market is.<br />

Why do you suppose that is?<br />
<br />
Because we've been fucked, time and time again, by incomplete content, untuned changes, and a complete lack of testing.<br />
<br />
4 years ago, this change would have been met with &quot;Oohs&quot; and &quot;Aahs&quot; by even the most skeptical player (IE : myself).  The fact of the matter is that we have precedent to base our opinions on.  It's not like it's an unfounded, out of line sentiment here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think these changes have promise.  I'm a little disappointed that SoE kept the news from us until they felt it was properly polished, and thereby lost &quot;heart points&quot; when the subject was banned from fan faire and ignored on messages boards, etc.  <br />
<br />
Attacks.  I'm not sure I'm happy with the idea of special attacks.  Then again, when I&quot;m feeling like a lazy warrior I will just ignore the openings.  Then I'll just be what I am now, except I'll still have new skills and I'll still have untied disciplines. <br />
<br />
Skills  I don't anticipate the new skills using uber-guild power to obtain, but we'll find that out on the 24th perhaps.  Rather, I suspect there will be a skill progression (i.e., there may be some new skills for, oh, the large population of non-65's) and that there will be a few that will require a large force of folks to get. <br />
<br />
<br />
Stamina  I'm not sure about the stamina bar.  Perhaps concerns with how OUR change effects hybrids should be banned here, but since my boyfriend plays a shadowknight I am aware that there is much concern that a stamina bar/discipline change will be seen as a nerf to the hybrids.  Some of us may like that idea.  I don't.  I want an upgrade to my class, but not at the expense of others' enjoyment.   Hopefully the stamina bar (and smaller stamina bar for hybrid) will be handled well.  Absolutely, warriors and other pure melee should have more special melee attacks than a hybrid.  The reasoning is simple:  They get spells, we get melee.  Just so long as their current disciplines are not crippled it should work out well.  (For instance, I really don't wanna screw over raid mechanics with a defunct ranger TS discipline system). <br />
<br />
And for the rest.  Quit whining imo.  I know we are good at it.  I know it may even be PROPER in most circumstances.  I don't believe this to be one of them.  At least not yet for christ's sake.  We already KNOW we'll be getting untied disciplines if the changes go into effect and that alone is a serious flippin' upgrade.  We don't even know what the skills are, much less whether or not one helps with taunt.  You want aggro, Haas, wait and see what they give you for it. <br />
<br />
And for those of you asking for distance aggro I got one thing to say: You got your cake and are eating it too.  Don't demand the whole fucking bakery, man.  It sounds like we are getting serious improvements that might make this a fun class to play again.  I suspect that taunt-like skills will be included but even without them we will get new melee skills and attack advantages that will make us higher on the group foodchain.  Maybe we ought to leave something for the hybrids, neh?  That way they won't start crying for a warrior nerf and THE CYCLE CONTINUES. <br />
<br />
So, those are my opinions.  I may be wrong.  But so might all the naysayers.  Lets see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like Haas.  I just think its a little early to be dissing changes that you admitted YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.  <br />
<br />
They are trying to make changes and upgrades.  That is good.  But in response, rather than even be mildly interested, you are blindly attacking what YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.  You have no idea if they'll address taunt (and, frankly, I'm of the view that if they give warriors a place in raids and in groups other than purely as the main tank, I don't CARE if taunt is addressed.  I want to have fun playing a game, I don't demand that I own the right to tank without agro problems).  <br />
<br />
I personally don't think &quot;why not address what we ask for&quot; is a hard question:  Because it might break the goddamn game and make encounters trivial.  I'm not positive that would be their response but I'm damn sure they are working on a method whereby warriors can have fun and be useful and yet encounters will still be challenging AND other classes can have fun too (Hence, my response to the range-aggro request).  See, we have exactly one interest:  Us.  SoE has several interests conflicting and they need to make sure everything works together.  <br />
<br />
No, I'm not kissing SoE ass.  They may very well screw this up.  But YOU DON'T KNOW yet.  Yer right, I have no idea what world you live in.  Maybe the world you live in is dated November 24 and you already know all the answers.  But I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

I don't really 'like' aggro lock however why is it not broken  that Knights are tanking TIME mobs with aggro as it stands but it would be if a warrior had similar ability? Why is it 'wrong' to wish to be able to tank with similar ability to a knight given that that is exactly what we all signed on for? Why is it so terribly greedy that we should seek to gain back some parity in the role around which our entire character concept was built?<br />

<br />
And to be clear, I don't believe our entire character concept was built around lock aggro.  It was built around taking damage well and giving out damage well.  To stand by that character development it looks like we'll be getting some mitigation bonuses to help take damage, and we are also going to get new melee skills and disciplines to dish it back out.  After four years of playing the game we may all consider ourselves to be a one-dimensional class, but I for one am GLAD we may become more versatile.  I'm tired of being the 5th string tank with little to do at a raid.  I encourage SoE to give us utility that makes us 'stackable.'  That is giving us &quot;parity&quot;, just in a less one-dimensional way than we originally asked for it. <br />
<br />
At the risk of usurping a thread about new changes to the same old &quot;balance&quot; issue already in play in several threads, I don't think anyone should be tanking time mobs with ease, knight or warrior.  I like what I'm seeing with the changes on Test concerning automatic mitigation of warriors.  I think it could have an effect on the choice of tank for hard mobs and certainly ought to be addressing some of your itemization concerns (which is to say, SoE is not going to take away the stats already given to Knights from items.  But they do appear willing to make those stats count for less and ours for more with a mitigation bonus).  Until it goes live I'm not holding my breath.  But its a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erm. We are a tank class that is currently avoided for exp. purposes because we don't compare in mob control. I'm all for additional stuff to aid the group (so I'm more a part of the team) but if the developers insist on keeping trivial mob control (again not something i really favour, but it's there and they either can't or won't address it, it appears), there is absolutely no reasonable excuse to hobble a warrior tank with it. <br />
<br />
I don't know what mathematical model EQ's developers seem to use to determine balance but ever since Absor's 'classes are not that far out of balance' quote I've had little confidence in their handle on the in game reality of how skills are valued by players. Nothing I've seen quoted so far has lead me to believe they've opened their eyes to that.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm not interested in raid mobs anyways (apart from as nice big adverts to illustrate problems :) ).</div></div><hr />

And if Sony just gives everything away then in 6 months they are out of business and what happens to this fun game we play then?  Yes, Sony cares about making money, but I'll bet a months salary most of the dev group are gamers and do what they do because they enjoy it and take a personal stake in the game.  And, yes, I also know a number of game developers and I work for a software company and I know what drives the people I've met and worked with in this industry over the years.  <br />
<br />
So what if Sony includes some/all of the melee balancing in an expansion (as long as the expansion comes out relatively soon :p )??  They included Kunark in an expansion - we all should have quit then because they made us pay to get a larger world when the current one was obviously horribly broken because it was too small and lacked sufficient content!!!:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next expansion =  MORE new skills and abilities (much like casters get new spells)<br />
<br />
<br />
So no, Sony isn't going to force us to buy the next expansion to use the new system, and it's initial skills/abilities.. but note this new system is desinged to be expanded easily.. meaning you can bet if you don't get the next expansion you will feel left out when you only have last week's cool super flying kick move and you see you buddy do a double-cartweel crescent kick to a headbutt slam move only available with the new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to agree with Haas here.<br />
<br />
The last few months of statements of &quot;we are looking into it&quot; meant to me &quot;wait till next expansion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Itemization destroyed balance, simply because it provided hybrid tanks the same access to AC/HP and weapon ratios available to the pure melee classes; essentially creating no cost whatsoever for being able to have a spell book. This simply should not have been the case. Also compounding the problem was that the designers who made new spells added additional power and utility to the Knight classes while being totally incoherent to the itemization issues. The result was no cost from items side and a huge benefit on the spell book side - the disparity is totally out of hand.<br />
<br />
The encounters now are based on the itemization/spells situation created when the expansion was released. In concept it should be that pure melee should be paramount(a meaningful one) at &quot;melee&quot;(wow new concept here), but to fix the current itemization problem there are only two options; Nerf Knights, or make warriors better to the degree of difference itemization/spells failed to address for the cost in having a hybrid nature.<br />
<br />
The problem with making warriors better is because adding any additional power would break the current system of the encounters. Basically said -- the current content cannot support a pure melee upgrade no matter how deserving it is. The problem with nerfing Knights is the uproar in doing so.<br />
<br />
The result is SONY will leave things as is until a new expansion comes out, or make changes shortly before the new expansion, and address the new content with (hopefully) a better understanding of itemization, cost/reward for choosing melee only, and development teams of spells and items seeing how things add up taken together and not blind to individually.<br />
<br />
This is the reality. But, it takes balls for SONY to come out and admit it, and for the last year they have chosen to not publicly admit their mess. The feeder line &quot;we are looking into it&quot; is, and should have been, seen as --- not till we can create content supporting the change.<br />
<br />
If it was my company I would have swallowed my pride and said we screwed up while realizing their would be a cost in fixing it. Somewhere, sometime, in some board meeting some SOE reps must have gotten together and decided the costs were too much.<br />
<br />
Are you reading this SOE management? Read below.<br />
<br />
And like Mitsubishi gained huge sales in their target campaign of &quot;zero-zero-zero&quot; deals, the bottom line was a 1 billion dollar loss.<br />
<br />
The lesson to be learned for you is that even though the numbers looked good - they failed to consider the worst case scenario. Costs of capital formulae cannot consider behavior.<br />
<br />
The games you play do not build customer base loyalty, and when relationships turn sour people will look to the substitute. If W.O.W. can provide the slightest degree of understanding this concept then I fear for your pride. /taunt off</div></div><hr />

But what do you make of the changes _already_ on Test - they seem to discount your expansion theory?  Or are those pre-expansion changes too?  Cuz it looks like SoE is addressing the itemization issue through pure mitigation bonuses.   And it looks like SOE is addressing that issue right now, not necessarily in connection with the next expansion.<br />
<br />
The changes on test coincide with the new &quot;melee balance&quot; system but aren't necessarily part of it.  So, yeah, maybe the new melee balance system won't be released until we buy the expansion, although I doubt it.  I cannot see SoE requiring the purchase of an expansion in order to, for example, untie disciplines.  Sure, they can give us new &quot;skills&quot; with the expansion, but the system itself will probably be separate from it. <br />
<br />
I'm with you.  I don't know what that will mean in terms of trivializing current content.  But it sure does look like they are making that change regardless.  And I wouldn't completely discount the idea that they may tune encounters to be harder. <br />
<br />
And, Rod, you missed my point.  I was purely and ONLY addressing range-aggro with the cake statement.  I, like you, have no idea what the melee balance will offer, except for what has been stated by Sony.  What we DO know is that SoE is trying to put our class back on par with Knights, whether that be in tanking or other versatility remains to be seen.  What I see from folks demanding range-aggro is that they are seeking to be SUPERIOR to Knights in all areas (not just melee-aggro) and take away any of the Knight's melee benefits.  That in my personal opinion is taking it too far.  Give us back our place as a tank, give us versatility on raids and in groups that makes the class fun and useful.  But give the goddamn Knights an area too.  Then no one will need to cry nerf in the future.</div></div><hr />

Ya know, I was hanging out with one of my RL friends from EQ last nite, and we were shooting the shit, and the funniest goddamned thing happens.  He says something to the effect of &quot;Yeah, how much you wanna bet this new &quot;Melee chat&quot; ends up being a fucking promo for a new expansion, and they completely ignore the issue yet again.&quot;  I'm sitting at home, doing some surfing later on this morning and I see's this post on FOHGuild.org leading to this http://forumsfr.ubi.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=fr_eqloft_eq&amp;id=zxscp<br />
<br />
OMG!  A new fucking expansion!  <br />
<br />
I'll bet fucking dollars to donuts that this new &quot;Balance system&quot; is something we've gotta pay 29.99 for, and if that's the case, I'll cancel both fucking accounts right now and delete my goddamned toons.  You guys go on keep being completely blind to the fact that this company doesn't give a RATS FUCKING ASS ABOUT YOU OR YOUR PROBLEMS.  They only care about one thing....THEIR WALLET.<br />
<br />
But I'll tell you what, lets come back to this thread in 2 months and see what really happened.  You can't teach an old dog new tricks, and these people are not going to mysteriously become compassionate about their game....they only give a fuck about the next thing they can sell you.  <br />

Haass, you need to take some fucking time off. I understand being skeptical, but dude... you are now in the point of &quot;pissing in everyone's cheerios.&quot; You are contributing little but whiny bullshit about how Sony is out to fuck us in the ass without vaseline. If you are that convinced about all this, quit the fucking game, drop it, move on to a more fulfilling life, but for the love of all that is good, stop it with the constant chicken little shit....</div></div><hr />

Posts like this make me laugh.  Did you just start playing yesterday or something?  Look at the big picture of customer service and game functions in the last 5 years and tell me if you see a trend.  SoE repeatedly lies to their customers, doesn't deliver on promises on the fucking boxes of their expansions, ignores questions they don't want to answer, doesn't test content, and doesn't have the foresight to understand how changes they do and don't make will affect the game.<br />

IF igorance is bliss, you should be totally in nirvana, SOE hasn't been in charge all 5 years. Companies get bought out. THINGS CHANGE.  And not everything is predictable, is Sony perfect? Hell no, but you are ascribing a whole new level of malevolence to them. If you hate them so much, just fucking quit already.</div></div><hr />

There is a difference.  And as a rule of thumb big corporations don't change.  They will do what they always do, which is increase profits, keep an eye on the bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. <br />

I believe SoE to be as uncaring as Haas does when it comes to players; but I do think they pay attention to their pocketbook and in this instance I think their pocketbook and my desires happily share the same dinner table.</div></div><hr />

SoE may be unresponsive at times, but I cant honestly agree with any of these charges besides ignoring questions... if any were true, they would be sued by every other game manufacturer that makes MMORPG's... Because not a single one has been able to beat EQ....<br />
<br />
I remember a quote, forget from who, that was along the lines of this.. &quot;The American Government is the worst one in the world...Except for all the others..&quot; <br />
<br />
The same is very true of EQ, say what you want, but EQ is and remains the number 1 MMORPG, it does so for many reasons. Have our concerns been ignored for too long? Most will agree, are we now being looked at and our issues addressed, from every indication I see. Yes. Will we get free Elemental Armor, +1000 hp augments, and 300 dps weapons, the sun the moon and the stars? NO.. But the issues are being addressed, and new tools to help in the future are being added. <br />
<br />
I honestly am a little excited about the prospects of what this may bring in the future... <br />
<br />
It looks like soon it will again be a good time to be a melee class.</div></div><hr />

Absor has been lying to us for months now.  Repeatedly we BEGGED for any response regarding warrior issues, what did we get &quot;We'll look into it.&quot;  &quot;We don't have anything to report.&quot;  The truth is that they were apparantly working on it, and just not telling us about it.  Why the fuck would you do that?  What the fuck is the posisble rational behind not telling people &quot;Ya, we got a plan, we're looking into the logistics of it at the moment, we'll get back to you in a month when we've had some time do some crunching.&quot;  Is that them lying to us?  In my eyes, yes.<br />
<br />
Was the bazaar working when Luclin came out?  It was advertised on the box.  Looks like they've been holding back features they claimed were in there as well.  If you want to argue that point, well then I can easily bring up the mass quantities of &quot;New zones&quot; that weren't itemized on release.  If there's not loot in the zone, that zone isn't complete, it's not ready for release.<br />
<br />
You can't agree with the fact that they don't test content?  Have you logged in the day after a patch recently?  Nothing fucking works.  Remember the Sol C patch?  They did one goddamned thing that patch and THEY DIDN'T EVEN PATCH THE GODDAMNED ZONE ENTRANCE IN.  They don't test shit, they never have.  WE are the testers.<br />
<br />
You don't agree that they lack the foresight to see how their changes or lack thereof affect the game?  Why?  all/all 100hp items off Vulak caused a problem.  Everyone fucking saw it, but it was 2 expansions later that Monks finally got nerfed to counteract those bad itemization choices.  Now we're staring at the exact same problems with non class specific armor, and guess what...we've got the exact same issues, predicted by people on this board no less, with Knights.   It wasn't that long ago that warriors were complaining because Monks tanked better than them you know.<br />
<br />
If you hate them so much, just fucking quit already <br />

Might as well answer this again so the mouth breathers don't keep asking me it.  I'll explain something to you.  I don't play this game for the game.  The game stopped being amusing a long time ago.  I play it for the interaction between myself and the friends I've made and the guild I lead.  The people I log in with every nite enjoy my company, they enjoy my experiences and when I'm around, they know they're going to have a good time.  I don't play EQ because this game is the best game on the market, I play it because I can't quit it and let those people down.   It's not a question of how good the game is, it's a question of a time investment and social interaction.  Either we play our level 65/135's on EQ, or we go play some other shithole MMORPG out there and be noobs.  It's not that hard to make the decision.  Stop fucking thinking that it's as simple as &quot;Quit or shut up.&quot;  I can play and I can bitch, they're not mutually exclusive.<br />
<br />
Believe me, the above is the only reason EQ has persevered as long as it has.  There are countless people on this board, and all over the world who are playing and have played for long after the game stopped being fun, because they have friendships and they mean more to them than some fucking game ever will.</div></div><hr />

Absor stated that Expansions won't deal with balance.  This melee system is separate and needs to be in place prior.  I expect the Berserker class will have a large set of melee &quot;skills&quot; from the new system.  Its the only way they can be introduced and be unique.  <br />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I typically try to understand the business side of decisions, and outcomes. I do this because that's what I do for a living in real life.  <br />
<br />
Everquest is a business, and as a business it has a profit motive. I am confident that whatever Everquest does it is done with a return of profit in mind. This is good. But this can also be bad. This is because, for a game like Everquest, the more corporatized it becomes the result is that people making the decisions on the game come from a background of Finance, and not of &quot;gaming&quot; and creativity. Everquest is not a product &quot;x&quot; that you run to Walmart and pick up for $1.95, and then go and grab another a couple weeks later. <br />
<br />
Everquest is a product ... yes. However, unlike product &quot;x&quot; Everquest is primarily a relationship first and secondarily a product. The dynamics of relationships are not what finance people can guage with their backgrounds. As a player of Everquest for nearly 4 years I can see things from the relationship side. And to be upfront about it, there have been things that, had this been just product &quot;x&quot;, I would have ditched Everquest game entirely.<br />
<br />
Loyalty to why &quot;frustrated&quot;(I'm not suggesting that there are not very satisfied players out there)players continue to play Everquest isn't to SOE...it is really to their &quot;time investment&quot; in making something. It's a relationship with their creation that they sunk thousands of hours into, and the relationships which others have helped along the way. In fact there are people playing that are totally frustrated, but people play out of &quot;hope&quot; that things will get better. This is not unlike a battered spouse who stays thinking it will get better. It's hard to just let it drop into nothing, and those that make that decision do it typically under trying dilemma. Thus, Everquest has a built in resiliance to poor management decisions. But, like all relationships, once it's broken it's very difficult to repair.<br />
___________________________________________<br />
<br />
This is a portion of a melee balancing document I have been working on.<br />
<br />
Dear SOE,<br />
<br />
This letter acts as a request in evaluating class development and balancing. Specifically, I am directing my letter at the warrior class’s balance structure. Although, my analysis is focused mainly on the warrior class it is not a comprehensive analysis of the class’s balance issues. Rather, it focuses on the more dominant/serious issues affecting the class.  I use the term “balance” and “balancing” to mean equitable consideration and implementation to a class’s utility structure.<br />
<br />
Basic assumptions:<br />
<br />
1)	The warrior class is arguably one of the most dependent classes requiring a group to successfully navigate and exist in the Everquest environment. The basis of this assumption rests on the fact that the warrior has no innate mobility to travel unseen, quickly, or over long distances instantly. Also, in the face of danger, the warrior class has limited ability to fend off an undesired encounter except to fight or run; no gate, root, or feign death.<br />
<br />
2)	The warrior class is arguably one of the most dependent classes requiring to group to successfully be rewarded via experience and items. The basis of this assumption rests on the fact that the warrior has no innate ability to heal himself in the course of an encounter, slow the opposition, or alter the opposition’s method of combat in any way so as to reduce his risk in the confrontation. Additionally, the warrior class has no avenue to mitigate the negative consequences for having a failed outcome(warriors cannot summon corpses, or resurrect).<br />
<br />
3)	The warrior class is arguably one of the most limited class selections for assuming utility in different roles. The basis of this assumption exists in terms of the two roles a warrior assumes; someone taking damage, or someone delivering damage. A warrior may play a limited role in pulling an encounter to the group of party members, but at the expense of consequences in the event of a bad pull(warriors do not possess lull, harmony, pacify, etc.). In addition to their own utility, pure melee cannot innately improve another class’s utility defensive or offensive in nature.<br />
<br />
4)	The pure melee classes in general are the classes who arguably are the weakest classes in terms of their soloing ability for reasons of being more closely tied to the above three assumptions than any other class structure in the Everquest environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the course of Everquest game class development from its inception the above four assumptions have largely remained the same. Game balance would suggest that an optimal benefit gained should be in place for utility lost for not having chosen another class. For the warrior class the utility left is damage delivered and damage received. For the pure melee classes in general the utility gained for specializing them to “pure melee” should entail pre-eminence in melee functions. Likewise, pure casters would have pre-eminence in casting functions relative to their melee ability. However, of all the classes only pure melee are innately restricted to one dominion of proficiency; meaning the pure melee cannot cast spells, but spell casters have some, albeit in varying degree, ability to melee (This is significant mainly on an organizational structure level for Sony with regards to itemization. If Sony has one team implementing spells for classes, and one team implementing items, when taken separately and then generalized across many classes it gives a double benefit to those classes having proficiency in both dominions. This impact, taken as a whole, acts as a disadvantage to pure melee classes with each successive expansion.).<br />
<br />
5)	Pure melee pay the highest price in utility for expected returns in game play.<br />
<br />
6)	For the pure melee classes the utility gained for specializing them to “pure melee” should entail pre-eminence in melee functions.<br />
<br />
7)	Due to pure melee’s very nature of being single dimension, and of specific utility, game balance would place them paying the highest cost for having these roles preempted.<br />
<br />
The Warrior<br />
<br />
8)	Warriors, by their design, are best at tanking. As the parent class, being pure melee, the warrior class should be the preferred class in that role.<br />
<br />
The Problem<br />
<br />
9)	The hybrid tanking classes(Paladin/Shadow Knight) have become too strong comparative to the parent tanking class, thus diminishing this preferred role. As a single dimension class of pure melee, warriors are not designed to afford this role to be preempted as they would pay the highest price. The preempted state belongs to the hybrid tanking class, whose very nature supports another dimension of utility. A dimension of utility not touchable to the warrior class, but given to the hybrid class in lieu of accepting their hybrid nature.  <br />
<br />
Why the problem ? <br />
<br />
10)	The reasons for this are two fold. The diminished role is a function of HP/AC being too narrow(due to itemization discussed later) between the parent class and the hybrid class. What hybrids give up in melee compared to their parent tanking class to acquire casting power is negligible – no real penalty exists. Secondly, the comparative grouping risk associated with the parent class for not having the 100% aggro lock which supporting classes possess suggest that a warrior can be too costly when a viable opportunity exists to remove that risk.<br />
<br />
Further complexities of the problem.<br />
<br />
11)	When Planes of Power was engineered the designers created Encounters, and implemented spells and items to meet those encounters. Taken as a whole these implementations are designed to provide sufficient challenge.<br />
<br />
12)	Adjusting existing implementations to provide additional utility would disrupt the environment challenge. Thus, even if discrepancies can be justified between the pure melee classes vs. supporting role classes adding additional utility(Increasing HP/AC) would disrupt the environment challenge.<br />
<br />
13)	The current PvE make up in Everquest cannot resolve this diminished role alone by increasing HP/AC of the warrior. The advantages gained by HP/AC is insignificant compared to the advantages gained by having more mana and less risk. The concept of tanking efficiency comes into play when both risk, and mana output are diminished by a class having sufficient AC/HP and weilding 100% aggro lock allows the healer to focus mana to one party member, and damage/death becomes an insignificant matter to other party members. The only time HP/AC show a greater return vs. risk are those encounters specifically designed to be more challenging and require the additional  AC/HP or defensive. These factors combined directly diminish the warrior as a tank choice except in those PvE instances which require defensive.<br />
<br />
Itemization, Law of Diminishing Returns,  and Class Balance<br />
<br />
14)	Law of Diminishing Return(Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001.) Law stating that if one factor of production is increased while the others remain constant, the overall returns will relatively decrease after a certain point. -- With regard to class balance the comparative advantages for choosing a pure melee nature have decreased. The mitigation multiplier a warrior has offers less and less return when itemization increases are available to both hybrids and pure melee equally as shown in item 15. <br />
<br />
15)	The HP/AC advantage shown to decrease as items are generalized(meaning same ratio’s, AC, HP benefits are shown to increase equally for both the warrior class and hybrid class; another way of saying it is that the associated penalty existing for having a second dimension of casting utility to the hybrid class disappears.  Be looking below each class receives the same increase(example of +1 here). That same increase over time removes the comparative advantage of something having started out twice as large to insignificant.<br />
<br />
&lt;Can't include the graph&gt;<br />
<br />
16)	Pure melee, unlike any other class, have a greater reliance on items. In fact, it has been their only avenue available to them for successive expansions for meeting environment challenges. However, the benefit derived from itemization is one of general purpose among all melee classes both hybrid and pure. This weakens whatever advantages a pure melee class was compensated with for being melee only. In fact it suggests there are no advantages for being pure melee when the very same weapons, and items are generalized among all.<br />
<br />
17)	Because the Knight classes have the same access to weapons, damage ratios, and armor class increases itemization here suggests that any balanced discrepancy existing has left. When Planes of Power was engineered the designers created Encounters, and implemented spells and items to meet those encounters. Taken as a whole these implementations are designed to provide sufficient challenge.<br />
<br />
18)	Adjusting existing implementations to provide additional utility would disrupt the environment challenge. Thus, even if discrepancies can be justified between the pure melee classes vs. supporting role classes adding additional utility(Increasing HP/AC) would disrupt the environment challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is not inclusive of the entire document, but is enough to work with.<br />
<br />
As far as the melee changes I have seen thus far, only the 4% mitigation has shown itself on test, however - SOE has met that 4% magnitude by adjusting a degree of content with 4%.<br />
<br />
However, a significant portion of the current discrepancy was due to itemization issues - and itemization is a factor of released expansions.<br />
<br />
I'm going to say that the 4%/4% move on SOE's part is a bandaid resulting from an incorrect paradigm that expansions and balance are not hand in hand.<br />
<br />
They may introduce more benefit, but I would argue any signficant benefit would have to be matched by a corresponding change to the environment.<br />
<br />
The entire class of &quot;Berzerker&quot;, and the proposed revamp of the entire melee system(from a business standpoint) would be much more economical with the release of the expansion. Also, they have an opportunity to redo itemization for the new content as well. Thus, the significant portion of changes may, in fact, come from the expansion.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to differ with some people's perception on what is &quot;day of release of expansion&quot; and what is &quot;a month or two&quot; prior. In my mind the fact that the melee changes were announced alongside the information for a new class, and the weighing evidence of an impending expansion -- still suggests they waited for an expansion. A couple months with a few test pieces, and a few implimentations would not be sufficient for me to say they acted separate from the two. I still see them as the same, and Absor said this wasn't something that just hit them like a brick walking down the road the day they announced these things - if I am not wrong there is a post saying this has been in the works for months.<br />
<br />
This should clarify my statement:<br />
<br />
&quot;The result is SONY will leave things as is until a new expansion comes out, or make changes shortly before the new expansion...&quot;<br />

As a player I do have some caution flags up regarding the revamp of the melee system just like many have expressed. While I am under the &quot;honeymoon&quot; affect that SOE has expressly given us attention, my concern is the revamp may reshape existing pure melee so much that it creates a new class that persons would not have wanted to play. I do think they have to be careful in this. And, I do think SOE should be mindful that the warrior concern wasn't expressly for need of a &quot;mana/stamina&quot; pool as much as it was a need t to re-evaluate the inequities existing in the current system.<br />
<br />
The missing parts of my balance addressed the Aggro issues. Pesonally, I am interested in SOE's formal position on the aggro issue. I personally consider 100% aggro lock an imbalance in the game from any perspective, and I am not entirely convinced that it was the intent from the developers to make it work that good. Rather,  I see it as a side affect from implimenting a &quot;play smart&quot; dimension from the pure caster dimension. The spells provided for aggro obviously help out, however the fact that hybrids have spells with create massive aggro aside from hate generating spells impresses upon me that the existing system creates too great an aggro control. The risk/cost basis for it just doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
I am also interested in a statement from SOE why warrior taunt skill exists at a higher level than hybrids.<br />
<br />
My interpretation is that pure melee have dominance in the aggro generation department above the hybrid classes, and that for hybrid classes to overcome that ... they must rely on specific spells to equal the playing feild, and/or exceed the Warrior's ability - however, if accepting that they were designed to exceed the margin of the warrior - it's an entirely new argument for me to accept that hybrid aggro should have been 100% - some risk still should exist.<br />

I must say that your posts are some of the most thought out and best reading ones I have read on any post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SOE has also made changes in the past, that has many players extremely happy...<br />
<br />
Yes SOE is all about profit, most big companies are all about money...<br />
but you got to realise thatmost of the time profit and client pleasure are the one and same thing...<br />
the problem is the client base is divided into different interests. And you can never please all of them at once.<br />
<br />
We (the melee) have been ignored a long time, that's about the only thing we can blame SOE for.<br />
But that time's finished, we are now their center of interest.<br />
Absor kept saying he had no info, and they were looking into it.. ya.<br />
But that's the truth... he had no info FOR us... <br />
once you're in the game industry, you realise that divulging info too early does more harm then divulging it too late...<br />
<br />
Imagine if they had divulged the little info they had 2 months ago...<br />
and said &quot;We're looking into wether changing the melee system entirely, is doable or not&quot;<br />
Imagine the reaction...<br />
One side fearing god knows what horrible nerfage melees would get,<br />
other side fearing the overpower melees would get,<br />
thousands of people flooding SOE with complaints, ideas, questions....<br />
<br />
Just look at the reaction they got now, when announcing part of an idea of a change....<br />
so many people dissing SOE for not addressing the problem... <br />
<br />
As a company, you got to be extra carefull about every single thing you say, and when you say...<br />
because each word that comes out, will be falsely interpretted, taken as a promise, taken as an insult, taken as a lie etc etc...<br />
<br />
Just look today's reaction, and think that 2 or 3 months ago, the reaction would of been the same, or worse...</div></div><hr />

 Stop fucking thinking that it's as simple as &quot;Quit or shut up.&quot;  I can play and I can bitch, they're not mutually exclusive.<br />
  <br />
<br />
I think it's rather ironic, that for someone who's called SOE all kinds of derogative names questioning their intelligence, competence and heaven knows what else, but at the end of each month you still give them 12,95$.</div></div><hr />

Oh I read them. Rationalize and explain  all you want. For a bunch of morons and incompetents they still get money from you monthly. Makes one wonder, who is the smarter ones. The fool, or those who keep giving money to said fool :p</div></div><hr />

While I may not agree with Haas' opinions, I can see where he's coming from.  Let me provide an analogy that maybe even you can understand, Torinak.  <br />
<br />
I live in the central core area of a city of a million people.  In my area, there is only nearby grocery store.  It sucks.  The store is never that clean, produce and meat isn't the freshest, selection is limited, etc.  However, I still shop there.  Why ?  Because, to go to another store would involve at least another 45 minutes to an hour of driving.  There is one other supermarket nearby, but it's even worse.<br />
<br />
Right now, this grocery store, to me, is the best option available, even with all its' faults.  Just as EQ is the best gaming option available to a lot of people.  To say that either I must think the grocery store is perfect, or else I can no longer shop there, is assinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To follow your analogy here, no one is saying the store is perfect. But Haass at times is basically saying the store is intentionally passing off bad produce to us. That is the difference, does the store screw up? hell yes, is it intentionally trying to pass bad food to us? no.</div></div><hr />

*winces* sorry ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, i'm saying the store is being a bunch of lazy bastards who care more about their coffee breaks than doing a decent job.  For some reason you assume lazyness is intentional, when for the most part, it's just the default scheme for a lot of people.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between people who care about their job and people who are just there to do the minimum amount required to collect a paycheck.</div></div><hr />
