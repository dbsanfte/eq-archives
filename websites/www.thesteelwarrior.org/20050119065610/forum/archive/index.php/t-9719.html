The helm has got to go too, I'd recommend a magnetic helm or kizrak's.  The BP is a bit low on AC as well, magnetic (58ac 115hp), Ornate (63ac 105hp i think), or LDoN (Miragul's-63ac 75hp or Tak-69ac 95hp theme) would all be better for AC and HP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Everlord</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">umm About the Weps...are actually Awesome DPS W/ thats said the Anger 3 slapped on them makes for perfect agro...I told him about the Droga Combo..but he likes his current DPS/AGRO...Were working on getting BoT Tower groups together to try and get the Ornate BP, Legs etc...Im looking for a HoRZ Helm and that Choker Xana Drops...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Everlord</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...Where is a Better place to Farm Ornate besides BoT ( which never drops it lol) That doesnt Require Keys....Also...What can i get out of Small Kael Raids/Groups that drop good upgrades for him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, depends on your firepower,  vindi bp will be better for him then cobalt. and erradication bp would also be a slight upgrade for him.  Tormax drops a decent hat that will carry you over till you get RZ hat.  if you have the time.  Dozekar is always a good dragon to beat up on when you are bored, silver bracelet of speed, silver charm of tranquility, and that mask(forgot the name) are still decent peices if you dont intend to farm him OoW stuff.  I still say save up for BoC cuz he's just not doing his job w/o something like ang3 augged BoC or better.  to be honest, you will get much more bang for your buck if you farm OoW so maybe look in that direction 1st then go back to old world to plug up any missing slots.</div></div><hr />
