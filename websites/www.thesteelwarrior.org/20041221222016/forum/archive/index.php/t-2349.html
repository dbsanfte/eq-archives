<br />
I know that taunt has and forever will be a much-discussed topic, but I have a new twist to bring up (at least new to me). Im a level 44 warrior, and was xp'in in DL this weekend. I noticed and interesting trend, which was perhaps just a random number generator thing. What I noticed is that it seemed that I had more succesfull taunts when I was right on the mob....that is, the closer I was to the mob when I actually hit taunt, the more likely the taunt was successful.<br />
<br />
Now I know that proximity based aggro (at least on certain types of mobs) has been well-documented, however I've never seen anyone test a proximity-based taunt before. Try it out sometime...if you're not already standing on the mob's feet, go ahead and move in (on large mobs, yes, you are actually &quot;in&quot; the mob)...see if you notice a difference. Perhaps some of you tester types can run some &quot;scientific controlled&quot; tests to see if my theory is all washed-up.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who's tanked for a long time has more than enough evidence from their own experiences to know that if they want aggro, they need to get their butts right up against that mob.  And make sure the bloody rogue stays at max melee distance! :p  <br />
<br />
you may have also noticed that if a mob is rooted, it automatically goes for whoever is closest.  In that case proximity is everything.  That's just another reason earth pets really piss me off, especially when fighting in tight dungeon corridors.  They keep rooting the freaking mob and sometimes a squishy (caster) is sitting too close....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only real significant proximity aggro dealing with non-rooted mob I've seen is whether you're in melee range and not.  I think if you get far enough away from melee range there's a bigger reduction in aggro but that kind of distance do not concern us.  As long as everyone else is also in melee range proximity aggro is fairly unnoticeable (unless mob is rooted).  It's still a good idea to be closest to the mob but don't count on just being close will get the aggro you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janthor</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always seen this as being the case.  The closer you are the more aggro you can pull from the mob.  If you have two warriors going at the same mob, warrior number 1 taunting and warrior number 2 taunting...both same level and same abilities/weapons/gear you will see that the warrior closer to the mob will get the more attention...kind of like I'm in your face what are you gonna do about it thing.  That's why during raids your always best to stay JUST within melee range if your not the MT.  If you get aggro back up a little bit further because you're not quite far enough away...</div></div><hr />

What occurred to me, however, was not only increased aggro from attacking close, but also the increase of successfull taunts &lt;shrug&gt;.</div></div><hr />
