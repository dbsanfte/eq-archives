<br />
how does the /shield thing work?  and what does it do exactly?<br />
<br />
What is flurry?  is that when the mob just randomly smacks everyone around it?<br />
<br />
What about enrage? What is it, and what should I do if it happens?<br />
<br />
I have experienced Rampage, and I got the thread from the library about how it happens.  But any info on it woould be apprecieated as well.  <br />
<br />
Been a while since I did anythig of any significance with my warrior and I would rather ask stupid questions here than fek up in game and get someone dead.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield - Used to protect another character. They take 1/2 of the melee damage and you take 3/4. Ex: a mob hits a chanter for 400. You /shield and instead they take 200 and you take 300. Shield is limited somewhat in range and cannot be used if either character is using a discipline. <br />
<br />
Flurry- Extra swings per round. Cool when you do it via AA, can be painful when mob does it to you.<br />
<br />
Enrage- All frontal attacks are riposted. Good when you do it via discipline furious, annoying to fatal if you're not watching for it when a mob does it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As has been mentioned, when Mob01 becomes ENRAGED!, all attacks in the frontal arc will be riposted. You can die FAST if you aren't prepared for this. Usually you will know ahead of time that a particular mob enrages or not, and this usually happens at 9% of the mob's HP. Just turn attack off at 10%, wait till it &quot;is no longer enraged,&quot; and finish it off. If you aren't expecting it, and you see &quot;Soandso has become ENRAGED!&quot; turn attack OFF ASAP until it passes.<br />
<br />
A note on /shield: It does save lives, really! I have a hotkey setup like this:<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 5<br />
/shield<br />
It's great for when the mob you have targeted aggros a caster or ranger or some other wus. If taunt fails BAM hit the shield hotkey - It will /assist the mob, pause for a moment to compensate for the slight delay in switching targets with /assist, and /shield the fragile one for a short time while you take aggro back.</div></div><hr />
