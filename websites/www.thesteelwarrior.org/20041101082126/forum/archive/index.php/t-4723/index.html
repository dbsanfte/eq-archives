<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question regarding the Anger line of augments for weapons. I have a Blade of Carnage which increases hate by 700. If I add an Anger 2 augment, which adds 400 hate. Will the hate stack? So 700 from BOC and 400 from Anger 2 = 1100 hate from one weapon? Or should I add a different proc instead? Any answers would be helpful. Also I need some advice on the next line of AA I should be getting. I currently have Innate stamina 5, Run 3, Combat agility 3, Combat Stability 3, Natural Durability 3, Physical enhancement, Area Taunt, Planar Power 5, Planar Durability 3, Innate Defense 5, Lightning Reflexes 5. Where should I go next? Thank you for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urgot_the_ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The anger 2 would not make your BoC a 1100 hate weapon sinse the 2 procs will go off indifferently from each other. You would on the other hand get alot more procs.<br />
I have the anger 3 and i wouldent change it for anything.<br />
<br />
I would go Stalwart Endurance, Ferocity and Tactical Mastery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">re AA, youve cleared all your defensive ones so really your out for dps ones now.<br />
as to which ones, that would depend on whats your dps set up. its its DW id go ambi combat fury then flurry for bang for your buck.<br />
<br />
if 2hander then go combat fury PB and flurry.<br />
<br />
stalward endurance u do wantt o pick up at sometime if u hate getting stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hold out for Anger 3 unless you're planning on upgrading your weapons soon.  Why stop at 400 aggro when you can have 600?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why stop at 400 aggro when you can have 600? Cause the 600 one costs the double of the 400 one without, actually, double the hate :p<br />
<br />
As far as offensive AAs, I would recommend Ferocity and Tactical Mastery, you really notice the difference :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So.....what augment would you recommend for someone who wields a Blade of War?  Ykesha, Anger or one of the lifetap, dot ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anger III.<br />
<br />
Might as well put the big daddy phatty aggro proc on the big daddy phatty aggro weapon. Lock it down, and dare the mob to hit someone else.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urgot_the_ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the BoW with anger 3 and as i said, i would never change it for anything. Some may say that it is overkill but i disagree.<br />
<br />
The ykesha is good aggro but nowhere close to anger 3. Sure it will add some to your dps but with the anger 3 i can let the nukers go harder on the mob without being afraid of getting summoned n killd. And for that, the raid gets higher dps.<br />
<br />
Lifetap would be worthless if you put it on the weapon you tank with. 75hp will do nothing for you if you stand as MT. <br />
<br />
DoTs on weapons are plain stupid imo. If you where to use a DoT weapon in clearings and by accident hit the wrong mob or have to change target and you get a proc the CC have no chanse of mezzing it.<br />
DoTs allso stacks on the max debuffs on a mob so if you have a lot of DoT weapons being used(example Ornate greatblade) the shamans n necros will cry over that their DoTs wont take hold. And the raid loses Dps over this.<br />
Some guilds even baned the use of DoT weapons on raids and this might not be such a bad idea imo..<br />
<br />
All in all, Anger 3 is your friend..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nomryh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was going w/ Anger III on my soon-to-be BoC &amp; putting Ykesha on an offhand that has a DD. I'd imagine BoC + Anger III is PLENTY of agro, especially w/ new provoke line... &amp; the extra DPS on offhand is nice. &amp; if that doesn't work, I'll just throw an Anger II aug onto a CHSD.</div></div><hr />
