I know augging it is purely situational by person, but I was wondering if there was any favored augs that warriors tend to stick on it.<br />

Any thoughts welcome.</div></div><hr />

AC10 from BB</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup. It doesn't really take anything else worthwhile anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Basthird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">+ 25 hp +25 mana +25 end from GoD ?<br />
<br />
or even the +30 hp mana end one ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daylenia Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when i replaced gcop with shield i put the 10 sta aug on it to get some of the sta i lost from GCoP (Greater Cloak of Pernicity)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">10ac from BBM. 15ac from Ferubi might work, but too many other slots you can't put 10ac in for the 15ac ones.<br />
<br />
Edit to add: End is nearly worthless at this time. Even SoE appears to have accepted that if you believe the summit reports. So do you consider 25 or 30 hp to be worth loosing the 10ac you can get from bbm aug? imo, it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're really low on sta, I guess that's an option. Because stamina is hard capped though, I'd definitely suggest you go with the augment that is simply going to last you forever, because that's what the shield will do. I'd take 10ac over 30hp in a heartbeat, and endurance doesn't even come into the equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I put the 15 ac on my shield but will move it over to my bp and put the 10ac in place of it.  The 15 will go just about anywhere but 10's wont.<br />

<br />
10 ACs can go in face, neck, shoulder, back and waist<br />
40 HPs can go in chest, legs, feet, arms and head<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be worth it to put 40hp aug into BP and put the 15AC in the other 7 slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jakazzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">omg what 10 stamina aug? your not talking about that high priced one with 10 wis also are you?  i would definitely put that in if i could get one to make up for the sta lost from pernicity, i will be getting planar power soon and my stamina is only at 280 self buffed and with stat food(ornate legs, halas pies, and grobb liquidised meet)  plus the augs are movable and sellable now so i can move it or sell it when my sta reaches 305 unbuffed : )</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called the Peerless Sphere of Fortitude, is LORE, and fits in all augment slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Even with old world estimates of 1ac = 6hp, the 15ac would be twice as good as the 40hp. In PoP or GoD though, the AC is worth even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Granite, there are only 2 15 ac augments you can get, so the point is that it'd be better to put them in other slots, say bracers, where neither 40hp augments nor 10ac augments fit. If you could get an unlimited number of 15 ac augments, I'd agree with your statement.</div></div><hr />
