<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doraar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which out of these four weapons would generate the biggest amount of aggro for a level 55 warrior? I don't have enough time to save for an anger 3 aug from ldon but I could save for maybe an anger 2 one...lemme know what yall think.<br />
<br />
List of weapons:<br />
Swiftblade of Zek<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Wind-worn Handblade<br />
Ornate Stone Battle Hammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CHoS all the way, the others aren't even agro weapons.<br />
<br />
Also if you can save for an anger 2 aug there's no reason not to save up for anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doraar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok here's what I was thinkin. Get a copper hammer and I already have a wind-worn handblade. I could save for an anger 2 aug and put it on the chos. Then I could save slowly but surely for an anger 3 aug. Only thing is I'm havin trouble decidin what to put in main hand and what to put in off hand. What do you guys think? :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sell the wind-worn, get a Droga Combo.  CHoS in primary and SotBS in secondary.  Aggro fixed.  Toss an A3 in the CHoS and ur set for awhile.   With the pp u have left after selling the wind-worn you can maybe buy an upgrade or 2.<br />
<br />
Why sell the wind-worn handblade?  SotBS is a 75hp DD/stun while wind-worn is a 60 DD.  Stun &gt; DD for aggro without any doubt.  And u even get more proc/DPS (very minor but present).<br />
<br />
And those other 3 weps u listed above, are crap for warriors.  Don't let low delay weps temp you.  DPS is not a primary source of aggro for warriors... it's all about aggro procs.</div></div><hr />

Ykesha aug is worth considering instead of Anger2. Personal preference.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to comment on this.  I grouped with a SK who was using this weapon.  He was a level or two higher than me.  I was using my Fabled Executioner's Axe.  He couldn't take agro from me even though I wasn't trying to keep it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">nah he wasnt trying to take aggro. if he wanted to he wouldnt even need a weapon at all to do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nah he wasnt trying to take aggro. if he wanted to he wouldnt even need a weapon at all to do it<br />
<br />
I don't think he was trying to say the guy was trying to take it, he was trying to say that he was holding aggro with a WMBS better than another person with a Fabled EE, regardless of class.<br />
<br />
The response I have for his post is that you held aggro from an SK because they can be very low aggro if they want, unlike a rogue or something where their main mode of attack cause considerable aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I understood the oposite : the war was using a fabled exe axe and the sk was using a WMBS.<br />
which make sence since the WMBS and the FEA are aproximatly the same DPS (with an advantage to the FEA if both of them are just worn hasted) and that warrior class have a hate mod increased for DPS hate, but SK class have it decreased (parsed by Breal here SK board (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?p=263284#post263284) where SK have a mod between 0.9 and 0.8, but war's one is between 1.1 and 1.3) moreover since the war was two lvl under the sk, he should receive a bigger hate bonus (since mob always likes to screw easy target like low HP and low lvl).<br />
<br />
have fun, <br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I understood the oposite : the war was using a fabled exe axe and the sk was using a WMBS.<br />
<br />
<br />
The SK was suppose to be MT, so I assume he was trying to take agro.  I have 36% worn haste, I think he only had 21% so that could have been the difference and I was puller so there's a bit more advantage to me.  Also, there was a rogue, ranger and druid in the group...not once did they pull the mob from me.  In any case...not to de-rail this thread...I use the Droga combo with no problems at all.  Only 160 points from the Anger 2 aug :).  Going to stick that in the CHoS, should be good for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Er haste is an advantage,but, he didn't even need a weapon to take aggro off of you wielding a dps non procer.Sk was broken ...you taunted or something hehe. :)<br />
<br />
PS and yeah use the chos main until you get a better raid drop or a BOC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it's unbelievable the number of SK that don't know how to use their spellbook, or maybe that don't know their have one :). <br />
But yes if you both got no haste except the worn one (and no dex buff) then you roundly got 53 or 54% haste while he got 21%, with the lvl diff and the weapon diff and the class diff, you probably output 30% more dps and more hate than him, so if he wasn't using any proc and spell to help him generating aggro there were no chance for him to ever take aggro on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Edit n/m - no coffee yet today and still asleep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was the warrior you were playing some levels below the level of the SK?<br />
Sometimes lower-level aggro can do some strange things.<br />
Was in a group the other day with a paladin six levels below me and it was tough to keep the mobs off her. Not entirely sure she wasn't ganking my aggro, but I don't believe she was stunning the mob or anything. Seemed to me to be happening more often than lucky procs would account for, and I suspect it was a low-level aggro issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The SK was level 54.  I was 52 when we started the advent, leveled 53 on the named kill :).  He was yellow to me at both levels.  He was throwing spells, not sure if he was using taps and such, I don't know a lot about Sk's.  Anyway, probably he just didn't really know his class that well or didn't really want to tank after all.  Point being, FEA is still a decent agro weapon :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">to go with a chos<br />
<br />
do the hole weapon quest for a living sone dagger or 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">you mean cleaver isn't , the Living Stone Cleaver (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=67036) which is a very good weapon for lvl 50+ (aggro wise, since its DPS is lesser than the F.Exe.Axe.). but I think it will ge hard to hunt safely in the Hole at lvl 53, will need more than one group I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, that looks like a nice weapon.  Greagor is actaully an Alt...got a 65 EP flagged cleric (and a group of friends equally geared) so The Hole would be no problem.  I'll check that out, thanks.</div></div><hr />
