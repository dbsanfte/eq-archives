<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious to see if this XP group is viable:<br />
5 Warriors<br />
1 Cleric<br />
<br />
Have the warriors trade off MT position. The MT would pull the mob, establish agro, then go defensive (aka 40% damage reduction). The other warriors would then whittle the mob down, while the cleric keeps the current MT healed. The MT position would then switch to the next warrior in rotation, and then rinse and repeat. The only caster who could pull agro would be the cleric, and as long as the other warriors are using high DPS low agro weapons, while the MT in rotation would switch out to high agro weapons, I don't see the mob ping-ponging. By the time it comes around for the first warrior to tank in rotation, he should be able to use a new discipline. If not, the cleric gets some med time.<br />
<br />
In order for a group like this to work, the warriors would have to be a well drilled team, and the cleric would have to be aware which warrior is up in rotation.<br />
<br />
Think about this the next time you see four of your fellow class members sitting around LFG in PoTranq. I'd like to hear from anyone who tries this experiment before I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have done grps where we had a pally, 3 warriors, a mage and a necro and we did awsome. Fast kills and not much dam. taken. The necro could lay his little heal on while the pally put a little on in between. Have also done a druid and 4 melees and a SK. We did fine as well, only the SK dies twice :). I think 5 war and one cleric could do fine even with out making it this complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have done a group of 6 warriors back in the days of Kunark and it worked great.<br />
<br />
If you want to do a 5 warrior, 1 cleric group, just have the best warrior tank, have all of the warriors use their best DPS  weapons and if they pull agro a couple of rounds, no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">done a 4 warrior + 1 Paladin + 1 cleric before, worked fine.  DPS is slightly lacking, but then it's not like 4 Paladins would've been good DPS either (except on Undeads).  Like it's been said, just have your best warrior tank and everyone use DPS weapons, and you don't have to worry about overaggroing if it's another warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My favorite group is 2 warriors, paladin, bard cleric mage.    Pull 4 mobs at a time, everyone tanks one while the warriors take turns /shielding the bard while bard sings AE dot and Damage shield song.<br />
<br />
I passed every trial in PoJ with this exact group setup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Long, long time ago I was in a group of 5 warriors and 1 ranger to heal in High Keep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, I think the cleric is overkill if you're going defensive on every mob.  5 warriors and a paladin might be interesting if the pally had KEI and good FT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh awesome, 5 warriors and another class can kill exp mobs!<br />
<br />
6 or so mages on our server just killed 425 Dain the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Belwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">warroirs 1 shaman in ew a LONG time ago. it'd work in the planes but you'd have to be crazy like me, anybody here on Vazelle wanna try let me know :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Back in the pre-Kunark days when I used to go on raids in Plane of Fear, my shaman was always the caretaker of all the little rangers. Would usually be me and 4 or 5 rangers plus something else (maybe a druid or robe). We'd pretty much get every kill too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah cleric is a waste get shaman + 5 warriors, pure ownage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not sure about that &quot;cleric is a waste comment&quot;. I was just in a group that was tank heavy and the cleric rocked. <br />
<br />
pal (me), war, war, rng, shm, clr.<br />
<br />
We would generally get multiples and split tank them, with up to 2 mobs per tank. Divine arbitration and group CH is a very strong combination when multiple tanks are tanking. Generally he wouldn't have to heal again until divine arb refreshed anyway. Worked very, very well. Our group's downside was low DPS.<br />
<br />
Our first real pull was I think 5 mobs and all 4 melees had a mob. One of the warriors commented &quot;this is how it's supposed to be done&quot; and I agreed.</div></div><hr />
