I wear SS and quest gear at the moment and am on par with any other warrior.....well actually much better, but its the tail, and their envious.  (iirc most of what Furor has on is WAR ALL, as such the best for iksar is whatever is best for everyone else, any perticular level you were thinking of in perticular?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate armor is just plane rare.....I have been there quite a few times and only gotten one BP, dont get me wrong I love it, and its a great CR BP, but I got Vindi otherwise.  I would suggest heading to Kael and making a mochary of the giants and getting Thurg gear.  They are about half if not less as hard as HoT, get faction, and get armor that is far far above anything an iksar warrior can use at 53 for ac and hp (no cobalt, no crusty, no FH).  I had on Jarcrap untill level 53 (with less ac then my bloody vambraces) as well, then I bit the bullet and bought Engraved Royal Velium....but was in full Thurg otherwise (we were farming for faction till we got to HoT).  Save some money and grab a Bracelet of Fortitude to offset the huge sta deficiency we have vs Barbs (10kish).  Other then that expect to spend upwards of 10-15k for full Thurg gems unless you go farming SG or something.  Overall a fulll suit of fairly decent armor for 10k is not bad at all.  I swapped in some netted kelp shoes for the 14stamina they give, least till I myself can get a bracelet of fort (killed radir 5 times, still no darn bracelet).  Definatly suggest looking at Kael gear, you can do the arena or manor (plate cycle) with a good strong two groups of 50 plus, or one good group of mixed 50 and 60.  Iksar are great, love them to pieces for RP, look, (other then I will never forgive verant for taking our swim animation from us), and play ability.  For the Empire.</div></div><hr />

Most of the warrior armor that was dropping was of the iksar warrior variety.  Didnt have a single lizard warrior on the raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually you want Stamina and Hp Gear if possible. Natural AC bonus will help you decide about taking Skyshrine vs. Kael armor.<br />
<br />
The problem for iksars is that it is going to be 100% a patchwork of items. (as was anyone who did everything up to VT in Luclin)<br />
<br />
The best is not one set. Things like Seru BP and Gaunts of Dragon Slaying and Cazic choker and Belt of Dorf Slaying and Strength of Elements and Spirit Wracked Cords. (Just to show the range of debatable items and all the weird places they can come from.<br />
<br />
(Not sure on Vex Thall upgrades, I am sure there is plenty of +125 stuff there)<br />
<br />
You honestly would have to go slot by slot and take a look at the different spots available starting with raw hps, making sure you have 41% haste, then moving to Stamina if you are challenged in that regard...<br />
<br />
AC will mostly take care of itself here as you are talking the highest-end Luclin and Velious stuff and especially if not being used on the mega-hitting PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
P.S. your question wasn't super specific. You need to discuss Level, Guild Resources, Access to Mobs, etc, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously tho, I think the point that Jak is making, is that when you get to 60+ raid level, it simply doesn't matter anymore. Thats what I think anyway, cause hes talking about gear that either I have or have considered upgrading to in the past :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakatsu</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are quite limited for gear at 53. Hate armor is very nice and the sv's are made specifically for the iksar warrior, at 60 I still use the Lego BP ( lousy luck on rolls 8( ). AC 33 +15 str, sta, dex is very hard to beat. Depending on his budget I agree with tryin to get Champs gear. Stones can get a lil costly but prices have drop quite alot recently. The best we can do is the mix and match but if you do it right you will have a very nice tank at 60.<br />

<br />
54 warrior, we are starting epics and going ok, we have killed Fey 3 times, not on any planes rotations, no VT, ToV, etc. Most we could do is thrug armor quests right now, so anything better than is droppable on things that are not boss mobs? hope that helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
He could be pulling out about 10 - 20 pieces of Plate armor from the platehouse for the amount of time it is currently taking to get ONE pristine scale.<br />
<br />
Just go to the platehouse and get outfitted. I went about 10-12 times in total with lots and lots of people and managed to get everything but arms over that span with open rolls. <br />
<br />
That armor will be fine for you until you are high enough to tank in the Halls of Testing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayash</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can buy the scales reasonably often in the bazaar (at least on Bertox), prices range from 3k-6k (and the occasional nutter trying for 10k+). <br />
<br />
To get the money friends of mine farmed Tae Ew bloods vials at the zone in (yes he is high enough to xp there in a group).<br />
<br />
Bloods sell readily for1.2-1.5k (i'm a GM smith and prices have dropped alot but for 1.2k they would sell very fast) and you can 10-15 per night at the current drops rates. 1-2 weeks farming there would net some decent xp and quite a bit of cash. <br />
<br />
If you know a GM smith you could also get some nice Tae Ew Chain tunics for the rogues, shammy's and rangers in your guild (personally i charge 2k for a successful combine on these - and the tunic is awesome)<br />
<br />
On Bertox (my only basis for price comparison) MQ thurg legs sell for 5-9k and BPs 14-20k, and are pretty easy to find. You could buy these after a few nights of farming in CT.</div></div><hr />

Tae Ew plate greaves are teh win.  They are 8ac less than rallos zek cultural legs, but have more stam and hp.<br />
I was lucky enough that a friend of mine who is a GM smith had 8 scales in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check my magelo, I'm all pre-pop armor, cept for rangeslot.<br />
<br />
Iksar Progression probably changed a bit since I went through it... For me it was Banded, Cabilis Scale, then they added Trooper Scale right when I needed it, then they added Legionierre Scale right when I got planer level, then SoV came out and PoG/Thurg was very nice.<br />
<br />
However, new Plane of Hate is live today, so.... Legionierre Scale may be changed, I haven't looked at the new Plane of Hate.<br />
<br />
I heard PoG has the Protectors fixed, which scares off people.<br />
<br />
We have racial crafted, Fearsome Skyiron Coat AC: +30 Str: +10 Sta: +5 Wis: +5 HP: +40 Mana: +40 ... much better for shammies then for warriors, really.<br />
<br />
Someone already mention Barbed Ringmail Tunic, off Tpos Icepaw in Top Dogs in Velks. At 53 I don't think you could really camp it yourself, but could buy it or try and convince your guild that's someplace they'd like to kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
But all in all, I'd suggest Tormax Ramp or Plate House in Kael. Check my magelo below, I'm still wearing that BP at 65. The plate restriction goes away with SoV+ armor sets, really. Cept for wishing for Cobalt Legs or maybe the Bracer, the No Plate rules are over with for you, really.<br />
