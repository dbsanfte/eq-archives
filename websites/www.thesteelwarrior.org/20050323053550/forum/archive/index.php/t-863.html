<br />
You all remember the Halls of Honor &quot;nerf&quot; they implemented?<br />
<br />
There was so much controvesy over bards pulling the whole zone and then they made mobs summon.<br />
<br />
After lots of more complaints, they changed it again to this time, if an individual aggroes more than 4 mobs (I think it's 4 mobs) they gate back to thier original spots of something like that.<br />
<br />
Now the designers of this &quot;nerf&quot; brilliantly did not figure out that it would also work on the trial mobs. Those who know this trial, we are suppose to kill mobs that pop and don't let them kill any of the trigger &quot;npc&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, thanks to &quot;nerf&quot; those mobs gate. Eventually the mobs killed the trigger NPCs to continue the trial had it was blown.<br />
<br />
How dumb can they get. With this, this trial can't be done properly. They better fix this soon or no one can pass the trial and zone into Mithaneal Marr's zone.<br />
<br />
Good job on thier part. It was really frustrating.<br />

<br />
did i miss a patch somewhere between then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Finally my guild isn't the only guild having the same problem.<br />
<br />
How in the world did your guilds make through it?<br />
<br />
We had mobs gating not when they were low on health but at 90% health and they suddenly dissapear.<br />
<br />
Tiring trial and a pure waste of time for my guild.<br />

Do you guys Kite Rooms 2/3 or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too many aggro and go for 1 person = warp/gate = despawned crazed norrathian = blown trial.  I don't really feel that's an acceptable fix. It doesn't much matter how skilled or well-equipped you are. Any guild that actually needs these flags is likely to experience trial blowage due to poor design rather than their own actual mistakes or shortcomings.<br />
<br />
I know they wanted to fix the HUGE problem (note: sarcasm) of bards kiting the whole abandoned piece of crap HoH zone in between guilds doing the trials, but come on...<br />
<br />
This change has very little to zero effect on my guild. We've backflagged this trial many, many times in the past.  As unpopular as randomly summoning mobs was with HOH soloers, it was a FAR better &quot;fix&quot; than this poorly thought out change.</div></div><hr />

Half the time I end up kiting a bunch duo with a bard and I'v e never seen problems with it.</div></div><hr />

Guilds that have progressed further would probably have slightly better gear and therefore stay over 40% HP easier, while newer guilds would not be able to do that as easily.</div></div><hr />
