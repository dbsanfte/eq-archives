I really haven't played since PoP came out, RL reasons coming back now and was wondering where I would stand when it comes to tanking PoP mobs. Not guilded so can't go kill some big mob for an upgrade, have about 23kish in cash and can dump some twinks for 15-20k more. Any suggestions would be great. Oh and the magelo hp/ac/atk are all correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'll be fine in PoP.  You'll share the problem we all face, but I don't see any glaring holes in your magelo compared to other Wars in tier 1 planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually it says &quot;Magelo Link&quot; :P<br />
<br />
The only upgrade I can think of would be Myrmidon's Gauntlets instead of Warlord's and a Windblade or War Marshall's Bladed Staff instead of the Flamberge for DPS.<br />
<br />
You should have no trouble tanking trash mobs in Teir 1 and 2 but named would be a lot harder.<br />
<br />
Right now, however, levels will do you more good than anything else. Your gear is already amazing, the main hindrance on your tanking abilities now is your level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only thing I would suggest is trying to get a FG or SBoL to replace the Katana of Pain, and that's strictly for Aggro/DPS purposes, but that might stretch you pretty thin as far as money goes.<br />
<br />
What you have right now looks fine, but this would be a step up in the Aggro/DPS department.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kinolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A few things I want to hit on with your suggestions,  please correct me if I'm off since I have been away from the game for awhile.<br />
<br />
I'm on KT/Rif/Zek faction max ally or near to each so switching factions for SS guants wouldn't be worth the time and effort I'd have to put into it.<br />
<br />
In reguards with what Timrum wrote...isn't HP more important then AC on PoP mobs within reason?  I mean, if you have over 1200ac shouldn't you look more at the HP of an item?  The neg ac on my hoop doesn't really effect my AC all that much.  Just means I'd have over 1300ac but would lose a bit of hp, same thing goes for the mask.<br />
<br />
And the only reason why I won't spend the cash for a Windblade cause the 2hs I have is pretty decent and I didn't have to pay anything to get it.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, what's a FG and SBoL?  Like I said, it's been awhile since I've played.  Btw, I love the sta on the katana so I'd only replace with something that is far supierior to it.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for all your input and look forward to reading your further input on this matter.</div></div><hr />
