<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note I am not saying everything  I am going to mention should be implemented for there to be balance, they are just some ideas for ways to improve the class. I do not mention monks or rogues at all here, but I am sure ideas along this line of thinking would benefit them as well. I am sure some of these have been said before, but what the hell.<br />
<br />
I think the way warriors are designed currently are very hard to fix because they bring so little to the table. I think SOE has really backed themselves into a corner here. Even if you gave warriors the same aggro control as knights while I feel they would be more desiarable than they currently are I would still take the knights utility in exp groups with my other class because they can tank fine and have aggro lock as is, as well as a lot of beneficial spells (those who diminish it bugger off, yes you might not get a group slot for one ability, but all the abilities combined make you more attractive for the tanking slot).<br />
<br />
I think we need more excitement to the class, a little more utility, as well as some improvements on our current tankability. <br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro:-  Make a skill that allows a warrior to use the effect of the weapon when he chooses, for up to twice a minute (or different timers per weapon). Remove the RNG of procs. Maybe add an AA where you can get more times per minute to use the effect.  It would be nice to be the master of your weapon, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DPS:- Our 2hdps is fine, our 1hdps needs to be brought up to par. Upgrade dual wield to do as much/maybe more dps than 2handers  (should be a bonus for taking more ripostes).  Ideas would be the offhand going off for more/everytime. Or maybe add a bigger damage bonus for 1handers, and add it to the offhand as well.<br />
<br />
Give us more diverse skills that benefit the group, pure mellee skills. I would like the mob I am hitting to really feel the asswhooping in other ways than just direct damage.<br />
<br />
Examples:- <br />
<br />
Armor break/Guard break<br />
<br />
Make the mob more susceptible to mellee and/or caster attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ankle Crush:-<br />
<br />
If the mob has legs it weakens their running speed as well as removing its kick ability if it has one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stunning Blow:-<br />
<br />
Upgrade stuns warriors have and add the duration of the stun just a bit to migitate and interrupt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disciplines:-<br />
<br />
Change the mana bar into a stamina/discipline bar and base current disciplines off that, or reduce their timers, or put them on seperate timers per discipline<br />
<br />
<br />
Just some random ideas I have been throwing around</div></div><hr />
