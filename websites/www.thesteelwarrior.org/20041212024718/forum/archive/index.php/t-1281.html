<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've seen a lot of threads about warrior aggro issues (completely understandable).<br />
<br />
In your opinion, is it worth starting a heavily moderated thread to come up with a suggestion or suggestions to fix it, that you could forward to Sony?  I mean, for those who have a problem.  I appreciate that many high end warriors, and those too low to be in PoP yet might not need major attention.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of something where you'd strictly filter out suggestions that warriors should get huge innate hp and AC bonuses, or be made intrinsically first choice tanks over knights, or all warr weapons should proc innate stuns, or 100% taunt success rates.<br />
<br />
This being on the theory that offering suggestions for a moderate fix to solve a problem won't be binned instantly like it would be if it was taken as an opportunity to ask for class balance to be overturned.  (A la Absor asking for balanced druid suggestions on group roles and ditching the idea after he got a string of demands for rez slows and translocates.)<br />
<br />
As board mods, is this a good thing / bad thing for you?  What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eh...not a bad idea, but the time for throwing out ideas has passed. There are many good ideas out there, just need someone to draft a mass letter for (most) everyone to send to Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anything that could result in a reduction to the 5000 threads about paladins would be a good thing IMO.  I kinda doubt that you will find too much that everybody (or a large majority at least) is going to agree on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep good points both.<br />
<br />
I hear you on the issue of Sony not liking petitions, and remembering an incident from my server a while ago they don't go for mass form letters much either.<br />
<br />
I agree much has already been said (several times over).<br />
<br />
Maybe have some selfless volunteer (preferably not me : P) collect the more moderate suggestions and draft them up, then mods make a new thread with this summary and let people say what they think / suggest changes to see if enough people agree to put it forward?<br />
<br />
Again it would have to be a reasonably moderated thread though or will get flooded with &quot;nerf knights&quot;, wall of words and Sony bashing posts.  Nothing wrong with posting disagreement but feelings run high on this one and it wouldn't be an open discussion thread as such.  Plus it's important not to derail the thread with arguments about ideas everyone knows would be rejected out of hand by Sony.<br />
<br />
I just think if it comes via the mod/s with a consensus from the community, as a suggestion rather than a demand then Sony's response or lack of it will be thrown up in sharp relief.<br />
<br />
But I agree working up a draft is probably a good idea.<br />
<br />
Opinions anyone?  Or am I just losing it a little here?</div></div><hr />
