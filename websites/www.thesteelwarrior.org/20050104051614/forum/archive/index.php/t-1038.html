<br />
Basically, Im looking for some upgrade advice. I believe I need more STA / HP, and my AC is nearing the magic number, but even that could use some help. I am a regular player, but not really a power player, and not interested in grinding away in PoP for hours on end. I don't mind merchant mining, doing worth while quests (just completed quest for Cloak of Pernicity) and the like. Have less then 10k to spend and play on Bertox server. <br />
<br />
I have 2 of the heads for the Draconic Paulderons, need to get Wizard and Shaman heads. I have just begun Coldain ring and am tring to talk wife to assist me with the first few Sigil of Veracity earrings. Wifes char is a 57 Shaman, and we duo most of the time, so anthing that we can camp or quest would be great.<br />
<br />
From what I have seen in the past, it looks like I should lean towards the Xanths earring, and something else. I was so proud when I actually got 2 SEoS in Burning Woods, but now think I have worn them far too long.<br />
<br />
Have spent 3 aas in STR, Run3 and Combat Fury 1 thus far. Its been fun to work aa with regular xping as it gives me something to look foward to. <br />
<br />
Any weapon upgrades would be helpful, but I am more interested in gear. I am usually MA for our guild, but we dont do anything too difficult, so that is why I went with CF1 instead of ND.<br />
<br />
You are all a bunch of great guys and I'd like to leave with Iksar &gt; all.</div></div><hr />
