<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mentioned this in the big Warriors in POP thread but thought it might be worth airing in it's own thread.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get peoples opinions on this.  It might be considered controversial and it certainly runs against all conventional logic :)<br />
<br />
So anyway. It's often mentioned how Knights have been upgraded over time such that their Hp and mitigation abilities aren't terribly much worse than a warriors, that coupled with their enhanced spell selection and various AA's and other utility skills makes them far more viable classes for grouping than they were in the Kunark Dark Ages.<br />
<br />
Given this, is it still true to say that they are entirely dependant on their aggro generating ability in order to be considered for the tank spot in a group?<br />
<br />
If knights were to loose their aggro advantage, how badly impacted would their ability to find a group be?<br />
<br />
This isn't an insidious plot to get knights nerfed I'm just curious as to what others think about this - warriors, and indeed any knight visitors to this board. <br />
<br />
Thoughts please....<br />

<br />
Advantage I see for a pally:<br />
-unshakeable aggro control<br />
-can add hundreds of hp (via buffs) to all members of his party (BMB/BSS)<br />
-can add even more if no cleric (symbols/etc.)<br />
-any hp disadvantage vs. warrior FAR MORE than offset by mana pool/healing spells.<br />
-other utility spells (cures, invis undead, etc).<br />
-MASSIVE damage output potential vs. undead (hoh, etc.)<br />
-emergency heal LOH to prevent deaths<br />
-can rez if needed<br />
<br />
Summary: due to the pal mana pool, there simply isn't any warrior HP advantage, and any disparity in DPS is probably made up by the superiour selection of weapons available (we give boss mob pal/sk weapons to twinks nowdays cause they are so common).  Add in all the other stuff, I know who I'd pick for an exp grind group given &quot;equal&quot; choices...<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. VERY old arguments, I made all these points back when the primary warrior board was eqstratics.  It's only got &quot;worse&quot; since then... :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my opinion that in PoP, once a mob is slowed, Knights make perfectly acceptable tanks under all but the most severe circumstances.  Paladin fast casting heals have been upgraded considerably in PoP and LoY, and they can very acceptably assist in keeping themselves healed if the situation requires it.  Shadow Knights can life tap for pretty good numbers to also help with keeping themselves standing.<br />
<br />
There aren't really more than one or two cases that I can think of where a Warrior would really be a  better choice to tank even if aggro control was completely equal, that is if you're not raiding something requiring defensive of course.  Warriors are, by my best estimates, perhaps a half step to a step up on the total durability package over Knights these days.</div></div><hr />

If the agro advantage of SHD/PAL was eliminated, you will effectively kill the class, especially for XP groups.<br />

Right, so you would have everyone believe.  I don't agree.  The Knight aggro advantage prior to PoP was of minor significance, and Knights were tanking fine and were getting groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You absolutely sure Luna?  It's the accepted wisdom that this would be the case because thats how it's always been before but does that arguement still hold true?? What remf seems to have misunderstood is that I was hoping for people to take a step back and consider the relative strengths and weaknesses of knights and warriors disregarding the aggro control side of the equation. I don't think it's quite the open and shut case that it used to be myself, i could be wrong though.<br />

Most of the paladins in my guild are within 500 hp of the top warriors (read: all but me), they can and have tanked just about everthing we kill as well as warriors.  Our SKs are in the same range, I'm sure.  I think hybrid tanks would do just fine if they had to rely on the taunt button like us.</div></div><hr />

Sure, warriors aren't dead for XP groups as is?  maybe we could nudge over a little and let you share our coffin.  As for me, I've been playing my alts over my level 65 warrior because I'm just sick of LFG, and this whole thing doesn't make it any easier... if knight classes were killed for XP groups at least then I could welcome them to the club, misery loves company or something.<br />
<br />
(yes warriors get groups, yes they can tank alright, no they can't agro like a knight, and lazy people are teh debil)<br />
<br />
edit: if knight agro does get nerfed, I would like to see their taunt cap raised to = warrior cap... at least then we'd be on equal footing agro-wise (other then itemisation issues).</div></div><hr />

<br />
To put it another way, if aggro was equal how do people think the Tank balance would stand between each 'Tank' class?<br />
<br />
....or would people be so interested in aggro lock that ALL tank classes would be sidelined in favour of other classes that can lock aggro?<br />
<br />
Heh<br />

Oh and lets confine the arguement to basic exping against blue con mobs that don't require any classes special abilities by default....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am almost shocked that you are even debating this.  <br />
<br />
It seemed almost universally accepted in that mega-thread where you and that PAL went on and on forever that most agreed that WAR taunt couldnt equal SHD/PAL taunt or you would kill the SHD/PAL.  <br />
<br />
Ive been on the other side of the fence.  SHD/PAL could NOT get groups easy.  Dont tell me that all could, because they couldnt.  I would be in a group and most would say, &quot;OK--now all we need is a WAR...&quot;  I was viewed as additional DPS..thats it.  Not as a tank.  That perception has changed over time though and I believe that was primarily due to agro control and PoP only re-inforced that (overall though, was probably *weakened* from what it once was to what it is now).<br />
<br />
SHD/PAL agro was vastly superior to WAR even before PoP.  Hell, you can throw every one of my PoP agro spells away if I can have the agro that Disease Cloud (&quot;DC&quot;) and Shadow Vortex once generated.  You would seldom, if ever, get agro off of me.  A single cast of DC would pulls mobs across the room to hit me.  If the old agro generation spells had the same effect, Id log on to your server and prove it to you.  You would never sustain agro off of me using old, pre-PoP spells, under the old *agro rules*.<br />
<br />
I guess Im confused though.  Werent you the one bitching about so fiercely in that mega-post---that WAR taunt was *broken*?  Perhaps I have you confused with someone else, but that certainly was the overall theme of that thread, I can guarantee it.<br />
<br />
I make absolutely no conclusion is WAR taunt is broken or not.  The fact of the matter is, however, if WAR could taunt as well, you will kill the SHD/PAL for XP groups, as they automatically become 2nd rate tanks.<br />
<br />
It has absolute nothing to do with can a SHD/PAL tank fine or not.  They can.  But agro generation is really the only significant advantage SHD/PAL have over WAR.  The ability to cast spells comes with a cost.  It isnt like SHD/PAL tank 100% equal to a WAR (all things equal).<br />
<br />
Claiming that WAR taunt is broken or whatever---knock yourself out making that point.  But please dont ask for agro generation equivalent to SHD/PAL.  If you played one, you would understand.  SHD/PAL will lose respect as being tanks of XP groups, and that can only have negative ramifications overall.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question.  Im definitely not saying that the *melee* classes are balanced.  Perhaps they can increase DPS, increase defense caps--hell, I dont know.  But dont take away our agro control benefit.  I would not expect, nor ask for tanking abilities equivalent to a WAR.  As such, the only thing I can bring to the table is agro control.<br />
<br />
If you relegant SHD/PAL to DPS units, you have killed them.  Its that simple.  SHD/PAL are far from good DPS characters, which means, by extension, I now have picked a lame-duck class, as I could have been a rogue or mage or monk or whatever.<br />
<br />
We are all tanks and we are supposed to take the beating from the mob so the others can do their job.  Let the WAR be the best at taking the beating--I agree that should be the case.  But dont ask for agro control as good--you'll kill us.  <br />

<br />
Hmm, so you are absolutely convinced that the other stuff you bring to the table wouldn't be of enough use to offset our current hp/ac advantage...?<br />
<br />
Is it absolutely certain that the changes that came into effect with POP and LoY (aside from the greater need for aggro lock) didn't also boost yours and pally's groupability factor? How much was it a perception held over from kunark that 'Knights couldn't tank' ?  Has the aggro problem which caused people to rethink this preconception done enough to ensure knights will no longer be sidelined?<br />
<br />

<br />
I have to ask how we can try to improve taunt without taking it to close to comfort to your own aggro abilities. <br />
If aggro is such a 'binary' issue (you have aggro lock you tank, you don't you LFG for ages) then do we need to find a way to balance warriors with knights via a different route so all can interchangeably take the tank slot....<br />

<br />
Just wanted to point out a big misconception about SU. SU doesn't provide MASSIVE damage increases. Slay Undead 3 increases damage output by roughly 18-20% with 255 DEX. If knights are positioned where they are supposed to be in regards to damage output, they still wouldn't outdamage warriors.<br />
<br />
Warrior 100%<br />
Knight 75-80%<br />
<br />
80*1.2=96<br />

I've started to change my mind vis a vis the Knight/Warrior situation in PoP, but I wanted to clear that fallacy up regarding SU.</div></div><hr />

It should be sufficient to offset the greater aggro capabilities of the pal/sk classes .<br />
<br />
 It should be a very very hard decision between war and pal/sk , but currently it is not because they are 90% of our hps/tanking , but infinitly better at aggro.<br />
<br />
Currently if you have a group and your considering a war or pal , no one can notice the warrior tanking better , because the difference is quite small . Everyone , however notices that hey are getting whacked a lot more while the warrior tries to attain aggro versus the paladin who can get aggro so much faster.<br />

<br />
You guys can knock yourselves out debating how the melee classes are unbalanced or whatever.  I make no conclusion about that.  Agro control is really the only thing I can cling to as being good at.<br />
<br />
From an SHD point of view...<br />
<br />
I can assure you that there are few classes that are more *worthless* at a raid then a SHD.  Our main benefit that I have seen is TMing mobs, say like on EMP kill, yard trash in VT or PoP, etc.  Thats pretty much it; we are additional DPS units.  Tank rotations, especially against PoP mobs, seldom, if ever, include a SHD as MT (makes sense though).  Our agro buff, while nice, surely isnt something that holds a raid up.  Anyone who claims that SHD are desired at raids because of that buff is either selling something else or lying.<br />
<br />
From an XP group point of view, the only real significant thing I bring is agro control.  If that was rested from me, Id be a lame duck, bringing nothing to the XP group at all, save for DPS.  That means, by extension, you killed the SHD class.  I should have played a different class if I only bring DPS to the group.<br />
<br />
Their has to be an advantage of playing a SHD.  If I had no agro control, Im dead--I should have played a WAR then I guess...<br />

Agree 100% that that could be a viable solution (to increase the tankability of WAR over a SHD/PAL).  I personally would not have too much issue with that at all.<br />

<br />
Wow, I want to scream at this - but won't.  It took 6 months after the release of SoL for people to start saying - wow Knights can tank in a pinch.  Up until that point I would spend hours LFG in places such as Velks, KC, all over Luclin, without a nibble.  Yes, PoP changed the rules - People finally started noticing that a Paladin could get aggro whenever we wanted - always had been able to as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
So yes, warrior's need some help in the aggro department.  Knights probably need to be knocked down some especially cease and desist - but we should not be equal.  I know I have argued this with Glatius on PoN - Paladins never were invited to a group for our utililty.  We do have a greater spell selection due to PoP - but so does every spell casting class.  I am all for all three tank classes being equal.<br />
<br />
Before PoP was released, one idea on PoN to make us more desireable on raids/xp grinds was a /shield ability - guess where that idea went.  And we would have been happy with it.  With the way PoP functions, it turns out we did not need more abilities - just a use for our ever present ability to generate aggro fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets break this down a bit.<br />
<br />
Lets say warriors are 100 at tanking , where do paly/sk fit in next to us? 85-90% as good at tanking?  Im gonna say 87.5%<br />
<br />
Lets say paly/sk are 100 at aggro control, where do war fit in here 50-60%?  Lets say 65 % .<br />
<br />
lets say paly/sk are 100 at other skills/spells where do warrior fit in here well , warrior have ..... defensive , paly/sk have too many for me to start to list. Im gonna peg warriors at 25% here.<br />
<br />
So if i add things up..  warrior :  100+65+25 = 190<br />
                                   Pal/SK  :  87.5 + 100 + 100 = 287.5<br />
<br />
I realize that these 3 catagories may be weighted differently but i think the disparity remains.<br />
<br />
So without giveing warriors spell , or nerfing pal/sk aggro management , the easiest solution i can see is to raise warrior tanking ability .  The amount it needs to be raised i will leave open to debate.<br />

Agree 100% Mofu.  I would have no problem if they increased (but not to an insane level) a WAR tanking ability to offset the advantage that SHD/PAL currently have over them (although Im not certain that its as big as everyone believes it to be).<br />
<br />
They should be equal at the end of the day.  But agro control should remain in the court of SHD/PAL--no question about it (all other things equal).<br />

<br />
And you admit that in Luclin that changed, people began to recognize a Paladin's ability to tank.  And godlike aggro generation wasn't the primary reason, was it?  It was that they could in fact tank.   PoP and LoY has improved their tanking ability even further by giving them additional spells, fast heals, and fast mana cheap stuns.  They're quite capable of assisting with their own healing or helping to heal the group/others.  Add to this they do have other utility they can use while tanking.  Warriors do not.  Granted all this additional ability requires mana, but that is much less of a handicap than ever before.<br />
<br />
So with all this on the table you would also argue that it is required that Paladins maintain a huge aggro control advantage over Warriors just to stay competative?  Otherwise no one will ever use a Paladin tank again?  Sorry, no sale.  I don't buy it.  I believe you believe it, but I don't.  Paladins have come too far and are too effective for that.  It makes no sense to me that Warriors must be at a pronounced disadvantage in order for Paladins to be competative.  There must be a middle ground, if you're just willing to accept the possibility.</div></div><hr />

Paladins level quite slowly because of their hybrid penalty, but more than make up for this in their excellent balance as a character at higher levels. They are well suited to a player with the patience to level them up, and provide good offense, defense, healing and buffs. They have the least downtime of any hybrid class, and are often the last to fall in a drawn out battle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
The warrior is the definition of the tank class in Everquest.  They have high hitpoints, a high armour class, and deliver somewhat impressive damage with their weapons.  They can dual wield, single wield, bash, slam, kick, and taunt.  They can parry, riposte, double attack, disarm and dodge.  <br />
<br />
Warriors functions in groups are not primarily to deal damage.  They are generally the tanks of the group.  Absorbing the damage from mobs as they lead them to the party.  Warriors must also be adept at watching who the mob is attacking and attracting the mobs attention so that the lighter armoured party members do not take excessive damage.<br />
<br />
&lt;==================&gt;<br />
<br />
Everyone with any sense of reasoning, can see that paladins were not made to be the end of aggr management, it was supposed to be a DETRIMENT.. So from a class design point, Paladins should not be affected at all by removing aggro from their spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perception is far more important than reality when it comes to getting group invites.  I have a 57 mage alt.  With my mage, I can add awesome DPS, summon many usefull items, including rods to aid in mana regen, can pet mez if needed, and have an awesome resist debuff that is low agro.  Finding a group with my mage is almost as hard as finding a group with my warrior.  Mages are perceived as a solo class.  So even tho a mage is an awesome group class, the perception far outways the reality.<br />
<br />
If knights lost their edge in agro, the perception would be that they are now not desirable tanks.  Warriors have more hp's, more mitigation and potentially handy discs.  Warriors also do more DPS.  Knights would end up in the same boat we are in now...acceptable as a last alternative.  The reality would be that they can talk almost as well as us, and their utility should make up for it.  SK's could still FD pull, snare, mana tap.  Pallies could still buff, group heal, etc.  I think that the classes would actually be balanced in raw, non subjective(if that is possible) terms, but the outcome would be unbalanced.<br />
<br />
I want to add quickly that these are opinions only, and that is is very hard to predict what such a change would in fact cause.  I am guessing.  Please be gentle with me as you tell me how wrong I am.  I am also making the assumption(dangerous to do) that when you say loose their agro advantage, you are doing it in a way that does not take actual spells away from them(except maybe the pure hate SK spells).</div></div><hr />

Because aggro is the greatest reprocussion besides mana that the designers came up with. Its hardcoded into basic design of the game.<br />

Anyway theres something i never realised which is that lvl 64 and above pallys have a self buff aura of crusader which adds 340 hitpoints and which stacks with virtue and BSS. so really, the actual difference at the high end game in hitpoints diminishes even further.<br />
<br />
I would never advocate a nerf of another class but given that we sacrifice any utility whatsoever to perform one job - and this is a separate issue from the aggro control one, then we should i believe have a significant difference in hps/mitigation.</div></div><hr />

Pleas if you quote something I wrote, understand it.  I did say that Knights were starting to be viewed as tanks in a pinch - in other words we could do if a warrior was not around.  Before then, I was getting passed up for groups &quot;waiting&quot; on a warrior.  Kind of like it is today but on the other foot.<br />
<br />
And secondly, I never said Knights should maintain the huge aggro advantage - what I did say <br />
<br />
So yes, warrior's need some help in the aggro department. Knights probably need to be knocked down some especially cease and desist - but we should not be equal. <br />
<br />
I also maintain that all three classes should be equally desirable as a tank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me be frank. As a paladin aggro is the ONLY reason a paladin gets a group over warriors. Our heals don't matter our buffs don't matter none of our spells are the reason we get a group except our stuns which translate into aggro. Now if you were to give warriors a huge aggro boost to the point they would not loose aggro to any class....even if you just made it where they would only loose it to a paladin or SK who wants aggro you simply break the grouping Paladin/Sk into obscurity. You make warriors be able to hold aggro over incoming heals and slows and you will not see a single paladin get a group unless there are 0 warriors LFG or in a group of friends. Heck at least if you arent gonna be picked up for tanking you might get picked up as a semi decent DPS person. A paladin who has no xp role is moved behind about 9-10 class's or more in the DPS line and thus will never be picked up as a semi decent dps maker. Right now it is EXACTLY where it should be. Paladin/SK should 100% be the choice in a xp group. Why? I will tell you why. Warriors have a raid role and paladins do not they are just extra bodies. Paladins have an XP group role and warriors are just an extra body. If you want to take away paladins group role how would you feel if they took away your raid role (defensive) and gave it to paladins/SK? The other thing is if you increase a warriors aggro abilities you also make many of the hard encounters MUCH easier to handle. Memblurr mob in air? No sweat at all if you had aggro like a paladin AND defensive with which to deal with its quad 2054. At this time you would have to make a choice on that mob. aggro or defensive. 99.9% of uberguilds choose the defensive and to deal with the aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This statement fascinates me, because it's one of the more common knight concerns.  I'm perplexed because quite possibly the other most common knight statement I see is this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights have always had an aggro advantage over warriors from day 1&quot;<br />
<br />
So here I sit totally perplexed about what exactly was the issue in Kunark/Early Velious then?  If knights' desirability is solely focused around aggro and they've always had an extreme aggro advantage, including during Kunark, then why were they so undesirable during Kunark as compared to now?   <br />
<br />
Also, this &quot;no raid role&quot; thing is just plain silly.  Sk's have significantly less of a raid role than Paladins (unless they have HT disc/AA, then they can be an enormous source of burst damage), as a matter of fact, Paladins are damn near a requirement on raid level encounters in PoP, not just one, but many.   <br />
<br />
Finally, I'd like to know exactly which raid level encounters would be 'trivialized&quot; by warriors having solid aggro generation?   Which raid level encounters in PoP are single-target encounters w/o AE's or adds or procs (i.e. primarily melee) which also have the additional challenge of squirrelly aggro, where the focusing of aggro on a warrior is the biggest challenge?   If you can name a few, I'd be very interested.    SOE has actually changed most encounters so that there's more to them than the MT/CH Rotation strategy as their primary challenge, there's now timed events, multiple adds spawning mid-fight, and so on and so forth, where the challenge is in the overall encounter and NOT necessarily in keeping aggro on the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me spell it out for you because it seems like you need it. pallys have very useful utility to a group, which warriors just do not have. even if warriors had better aggro generation, this would not make pallys less desirable.Its been spelt out before and ill spell it out again - <br />
<br />
1. even if they change warrior aggro, we will never be able to maintain aggro as well as pallys, unless you guys get hit with the major nerf bat so you will always be preferred for solid aggro control <br />
2. hp/ac difference - not really much in it and i think this is pretty much accepted, nuff said.<br />
3. Pallys bring rez ability, buff ability, group heals, heals, LoH, Crowd control via root parking and a few others. You should know that by now? you are a pally aren't you? So your DPS is not great - you think average warriors put out a lot of DPS? groups dont take pallys, warriors and SKs for the DPS we put out, they take us to tank. simple.<br />
4. Raids - You ever been on high end raids recently? Dont you realise how useful pallys are? Most encounters these days, whether Ntov, luclin or pop have some form of AoE. Clerics are busy healing the MT, so guess whose the only one left for group heal purposes? Pallys also make good rampage tanks.<br />
<br />
ANyway, hope you manage to take that all in aldarian. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. If not, thanks for stopping by and please drive through.</div></div><hr />

90% of XP mobs in pop are perfectly stunable, even Giants in BoT, mobs in the Elemental Planes, mobs in Valor, Mobs here, mobs there<br />

<br />
See, this is were you have a fundamental flaw in your logic.  Your spells do matter.  The reason they matter is because they are what help to make you a functional tank.  If they took every spell except for stuns out of the Paladin spell book, how good a tank would they really be?  How functional would the class be?<br />
<br />
Stuns are only a single faucet of the Paladin class.  They are not the sole or even the primary reason Paladins make good tanks.  Clerics have stuns, they make lousy tanks.  Enchanters have stuns, they make even worse tanks.  Aggro control alone, does not make a tank.  Paladin stuns are what is currently making Paladins the superior tank, because aggro control, which they've always had and no one has really cared about, got really important in PoP.<br />
<br />
This was not an intended 'feature' designed into the game with PoP to make the Paladin a superior tank.  It was an unforseen side effect of the massive DPS added to PoP mobs so that they could lower their HP and still have the mobs be challenging.  They wanted fights to be shorter because people were annoyed with Luclin mobs where they had to beat on them for three days to make them go dead.<br />
<br />
Adding the extremely high DPS to PoP mobs made aggro control that much more imperative.  And Paladins benefited.  But this was not intentional and it is not something that must be the case for the Paladin class to thrive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is one thing nobody seem to realize, <br />
<br />
lets say next patch i cant use my spells anymore to get some agro.<br />
<br />
well.... How the hell do i get agro ...<br />
<br />
warrior usually have weapons with agro procs and have dual wield to get agro, paladin ( and sk ) use slow 2hander with no agro proc usually so they dont get agro on raids and such.<br />
<br />
beside weapons with agro procs dont go to pal, sk they go to warrior for raid purpose, so what if i cant get agro with spells , i need a blade of war now to keep agro ... unrealistic, that weapon will go to a warrior ( and should go to a war also  )<br />
<br />
so now i cant hold agro at all, actually much worse than a warrior, so now not only is the warrior better at tanking but he is also much better at keeping agro. i am now useless.<br />
<br />
oh ya i got heals and loh and group buff , right. well if i have a shm/druid/cleric in my group healing me i am 99% of the time FM in a xp group ,a good xp group wont need my heals, or  loh for that matter. granted they can help if thinks go bad but ppl dont make xp group thinking things will go bad.<br />
<br />
anyway just wanted to raise that point, if i cant get agro withg my spells tomorrow i am now way worse than a warrior both at agro and at tanking.<br />

<br />
besides, its never likely to happen. if they ever get down to changing things, which imo is not likely, and theydecide to do it via a nerf bat to pallys, then the most obvious solution would be to adjust it so that only your higher level stuns have any effect. so you would still have aggro control, but there would be associated downtime because you run oom faster, which never happens currently. <br />
<br />
besides, last time i grouped with a pally who had goldenrod, he had to put it away because it was getting so much aggro, so its not that there arent aggro generating weapons for pallys/sks.<br />
<br />
anyway this is all pure hypothesy and i very much doubt will ever happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ink kunark/velious groups could care less about aggro.  The mobs did not hit hard enough to worry about a tank loosing it until aggro was re-established.  On the flip side, there was a larger difference in Warrior - Knight mitigation and even though we could always get aggro, healers were furious when we did because they had to work much harder.<br />
<br />
And for all of those saying Paladins get utility - great we do, but back Pre-SoL it never helped us get groups.  Why would it be any different now?  We bring less DPS then a warrior - warriors dont get groups for dps since groups want to kill faster.  Killing faster means filling slots with healer (we cannot be primary), slower, tank, and 3 damage dealers.  If it is not effective now to have an extra tank who deals low damage (warrior), why would groups pick up a paladin if a warrior was tanking?  Druids/Clerics can handle the healing by themselves.</div></div><hr />

I think it would be better to make spells that have ZERO chance to affect a mob in any way (immune due to level or whatever) create ZERO aggro.. then a pallie or SK would actually have to use some meaningful amount of mana to hold aggro 100%... which makes sense.. It woudl not in any way hinder their ability to hold mana... except make it actually cost them some mana. Cease and Desist pissing off lev 65 mobs is akin to a fly pissing someone off for the potential for biting em when it splats on their car windsheild. It just should not happen.<br />
<br />
I think the best solution is to actually give warriors a definate AC and HP advantage again... as of now... there is at best on average in my experience a 500HP difference in equivalent gear and AA between a knight and a warrior, and the knight usually actually will have more AC.... In other words... undefensive tankability differences are so negligable as to be unnoticeable.<br />

On a side note.. since I cannot seem to ever be able to create or get a group anymore outside my guild (and play alot during &quot;off hours&quot;).... my Gar is now 37 with laughable play time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladin/SK should 100% be the choice in a xp group. Why? I will tell you why. Warriors have a raid role <br />
<br />
Next time I hear some one say we are balanced becuase we have an important place in raids I will fucking scream.   Pardon my language, but that attitude just burns my ass.  I play a warrior because it is the class I enjoy most.  I do not want to have to play an alt(god knows I have to many) untill raid time because that is the only  role we have.  Balance has to exist in exp groups, and in raids.  They are to seperate environments.<br />
<br />
Now back to our regularly scheduled program.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what is the trade off that allows any class the ability to aggro lock a mob to be 'balanced' vs. the game (as distinct from balancing between classes)? Is it in fact not balanced but SoE simply cannot think of a way out that doesn't penalise knights too heavily? <br />
<br />
I think you hit the nail on the head there.  The ability to agro lock(and to be fair it is not total agro lock, my shaman alt can pull agro off anyone if I try) is to my mind unbalancing.  I have met 65 enchanters, with tons of AA's who still have not learned basic grouping skills.  You know it is coming when they find out it is a warrior tank and they start right in with warriors cannot tank, they have no agro...they suck.  Then they proceed to act like an idiot, tash before I even have attack on, get agro, run around like an idiot...knights allow these people to get where they are.  There solution to not learning to skillfully play there class is to blame warriors, and only group with knights.<br />
<br />
If knights did not have agro lock,  with the current state of the game, I do think it would reduce them to the point warriors are at now...last choice for an exp group tank.  I agree that part of the reason SoE has not made any tank balancing efforts recently, and has let the problem get as bad as it is is due to exactly what you said.  How do you fix the problem without increasing mudflation, without reducing knight group desirability too far, without breaking the game further than it already is?  I know I do not have any good answers.  I know also that I hope to god they do something  soon tho.</div></div><hr />

Hey yes that last one works on 65 mobs.. Guess what level boss mobs (mostly) are... Level 66+!<br />

I think I missed a few, whatever that 1hb is in BoT...<br />

So I guess they probably need to gauge tyhe average knights mana pool and decide on a more appropriate mana cost for knight stuns. Also.. dont knights have a mana penalty being hybrids? Either way... 65 mana is still alot better then 15... shit... kei will regen 15 mana in between chain casts.....<br />
<br />
Also.. the bigest problem with the low level stuns is he has two.. can alternate between them and chain cast them....<br />
<br />
So.. lets recap.. as it stands... all low level stuns plus their high level one can and do cause ALOT of aggro.. are low mana and can be used to chain cast stuns....<br />
<br />
If changed so low level ones were useless for aggro as they are being used: Only one stun.. with 12 tick refresh..... that might actually stun a mob... still a lotta aggro.. but now it costs em 65 mana plus mana for whatever other real spell they are going to use to lock aggro (as was mentioned above... stuns arent the only thing.. they are being exploited due to low mana cost and refresh times).<br />
<br />
Anyhow.. I still advocate higher AC and HP disparity between all Kights and Warriors will be the better of the two above solutuons I mentioned.</div></div><hr />

It is not a statement I like to make... but it is the truth... and a VERY large gripe on part of most/all warriors.. we are slaves to the RNG just to attempt to do the one thing our class is actually supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Anyway... I still think the best solution is to increase the AC and HPs diff between warriors and knights significantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE can't give warriors the best aggro ability in the game, it imbalances raid encounters, and puts knights out of a job.<br />
<br />
SoE can't take away aggro lock by knights, it is the only thing we bring to the table on raids.<br />
<br />
What SoE can and should do, is make a warrior's taunt button more effective, or give warriors a special skill that gives them a small aggro head start at the beginning of an encounter.  But...both of these improvements would be disabled while a warr is defensive.<br />
<br />
This solution would put warriors on equal footing with knights as xp group tanks, without changing the raid game at all.  That is really the outcome we should all be striving for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the one guy/gal that quoted castersrelm on the pally and warriors who died and made castersrelm the officiall SoE stance on what classes do? as far as I can remember castersrelm is not assosiated with SoE and only gives there explination of things.<br />
<br />
I couldent tell you what the fix is but i can tell you taking knight aggro away wont be as bad as knights seem to make it to be but to do that you would have to remove spell aggro across the board cause just taking awya stun aggro on immune mobs wont d much as flash of light and sk spells (dont play a sk so can't say) still can be used and guess what FoL is level 9 hehe<br />
<br />
I guess all I would suggest to help balance the dasparity a little is make warriors midigate better then knights and add some hp's (although with wars being able to break 10k buffed grabted not to many can but there still are some that can I am not sure if adding hp's would do much other then make the mid level warriors happy and there is already a decent hp gap between mid level wars and knights iirc)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why exactly would giving a warrior more HP and AC imbalance a raid... I do not believe this to be true whatsoever... most mobs where it matters over a certain threshhold would still be able to one round most warriors even with an additional 1K ac and 2K HPs, hell.... the new Maestro in Hate is capable of putting out 10120 HP of damage in ONE ROUND., 6K of it healing himself... and hes not anything near most of the other t3+ planar bosses.<br />
<br />
The average level 65 warrior probably has right around 5-6K HPs unbuffed if he/she has done his/her AA abilities, the very top end tanks have just over 7K hps with one of the best (if not the best) being 7900 (Furor). So... say avg raid buffs equal +2300 (or so.. depends on buffs and what resists ya need, etc), so.... this makes most warriors raid buffed in the 7300-8300 range.... still well within the realm of being one rounded by Mr. punk Maestro of Rancor. add another 2K hps on it... 9300-10300, and you still would at best get to a level that DI would have to pop, but more than likely can still be one rounded. Whats this give Furor for HPs... 10200 or so before and 12200 after.... would not meaningfully change that fight for him either. With defensive, Maestro is capable of 8060HP of dmg since defensive would NOT halve the dmg from the lifetaps.. (actually more damage since 8060 is using 50% savings on defensive.. which we know is overly optimistic).<br />
<br />
Now lets look at AC... avg war at 65... well.. this varies a hell of alot... pre pop.. anything over about 1300 is wasted... post POP.. you need increments of about 1K ac to see a very little return... so I think they could give warriors 2K ac and not see much of a change in PoP encounters... but 1K is more reasonable (there is a HUGE thread here with parses if ya wanna peruse this info yerselves).<br />
So mostly AC value is eyecandy for the tank after a certain amount except very large increments.<br />
<br />
Now.. if we do NOT add HP and AC to the warriors... you think most knights would like reducing their AC and HPs... there has to be a gap.... and I hate to call for the nerf bat... which is why I dont advoicate either of the routes proposed above as solutions and thing the best solution is to further mudflate in a way that wont meaningfully change most boss mob encounters but make warriors just as viable as Knights for a slot in the XP group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I always thought cease and desist were mistakes. The mana cost and refresh time on both is too low. That being said, the reason most &lt;64 paladins use them is because they only have 1 other stun that actually does anything. Until you get 64 and get QWoS, a paladin only has 1 stun that will actually hit a mob they are xping against. When you only have 1 stun that will hit a mob, it isn't effective as either a spell interrupt or a stun to reduce damage, simply because of the recast time for stun spells. You need a minimum of 2 to be effective.<br />
<br />
My spell line up is as follows:<br />
Light of nife--&gt;1 second cast 800 hp heal (burns mana badly<br />
)<br />
Force of Akilae--&gt;quick casting stun that hits mobs up to 61?65?<br />
Cease--&gt;my pulling spell (and something has to go in that slot)<br />
QWoS--&gt;slower casting, longer duration stun, eats mana badly<br />
CC--&gt;heal over time spell, keeps up with half the damage output from a slowed PoP mob.<br />
HWoP--&gt;group heal, eats mana very quickly(good example of a well balanced spell)<br />
DA--&gt;I'm usually tank, never get to use it<br />
Root--&gt;Use it fairly frequently<br />
<br />
After gaining a couple of levels, a self buff, and another stun that actually hits xp mobs I've changed my mind about the knight/warrior relationship. I can probably tank a PoP mob better than a warrior can during the initial part of the encounter. I can stun the mob to reduce the damage I take while the mob is still unslowed. Hit it with FoA right before it gets into range and then hit it with QWoS. That is about 5-12 seconds that the mob isn't doing damage to me. As a pleasant side effect, I also gain a substantial amount of aggro. Warriors simply don't have any tool analagous to that.<br />
<br />
Paladin heals don't really make a paladin more survivable than a warrior, stuns do. Our heals are either 1)extremely mana inefficient 2)slow casting, or 3)slow to heal. Usually the only time you really need some sort of intervention in healing is when the mob is unslowed. If we are the ones tanking in that case, casting a spell that doesn't have a 1-2 second cast time can be very, very difficult. That means we can use our inefficient heal or we can use our HoT. It's the stuns gentlemen.<br />
<br />
I would like to point out that it isn't nearly as big of a problem until the paladin is level 64. That is when we get Quellious Words of Serenity and also when we get Aura of the Crusader. When I dinged 64, I got about 370 hp and greater survivability from the extra stun. Very big difference. From 61-63, warriors really do have a noticeable edge in damage absorption compared to the knights. &lt;---Keep in mind, those 2 spells are paladin only, I have no idea if there is anything analagous for SKs. <br />
<br />
Just to touch on a few points that have been brought up. Yes, knights do have utility. No, that's not why we get groups. It never has been, except for fringe cases. A group is looking for a tank, we get the nod. There has only been 1 time in the 4 or so years that I have played that I got an xp group specifically because I had heals AND could tank. I can see SKs getting groups for utility, because I've looked for SKs for my group on occasion for FD pulling and snare. I don't see that happening for paladins. You either have enough healing or you don't.</div></div><hr />

If you made stun only aggro if mob wasnt immune you'd effectivly Screw all warriors between Epic and Endgame Velious/Midgame SoL for taunt. <br />
<br />
Dont let max DPS fool yourselfs, the chance of mobs to one round a warrior is very low, if the mob is properly debuffed, and the warrior Properly buffed.<br />
<br />
A few hundred HP and 100-200 AC help immensly for increasing the likehood of a warrior to die on boss mobs..<br />
<br />
P.S What is name of Innoruks/Maestros lifetap I'm betting its only -150 or -200 MR or so (I could be wrong) so the only way your gunna get a full proc is you dont have a bard w/ your MT to jack up his resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only Tier 3 Boss that is a melee machine is Mithaniel Marr, and his proc doesnt hit the MT for full damage if you do the encounter Right...<br />
<br />
Hell I did him yesterday and was grouped with MT and could visable see our MT's HP go down in incriments of 5-40%. I dont know MM's max  Melee DPS in a single round, but I'm gunna assume its a lot, with Flurry and 2kish?? I'm gunna assume he quads, but I dont know if he does. he might only Tripple, Thats still around 10k+ max in one hit if all his melee hits for full, and it happens, It simply is so rare, that you wont see it happen w/ any degree of reguluary.<br />
<br />
P.S. I know MM gives the Rampage message, But I'm pretty sure its bugged and is a flurry.<br />
<br />
Even If I'm Delerious and he doesnt thats stilll 8kish in a single round, and I just havnt seen that happen, law of statiscial averages makes it so its very improbable. Only mobs with very high atk, (Blazzrax RZ) will you see a lot of max hits, or mobs that are extremely long fights (Xegony) will the chance of that one round happen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread took-off, that's for sure...<br />
<br />
A few random thoughts:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I was looking at the pally boards the other day and there was a discussion about HP buff stacking. Anyway theres something i never realised which is that lvl 64 and above pallys have a self buff aura of crusader which adds 340 hitpoints and which stacks with virtue and BSS. so really, the actual difference at the high end game in hitpoints diminishes even further.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, I can assure you that I believe this is utterly a terrible decision by SOE.  AoC should NOT stack with all other buffs.  Even CoL (SHD 65 self-buff) doesnt stack with BSS...All things equal, a PLD WILL have more HP then a SHD via this buff alone (which is wrong IMO).<br />
<br />
<br />
SHD mana-taps continue to be brought up as something they bring to the group...LMAO.  <br />
<br />
That is like a lvl 52 spell, and it SUCKS.  Once a SHD gets SA3, he would certainly *never* use the mana tap proc buff.  Not only is it unusable against non-spell casting mobs, SA3 doesnt work on it and SoC and MC do NOT stack.  Please, throw the *SHD bring mana-taps to the table* comment out the door...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And you admit that in Luclin that changed, people began to recognize a Paladin's ability to tank. And godlike aggro generation wasn't the primary reason, was it? It was that they could in fact tank. PoP and LoY has improved their tanking ability even further by giving them additional spells, fast heals, and fast mana cheap stuns. They're quite capable of assisting with their own healing or helping to heal the group/others. Add to this they do have other utility they can use while tanking. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this is hogwash.  SHD/PAL get groups basically due to that agro generation.  If you are unwilling to accept that, then you are blinded by your own frustrations with your class.  It has extremely little to do with these &quot;additional spells, fast heals, and fast mana cheap stuns.&quot;  It allows all the other potential agro hogging classes to be more aggressive with their spell casting and suffer the consequences less.  Only someone not a SHD/PAL would think that when you are MT for a XP group that you bring all these spells to the table.  Hell, if the mob isnt slowed, you have one hell of a time even getting these spells off.  As a SHD, I have a .5 second--yes--thats 1/2 a second--600ish DD spell and THAT gets interrupts OFTEN against unslowed mobs.  Once the mob is slowed, however, the battle is pretty much won, so the ability to cast spells at that time borders on almost irrelevant.  Agro generation is the single most important attribute that SHD/PAL bring to a group.  Make *NO* mistake about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If knights lost their edge in agro, the perception would be that they are now not desirable tanks. Warriors have more hp's, more mitigation and potentially handy discs. Warriors also do more DPS. Knights would end up in the same boat we are in now...acceptable as a last alternative&quot;<br />
<br />
Agree 100%<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;OK if we make warriors only role in the game a Raid punching bag. We all might as well just stop playing our warriors right now and roll up another class to play when we want to XP because warriors dont belong in an XP group? &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Want to talk about sad...if SHD/PAL agro generation was stripped form them, they become completely expendable, including raids.  Hell, in the example above, you *still* can be quite desired, even if its only a raid situation---a SHD/PAL without agro generation benefit would be worthless across the board, raids and otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, this &quot;no raid role&quot; thing is just plain silly. Sk's have significantly less of a raid role than Paladins (unless they have HT disc/AA, then they can be an enormous source of burst damage), as a matter of fact, Paladins are damn near a requirement on raid level encounters in PoP, not just one, but many. &quot;<br />
<br />
Agree that SHD are more worthless at raids then PAL, but BSS and a few fast heals doesnt make them a requirement at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;See, this is were you have a fundamental flaw in your logic. Your spells do matter. The reason they matter is because they are what help to make you a functional tank. If they took every spell except for stuns out of the Paladin spell book, how good a tank would they really be? How functional would the class be?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL---you can do that and the PAL would still make a terrific tank.  Its all about agro control in PoP.  I 2-box a SHD and a SHM (been playing a ENC on 2nd computer a lot also) and substantially all the time, I only focus on my AGRO generation spells on my SHD before the mob is slowed (which amounts to 2 main spells).  Slow is god in PoP.  Once the mob is slowed, the fite is just about over.  If the MT holds agro until the mob is slowed, game over.  Its all about agro control.  Once the mob is slowed, then I can tee-off on some other spells, but seldom before.  An unslowed mob is a MAJOR pain to successfully cast spells.  Before slow, its ALL about agro control.  Once the mob is slowed, however, the entire fight is almost trivialized, making our spells much less critical.  I dont understand why you are having such a hard time accepting that.<br />

A few hundred HP and 100-200 AC help immensly for increasing the likehood of a warrior to die on boss mobs.. <br />

I few hundred HP is meaningless on a mob that hits for 1030 max... avg hit in the 600s if it comes down to a few hundred HP.. then DI takes over and you live or die the next melee round.<br />

In most cases 500 AC would not make a single bit of difference in a POP  encounter, so how would 100-200 AC help? Please look at the parses done by Solinar and a few others... that horse has been ridden, beaten and made into glue already.. lets not go there again ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given this, is it still true to say that they are entirely dependant on their aggro generating ability in order to be considered for the tank spot in a group?<br />
<br />
If knights were to loose their aggro advantage, how badly impacted would their ability to find a group be?<br />
 <br />
<br />
People have gone way off topic with the usual complaints, ideas and bitches.  After a couple quick comments, I am going to try and stear it back sorta on topic by asking a couple questions of my own.<br />
<br />
Please, throw the *SHD bring mana-taps to the table* comment out the door... <br />
<br />
As one who did bring that up, I learned something new, consider it thrown out.  Sk's still bring utility in the form of snare and FD, and as I stated, I do not think that is enough to get them a group without their agro ability.<br />
<br />
 Agro generation is the single most important attribute that SHD/PAL bring to a group <br />
<br />
I think that statement is 100 % accurate.  This also kind of brings me to my questions.<br />
<br />
-if, as the original question was asked, knights lost their agro advantage, what would be needed to be added to give them enough utility to offset that?  Also, what would they need to see an increased and improved raid role(so that we get no more of the warriors are just raid tanks, knights should be exp tank line of thought)?<br />
<br />
-is there a way to balance knights and warriors to make it more desirable to have both in an exp group?  Could knight utility be upgraded in such a way that it would be advantageous to add them to a group that already had a warrior?  Could warrior DPS be upgraded enough to get them considered for a group thqat already has a knight?<br />
<br />
I really like this thread as the idea I think Valeris was going for was to look at the impact of changes to warrior/knight balancing.  If we are going to call for balancing(and god knows we do), it is a good idea to see just how it would impact the classes involved.</div></div><hr />

If a mage were to pull agro in Fungus Grove, what's a shroom going to do to him?  Hit him for maybe 200 points of damage until the MT taunts it back off.  Use the same scenario in PoP and now that exp mob just obliterated the mage for over 2000 damage in one round, pushing him to low health agro and signing his death warrant.  <br />
<br />
Maintaining agro in a standard experience situation is ever more important NOW than it has been before (minus raids).  <br />
<br />
So now we start analyzing the real difference between Knight and Warrior MT.  Warriors still reign supreme in boss mob tanking due to the fact that we have /Defensive, but most of us spend the vast majority of our EQ careers exping.  So we start comparing a Paladin to a Warrior and realize that Mr. Paladin has 600hp and 40ac less than Mr. Warrior, but Mr. Paladin can hold agro on a mob like a 14 year boy old keeps his eyes on Pamela Anderson.  Considering 600hp is but a single hit from a mob these days, who's to care about the difference when he pretty much ensures the safety of the rest of the group?  <br />
<br />
/invite Mr. Paladin<br />
<br />
And now for a second example.  It's quite obvious that you cannot exp in PoP without a slower.  Unless your cleric has an infinite manapool and is REALLY attentive, it's just not going to happen.  The entire process for PoP exp encounters is pull, tank for a couple of seconds, and slow as soon and as safely possible.  This is because the average exp mob in PoP has more dps than Jesus unslowed.  With a warrior doing that job, you have to wait 10 seconds or so (give or take) before the mob can be slowed.  This equates to, if the mob is doing 350dps unslowed and 60dps slowed, 2900 extra damage taken in 10 seconds than needed.  Paladin tanks, immedietly stuns, shaman slows on incomming.  Since PoP encounters are designed to be short and difficult, but fun, you've just avoided *THAT* much extra damage being dealt to the warrior.  Obviously, the longer the fight, the less initial advantage a Knight would have with this ability to gain snap agro, and thus this is why warriors are still king for tanking raid mobs.  But back to where 90% of what happens in EQ; exping, you tell me who exactly is the better tank?  Is the warrior who's sole ability is to tank the better tank or is the hybrid Paladin who's designed for more versitile utility actually the better tank?  In reality, he is not, but because of the way things are in PoP, Knights simply end up doing a better job.  <br />
<br />
Finalizing, I can guaruntee you that half of the online debates on class balance would not be here if PoP were just like Luclin - high hp/ac/atk but low max damage mobs.  PoP encounters are designed to be short, hard, fun, and challenging.  We always knew Shadowknights and Paladins gained agro much more quickly and effectively than warriors.  It is just now that snap agro far outweighs the difference in 600hp and 40ac.  <br />

<br />
oh yeah, really useless.<br />
<br />
you try to claim theyd be unable to get agro? THEYD BE IN THE EXACT SMAE BOAT WARRIORS ARE CURRENTLY IN, ... and yet you claim warrior agro is fine....<br />
<br />
Not exactly. A paladin/SK without any aggro associated with their spells is NOT a warrior with &quot;heals rez buffs self buffs taps and FD.&quot; If we had /shield, all the warrior discs, the hitpoint advantage warriors have, and the AAs that warriors have, then yes...we would be.<br />
<br />
I don't know about SKs, but the lower DPS, lower taunt skill, no dual wield, and lack of weapons with a taunt proc would make paladins aggro much worse than warriors if the aggro was removed from our spells.<br />
<br />
When was the last time you got a rez from a paladin?<br />
<br />
BTW, if paladin and SK spells lost all aggro, then necros, chanters, and clerics would have a field day because the aggro is associated with the spell, not the caster of said spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My position on this : in POP xp groups once a mob is slowed, there is NO difference with a warrior or a knight in damage absorbtion. There is no difference if a knight is well equiped even in raid.<br />
<br />
So at least in xp groups, warriors have :<br />
- Better damage output<br />
- the best mitigation<br />
- disciplines<br />
<br />
Paladins :<br />
- excellent aggro control<br />
- good mitigation<br />
- some backup abliities (root, stun, group heal, back heal)<br />
<br />
Shadowknights :<br />
- perfect aggro control<br />
- good mitigation<br />
- some usefull offensive spells (snare, lifetap, dots, group atk buffs...)<br />
- Pulling abilities.<br />
<br />
I think today we do not have enough things to counterbalance the advantages of the knights :<br />
Damage is irrelevant (we are NOT damage dealers). <br />
Disciplines cannot be used every time like spells are, and we cannot rely on 3 mins every 10 mins.<br />
Mitigation is irrelevant now. with the damage output of trash mobs... for any average warrior tanking an unslowed mob is becoming a mana sponge for the healer... but when pop mobs are slowed for 50% or more, even rangers can tank those...<br />
<br />
So there is 2 solutions for SOE :<br />
- put warrriors with the aggro control as knights, but it may hurt them the way some of those posters said...<br />
- Give &quot;something more&quot; to warriors, allowing us to be more powerful in another way than aggro... I don't know what, maybe some true different mitigation table, or separate disc timers, we need something. We are a class who do A, when any other class can do A+B+C.</div></div><hr />

As one who did bring that up, I learned something new, consider it thrown out. Sk's still bring utility in the form of snare and FD, and as I stated, I do not think that is enough to get them a group without their agro ability.&quot;<br />
<br />

Sorry Red if that came across as disrespectful.  Sometimes the typed words may sound far more harsh then they would if I was chatting with you say over the phone or something.  I was just laughing, becuase SHD mana-taps border on worthless at the high end.  :) <br />
<br />
&quot;if, as the original question was asked, knights lost their agro advantage, what would be needed to be added to give them enough utility to offset that? &quot;<br />
<br />
Great question Red.  I dont know the answer.  That was why I state, at the moment, SOE just cant strip SHD/PAL of the agro advantage--they'd kill us.<br />

<br />
But Knights do, Knights have every single HP increasing AA Ability that Warriors (or other melees do for that matter). This is a huge part of this issue.... the HP advantage (and AC) that warriors once had is now a MYTH... mudflation has decreased it to a point of absurdity. Warriors are the red headed step children of SoE/VI... always have been. Most of us feel that we have been nerfed by exclusion. <br />
<br />
<br />
no dual wield, and lack of weapons with a taunt proc <br />
<br />
<br />
Most Warriors use 2 handers for DPS and high end tanking anyway.  There are MANY MANY MANY more Knight only weapons available that are alot nicer then much of the selection a warrior would have. Also, just playing devils advocate here... most EB weapons are Knight usable as well.<br />

Im not going to mince words on this issue - anyone who turns down a paladin rez is a @#$%ing IDIOT.  the difference between a paladin rez and a cleric rez is less than a single kills worth of exp.<br />

There are a ton of 1hders in PoP, but 95% of them a Paladin wouldnt touch.<br />

How many times have you had your MT go to 5% or less before CH hit.....<br />

<br />
That is like a lvl 52 spell, and it SUCKS. Once a SHD gets SA3, he would certainly *never* use the mana tap proc buff. Not only is it unusable against non-spell casting mobs, SA3 doesnt work on it and SoC and MC do NOT stack. Please, throw the *SHD bring mana-taps to the table* comment out the door...<br />
...<br />
<br />
Uhh... you do play a SK, correct?  I know you've posted on the SK boards, but you are woefully uninformed, sir.  They changed Mental Corruption quite a while back.  It's not a &quot;tap&quot; anymore in the sense that it takes mana from the mob and gives it to us.  It is now a 50 DD proc (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2717)(scalable with SA), with a 100 mana recourse (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3613).  It doesn't matter in the slightest whether or not the target has mana.  This change is months old.  Our other spell that people sometimes refer to as a mana &quot;tap&quot;(Zevfeer's Bite) is even more useful.<br />
<br />
Now for something on topic... all this talk of removing spell-based aggro is kind of pointless.  SKs have an entire line of spells that do NOTHING but generate aggro.  We're supposed to be able to do that.  <br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with warriors getting a boost somewhere(be it in tanking ability or aggro generation), but leave knights alone :p</div></div><hr />

This is fairly exclusively a PoP phenomenon is it not?  It wasn't true before PoP.  It is now true with PoP.  It is your contention that for the SHD/PAL to be attractive to a group they must blow Warrior initial aggro control so far out of the water that the Warrior is clearly the third choice.  Basically you're saying that for you and people like you to participate and enjoy the game it's required that I and people like me not be able to participate on an equal footing and enjoy the game.  There can't be equality because equality would automatically equate to inferority for the SHD/PAL.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time with that premise.  You're basically saying that Warriors should be satisfied with being a raid only class and sitting the side lines or logging the rest of the time.  I don't consider that a very reasonable position.<br />
<br />
I do agree that aggro control in PoP is the most important aspect of ANY tank class.  Paladins and Shadow Knights have it, and to a great degree Warriors don't.  They can even things out by reducing Knight aggro control, increasing Warrior aggro control, giving Warriors other things that are nearly as attractive as aggro control (what those things are, I can't imagine), or they can accept that Warriors have been turned into a third rate class that will slowly whither and die except for raids.<br />

No--I never, ever, stated that SHD/PAL must &quot;blow Warrior initial aggro control so far out of the water that the Warrior is clearly the third choice&quot;--where do you get this from?  The *only* thing I am stating is that a WAR should not be able to generate agro as well as a SHD/PAL can.  If they do, SHD/PAL are dead.  Its that simple.  If they want to improve WAR in other ways to generate equality, then fine.  I dont give a shit.  But, at the moment, they *cannot* make WAR on par (or superior) with SHD/PAL in terms of agro control.  I am beginning to wonder if you are truly reading my posts to reply to them.  I dont understand why I am repeating the same thing over and over again.  I am totally in favor of equality--all I am asking for is reasonableness--agro control, at the moment, has to rest with SHD/PAL (for tank classes that is).<br />
<br />

<br />
I totally agree with this, except that they should *not* turn WAR into a 3rd rate class--clearly that is a poor decision.  I never stated that SHD/PAL and WAR were balanced--the only thing I stated was the best agro control has to lie with the SHD/PAL at the moment.<br />
<br />
LMAO Mathas---&quot;woefully uninformed&quot;  nice choice of words.  question---what self-buff do you use at 65?  It seems you have SA2, so do you use MC or SoC??  Zev's bite isn't truly a *tap*, so I purposely excluded it.  It will aid the group for mana regen though.  I only wish the re-cast was a little faster--then it would be much better (save for CoD or BoT or some other zones where its perma-resisted)<br />

Prior to PoP no one really cared that Knights could own aggro control.  It wasn't that major a factor.  Warriors were still quite competative for group slots with weak aggro control.  PoP changed that.  You've addmitted that aggro control is the MOST important aspect of tanking in PoP.

Yes, you're very protective of your aggro control, I get that.  Warriors can't have anything remotely close to it, the MOST important aspect of tanking in PoP.  Because if they actually had anything close to it, again the MOST important aspect of tanking in PoP, then no one would want a SHD/PAL.  Gotcha.  I disagree, but I see your point.  You don't want us competing in the MOST important aspect of tanking in PoP.  Anything else they do is fine, as long as you have a lock on the MOST important aspect of tanking.</div></div><hr />

I make no conclusion in terms of what is most important attribute of tanking or not.  My agreement above was meant that it plays a big role, but I very much hesitate in terms of it being the *best*  Many will immediately challenge what *is* the *most* important part.

<br />
Agro generation is the single most important attribute that SHD/PAL bring to a group. Make *NO* mistake about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its all about agro control in PoP. I 2-box a SHD and a SHM (been playing a ENC on 2nd computer a lot also) and substantially all the time, I only focus on my AGRO generation spells on my SHD before the mob is slowed (which amounts to 2 main spells). Slow is god in PoP. Once the mob is slowed, the fite is just about over. If the MT holds agro until the mob is slowed, game over. Its all about agro control. Once the mob is slowed, then I can tee-off on some other spells, but seldom before. An unslowed mob is a MAJOR pain to successfully cast spells. Before slow, its ALL about agro control. Once the mob is slowed, however, the entire fight is almost trivialized, making our spells much less critical. I dont understand why you are having such a hard time accepting that.<br />
<br />
The above quotes are why I arrived at the conclusion that you and I agreed that aggro control was the most important aspect of tanking in PoP, not however the only aspect of tanking.  Perhaps I was mistaken in that conclusion.  Perhaps what your really mean to say is that aggro control is very important for SHD/PAL and Warriors can do without it.  I would however debate that becaues of course we're seeing that Warriors are getting the shaft because of that lack on a pretty consistant basis in PoP.<br />
<br />
You want your aggro control and you don't want Warriors to have it.  You don't care what else happens as long as you maintain that position.  If you mean something else, perhaps you should explain it more clearly, I may be misunderstanding you.<br />
<br />
Now, a direct question, what would your feelings be if Warriors got something that was within spitting distance of SHD/PAL aggro control, but wasn't as powerful?  Still the same objections and feelings of complete uselessness through out the entire game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I wasnt clear, I apologize.  Im not stating that agro control *is* the single most important part of *tanking.*  That would be a different topic (and I dont believe that to be a true statement anyways)<br />
<br />
I am merely saying that a SHD/PAL bring agro control to the table as the one advantage you get from us acting as MT of a group.  That is why SHD/PAL are highly desired in groups.  It really isnt for any other reason.  If agro control was a non-factor, all things equal, no way would anyone choose a SHD/PAL in a group when a WAR was available.<br />
<br />
You stated before that I am clinging to agro control.  Yeah, you are 100% correct.  That is the *only* damn thing I got.  I mean, put yourself in my shoes.  If the agro advantage was gone, what the heck would I bring to the group?  Its the *only* thing I got, despite Aldarion's foray into certain other abilities.<br />
<br />
I dont know what the answer is.  Perhaps SHD/PAL do tank too well--or, perhaps WAR need a boost in the tanking department.  Im not sure what the answer is.  All I can assure you of, if you strip us of our ability to hold agro, I might as well /delete my character, as I am completely a 2nd rate class.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You want your aggro control and you don't want Warriors to have it. You don't care what else happens as long as you maintain that position. If you mean something else, perhaps you should explain it more clearly, I may be misunderstanding you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, you are misunderstanding me.  I never stated that I dont want WAR to have agro generation skills.  All I am saying is that it cant be as good as a SHD/PAL.  And it cant be reduced to a insignificant level either, or we are just as dead.  It would be akin to the situation right now with many WAR claim that SHD/PAL tank well enough that a WAR tanking doesnt yield a material difference.  Well, it would be the same thing here.  SHD/PAL need to maintain a material advantage on agro control over a WAR.  See comment below however.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, a direct question, what would your feelings be if Warriors got something that was within spitting distance of SHD/PAL aggro control, but wasn't as powerful? &quot;<br />

Im not sure what *spitting distance* means.  I have no objections to WAR getting a boost in the agro department, as long as there was still a material advantage (in agro control area only) to choosing a SHD/PAL to act as MT also.  I am 100% about equality.  You have to take a second and look at it from a SHD/PAL point of view.  Agro control is really all we have.  The more I think about it, perhaps WAR need to be boosted in terms of tanking so that there is a material difference when a WAR tanks vs a SHD/PAL.  I know I am probably going to get the shit beat out of me, but that is beginning to make at least some sense to me.  Boost a WAR ability to tank.  Make it a total trade-off, so groups are saying, &quot;well, we can pick good agro control or we can get *truly* a better tank.&quot;  Make the decision *hard* for groups, so that the classes are interchangable.  That, I believe, is where most of us want to end up at.<br />

It wasn't that major a factor. Warriors were still quite competative for group slots with weak aggro control. PoP changed that. You've addmitted that aggro control is the MOST important aspect of tanking in PoP. It was not the MOST important aspect of tanking prior to PoP, or Warriors would have been screwed blued and tattooed in Luclin.<br />
<br />
Don't know about other Knights, but my experience Prior to pop was that I &quot;could&quot; get groups, but warriors still demanded most of the xp tank slots.   Most being more then 50%.  To me, balance is when all tank classes have an equal shot at a group.<br />
<br />
Glatius,<br />
<br />
Both Luna and myself have clearly stated that we don't want warriors to get equal aggro.  And we have both clearly stated (well I think it was clear) that warrior's needed to be bumped up and Knights bumped down.  I have no idea where you are getting that either of us believe warrior's should be no-where near a Knight in the aggro department.  But, it would have to be balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh, Luna...First, please stop ranting, your arguments are taking it out of the focus of this thread's purpose.  Agro control has been agreed, by SEVERAL classes, to be the most important part in tanking in PoP.  It's simple common sense.  You can't control agro, your group is dead.  End of story.  Saying otherwise makes you look dumb and unknowledgeable about your own class, which I don't believe you are.<br />
<br />
Second, will everyone PLEASE STOP lumping SHD/PAL together on their capabilities other than tanking.  Paladins and Shadowknights are KNIGHTS, but they are VERY different.  I don't beleive you can even consider them similar anymore OTHER than being hybrid tanks.  I've seen NOWHERE of any words saying Paladins are designed to hold agro.  Nowhere.  Shadowknights I can give you several reasons they are designed to hold agro.  SoL made Shadowknights and Paladins into very different classes, they aren't even opposites anymore.  As such, they will not be affected the same way if they were to lose agro abilities.<br />
<br />
Luna, back when we had disease cloud and shadow vortex, we had the best agro in the game, bar none.  We had spells which costs incredibly low amounts of mana that gives unbelieveable agro.  SOE doesn't want SKs to have that strong of agro, obviously.  But now we have more control and more balance in the SK class than ever before.  Paladins however are as unbalanced in agro (and overall, I feel) as we were back then.  Stuns cost so little mana and give such huge amounts of agro that Paladins can do what people accuse warriors of...hit autoattack (after casting a couple stuns) and then go AFK until after the end of the fight.  I have personally seen paladins do this, including my own roommate, a 65 paladin.  I don't believe ANY class should have that good agro control for so little cost.<br />
<br />
The original question is, which you vehemently responded to:<br />
If knights were to lose their aggro advantage, how badly impacted would their ability to find a group be?<br />
SKs, yes, this would nearly kill their ability to find groups, if not outright kill it.  However, paladins are coming in here and saying, like I knew they would, that they bring nothing other than agro control and it would kill them.  I call BS on that.  Paladins will always downplay their abilities because they either are naive, or they KNOW they have it better than the other tank classes and don't want to be nerfed, or they're suffering from IDGStm (I-Deserve-to-be-God Syndrome).  Pallys have been incredibly upgraded since Kunark era, even since SoL era with PoP and LoY.  They are NOT the same as back then.<br />
<br />
90% pally rezzes have so little difference from 96% cleric rezzes.  It's 6% of the experience you lost in the death...that comes out to about 1% exp...you can get that back in one kill.  I play a cleric with an epic, I know the difference, it's not much.  Any paladin who downplays their own rez as worthless compared to a cleric's rez is a lying scumbag.<br />
<br />
Group heals can't be nerfed, the agro comes from heal agro, which SOE only makes worse, not better.  They also have the fastest heal in the game, Light of Nife, which is 1 second cast time for 850hp (which can be improved with AA).  This is in addition to their LoH and group LoH-type ability from AA.  Any paladin who downplays these abilities is tryig to keep them from getting noticed.<br />
<br />
Due to Paladin's much higher utility, I believe agro wise, power should go more towards: SK &gt; Pal &gt; Warrior...SKs are designed BY SOE to have better agro control than any class.  Paladins shouldn't have as powerful agro control, they simply aren't designed to do so.  In the words of the developers:<br />
<br />
Paladins are designed to not only melee but to have fast, fast heals. Paladins are excellent in situations where a character in your group is going to die RIGHT NOW, and thats one of the roles weve tried to carve out for Paladins.. We are trying to create niches for classes and Paladins are there as a Warrior of sorts who can take damage but have spells more suited to a Battle Cleric with their group heals, fast cast heals, lay on hands, stuns, etc. <br />
<br />
Nowhere in there do they say Paladins are designed to hold agro, as I've said before their agro abilities from stun come from the &quot;downside&quot; of stunning, but instead of being a downside, for paladins this is a huge benefit.  No downside to speak of in the case of paladins and exp groups, unless you're an idiot who doesn't know your class.  I'm not for removing agro from all stuns so that it creates no agro, but why in the hell is the full agro still there on stuns the mobs are immune to?  Have immune stuns create less agro compared to their normal agro (and have any damage component create normal agro they would).<br />
<br />
To answer your question from the first post...It would nearly kill SKs, but Paladins wouldn't be as hurt, as long as they're not an idiot and play their paladin as just a warrior with stuns.  They're more powerful than they'd like you to believe, these last two expansions made sure of that.</div></div><hr />

Most paladins have always loved the class - even back in Kunark.  It is player perception that is a problem.  Paladins had just as much problem Pre-PoP as a SK getting groups, even with all of our utility.  But, I am not oppossed to having SK outaggro paladins - you are doing more dps and casting aggro spells.  Where did you get the quote from?  I have never seen a developer state that SK are designed for aggro control.</div></div><hr />

What?  Im not ranting.  Im exactly on topic.  You point out what the *original* question was, but then fail to recognize the follow-up question:<br />
<br />
&quot;To put it another way, if aggro was equal how do people think the Tank balance would stand between each 'Tank' class?&quot;<br />

<br />
Can you explain that?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I can easily form an argument against that right now and I can tell you many others agree.  If agro was the *most* important attribute for tanking, then why not have a wizard tank then?  I dont care what kind of agro you can generate, if you cant take the beating, you probably wont be tanking too much.  Being able to take a beating is the foremost important part of being a tank.  Without that, agro makes no difference.  Agro is merely the application of your ability to take a beating, but it doesnt help you in that regard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding your SHD/PAL comparision--/shrug.  Im not sure.  All I can state for certain is that many of my PLD friends struggled quite a bit trying to get groups before agro control became as big an issue as it now is.  They can now far easier then they did before.  Perhaps a PLD can speak up--I can only speak somewhat intelligently about a SHD.<br />

<br />
 I dont think the aggro situation has to change . As a matter of fact the smartest way to tank mobs , even in exp groups would be to have a pal/sk AND a warrior , heck use the paly/sk's great ability to get insta aggro , and they are good nuff tanks to take those first few rounds, then have the pal/sk TRANSFER the aggro to the warrior , who by then has piled up some good sustained aggro and can hold it till the end . And by the same token the warrior needs to then have his &quot;great ability&quot; and that is to tank , the only problem is that warriors are just not THAT much better tanks than pal/sk's , certianly not enought difference to even bother running your group the way i described above and that is the problem.<br />
<br />
So once again i vote give warriors their own mitigation table , it doesnt have to be that much better than it is now , but as someone stated before there will be a perception that warriors ARE really better tanks . <br />
<br />
 Just adding some hps wont really accomplish the goal because whether you have 7000 or 9000 hps , they all have to be healed back at some point and that takes more mana . I really think warriors need their own mitigation table , so that we have something that we do much better than anyone else.<br />

<br />
Is that so?<br />
<br />
Then what would you say the single most important attribute that a WAR brings to a group?<br />
<br />
SKs have FD, ghetto heals, harmtouch, lifetaps.<br />
<br />
Pallies have heals/group heals, LH and BMB plus self-buffs.<br />
<br />
Warriors have /disc defensive and about a 1.5k hp spread between themselves and a similarly-equipped knight with the same AA's.<br />
<br />
Now tell me why &quot;aggro&quot; is the most important thing a knight brings to a group?  If you are a pally, don't you backup heal in a pinch?  If you're a knight don't you lifetap a bit to defray the cost of healing you?<br />
<br />
Tell me exactly what a warrior has over a knight besides tanking bossmobs in disc?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, that's what I thought.  Not much beyond about 1.5k hp which is further negated by paladin heals and sk lifetaps.</div></div><hr />

Have to admit, I like your idea.  Give Pal/SK just enough damage mitigation to suvive the initial pull/aggro generation then let the warrior take the aggro.   I will always agree with working together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights spells can NEVER lose their aggro component.<br />
<br />
If they ever do, the taunt button becomes GOD as cleric heals, wizard blasts, enchanter mezzes, shaman slows, and all spell effects do NOTHING for aggro.<br />
<br />
If it ever stops aggroing on spells then you could taunt once.. and then AFK until the mob is dead from spell blasts.  All other melee besides Warrior become pointless (rogues/monks/etc) as they cause aggro from sword swings and spells do nothing...<br />
<br />
So now we have to remove aggro from melee damage right?<br />
now the Taunt button is the only way to create hate...  grats AFK warriors as maintaining aggro is now trivial.  Anyone with a Taunt button presses the button and is the only guy on the hate list above &quot;noticed&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Its just not gonna happen...  they will never remove spell aggro... just like they will never remove melee-damage aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior CAN use hate modifications, but they have to not exceed current high-end Blade of War aggro generation, or the game will have MANY instances that are trivialized.<br />
(Fennin for one, most of PoEb, anywhere where a knight gets splattered before a significant heal can land basically)<br />
<br />
<br />
truly, its the middle-road non-EB warriors that actually have a the largest and most understandable gripe... <br />
the dependence on EB is a major crutch that the warriors should not have to use.  Hate generation should be inherent and constant for a warrior... not based on luck.<br />
<br />
However, Knights aggro SHOULD be burst-able, and indeed, knights should be able to TAKE aggro from warriors given proper mana expenditure. (Shadowknight aggro I feel is QUITE balanced considering the mana expenditure and opportunity cost for using our aggro spells)<br />
<br />
The REASON knights own aggro is the ability to time when their +hate stuff hits...  warriors have to wait on procs...  knights press some buttons at the right time...  If warriors can press a button at the right time for +hate (not +positional like taunt) then the balance will be fine...  I would FULLY support such changes, even if no other changes were made...<br />
<br />
Just because it annoys me to see so many telling me how freaking godly I am in comparson to the meak little warrior...<br />
<br />
<br />
Please remember that knights paid for their spells....<br />
1) lower skillcaps (just scored my newest record for MISSES last night at 27 in a row... with a 20 delay weapon at haste cap...<br />
thats right people... I stood there whiffing for almost 20 seconds before getting a hit...  THANKS low skillcaps!)<br />
2) lower HP (warriors in my guild approach 10k HP buffed...  the knights best is just under 9k.<br />
3) horrible disciplines that recharge insanely slow<br />
<br />
If you think that being able to heal yourself for 1000 is as good as  having that 1000HP beforehand when you are tanking, then you need to do some reading and parsing.<br />
<br />
/fizzle<br />
/interrupt<br />
/resist (lifetaps - yes there are mobs who resist lifetaps fully magic debuffed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights simply do NOT want to be pointless again....  and they have a legit and VERY potent example... (like for instance since Kunark)<br />
<br />
Knights WOULDNT be pointless without better taunt than warriors...  but warriors would be so much better of a choice that what warriors face now would be a joke in comparison.  Without a perceived advantage (our spells are NOT considered an advantage... they are seen as a perk and little more since most people haven't a CLUE what Shadowknight spells do) the knights would be forever distantly second place.<br />
<br />
Im sorry, but...<br />
Due to most players not having the SLIGHTEST clue what the knight spells do and how(especially Shadowknights) most of them have not a single clue where they stand in comparison to knights in any semblance of logic or truth.<br />
<br />
Note, for those of you quoting lucy and thinking that you &quot;know&quot; something...  Shall we discuss the fact that nearly everything you are currently debating has NOTHING to do with the spell entries in lucy?  (amount of hate generated...)<br />
<br />
Most of the warrior's current inferiority complex is based only upon perceptions that they aren't noticeably better than knights is just plain bull.<br />
<br />
The only one that holds merit is the one that asks why warriors require uber hate items to do their job....<br />
<br />
I can sum up the whole thing in a few words warriors...<br />
<br />
You get my hate generation when I get /defensive<br />
You get 90% of my hate generation when I get 90% of /defensive<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
How would you feel if Knights got your primary advantage in the raid role?<br />
<br />
Thats the EXACT same feeling knights will have about warriors getting their hate generation in XP groups...<br />
<br />
the best solution is actually somewhere in the middle...<br />
<br />
(warriors gain the ability to add consistent +aggro, and knights gain the ability to BURST tank.... example: short duration auto-parry/riposte)<br />
<br />
Warriors get to better compete with the Knights in groups, and Knights get to have their 9 seconds of glory on raids....  god forbid...<br />
<br />
I already posted a package of what I believed would actually solve the problems... but it only works as a package, and there are too many that can't see &quot;balance&quot; as any more than &quot;I want to make all other classes useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry for any hijaking... I get truly annoyed at the whole warrior-possum act.<br />

You point out what the *original* question was, but then fail to recognize the follow-up question<br />
If it will make you that much happier to have that question answered, then here.  Making agro equal, you have three classes who can hold agro just the same, it all comes out to the benefits of having each class.  Paladins bring more healing and hp to the whole group, SKs bring more magic damage as well as (62+) mana to the whole group, warriors bring a slightly more tanking ability compared to the SK/Pal (although the gap doesn't seem as large overall as it should be, IMO), and more melee damage than either.  If agro was equal, and you had the choice of any of them, it'd be depending on which of these you wanted, or which you were lacking.<br />

&quot;Agro control has been agreed, by SEVERAL classes, to be the most important part in tanking in PoP. It's simple common sense. You can't control agro, your group is dead. End of story. Saying otherwise makes you look dumb and unknowledgeable about your own class, which I don't believe you are&quot;<br />
<br />
Can you explain that?<br />
Certainly, although I'm surprised I have to.  Considering the damage output of PoP exp mobs being much higher than any other expansions exp mobs, a mob running around attacking anyone isn't good for anyone.  If whoever is tanking can't hold the mob to them, then it'll be attacking anything and everything that manages to gain agro.  If the mob kills the healer or slower, or too many damage dealers where you can't kill him in time, you've wiped.  Wasn't this in grouping 101?  PoP exp mobs hit hard, so being able to keep agro on the tank, however the group decides to do it, is the most important part.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, it was a statement about your perception that agro isn't as big a deal.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I can easily form an argument against that right now and I can tell you many others agree.  If agro was the *most* important attribute for tanking, then why not have a wizard tank then?<br />
I can have the most uber warrior in the world, 30k hp, mitigation unsurpassed by anyone, even the gods...it all means absolutely nothing if the mob runs by me and heads for the slower.<br />
Whoever can hold the agro is the tank (Shaman are the tank a lot of times, for example), hp/mitigation are a definite necessity, but being able to keep the mob on you is a major part.  You are the tank if the mob is trying to hit you the most, most people would rather have a war/pal/shd be that instead of them, in fact most healers would too.  Being able to take the beating is more of a minimum...being able to keep the mob on you, however you do it, is an absolute must.  Ask the rogues...most of them don't care WHO is being beat on, as long as it's not them so they can BS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding your SHD/PAL comparision--/shrug.  Im not sure.  All I can state for certain is that many of my PLD friends struggled quite a bit trying to get groups before agro control became as big an issue as it now is.[Quote]<br />
SKs struggled too, I know I was mainly relegated to pulling, which SKs weren't considered good at until people woke up and realized how good SKs were.  Things change, as you've noted, people begin to notice how good other classes are, what they can do...you think the majority of people ever thought bards could kite as many mobs at once as they can do now until it became as well known as it is now?<br />
<br />
[QUOTE]I always love the insulting posts.  As if they have nothing intelligent to add to the discussion, so they insult you, either directly or indirectly.  Grow up dude.<br />
I think it was more aimed at the fact you seem to be overlooking the other stuff SHD/PAL bring to a group, and not giving them as much weight as they should be given.<br />
<br />
And Brik...okay, okay, we know that Knights can't lose their agro components on all their spells...it would mess up too many things (including bard songs, I bet, even tho it has nothing to do with them). ^_^  I don't want Knights to lose their agro abilities...despite the way this thread sounds, not many people do.<br />
<br />
Valeris posed the question over if the situation is still there, if the agro gaining abilities of knights are still needed to allow them to get groups, despite 2-3 expansions later and many improvements.  My response was yes for shadowknights, being as that is their primary role in this game...having the best control over agro, and there's sufficient downsides to it (mana cost and power) where it's not too balancing considering it's their job, but no for paladins...they have gotten many upgrades with buffs (lower level versions as well), fast heals, they still get upgrades with stuns that stop the mob from attacking.<br />
<br />
Oh, and cuedyen2...I got the quote from a Developer Panel at a recent Fan Faire, which was after the spells designed purely for agro were given to shadowknights...here's what they had to say about SKs.<br />
Shadow Knights are excellent secondary tanks. They have better damage output than a Paladin and their agro control spells are very useful as well. <br />
I too think shadowknights should easily out-agro paladins, mainly due to the fact that SKs have spells directly designed for it, and paladin's stuns only have agro to keep stun-capable people from chaining them.  Like I said, this isn't a downside to a paladin, it's a benefit, one I don't believe was intended to be as powerful of one as it is.  I want them to be able to stun, but remove the huge agro from the immune stuns...it'll change things, but it should be a good one overall.</div></div><hr />

They can get burst agro, which is somewhat of the initial idea so they can save casters etc., but since they don't lose that burst agro at all (unless SKs FD, or someone goes over them in agro) it's become trivial to tank.<br />

<br />
&quot;Certainly, although I'm surprised I have to. Considering the damage output of PoP exp mobs being much higher than any other expansions exp mobs, a mob running around attacking anyone isn't good for anyone. If whoever is tanking can't hold the mob to them, then it'll be attacking anything and everything that manages to gain agro. If the mob kills the healer or slower, or too many damage dealers where you can't kill him in time, you've wiped. Wasn't this in grouping 101? PoP exp mobs hit hard, so being able to keep agro on the tank, however the group decides to do it, is the most important part.&quot;<br />
<br />
No genius.  You actually had the nerve to rag on me for going off the topic of the thread, which I did NOT do, then, in true hypocritical form, post something that *is* off the topic.  I asked you to explain THAT, not your stupid comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can have the most uber warrior in the world, 30k hp, mitigation unsurpassed by anyone, even the gods...it all means absolutely nothing if the mob runs by me and heads for the slower.<br />
Whoever can hold the agro is the tank (Shaman are the tank a lot of times, for example), hp/mitigation are a definite necessity, but being able to keep the mob on you is a major part. You are the tank if the mob is trying to hit you the most, most people would rather have a war/pal/shd be that instead of them, in fact most healers would too. Being able to take the beating is more of a minimum...being able to keep the mob on you, however you do it, is an absolute must. Ask the rogues...most of them don't care WHO is being beat on, as long as it's not them so they can BS.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
My god...I would hope that you would see that its pointless to argue, but apparantely not.  We can play these stupid games all night.  &quot;Which came 1st, the chicken or the egg.&quot;  /DUH.  <br />
<br />
It doesnt work that way anyways.  I never said that agro was not important.  But making the claim that it is the *most* important is completely flawed.  If you cant take the beating, you arent going to be a successful tank.  You have to be able to take the beating before you would ever consider wanting agro.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was more aimed at the fact you seem to be overlooking the other stuff SHD/PAL bring to a group, and not giving them as much weight as they should be given.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh I consider it.  I consider it all the time.  Now Im *not* saying that the classes are balanced--as stated like 100 previous times--they might not be.  At the end of the day, however, WAR do have abilities that SHD/PAL to not have and they are advantageous.  That will, to at least a certain degree, offset some of our spellcasting ability benefits.  The fact of the matter is, SHD/PAL primarily became useful in PoP due to agro control.  I know before that, it was not nearly as fun, nor enjoyable.  We just were not desired, despite the fact that we *did* bring all these other abilities to groups.  People perferred WAR, many times by a large margin.<br />
<br />
I guess Im confused.  If WAR were given good agro control, but not as good as SHD/PAL, yet had their tanking ability (or some other attribute to offset the agro deficiency), why wouldnt people consider that as reasonable?  Despite what any of you say, I am 100% in support for equality.  I think we all want to end up there.<br />

Well imo as a species evolves and over the eons eventually becomes something else , each advance is made through the birth of the next generation . So assumeing that something eventually became a chicken , id have to assume that there was an egg before there wasa  chicken .<br />

<br />
<br />
Hmm.. I never said PoP only.. if I did I meant overall. Interesting to know though since Knight weapons now ROT on our raids...<br />
<br />
<br />
There a decent amount of EB/TB Knight USABLE weapons in PoP (Including HateB) but I dont know of a single knight with one, and if their is one its staticslall low.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe, yeah.. I said I was playing devils advocate.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding HP...<br />
<br />
How many times have you had your MT go to 5% or less before CH hit.....<br />
<br />
Often enough that on many encounters I maintain space for and obtain a DI, but still as rare as the damage spike that caused it.<br />
<br />
thus 200-300 HP DOES NOT make a difference 98% of the time<br />
<br />
<br />
I have 8500 Raid buffed, our top Warrior has 9200..<br />
<br />
Thats 700 difference or around 9%<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you Silent Tempests top Pally?? if not.. compare his diff, besides... 700 HP diff compared to a elemental guilds TOP warrior... not bad... On average, it looks to me like most similarly geared and AAed pallys will be 500HP shy of their warrior counterpart, and the knight will probably have a higher AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Add Another 100 AC thats 14%?<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually... 100 AC in most cases wont make a danged bit of difference unless yer right at the threshold of that mobs attack limit (or whatever Solinar called it) and the 100AC put you over... for the LARGE thread here on AC parses and &quot;is AC meaningful&quot; it showed that you needed increments of over 500 AC to really see any meaningfull difference.</div></div><hr />

-I don't think Removing any knight aggro is necessary, but I do not for one second think either knight class would be utterly devasted if their aggro was brought down. They would be at a disadvantage to warriors for groups, but I guess most knights these days are just not used to that that think that = broken.  The best solution however would be to bring warrior aggro up.<br />
<br />
-Knights used to get a few spells every 10 or so levels, but lately get spells at the rate of casters (although a lesser line). A few spells every level. If those spells cannot be used for anything to have any advantage over a pure mellee whatsoever then something is not being done right. The spell lists for hybrods are pretty amazing. So I really do not think either knight is a one trick class (aggro). I have seen knights do some rpetty amazing things, besides having a 100% lock on aggro.<br />
<br />
-Having seen some pallies cause havoc on some SSra named, multiple 4-5k crits. I am inclined to believe that the dps of SU is a  tad more than 10%, especially for long fights and over time in exp groups. One Paly claimed 250dps with a Tunare sword on one name</div></div><hr />

The mobs did not hit hard enough to worry about a tank loosing it until aggro was re-established. On the flip side, there was a larger difference in Warrior - Knight mitigation and even though we could always get aggro, healers were furious when we did because they had to work much harder.<br />

This is precisely the answer I referring to.  It amazes me that many knights hold to the &quot;aggro advantage&quot; being the sole key to being viable tanks, and supporting a greater spread in defense.   ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?   <br />

Have you COMPLETELY lost your mind?   THAT is what got you guys screwed in Kunark, the tankability differential, NOT that warriors had decent aggro.   And you actually WANT a return to that to prevent a return to that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I dunno what a average tank is to some of you. I myself think im a average 65 tank.  I have 4200hp unbuffed, I have 1160 ac unbuffed. <br />
<br />
How is that diffrent from a self buffed paladin of the same level? <br />
A 65 Average paladin I have eben told has 4700 hp With his self buff's.  (without virtue or hand or shammy )<br />
Oh yeah, that average 65 Pally has a higher ac then me and also the same mitigation. Unless I use defensive.<br />
<br />
He can also tank better then I can with his stuns and never ending cracked out KEI self. <br />
Umm Where is a pure melee KEI?.. I'd like a regen spell that lasts 4 hours and regens me for 30 hp a tick. <br />
<br />
Oh wait a minute, I have more dps then a pal!... But ummm wait I am dual wielding weapons and eating more ripotse damage, Where the pal has a insane 2h Item that just generates sheer ass whipping..  Hmmm wait a second did his holy blade just clense that undead for 2600 points?... <br />
<br />
Doh.. Okay well I cant match his dps.. But wait I can buy new weapons.. Oh Wait.. I have to pay 150k for a Splitblade of destruction (14dmg 19dly) But umm a pal can buy a 21/24 for 10k..  Well drat okay i'll never be able to afford updates to myself as easily as a pal. <br />
<br />
But wait im great on a raid!!! Huzzah! I shall shine forth! But I cant hold aggro on the named, Because I cant afford weapons that let me do my job and help increase taunt, And Ummm That pally just got chewed up... Ooops... well hey... At least my disc kept me up.. &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Now lets turn and lookit SK's..Hmm Cant match their DPS because of all the dot's they can toss around. <br />
<br />
I cant pull worth crap, and yet SK's are the masters at pulling having torn that from some poor monk's dead abused SK violated body. <br />
<br />
Hmm Oh wait that SK just hit for 8k with a harm touch and can do it again in 20 mins &gt;&lt;  Remind me not to mess with that SoB...<br />
<br />
Sorry.. I just read this thread at 6am, and realized. How stupid is this for SK's and Pal's to cry about a invisable nerf bat, When they have life so good?<br />
<br />
Heck warriors have life good to, Till they hit the PoP Ceiling.  And Honestly.  Some of you need to reevaluate what a average warrior is. 5-6 k hp unbuffed is NOT Average. 3.5- 4.9 hp is AVERAGE.  Most average warriors wont get past tier 2 intill they take flags off. <br />
<br />
Im sorry you may think this is a flame,  But it trully isnt. The concept and ideal of average isnt PoFire. Its Plane of Nightmare.<br />
Anyone whom puts PoFire Next to Average isnt average. Not every warrior that wants these changes are 65 with a uber elemental guild. <br />
<br />
Average 65 war 3.4k hp to 4.9 K Hp Unbuffed (from clerics)<br />
AC on the average warrior at 65 is 1000 to 1300<br />
<br />
Average  65 Paladin 3.9khp - 5.2 kHP (self buffed)<br />
Average ac 1100 - 1345 (self buffed)<br />
<br />
Average 65 SK 3.1k hp to 4.5.k hp <br />
Average ac 1070 - 1250 (self buffed)<br />
<br />
I am not the greatest but this is talking to friends whom only have up to BoT access, whom are not elementally flaged.<br />
Take a look I asked a lotta people . <br />
<br />
Those are the average I have found.. SK's are the only ones semi hurt by lack of HP yet the AC on al;l nearly mirrored each other.<br />
<br />
With Paladins after self buff's they usally ended up having around 500hp more then warriors. As well as a higher ac<br />
<br />
Warriors are stuck in the middle of the plate tank class. <br />
Yet we have no self buff's, We have no self healing, Nor a FD . (Tho I gate to my bind point really well, I just havent learned to take my gear with me yet &gt;&lt; ) We have no true aggro control over the other two classes, Wherein they have significent value more to bring to the table.<br />
<br />
However in the end of tanking their in lies a choice, What friends you have made to group with, What guild groups are open for you. Where the best places to go are, or if your intuitive enough to form your own group.<br />
<br />
Just because we lack in a lot of aspects dosent make any of the three classes have less ability to tank then the other. We can all take a hit the same. Its just what you can do with what you have.<br />
<br />
So chill relax and remember,<br />
We will nerf bat them friggin hybrids one day<br />
*grins while oiling his nerf bat and thinking of the day of sweet revenge.. *<br />

<br />
Those &quot;2600&quot; hit on undeads are as rare as our cripple hits for 2000 under fellstrike...<br />
<br />
and you cant compare unbuffed warriors with self buffed pallies, because you will always use the healer buffs in xp group... there is no solo in Pop. and there is always an aego or virtue seller at nexus.<br />
An average warrior may have some HP and defensive AAs, will most of paladins may take critical hits or another stuff...<br />
<br />
The problem is NOT the hps anymore : its that HP doesnt matter once you break 3k8 - 4k in any PoP xp groups... because of slow. slow trivialise tanking. in pop with the damage output of trash mobs it's almost only aggro that matter for casters, when they seek a tank. So as glatius said, SOE have now 2 possibilities : give us better aggro abilities or another thing that make us attractive (but what ?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, if read on PoN, there are plenty of paladins who think the status quo is perfect.  I personally don't think that any class should feel second rate and believe the aggro difference between warrior - knight needs to be narrowed.  I also think the mitigation advantage of warriors needs to be increased to get it back to whatever the vision was.  I would not change either drastically. <br />
<br />
Both changes, they would have to be carefully thought out so groups would have a reasonable choice &quot;higher mitigation of a warrior with ok aggro or lower mitigation of a knight with good aggro&quot;.  I do think that Knights aggro triviales xp groups and should be lowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the deffinition of a good group? I will spell it out to you in quasi mathmatical formula's. <br />
A good group = A group where mana regen is &gt; the cost of negating 100% of mob damage and in which deals X DPS which is = or &gt; the amount needed to kill a mob in Y seconds which is considered to be a good rate by the players of said group.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at those componants.<br />
&quot;Mana regen &gt; cost to negate 100% of mob damage&quot;. Negation of damage happens in a multitude of ways. Healing, slowing, mezzing, buffs and mana conservation/efficientcy are the primary ways to get this into correlation. So if you break it down you want a single person who can take damge well holding aggro so the most efficient heals can be applied to conserve mana and that person must therefore hold aggro over the high aggro negation of Slows/mezz to proliferate the conservation of that mana.<br />
<br />
A constant in this is that at ANY time you are at the point of Mana regen &gt; cost to negate 100% of the mob damage ANYTHING you add beyond this is superfluous and of no use. It simply does not stack beyond the point of being enough.<br />
<br />
Now take a PoP group with a cleric with c5 on a horse and lets say 5 FT and his self mana buff and 1 natural mana regen. He will regen the cost of a specialized c heal in about 6 ticks. That is 7500/6 or 1250 per tick healed that can be sustained. A slowed PoP xp mob does not deal that much damage per tick on average. Since The cleric with that mana regen and a slower have reached the threshold where the regen is &gt; mob damage costs then ANY heals added by a paladin are superflous in their own right. Do I heal in a good xp group even in elem planes? Hell no i don't cause i simply never have to because the cleric can and will handle 100% of it and still be at 100% mana by the time the next mob is pulled. So basically your theory that we bring heals to a group is pretty much moot. We bring the ability to heal but it is NOT neccesary in any way for the group to function on a higher level. So what about our buffs? Our buffs also bring nothing in this case as long as the tank has with cleric buffs enough hp's to let the cleric sustain the mana regen &gt; cost equation and 300 hp buff isnt gonna really move this one way or the other with heals landing for 5k+ at the minimum with a smart mana conserving cleric. Our rez we bring to the table that you all keep spouting about? Not even really worth mentioning as if the cleric dies so will the rest of your little group and thus you might as well get the clicky ress instead of mine when our little bodies pop to the GY. On the off chance you are in a group with no cleric then you will actualy get benefits from our rez ,buffs and heals as it is much harder for a druid to reach the threshold but if they do the healing buffing go back to not needed but I don't see that many groups going to take out any tuffer xp mobs than gimp ass Wasteland mobs in PoV without a cleric very often. The very very few who do are brave guys I respect but they also dont just pick up people for the group who are LFG in the first place which is what we are talking about. Overall if you look at what most groups consist of nowdays it is cleric(sometimes druid in weaker xp camps) slower tank 3 dps people. This is this way as it is the most efficent as a slower is important to the negation of the mobs dps and so is a tank who can keep the aggro so the cleric can use the more efficient heals. Make warriors as good in aggro as paladins or SK's and what you end up with is warrior being the 100% of the time choice for any good group as what a paladin brings other than his aggro in this part of the equation is superfluous due to it not stacking with what the cleric and slower has already done since they have reached the unlimited mana threshold.<br />
<br />
On to the next point.<br />
<br />
&quot;DPS = or &gt; than the amount needed to kill a mob in y seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
Now when you are choosing a tank and the other things brought by a class will be mostly if not entirely useless to the group would you EVER take the tank that does the least damage and has the same aggro? Answer is no. DPS is a stackable item up to ANY point before instant and continuous death of any and all mobs. unlike the negation of the mobs damage. There is a point in which adding to that is not useful but adding more DPS is always better for the xp of the group. Faster kills = faster XP. Now you see both warrior and paladin looking for group. you got the essentials of a PoP group already in a cleric and a slower but you need the third essential, a tank. Now you already know that you will be reaching the ability to mitigate 100% of the mobs damage between the cleric a slower and any tank who can hold aggro and thus have non stop pulls for great xp so you begin to weigh the advantages of the ones vieing for the slot. The paladin has aggro and buffs that will be of really no ultimate use other than to make someone feel better about their stats, rez which will be of no consequential use, heals which will not be needed, and moderate DPS. Then on the other hand (if warriors were brought to where palaidns are) you have a warriors who brings aggro, hp's and ac advantage over the paladin that will overall be inconsequantial as even without the difference the constant of mana&gt; cost will happen, and he brings better DPS than the paladin. Choice is simple. you pick the warrior 100% of the time. He will provide for a more xp friendly setting as he will help you kill faster while doing exactly the same job the paladin would do.<br />

<br />
Also, I have to question why (given this perfect group accepts nothing less than the optimum class balance so as to maximise it's mana useage vs. DPS etc) that a 'general utility'  knight should be favoured over it's 'tanking specialised' parent class in that group? <br />

I have witnessed, on numerous occassions, times when the Cleric's timing was just a tad off on the CH for a Paladin in an experience group.  I knew the CH wasn't going to land in time.  The Paladin knew the CH wasn't going to land in time.   If it had been me, I would have popped furious, and hoped not to need a discipline again for a good long while, or popped defensive and prayed.  The Paladin popped off a 1 second cast time, 850 HP heal on himself, and viola, no Paladin splatter.<br />
<br />
Now, if you tell me that Paladin heals are irrelevant and meaningless, then I respond BS.  I've seen Paladins keep standing in situations where I would have been dead and at my bind point.  This was solely because of their ability to heal.  And one, only one mind you, 850 HP heal pretty much negates the usual difference between the two classes buffed. <br />
<br />
So sorry, the attempt to down play the Paladin ability to heal just doesn't fly.  Maybe you don't use your heals to advantage when tanking, but I've seen many a Paladin who does.  And it makes them incrediably durable.</div></div><hr />

There is a reason I listed Paladins self buffed status.Because thats part of what their class brings and shouldnt be dismissed. Lets say you have no cleric only a paladin and a druid to play healer, <br />
Thats what the Paladin brings in over a warrior, the abilty to maintain a higher hp/ac status through spells other then aggro control. Thus being a better tank then warrior due to getting more out of Cheal.<br />
Self buff's HP/AC still do matter in PoP even more so now that mobs hit for 500-700 a shot in tier 3,  300-600+ In tier 2.<br />
<br />
And to say there is always a aego or virtue for sale. Not always, Lets look at a xp group with out a cleric, With a druid playing healer. If a warrior buff drop's we have to leave group go get new buff come back stopping the flow of xp. If a paladin buff drops he simply rebuff's himself and all is well. <br />
<br />
My arguement, is not nerf hybrid's but more that they can do more then simply use aggro as their one crutch to say they are the best at something, Hybrids werent meant to be the best at something, They where meant to be jack of trades, Instead now Jack jus pulled a few aces out of his hat and wont let them go.<br />

<br />
Why are you trying to downplay paladins vs. warriors?<br />
<br />
There are definitely instances where paladin heals and abilities will be useful, if not save the group.  This includes, but is not limited to:<br />
<br />
1. Healing Wave of Prexus/Marr when cleric uses Arb.<br />
2. Spot/backup heals when necessary (late CH's != a bad cleric, even the best have off moments)<br />
3. Root<br />
4. Stuns<br />
5. LH in a pinch<br />
<br />
Wow, seems like the paladin class brings MUCH more to the table than aggro control!   <br />
<br />
Now tell me what a warrior brings to the group vs. a paladin with similar equipment and AA's, of the same level.<br />
<br />
Big whoop-de do.  We have about 1.5k more hp, and /disc defensive.  (For the record I have never popped /disc furious except when fighting Behemoth.)  More DPS?  I parsed 20-25 more DPS than my pally friend in the group today.  <br />
<br />
I don't see that many groups going to take out any tuffer xp mobs than gimp ass Wasteland mobs in PoV without a cleric very often. <br />
<br />
BoT mobs with a 65 druid healing are really not that hard, especially if you have a slower.  We had a pally along today for rez (if needed), buffs, and backup heals.... Maybe you should take a harder look at the paladin class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the deffinition of a good group? I will spell it out to you in quasi mathmatical formula's.   A good group = A group where mana regen is &gt; the cost of negating 100% of mob damage and in which deals X DPS which is = or &gt; the amount needed to kill a mob in Y seconds which is considered to be a good rate by the players of said group....Hope you have had fun sitting in on group math 101 Have a pleasant day.<br />
 <br />
<br />
You then show that, in a perfect world, with no lag, no distractions, the ideal mix of classes available, a paladins buffs and heals won't help.  If your heals and buffs are so useless, would you give them up?  Some how I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Now if youa re in the situation like that more often than once every hour when your disc is up then maybe just maybe get a clue and find a cleric who isn't afk'ing or tradeskilling while healing. <br />
<br />
So, lag never happens?  The clerics phone never rings?  The clerics baby never cries?  The cleric never gets a string of fizzles?  You never get adds and have more than one person taking damage?  All those things can make for more than one instance of a late heal in an hour, and do not mean a crappy cleric.<br />
<br />
And sometimes, there are crappy clerics.  Sometimes that is all that is available out there.  And if the option is to not exp, or exp with a crappy cleric, well, you are still most likely going to be exp up with a crappy cleric, and that is better than no exp, so you just live with it, and hope you have a druid or shaman or(get this) pally who can help keep things going.<br />
<br />
Heals are only one type of utility spell pallies have.  So even if your heals are useless, you still have utility that a warrior does not.  Thank you for trying to dazzle us with your math lesson, and lessons on what a group needs, but it does not change the fact that the way things are now, pallies are better exp tanks, plus have more utility.</div></div><hr />

Paladins, more often than not, will downplay the power of their class when &quot;balance&quot; is in question.  Groups in PoP very regularly do not have a cleric, druids and shamans received heals that are sufficient in PoP for the most part...oh wait, you only exp in Elemental planes.  Funny, you DO know the elemental planes are only about 6 planes out of the 17 zones you can fight inside in PoP, right?  Or how about out of the 130 other zones or so outside PoP?<br />
<br />
(sometimes druid in weaker xp camps)I love this statement, because in your spiel the words &quot;weaker xp camps&quot; means anything below elemental planes, really...that's interesting because that's where the MAJORITY of people are.<br />
<br />
Saying paladin heals are moot when you're only talking about the top planes in PoP is a pretty sad argument.  As well as your argument being dependant (as Valeris said) on having a cleric with 57 points of mana regen constantly (on their horse, which means no ducking in the case of emergency heals, which the Paladin class happens to excel at, btw).  I'm rather surprised you didn't say 15 FT or even Mental Clarity 3, or perhaps Spiritual Dominion?  That would have helped you prove your point you failed to make.<br />
<br />
Arguing channeling abilities on a 1 second spell is pretty sad as well, it takes a special breed of Paladin to not even BOTHER trying to cast a 1 second spell at level 65 on a (presumably) slowed exp mob...either the heal to get your hp back or your stun.  Since PoP xp mobs on average do not do 210hp DPS, according to you, if it's impossible to get a 1 second spell off then you should have gone for your LoHs instead, which SHOULD be up since, as you've so eloquently stated, the cleric is keeping up on all heals and you're heals are...&quot;moot&quot;, was it?<br />
<br />
And if the cleric dies?  You say:<br />
Our rez we bring to the table that you all keep spouting about? Not even really worth mentioning as if the cleric dies so will the rest of your little group and thus you might as well get the clicky ress instead of mine when our little bodies pop to the GY. <br />
Unless you were going to wipe ANYWAYS, I sincerely doubt this is the case 100% of the time in PoP.  Since in your examples the cleric is doing nothing but medding and CHing, the cleric in this &quot;best case scenario&quot; will only be getting agro from CH cast on you.  That means that when the cleric dies, you are full health.  Now since, as you've said, a slowed PoP xp mob, on average, does not do more than 1250hp damage per tick, it should be VERY easy for you to keep yourself alive for a decent amount of time since you have over 5k hp, especially with your LoH (or perhaps if you were a smart paladin you would keep a Soulfire on you for &quot;oh shit&quot; moments), where your group members can finish off the mob and you can rez any deaths in with your &quot;useless&quot; 90% pally rez.  If you can't do that, then in normal cases that mob would have two or three-rounded you, in which case your assessment on the damage capabilities of PoP xp mobs is flawed, or perhaps a warrior tank with defensive would be better off tanking than you. <br />
<br />
In any case, your argument is laughable (No really, I cracked up laughing, honest).  Do you honestly BELIEVE what you wrote?  My god, you've got the &quot;arrogant paladin&quot; as well as the &quot;poor me I need my agro over warriors&quot; in ONE LONG STATEMENT...now that's good BSing.<br />
<br />
Quit downplaying the capabilities of the paladin class, there's plenty of us who will call your bluff.</div></div><hr />

Or you could get an ability where you instil within your group memebers a serious strategic insight by tales of battles lost and won by the use of wits and cunning (Make it reduce mana cost on all spells by 5% and do more damage or last longer when cast.) Hell warriors always like to tell tales of their battles. (Doesnt cut into bards abilities s much as it would have to be stackable and since both have a form of dps increasing it stacks)Even that will sooner or later cause some mudflation but it will not be as fast or as overdone as just taking a class's only current role of any worth and moving it to your own class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I believe I stated earlier in this thread - if people do agree that aggro lock is 'required' (the arguement has far more relevance to an SK than a paladin though I still believe) then I've asked for suggestions that people believe would give knight classes enhanced desirability in a group to make up for it. I've got a long assed post I oughta make at some point about this , maybe later :)<br />
<br />
Actually I happen to agree with you in part about giving a warrior some use outside the main tanking slot (in a group and on a raid) Only as part of an overall balancing solution that takes into account knight concerns I hasten to add (before certain knightly posters scream 'injustice'  :p ).<br />
<br />
This topic is about balancing the exp grouping situation a little better. It's my contention that balancing by aggro will not work - so long as virtual aggro lock exists warriors will either have too little and no other ability will ever make up for it or warriors will have 'enough' and knights (although again the pallies have a far weaker case than the SK's) will be shafted. From an enjoyment perspective Aggro lock also makes the exp slog even more tedious than it could be. <br />
<br />
Have to say considering how hard i have to work as a secondary tank (usually at least 4 warriors on our raids most 65 , I'm 63) to make myself feel anything but a fifth wheel, a paladin turning around and telling me they have no role in a raid, given all the abilities they can tap to make themselves useful, is just a little, well, pathetic....<br />

Now if youa re in the situation like that more often than once every hour when your disc is up then maybe just maybe get a clue and find a cleric who isn't afk'ing or tradeskilling while healing.<br />
<br />
Yes, you're right.  SoE worked so hard to give you all those freaknig spells, because they considered them essentially useless.  Every expansion they've continued to give you even more of those useless spells, because they just wanted you to be even more useless.  Paladins never use their spells in a group, when tanking, except for stun.  No Paladin has ever figured out how to add more functionality or pull a situation out of the fire unless it was using a stun.  Thanks so much for clearing up how utterly useless all things Paladin truely are except for stuns.  We're educated now.<br />
<br />
On another topic, I often find it interesting how on the one hand Paladins will cry about how unless they're tanking they're never picked for another group slot because they don't bring enough to the table, yet seem to think that when not tanking a Warrior will be selected for another group slot because he brings, for the most part, an additional 20% DPS and nothing more.  WTF kind of logic is that?  With all the Paladin's flexibilty, no one wants them unless tanking, but without any flexibility at all they'll want Warriors when not tanking?  Gah, talk about convoluted logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I am a foolish roleplayer...I seem to remeber this from oldschool roleplaying...( i know i am lumping rogue/monk in EQ pure melees in the hybrid class here, but just folow along)<br />
<br />
Base Melee Class... Warrior - BASE Tank <br />
Hybrid Melee Class... Paladin - SECONDARY Tank, specialized in healing and killing UNDEAD<br />
Hybrid Melee Class.. Shadowknight - SECONDARY Tank, Specialized in pain/death/damage, and using UNDEAD<br />
Hybrid Melee Class... Ranger - Scout, Tracker, specialized in RANGED combat<br />
Hybrid Melee Class... Rogue - Scout, specialized in sneak attacks.<br />
Hybrid Melee Class... Monk - Scout, specialized in H2H combat and special moves. <br />
<br />
It seems to me, that it has always been, in any roleplaying systemm that there should be fewer of the SPECIALIZED and hybrid type classes than of the base class. If they were not limited, then the HYBRID would become the norm and would no longer be special or rare. If a Paladin can do everything a warrior can and better, and have spells, and have special abilities, why play a warrior? <br />
<br />
Perhaps I am wrong, but Paladins role needs to be specialized, thats what they always have been, and should be. There needs to be some trade off for using a paladin to replace a warrior in the base warrior role, ie Tank. Currently there is absolutely no trade off in using a paladin/sk over a warrior for a base tank role.<br />
<br />
Paladins scream 'Defensive' every time  people point out that their class is over balanced compared to warriors. Defensive is old and at level 65 pretty much useless ability, I MT for raids up to SolRo all the time, and rarely ever need defensive. We use defensive almost exclusively on BOSS mobs, it is NOT a real group needed ability.  I am so sick of hearing paladins scream defensive...<br />
<br />
By the logic of paladins, Rangers, Monks and Rogues should all be viable MT's. After all they have excellent Aggro generating abilities. There should be no trade off in making them MT's.<br />
<br />
If you look at the melee classes above, here is where EQ has gone wrong.... <br />
<br />
All of the 'hybrid' classes above ghave much greater Agro generating abilities than warriors, any single one of these classes can and will draw aggro from a warrior, almost at will. However, just because they can darw the aggro, do we want them as a MT? Why was the monk mitigation change made? Because they could easilly MT almost any mob in the game, even though they were not supposed to be able to. Rangers, Monks, Rogues have less AC and Mitigation than warriors so, that makes them less viable tanks, they take too much damage and have much fewer hps to MT consistently. Pal/SK's though have almost as many HP's and AC and Mitigation as a warrior so they make viable secondary tanks.<br />
<br />
If you look closer at all these classes, each of them also has a 'get out of jail free card'  they hav an ability or spell that was designed in the class to save them from unwanted aggro. What are these abilities?<br />
<br />
Monk - FD<br />
SK - FD<br />
Rogue - Evade<br />
Ranger - Jolt<br />
Paladin - STUN!<br />
<br />
What was that? STUN is the paladins way of loosing aggro? Yes, look at the design, that was what was intended. Stun the mob, to prevent the paladin from taking too much damage...<br />
<br />
But, But paladins say that stuns were meant to get aggro! <br />
<br />
Ummmmm, NO. <br />
<br />
Stuns were not intended to draw aggro, what happened, is what happens in any game that is played by multitudes of people, many 'munchkins' and 'powergamers' It was quickly discovered, that a stun, interupted spells and stopped mob DPS. This made mobs much easier to kill with the party taking less damage, kill faster and greater numbers. Chain-Stun of mobs became a viable tactic. To combat this tactic, SOE made a quick fix, lets add an artificially high aggro modifier to stun. Since originally CLERICS were using this along with other pure casters. Being summoned because of high aggrio is BAD. so this lowered the use of the chain stun tactic, by these classes at least.  <br />
<br />
It however left one little loophole in the game, Paladins and stun. <br />
<br />
Prior to SoL, the gap between warrior/knight hps and AC was meaningful. We have seen the parses, It takes a significant amout of AC to really make a difference. 200-500 AC to make it noticeable. With SoL/PoP AC on knights shot up dramatically. To become similar if not exceed most warriors. Also The HP differential used to be real, I remember prior to SoL, I would have twice the Hp's of a similar Paladin, now if i have 500 more I am lucky. And with PoP mobs hitting for 700+ well that 500 hps doesnt mean all that much. What that does mean is that the 700+ hitting mob withh destroy a caster class in 1-2 rounds, so if there is any loss of aggro by the MT, half the party can die almost instantly. <br />
<br />
This has made the importance of Aggro Management the MOST important aspect of the entire EQ endgame, EXP or RAID. The mobs do so much DPS, that if a caster gets summoned for more than one round, he is dead, simple as that. Now the paladins say, well then make us MT's on Raids, give us your job as warriors. give us defensive... <br />
<br />
A raid is a different situation than a group exp situation. With a group your goal is to kill as fast as possible, grind out the mobs get the exp. A raid has entirely different goals. Kill the big boss mob, get flags, get loot. Everyone knows this. You do not raid for EXP, and at our level you very very rarely can group for a meaningfull loot upgrade. So on raids, people have more resrtraint, they will hold off on chain nuking, they will cast jolt, they will FD, they will evade.. The speed of the kills is not as important as working together to succeed. <br />
<br />
In an EXP situation, Speed Rules. People can say that warriors can tank as well with a disciplined group, that is wrong... we can tank BETTER with a disciplined group. The problem is, with PoP no one wants to be a disciplined group, they want to crank out those 2 AA an hour. They want to get xp no stop. With a warrior as MT and a disciplined group, no slow on the pull, no chain nuke, wait for assist.. you WILL NOT get those 2 AA an hour... <br />
<br />
So to get back to the original question...<br />
<br />
Knights - still second rate tanks without aggro lock? Knight have always been supposed to be SECONDARY Tanks. That is what they were designed for. They were never intended to be Main Tanks, except in an emergency, or a non-ideal situations. <br />
<br />
With the Aggro lock, in PpP, in a GROUP EXP stiuation they are now the IDEAL tank.  <br />
<br />
To which response the paladins will say, but you are the ideal raid tank. Lets look at this.. How many warriors do you need on a raid? defensive 3 min, 9 min reset.. if you swap MT's continuously and ALWAYS have a warrior defensive. 3 Warriors on a raid and you are complete. No need for any more. Now, how many EXP camps are there in the game? Lets just look at Tier 2-3 I waould say easilly 5 in each tier 2/3 zone? so thats what  30-40 easilly? And how many effective raiding groups are in the pre-elemental planes at one time? 2 maybe 3?  so not incuding paladins on raids, BSS, LoH rotation etc.. there is room for 35 paladins and 6 warriors in tier 2-3 at a time... THATS what warriors are complaining about. <br />
<br />
I guess warriors could ways go to Velios/Luclin and MT there and 3 days later walk out with an AA point...<br />
<br />
to sum up.<br />
<br />
Stun -- unintended consequence of added aggro makes Agro Lock a fact of life.<br />
FT-VoQ- Makes mana no longer a concern, infinite stuns, no need to worry about healing downtime.<br />
EXP MODS- insane exp modifiers in PoP made it the ONLY place  people want to exp.<br />
AC/HP/Mitigation - Knight have easilly made up the gap in the once Warrior dominated stats. No longer is the warrior advantage noticeable.<br />
<br />
 PoP has made the Paldins the prefered MT not through intended design, but none the less they are now the ideal Tank for all except Boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the height of hypocracy, as the thing that made Paladins and SK's viable tanks was improving melee defense to barely noticeable differences from warriors, stepping all OVER the warrior's &quot;main role in a group&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]How bout asking for something that helps the whole group like an ability that when you turn it on everyone in the group gets some benefit.

<br />
Then suggestions as to how to make us cut into bards' primary role of group combat enhancement.   The fact is, warriors, by having their melee defense &quot;advantage&quot; disappear to almost nil when not using defensive disc, has acheived the same result that you're proposing that cutting the artificial aggro gap would produce.  I suppose it's ok because you benefitted from that though, and now have carved a niche for yourself that you want to be protectionistic over.</div></div><hr />

Adarian, you play in some pretty low risk groups.  Paladin heals are incredible in a few situations.  Most clerics I play with like the idea of backup healing, and I must admit that some camps are pretty impossible without someone to heal the cleric on a multi-mob pull.<br />
<br />
Not to mention what happens when only the cleric dies in a pitched fight?  It's happened quite a few times to me in Castle2 in plane of Fire.  Paladin heals and rez are pretty damn useful on tougher camps.<br />
<br />
Paladins own, I think they are well balanced within the general sense of the game, and don't want to see a single change to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've really only ever had dps as a &quot;class advantage&quot; in xp groups.  I guess you could update warrior dps to create that large gap again, although it would wreak havoc all over the place with casters.

Our job is to tank.  It is the only thing we do well.  Paladins have utility, warriors have none.  Is paladin utility enough to get them a group if they lost their agro lock?  Probably not, but it is something to look at.<br />
<br />
You get aggro like you want then paladin and SK's will HAVE to get something else or be dead class's <br />
<br />
Actually, a large number of us do not want knight agro, in fact we don't want knights to have knight agro.  We think that agro lock is an unbalancing thing, and to fix warriors involves nerfing knight agro.  There is a large amount of disagreement with this, but is one of 3 schools of thought on how to fix warriors.  That noted, I do agree that knights would fall on hard times without their advantage in agro.  This does not meen that either knight class lacks for utility tho, merely that it is only part of the solution.<br />
<br />
 If you do not think you are good enough in xp groups then how bout asking for something that doesn't break right into another person main role in a group. <br />
<br />
Tanking is our role.  Let me repeat that.  Tanking is our role.  It is all we have.  Our problem is that the other 2 tank classes(not pure tanks, but hybrid tanks mind you) that fill this role better in PoP.<br />
<br />
Even that will sooner or later cause some mudflation but it will not be as fast or as overdone as just taking a class's only current role of any worth and moving it to your own class. <br />
<br />
You mean like knights took over our only role?  Warriors are tanks, it is what we do, it is all we do.  We have zero utility.  Paladins may have only one &quot;role of any worth&quot;, but warriors have only one role, period.  The sad part is we cannot do our role often any more, becuase 2 hybrid(and I make this point again, not pure tank, but hybrid...you know 3/4 tank, 1/4 caster or whatever) classes have gotten to be better at it than us, and are there for prefered.<br />
<br />
Trust me Adarian, I understand why you are standing up for your class.  Why you are downplaying some abilities and trying to defend you role as primary exp tank.  Life is god right now for paladins, and SoE has a tradition of breaking things they are trying to fix.  From your point of view, it is better to have warriors relagated as third class tanks rather than take the chance that you might get broken to fix warriors.  Just do not expect us to agree with you. <br />
<br />
As I believe I stated earlier in this thread - if people do agree that aggro lock is 'required' (the arguement has far more relevance to an SK than a paladin though I still believe) then I've asked for suggestions that people believe would give knight classes enhanced desirability in a group to make up for it. I've got a long assed post I oughta make at some point about this , maybe later  <br />
<br />
This coment is from Valeris, who started this thread.  Note that he(or she, sorry if I guessed wrong) is trying to find ways to keep knights desirable in exp groups.  We do want knights to be just as wanted in exp groups as us, we do want balance.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Val, looking forward to that long assed post:) .</div></div><hr />

 Knights have always had aggro mastery , the only diff was pre-pop warriors were seen as the better tanks and mobs didnt hit as hard so it was not a big *boon* to the knights . Now in PoP you have mobs hitting so hard that the casters are more worried bout saveing their own ass's so knight aggro has become a premium.<br />
<br />
 Easiest solution i see is simply make warriors the better tanks again  , leave knights with the aggro , its quite useful for tanking the mob till slow lands , then they can lay off the aggro and let the warrior take over , but the warrior must be sufficiently better at tanking to make this a desireable stratagy.<br />
<br />
 If this was done then BOTH warriors AND knights would have a role , sure it may leave less spots in group for monks and rogues , but who really cares bout them ;P .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is people Knights had the number 1 slot in tank aggro from the original release with the spells stun holy might and force. We did not usurp your role by getting more aggro added in later the aggro was ALWAYS there. The only thing that changed the roles is SoE making mobs hit so hard that aggro &gt; tankability unless that tankability was 50% or more better. Its the fact that a 3k hp caster does not last 4 rounds of unslowed meel from a double 650 hitter or a quad 500 hitter in the tier 3 zones. That makes them take the aggro over the tanking no matter what the difference you make in tanking as they do not want to die. Noone usurped your role by getting wonderous additions to aggro as we were always better at aggro, it was usurped by the damage that the mobs do now and the amount that effects caster class's. The thing is that the aggro really on matters on a unslowed mob. a mob that is slowed takes a bit to kill even a 3k hp caster so only up till the mob is slowed does the aggro matter that much in the first place. Now if the mobs were not slowable then you would see a large return to warriors as the chosen tank as well as the difference in tankability would mean more as you would have much less aggro problem at the start from debuff/slow happening as it would be pointless with it being immune to slow. So one answer to your problem would be to make most pop mobs unslowable. but that will not work either as then shaman would mostly be out of a job in xp groups as well.</div></div><hr />

This is a good point, why not leave aggro as it is and make us better at taking damage. Instead of further blurring the lines between the tanks, give people a reason to put up with inferior Warrior taunt.<br />
<br />
Of course any changes to our damage taking capability should be added to the naked Warrior, not added via gear. Regardless, *something* needs to change.<br />
<br />
As things stand now, Warriors are not even close to Knights in the value they add to a group. Almost every night I am with the same group. This includes my friends level 62 SK.<br />
<br />
I have a 700 HP advantage over him at the same level (62).<br />
<br />
He taunts better, adds more DPS, has better AC (although as an *Agnostic* Warrior (different rant) in a small guild I had to sacrifice a fair amount of AC to get decent HP) and at the same time he adds vastly more utility. Oh yeah, and with spells, (Bond of Death, Lifetaps) he closes the HP advantage. Overall there is no contest, he is a much better tank.<br />
<br />
My advantages other than HP? Umm, Defensive (what a curse this discipline is), Fortitude (although SK has Harmshield).<br />
<br />
Now I sure as hell don't want SK's nerfed, my friend is having lots of fun with his. I just want to feel like my Warrior is as valuable to the group. Dammit I want to be main tank, I offer nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dammit I want to be main tank, I offer nothing else.<br />
<br />
Basically this is the point, isn't it.  We, Warriors, offer nothing else that you can't get better and more of in some other way, unless we're tanking.  And currently even tanking you can get better, it just happens that tanking is the best thing we do.<br />
<br />
To add enough additional 'tanking' to a Warrior to make him attractive when compared to the 'snap aggro' of a Knight, you'd almost have to give him the ability to stand up to unslowed PoP mobs for a good 10 to 15 seconds without running the risk of death.  Otherwise the slower is still going to get aggro.  And the problem hasn't gone away.  No one cares how well a tank can tank if he can't focus the mob's attention.  Unless we can tank an unslowed PoP mob long enough to ensure aggro control giving us additional 'tankability' accomplishes nothing.<br />
<br />
The only other approach they could possibly try would be to drop the DPS of PoP mobs.  This of course would make things less 'challenging' for people.  But I would offer up this, at this time the only ones that the game is really challenging for are people who play with Warriors.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the right answer is.  Increasing our aggro control will reduce the challenge, of course it will, but it will at least put us on a more level playing field with the Knights, who already trivialize aggro control.  <br />
<br />
Decreasing Knight aggro control, while adding back in more challenge, removes or reduces an areas that has always been one of Knight superiority.  And it sure as hell is going to piss off the Knights.  But it would also add back some of the 'challenge' and force people to use good aggro control tactics.  Maybe it's worth it, I just can't say.<br />
<br />
Increasing Warrior tanking isn't really going to make as big a difference as people think, I suspect.  With Knights trivializing aggro control and slow trivializing mob DPS, there currently is no real reason not to use a Knight.  Being able to slow immediately is a huge huge safety factor for everyone.  Being able to unload on the mob almost at will has a huge huge impact.   How well would Warriors have to tank to make giving them 'solo' time with the mob worthwhile?  How much slower are people willing to go just to allow the Warrior aggro?  I'm thinking that in general people aren't going to want to give up the benefits they have with a Knight just because a Warrior can take a better beating, since Knights take a beating well enough and the snap aggro they represent allows so much more flexibilty for everyone else in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glatius, you and I have gone back and forth on this, but I want to make the point again. BTW, this is not a flame, and I would prefer for it not to be side tracked and turned into that sort of thread.<br />
<br />
Your post above continues to neglect my preferred solution, even as you state &quot;The only other approach they could possibly try would be to drop the DPS of PoP mobs&quot; - the other approaches being:<br />
<br />
&quot;Increasing our aggro control &quot;<br />
&quot;Decreasing Knight aggro control&quot;<br />
&quot;Increasing Warrior tanking&quot;<br />
<br />
There is, in fact, another (superior IMO) approach which is less intrusive, and seems to me to be well worth considering, since it addresses the CAUSE instead of the SYMPTOM (which is unfortunately what most warrior-specific &quot;solutions&quot; I see posted here do):<br />
<br />
Attach a real cost to knight snap aggro in terms of mana and thus downtime. Whether this is done by making low mana pally aggro spells non-aggro, or mobs in tier 2+ zones immune to them, or whatever mechanism, I don't care. The point is to confront groups with a clear tradeoff, and one that does not overwhelmingly favor pallies, as is currently the case.<br />
<br />
Were that to be done, would some xp groups still choose pallies? Of course - because the risk of death is still lower for those groups, especially ones with chanters who choose not to (or do not know how to) practice aggro management. But those groups would not be making the uber-AA they are now due to the required med time for pallies using expensive spells. <br />
<br />
However, groups that prefer a little risk and challenge in their xp game would no longer be penalized in terms of xp rate, because with careful aggro management, these warrior-MT'd groups could keep pulling while the pally-MT'd group is sitting on their asses waiting for Mr. Snap Aggro Extraordinairre to med. But these groups run the risk of more deaths, so things balance out in terms of MT selection criteria.<br />
<br />
In this way, you don't have to directly nerf pally aggro, you don't have to break warriors to be as overpowered in this department as pallies, you don't need to modify DPS on PoP mobs, you don't reward behavior on the part of casters that most agree is reckless and unskilled, and you don't penalize caster behavior that most would agree is more skilled and nuanced.<br />
<br />
That said, I would not mind seeing warrior tankability gap with pallies be addressed (and plz do this in some way that does NOT involve itemization!). <br />
<br />
Between the two of these I think a balance could be found where both pallies and warriors could be made happy.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is: it's not about aggro. It's about xp. I think we almost all agree on this. Groups now choose pally MTs because xp flows faster with fewer deaths than with warriors MTing. If you change the driver (xp rate) then you change the behavior (MT selection criteria). I think this is the more sensible approach since it addresses the high level problem (cause) that we are seeing instead of the specific by product of warriors getting the shaft for tier 2+ xps groups (symptom).<br />
<br />
And allow me to pre-empt the old 'you can't change human nature' argument by stating here that I am not talking about changing human nature, but rather altering conditions to lead to a change in human *behavior*.<br />
<br />
Now, to tie this back to Valeris original question:<br />
<br />
Given this, is it still true to say that they are entirely dependant on their aggro generating ability in order to be considered for the tank spot in a group?<br />
<br />
If knights were to loose their aggro advantage, how badly impacted would their ability to find a group be?<br />
<br />
I would say that groups are looking for one thing when they look for an MT for a tier 2+ xps group: fastest xp rate possible. Pallies aggro generation ability is uppermost in groups' minds atm it is true, but only because it does not come with significant downtime attached, which would after all tend to cancel out the aggro advantage as part of the total package.  <br />
<br />
If this downtime were part of the equation, even though aggro ability remained untouched, then knights would be impacted in their ability to find a group only to the degree that warriors came to be seen as viable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While your arguement has some merit, I don't deny, it seems to me that basically you're saying that the game should be made less fun for Knights in order to address the current situation that it's less fun for Warriors.  What exactly do I mean by that?  Allow me to explain.<br />
<br />
Things, which to me are not fun:<br />
<br />
1. Sitting around medding when you could be killing.<br />
2. Having people in your group dying when you could be killing.<br />
<br />
Now, Warriors currently generate more of situation two than Knights because of aggro control issues.  If the changes you suggest are implemented then Knights will have more of situation one than Warriors.  Net impact is that groups with Warriors still have plenty of 2, groups with Knights will have plenty of 1, and no one is having more fun.<br />
<br />
Personally, I find having my slower getting the crap beat out of them regularly as annoying and not particularly 'fun'.  Yes, people claim that it's not required, but numerous slowers I've played with have it happen on a regular basis, some of whom I personally felt were very good players.  And this is even with me using dual wielding slow weapons or a high damage procing 2hander. I also find having characters like Druids feeling like there are entire lines of spells (primarily their dots) that they can't use with a Warrior tank due to the aggro as being counter productive.   If people are going to group, shouldn't they be able to use their abilities fairly effectively, even if they have to use a bit of care?  Should it really be the case that with one type of tank you should have your hands tied so that you use a third less of your capability on a regular basis?  Just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.<br />
<br />
I think Warriors have too little aggro control.  I think Warriors need some more, so that people playing with them can, within reason, use much of their functionality without constantly being in fear of the beat down.  And my observations are that currently this just isn't the case most of the time.<br />
<br />
PoP mobs have to much DPS for them to be ponging around on people.  Warriors have too little initial aggro to stop them from ponging around at least to some degree (slowing being the big pong generator).  People should be able to perform their core functionalities with any tank and be reasonably confident that using some thought, some prudence, and some care will mean they need have no fear.  And Warriors duel wielding EB weapons or BoW aside, that isn't the case for most Warriors in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">babytank</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read the majority of the posts and I think paladins and sk's should stay the way they are.  THey are finally coming into their own in the end game.  With that being said. Warriors should get an increased aggro booster not to the point of sk or pally but much much higher than it is now. If you watch a warrior vs any other class warrior has the lowest taunt in the game. If we arent able to get a mob to hit us wtf do we have so many hp.  <br />
<br />
This can be accomplished in many ways.  One would be to give us warrior only weapons that proc a significant % more aggro than what is available without being in uber guilds.  Another would be to make our taunt more effective.  Our disciplines are nothing compared to stun.  I would gladly trade half my aa's for pally or sk ability to hold aggro.  Anything pertaining to hp, offensive and defensive everyone gets.  What makes warriors stand out? AE taunt...thats almost useless in xp groups.  /shield...another mostly useless addition.<br />
<br />
Warriors have more hp/ac than pallies/sk's....yeah right...1 hits worth in any zone above tier 2.  My sk friend has less than 500 hp less than me and we are in similar armor and similar weapons.  Mobs in pop hit for 500 average.  Ac...does it honestly make a difference between 1250 and 1300? NO...So warriors have become a raid only class.  I sit lfg for hours as a 65 warrior where as my 65 sk and pally friends are always in a group.  <br />
<br />
As for raids...SK and pally are more useful than they think.  Their spells make them a much needed addition.  I don't like seeing a pally or sk on the tank list.  THey shouldnt be there.  Not on a tier 3 or higher zone.  <br />
<br />
Adding warrior only weapons with better aggro that are not limited to tier 3 boss mobs would greatly increase a warriors groupability without really changing end game encounters.  Making our innate taunt button more effective would also not change end game encounters.  Adding about 1k more ac and 2k more hp would make warriors a true tank. Warriors have had so few changes made to them that we are due something.  I personally think by adding a few minor things would put warriors back where they belong. And wouldnt change the game so much that paladins or sk's wouldnt get groups.</div></div><hr />

All I ever wanted to do is to tank. (Yea you probably know Im playing a pally as my main char by now.)<br />
<br />
During my first two and a half years playing this game (pre PoP) I was always playing the gimp class that was going lfg for hours and generally having a very hard time getting pickup groups.<br />
<br />
It just puzzles me that so many ppl who post on this board are so little aware of their own history as a class and the history of the classes they are comparing themselves with.<br />
<br />
Not gonna start a flame here but I think its pretty short sighted to 'upgrade' the warrior class by wanting to nerf the knight classes that have been suffering for years and just recently been somewhat fixed.<br />
<br />
Lets face it taunt is the key feature and class defining ability for knight classes. If you gonna screw knight taunt you might as well screw warrior defensive and evasive discs, or encs ability to mez, or shamans ability to slow or clerics ability to heal or.....<br />
<br />
If you want something fixed please come with some constructive ideas, like adding extra hate to warrior kick (mobs should be pretty darn pissed by a kick in the nuts imo), or give warriors innate hate proc on weapons or something along theese lines.<br />
<br />
Picking on others to fix your own problem only gonna lead to more problems.</div></div><hr />

Most of you warriors are complaing about initial aggro not really holding onto it once the mob is slowed and on you. So what you do is make a new warrior ability called &quot;Fierce challenge&quot;<br />
Now what fierce challenge does is give you a instant cast push button amount of aggro right off the bat. Make it scale due to level but i will go with the lvl 65 version for explanation.<br />
At lvl 65 the fierce challenge ability would do 3 things when pushed. It woould give 1000 aggro to the warrior on that mob. Second it would put a buff up on the mob and third it would put a buff up on the warrior. The buff on the mob works like the C Heal buff from the kunark Cleric BP. basically it stops any other fierce challenge from beiing dealt to the mob. The buff on the warrior works differently. It is a Deaggro over time. Lasts 4 ticks and every tick it makes you loose 200 aggro. So overall you still get a push button spell that is 200 aggro even after the deaggro is over but it is 1000 aggro at the start when you need it most to keep the mob off the slower. <br />
This leaves paladins and SK's as the 100% aggro lock champ and still answers the problem of initial aggro for warriors. Will paladins and SK's still be able to keep the mob on them 100% of the time? Yes. Will warriors be able to keep the slower alive with this and then be able to keep the mob on them unless someone does some pretty damn high aggro? Yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With my Greatstaff of Thunder, I only need that on one mob every 10 minutes on average.  Every other mob (in BoT this is) I proc very soon and am able to maintaint aggro through the slow without issues.  On that one in 10 minutes tho I have to Taunt off the slower, and if its a robe then they dont like that.  <br />
<br />
In that case I can fire this ability, kind of a reverse DA.  <br />
<br />
I like it because it is temporary and in the time the effect wears off I better to have proced.  It increases that likelihood and allows the cleric to lay in a quick heal to save teh robe.  But from what I can see it isn't too powerful that makes things trivial.  <br />

From you and your fellows' previous arguements I would think you would expect knights to suddenly loose their ability to find a group -  do you see your total aggro lock as advantage enough?

<br />
I'd like to see an inherent increase in warrior HP and resists. Make it so that everyone WANTS the agro on the warrior.  And the 2k AC  mentioned by the time you got to L65 is reasonable.<br />
<br />
It should be an improvement that affects the entire warrior class, not just high end or end-game players. AA is not the way to fix things. <br />
<br />
I can pull agro from an L65 Pally right now (I play an L58 warrior). I just can't keep the agro if he wants it.  <br />
<br />
I also think that bandaging needs to be improved for the warrior class. More healing per attempt and higher at the end. 80% for the warrior class would help those warriors who have to solo at times. Not trying to make warriors a solo class, just give them the opportunity sometimes.  OR provide either a class innate higher HP regen or a wide range of moderately available HP regen items.  The rarity of HP regen items is so sad it is like a sick joke.<br />
<br />
HPs have increased substantially over time in EQ yet the percentages for warriors have not.<br />
<br />
I think that increasing melee damage, as has been mentioned by SoE may help to solve some of the taunt issues.  <br />
<br />
The effect of spells for pallys and SKs has been underestimated by the developers. There has been nothing in warrior gear or innate abilities to balance that.  A real increase in HP or even innate damage avoidance would help that. <br />
<br />
Make it so people want BOTH a warrior and a Pally/SK in their group. Taunt can work as is, IF something else is adjusted on warriors to make them attractive.<br />

<br />
Increase the defensive spread between warriors and knights...<br />
<br />
And give knights some &quot;Aggro Management&quot; spells, meaning spells that could pull the kind of aggro that knights are capable of pulling, yet being able to do it through another player.. i.e. a warrior.  <br />
<br />
The shadow knight casting his darkness spells THROUGH a warrior so that he's directing the warrior to be hit.  The Paladin stunning THROUGH the warrior, using the warrior as his instrument by which to call divine wrath upon his enemies.  <br />
<br />
Clearly the best way to make this work is to ensure that the warrior is a better &quot;tank&quot; by enough of a margin that it makes sense to have the warrior tanking as opposed to the knight, but the warrior alone has all the current difficulties that warriors are famous for, and the Knight alone is enough of a burden on manabars to make a group go for the combo... When you put the two together, it makes a tanking powerhouse!</div></div><hr />

<br />
How to make a difference meaningful enough that groups will ~NOTICE~  the difference without making warriors have way to many hp's to be balanced though? the old aggro vs durability arguement proved to be unuseable - it just got the knights stuffed a la kunark. Now with aggro being the prime need (so long as your tank can tank) it's our turn to be on the wrong side of the equation. Dropping knight hp's certainly wouldn't be good for the knights - particularly joe average knight.<br />
<br />
I just don't see it as possible to come to a balanced conclusion so long as aggro lock vs no aggro lock exists, better in my opinion to make ponging a fact of life because then, just maybe, there's more of a market for a second tank in group when the shit hits the fan or the first tank drops (less quick the slow can be landed more tanking risk) - in that situation knight abilities give them an additional plus point to add them to the group (I was personally mulling over the idea of leaving SK's with the ability to produce aggro near to where it currently stands but making it ,as you mention, provideable only through another tank - Warrior, pally or SK) ... probably SK's would need more to make them group friendly without aggro locking as a fact of life....<br />

<br />
Windblade<br />
<br />
Not to mention the droppable loot out there in POP thats knight only and goes for peanuts, the Pally killing  Sword of Lost Crusades from Ssra (easier kill than AoW), Seru sword etc etc....<br />
<br />
If neccessary I would have no problem with a further upgrade to taunt and other skills for knights so that they can perform on par with us... although then some form of group utility for a warrior would be more important as a balancer....<br />

<br />
This idea that they should be as good or better than warriors has me totally perplexxed. they should be able to SUBSTITUTE for a warrior, but there should be some drawbacks if so. they SHOULD NEVER be prefered over a warrior for a 'TANK' spot. The whole pal/sk myth that they have perpetuated just amazes me.<br />
<br />
 It amazes me that warriors accept this to any extent.<br />
<br />
There should NEVER be a question of who is the better tank.<br />
<br />
NEVER.<br />
<br />
Is there ever a question <br />
of who is the better healer?<br />
or who is the better slower?<br />
or who does the most DD?<br />
or who is the better buffer?<br />
<br />
NO!<br />
<br />
why is there a question who is the better tank?<br />
<br />
Warriors are the ONLY TANKS in the game, Knights are not pure Tanks, they should never be chosen over a warrior as a tank, they should be chosen for their added benefits and abilities.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------''<br />
<br />
When defending their skills.. dps/aggro etc...<br />
they always say that their skills are better BURST, ie BURST aggro, BURST dps..<br />
<br />
remember just before PoP? remember the MB nerf?<br />
do any remember WHY this was done?<br />
some say because Wiz abused it, true.. <br />
what did SoE say? MB would trivialize encounters.<br />
Because the BURST EFFECT.. ie 10 MB wiz would kill AD almost insantly.. etc etc...<br />
<br />
Well SK BURST dps is nice, excep, because of the lowered dps, and the improved mana regen.. that burst can be sustained for extended periods..<br />
<br />
Pal/SK BURST aggro is nice but as we have discussed, it is virtually infinite aggro, not burst...<br />
<br />
I honestly think SoE did not realize this at release, but there is no way i believe they do not re alize this now, and it needs fixxed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if aggro control were the same, then we wouldnt be having this problem.<br />
<br />
We all can aggree the Tanking aspect of the 3 classes is so closs as to be undistinguishable...<br />
<br />
Choose warrior - more hps<br />
Choose sk - more dps<br />
Choose Pal - back up heals<br />
<br />
Right now, War are not loosing groups because we cant tank, it is because we cant hold aggro as well as the other two, AND we cant INSTANTLY get aggro on demand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Seriously monks mitigation is a big issue for them , remembering the screams about nerfing last year? <br />
 Monks can &quot;tank&quot; very well . the only thing they lack is taunt , Ooops , just remembered , all the monks at same level as I am can take agro off me and then FD just for a laugh .<br />
 So why can't Warrior mitigation be improved w/o haveing to resort to huge amounts of AA points <br />
 Less mana usage is an argument but how many groups kill very quickly , stick in a necro or bard and the amount of mana sponging by more healing required doesn't seem to be an issue any more <br />
 Give us something to ensure we don't LFG forever , there's posts on boards about uber SK , Pally or Monk soloing whatever high level mob . I know what happens when I try to solo anything interesting . <br />

I find this an intresting statement, seems to be the standard hybrid response to this issue.  But agro means everything to tank, its the only thing warriors do, you make him 2nd best at that, what does he have left.  Hybrids have a vast array of other spells and abilities, warriors tank, that's it.  The fact that hybrids are able to exploit the game system by using spells to lock agro, it is killing the warrior class, seems intresting that hybrids dont seem to give a crap about that.<br />
<br />
As far as the taunt key being &quot;broken&quot;, it aint.  Works just fine, just as it was designed to work.  It just needs to be upgraded.</div></div><hr />

Interestingly enough there is at least one high level PALADIN, who seems to know her shit (/wave Aeka), that seems to believe that this is exactly the case. She goes so far as to say that until we get a little bit 'extra' BEYOND some more aggro we'll still be broken !  Wish i could just laugh that claim off....:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liakim1</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings warriors.  Sissy paladin here, first time poster here at Steel Warriors.<br />
<br />
I've been following these warrior vs. knight threads (more often warrior vs. paladin threads unfortunately) for many months now.  I generally don't post on the subject matter, as I've never been one to voluntarily jump into the lion's den.  The topic of this thread piqued my interest though, and I feel compelled to add my thoughts on the matter - as welcome or unwelcome as they might be.<br />
<br />
First of all, when I rolled my paladin after first getting EQ, it wasn't to tank - it was because I liked the idea of a savior, if you will.  Saving someone from death or bringing them back from it have always been my favorite aspects of being a paladin.  I never wanted your job, in fact I always held warriors in high regard for what they do - get beat on so others don't have to.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I never got groups based on the fact that I might save someone from death.  I got groups because I had a decent amount of hitpoints, I am a plate wearer and hence have decently high AC, and because I had tools to keep others from getting beat on.  That's fine, I'll tank in a group - I want xp like everyone else.<br />
<br />
If my stuns, my primary tool in my arsenal of preventing others from getting beat on, was suddenly taken away from me - could I still tank?  I'll still have the same HP, still have the same AC, but my tools of agro would be quite sub-par, I think.  Correct me if I am wrong, but in conversations with my warrior friends, I believe warriors depend on DPS, speed, procs, and taunt to generate their agro.  They want best haste, best ratio, meanest proccing weapons, and the taunt button to put them +1 hate on the list during encounters.<br />
<br />
Haste is pretty much universal to melees, I'll dismiss that.<br />
<br />
DPS.  My weapon skills top out at 225 (and they are all there atm).  Archery caps at 70 (I can't hit a kodiak in West Commonlands if I'm right next to it and it's standing broadside to me).  I couldn't say what stat affects it, because I don't know, but I miss generally about 45% of the time, regardless of weapon used.  My ATK is about 1000 unbuffed.  1handed I can do about 35-40 DPS, 2handed I can do 45-50 (at 100% haste).  This is below that of warriors, I believe, though not by much.<br />
<br />
Procs.  Not many paladin weapons out there (droppable I mean) have the mean procs on them.  I have a Massive Dragonclaw Shard, Scepter of Lightning, Windblade, and a Black Handled Bonebreaker.  None of these weapons have hate generating procs.  I have a spell I quested that imbues all my attacks with a 65pt dd proc, but it is very rare and unaffected by any of my melee stats.  So, I'd have to get a proc weapon like a Wavecrasher, Frostbringer, whatever (sorry I don't really know what the good ones are).  Since I cannot dual wield, I can only wield a 9/19 or 12/20 or whatever in my primary hand, cutting my DPS in half really from my 28/30 and 25/25 1handers I use now.  Also, being a paladin, my primary focus stats are STA and WIS - my DEX and AGI are barely over 100, STR is about 150.  Any proccing weapon won't proc much with a 100 DEX I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Taunt.  I have one, you have one, we both know how unreliable it can be.  Add in a bit of uncertainty for me, since mine caps lower.<br />
<br />
So, I still have a few spells I can use though..... the ever popular Flash of Light, for one.  I've tried this one before, and it's dangerous - more dangerous than not casting it.  If you aren't right on top of the mob, it's goin for a run, and coming back with pals.  Also, being a level 9 spell, it gets resisted more times than it's worth having memorized in my experience - and a resisted Flash of Light unfortunately doesn't have quite the same effect as a resisted mez or slow.   Root?  Ahh, a very good spell, I do love this one - but it's the bane of melees.  Too often when using this spell I get rangers and rogues tell me how much I suck at agro because they're getting hit - never mind the fact that they're parking themselves right in the mobs arse and hackin away.  Heals?  Another good attention getter, but nowhere near the effect of a CH in terms of agro, except LH - which has a 72 minute refresh on it.....<br />
<br />
So this is where I stand if you and I go head to head, me without my stuns.  <br />
<br />
As someone stated before, the 3 tank classes all should have their own twist they bring to a group - warriors having increased HP/mitigation, paladins having buffs and heals, SK's having damage dealing abilities.  I'd love for this to be true, but unfortunately if I'm getting beat on, as I should if I am the tank, my healing abilities really don't mean much.  It's hard for me to get off that group heal when getting hit for a double 600.  It's hard to even get off those nice 1.5 second heals.  Heck, I get interrupted alot on Yaulp, if I'm using it.<br />
<br />
So, this is my stance on where I would be if stuns were removed from the equation.  I don't think I'd hold a candle to a warrior, to be honest.  And I wouldn't mind, provided I could get groups based on my other abilities of which I am so proud - but it just doesn't happen.  99 times out of 100 the first thing I hear upon joining a group is 'Mash that stun key you agro-slut, we'll keep you alive, don't worry' /sigh.  But anyways.....<br />
<br />
About us knights being hybrids of warriors and therefore supposed to be inferior - why did SOE give SK's such an amazing line of hate spells?  Why did they give us so many self only spells to boost our haste, ATK and HP?  I really think SOE wants us all in that front slot of the xp group, but unfortunately in the process of beefing us up for the job, they forgot warriors.  I'd really like to see warriors brought forward ALOT in agro generation, maybe not to the 'lock' state knights can achieve, but a fast ramp up and ability to get it back halfway quickly if lost.... that's just me though....<br />
<br />
Please forgive me the long-winded post.  I didn't really intend this much, but sometimes when you start, alot spews out.   I look forward to seeing your responses as well - I do enjoy learning about warriors and their concerns, in a way I think we all become better players the more we know about each other.<br />

Wether that works is anyones guess....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;It's hard to even get off those nice 1.5 second heals. Heck, I get interrupted alot on Yaulp, if I'm using it.&quot;<br />
<br />
How can you get Stun off then if you get interrupted so easy?  Have 80% hps on the pull then heal yourself on inc.  I bet that would piss em off enough that dps and a Taunt would hold aggro.  <br />
<br />
If you take away your stun, then SoE Needs to: <br />
1) Give Paladins equivalant Taunt to a Warrior<br />
2) Make Yaulp a group spell.  I can see this making a Paladin very attractive for a melee dps group, but caster groups would still like Warriors.  I can also see this ReALLY pissing a mob off.  <br />
<br />
I think Pally aggro should be dependent on his holy powers, not a freaking stun.  <br />
<br />
That said, I like pallies having Stun.  I hate grouping in BoT and having casters gate out.  Its annoying as hell having a mob gate out (in BoT their gate hels them 33% too) then to pull him back to camp, then see him gate/heal again and again.  <br />
<br />
I was MTing fine and never losing aggro in BoT, but because of casters gating out all the time I repped our rogue with a Pally.  Loss of dps? Nope, we kept our area clear of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fahrseer</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me state upfront I play a paladin. I have enjoyed reading these threads on Steel Warriors and on Paladins of Norrath, and just wanted to add a couple of comments...<br />
<br />
Stuns are a very important part of what I can offer a group, but I do not disregard my other skills and spells. Most of the spells I get are not as good as those of the parrent classes so I use mine in emergency situations. There is a lot of satisfaction in being the 'life saver' - thats why I created a paladin in the first place. Really, my spell selection shines best in allowing me to actually solo from time to time, something almost impossible for a warrior to do.<br />
<br />
I would be quite happy for low level stuns to not affect (aggro) mobs above the level they were intended. It isn't logical to me for Cease or Desist to aggro a level 60 mob - but it does. I can quite happily use higher mana cost spells and keep aggro, just at the cost of being more mana conscious. Offensive spells should generate aggo - as long as they affect the mob - taking that aggro away would introduce another imbalance into the game.<br />
<br />
I am an average level 62 paladin and so much of the arguments here on parity of HP, AC and such don't seem to affect me. At my level, in a casual guild, there remain VERY distinct differences between my AC/HP and warriors I group with day-to-day. <br />
<br />
I enjoy tanking, but I also really enjoy groups where I grab initial aggro, the warrior then takes it and I back them up, ready to stun again if the mob heads for the casters. This also means I can provide supplemental healing, be ready to root adds and so on, things I would have much greater difficulty doing if I am the tank. Unfortunately there are many people who don't want to take the chance that aggro will be lost and they may take a hit.<br />
<br />
someone wrote<br />

The fact that hybrids are able to exploit the game system by using spells to lock agro, it is killing the warrior class, seems intresting that hybrids dont seem to give a crap about that. <br />
<br />
And this is where it gets disturbing because this is exactly what is happening. In my guild, about 3 months ago, there were (regularly) 8 warriors and 3 paladins and 3 SK's playing. Now there are 3 SK's, 3 Paladins and NO Warriors. The warriors have all either left to go to pure raiding guilds or to reroll new Alts. The reason given is desirability in regular xp groups.<br />
<br />
I am a paladin and I don't like the loss of warriors from the game. I also do not think that nerfing paladins or calling stuns an exploit helps anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I dinged 65 not a long time ago... I'm glad I am no longer forced to xp anymore. I think after ND3 and PE, if nothing change about class balance, I will never ever group for xp again.<br />
It sucks to sweat on my keyboard, hoping for a proc at every pull while the chanter tell me &quot;taunt more&quot;... sometimes (with gguild groups for exemple) its wonderful, I have NP, sometimes... I want to throw my computer through the windows. <br />
I dont have EB weapons, I may have one later, but fighting with Ntov quality gear and cannot do something repetitive like xp, while any other class can relax while playing against trivial content, I cant stand this. <br />
<br />
My opinion is the high level warrior is clearly and only a raid tool. the today warrior is supassed everywhere, except in raid. even in raid, you must always be the best, because a paladin slightly equiped than you will be better (except for 3 mins on bosses).<br />
<br />
Arg, I ranted. well I think the whole problem is because slow and debuffing is now EXPECTED, while aggro rules were set in Velious and slow wasnt needed like it is today. so the solution may be either :<br />
<br />
1 - Raise warrior aggro<br />
2 - Reduce slow aggro<br />
3 - Add warrior abilities (like the &quot;grapple&quot; or &quot;summon&quot; or &quot;pull&quot; we speak about in the Arena forum</div></div><hr />
