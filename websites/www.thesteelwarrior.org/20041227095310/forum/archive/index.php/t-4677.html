<br />
and I just realized something<br />
<br />
I've been using the wrong formula for max damage past 50, but oddly enough it seems to be accurate.<br />
<br />
What was the example above that showed it was wrong?<br />
<br />
290 Str<br />
250 skill<br />
65 level<br />
16 damage weapon<br />
13 damage bonus<br />
<br />
[((290+250)/100)*16+13]=99<br />
<br />
Post 50 I somehow added Level into the equation without thinking (can't remember where else I would have gotten it from as this forum was where I origonally got the equation, but....<br />
<br />
[((290+250+65)/100)*16+13]=109<br />
<br />
A bit closer to your max damage, eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, like I said, I added level somewhere when I was figuring and it works for level 50-56 so far.<br />
<br />
Wonder if there is some other variable that is missing. This one apparently lowers damage after 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any formula is not going to be exact, except by accident. The tricky part is the 'damage bonus' changes that happen at 56,60 etc.<br />
<br />
Having max hit increase by 1 for all 1 handed weapons doesn't fit nicely into any simple formula you can make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i checked my max hit with GSot4W (41d 36bonus) max hit was 278, max crit (if it matters) was 455, the formula adds up max hit to 290. <br />
<br />
i think recording as much information as possible will give us a better understanding of how max damage is caculated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">str in the equation is wrong. str has no effect on your max hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see any atk in that formula<br />
<br />
If so why would ppl want high atk?(although for tanks atk doesnt help as much as to rogue but hey its good to have as bonus) even at max str atk still goes up with effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pure Attack (Ferocity, Ferine Avatar, Vengeance, Aura of Battle, ect) doesn't make max hit go up- It makes you hit for more, more often.<br />
<br />
IE, instead of hitting for max 5% of the time, you might hit for max 10% of the time.</div></div><hr />

And my Frostreaver (damage 42) maxes for 475.</div></div><hr />
