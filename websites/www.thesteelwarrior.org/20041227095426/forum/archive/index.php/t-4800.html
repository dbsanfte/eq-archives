<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive used to work by taking the difference between max damage and min damage, and dividing it in half.<br />
<br />
For example, if a mob hit for 800 - 1650, while defensive was running, it hit from 800 - 1225.<br />
<br />
The new Defensive discipline (and Stonewall) supposedly boost &quot;Damage Mitigation&quot; by 45%.<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem to be the same thing.<br />
<br />
My understanding of Damage Mitigation (as it applies to things like Combat Stability and Innate Defense AA lines) is that it reduces overall damage by X percent (ie: CS3 reduces overall damage by 10%) however, it does so over time and is only really noticable in long term parses.  A mob with a hit range of 800 - 1650 will still hit someone with CS3 for 1650 some of the time.<br />
<br />
So, does the new Defensive discipline just boost the same Damage Mitigation that we may already have from CS3/ID5 AA?  In other words, over time (3 minutes) it will reduce the damage we take by 45%, but it doesn't actually reduce the maximum hit value?<br />
<br />
I'm confused, please enlighten me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavhok</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It operates in almost the same way.  Instead of reducing the damage interval by half, it reduces it by 45%.  The other 5% comes from the innate warrior mitigation that also went in.  You will take the same damage while in defensive that you did before the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 5% mitigation boost is innate and permanent for all level 1+ warriors and stacks with defensive, evasive, AAs, you name it.</div></div><hr />

Looking at boss fights only, it appears that while the max hit/ min hit numbers are the same with defensive/stonewall as they were before the patch, the average hit has gone UP.<br />
<br />
Non-Defensive, the max hit is indead 4% less than it was before the patch, but again, the average hit is higher.<br />

Ignore the non-Defensive numbers for KTXAHR, as I died within seconds of defensive dropping, then the server crashed, and all hell broke loose.  So the average hit, non-defensive, is skewed quite high due to it being only over a spread of 12 attacks that also happened to include 2 or 3 1580 hits in a row (love that RNG)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it seems that the actual Mitigation boost granted to warriors is 4%, as the new max-hit values for mobs are 4% less than before.  Also, this works differently than CS/ID line of AA, as they do NOT reduce the max hit of mobs (in fact, do they actually do ANYTHING? boggle)<br />
<br />
A perfect example is TVK.  His max hit is 1000.  Ask anyone, including casters, and they'll confirm this.  Even with CS3/ID5, which should provide what, 17.5% mitigation boost (10% for CS3, 1.5% per level of ID?) his max hit is STILL 1000.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is, the change to warriors in the patch dropped the max hit by 4% non-defensive, yet we now take on average 8% more damage.<br />
<br />
Something ain't right in Warrior land.....<br />
<br />
FYI: <br />
&quot;OLD&quot; values are for a total of 4 fights on each boss (ie: I had logs for 4 VT raids in December before the melee patch)<br />
&quot;NEW&quot; values are, of course, for a single fight on each boss.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavhok</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were no changes made to the normal combat formulas aside from the damage interval reduction for warriors.  The variance in damage taken from fight to fight can be quite high with EQ's combat system because of the many random elements.  When parsing your DPS while fighting through an LDoN adventure, you'll see a lot of fluctuations.  Like Tarkas said, small changes like whether or not druid debuffs were in can also affect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kavhok, with all due respect, let me ask you this.<br />
<br />
We know how the combat formula works.  It's Damage Bonus, + (N,  [where N is a number between 1 and 20] multiplied by the  damage interval), which is at least partially influenced by AC, and probably the rest by the RNG.  We determined that the boost in mitigation you gave us removed the possibility of a mob hitting us for DB + (DIx20).  So where did the other hits go?  Did you simply change the formula for warriors so that N is 1 to 19?  Did you make some kind of backend change where it removes one DI if the target is a warrior?<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering because I fought Dozekar last nite for the first time (and owned his candy ass, btw), and my log showed a spike at minimum damage (DB + DI), and one at the next step up (DB + DIx2).  That's the first time I've ever seen that happen, but like I said, it was also the first time I fought him.  All I'm asking is exactly how you modified the damage formula for how warriors take damage...perhaps there is an issue in there.  You can use the ol' &quot;RNG is streaky&quot; argument, but you have to admit that some pretty sketchy data has been posted here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We failed phase 3 for the first time since our first time there because we had to chain-rez our monk pullers,  mobs were constantly hitting max damage and raping them.<br />
<br />
Mobs are all hitting high end to max hits most of the time since the patch..  I do not have  extensive parses handy but it's easily noticable.<br />
<br />
If the warrior parses show 8% more damage taken with the mitigation &quot;boost&quot; in effect it's probably hurting everyone else more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zhakran</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still that's pretty speculative...it's either a fluke or a bug, I don't really think anyone would just flat out lie. He said that nothing was changed with the base combat system. <br />
<br />
Then again, the servers have been completely fuxxed since the patch, crazy lag, crashes, etc..... <br />
<br />
So either it's some weird bug or everyone is just paranoid...I doubt the Devs are really out to get us...</div></div><hr />

Khavok the warriors on this board KNOW their characters... Most if not all of us can tell during a fight whether we are taking more damage or not without having to look at parses and hard numbers.  Dont make us all do hours and hours of parsing to show that something is wrong particularly when the batting record on this patch is as horrible as it is.<br />
<br />
Bad code pushed (more than once) on disciplines.<br />
<br />
Disciplines not resetting right.<br />
<br />
Disciplines on wrong timers.<br />
<br />
Numerous bugs that were allowed to go live (dispel negating buffs)<br />
<br />
Casino crashing multiple servers.<br />
<br />
At this point if warriors are noticing increase in damage taken (where according to the patch we should be taking less) than might not it be wise to double check the code with regard to our mitigation boost?...  <br />
<br />
hehe judging from the amount of bugs with this patch thus far that any assurances from SoE that &quot;...x is working as intended&quot; is sounding VERY hollow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThanAlhazred</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real effect of the mitigation improvement is simply a reduction in the max hit by 1 DI.  This is not quite a 5% mitigation bonus as mobs as well as players tend to show spikes in the damage distribution.  So if we were spending all of our time getting pummeled by critters that used to beat us for max virtually every swing we would now be getting beat on for a new, lower, max every swing.   It could very well be that *how* the new max hit got implemented could have shifted the median hit higher, thus on average increasing mob DPS.</div></div><hr />

This is true to an extent, but it is also true that it is easy to be fooled.  Over on PoN they are having a number of pallies saying that their stun agro got nerfed.  Most agree that it did not.  I don't think those pallies who think stun agro was nerfed are lying, just that they where fooled.  When dealing with random numbers, and as streaky as the EQ RNG is, I would have to say without parsing you simply cannot tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is just an issue we'll have to keep an eye on, but I don't think there's enough clear evidence to suggest some new problem has been introduced.<br />
<br />
I just can't see that the change actually means anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here goes.<br />
<br />
the change was to the DB/DI where a mob can only hit you for 20 different numbers. DB is the lowest it can hit, the next 19 are constant, ie; 100min hit the next 19 hits would be 200 300 400 500 etc etc.<br />
<br />
now the new change made it so we only get hit for the first 19 so while everyone else would get hit for 100 - 2000 we would only get hit for 100-1900.<br />
<br />
however the higher AC you have the lower on the DB/DI list you will have.  for example someone with 2000ac tanking Xegony will hit hit for min dmg ruffly 60% of the time and only take 3% or so max dmg.<br />
<br />
but  lowering the defense from 50 to 45 makes it less effective in fights vs weeker mobs. it will be basicly the same for tier 4 and 5 gods but if you are time equiped and are fighting mobs that no longer hit you for max dmg then the 19/20 wont help, but it wont mater cause the mob would be trivial anyways.<br />
<br />
but for people that are still getting hit for max dmg then the defense/5%(19/20) mitigation is the same as it was before but now you always have 5% mitigation going at all times.</div></div><hr />
