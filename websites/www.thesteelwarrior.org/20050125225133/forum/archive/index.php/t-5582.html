<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tagged along on a VZ raid and we won easily, and I was the only person in attendance who could use the scimitar that dropped, so now it's mine. As you can see in my magelo, my two possible weapon setups are GSot4W, or scimitar and cord hilted spike driver. I know the 4winds will easily outdamage the dualwield setup, but it's aggro has been spotty for me, especially on raids, so I'm thinking I should use the dual wield for better aggro. Just have a couple of questions for you all though:<br />
<br />
First, am I right in assuming my 1handers will out-aggro my 2hb?<br />
Also, which weapon of the 1handers should i mainhand? The CHSD is +450 hate, while the OSoW is a dd with ac reduction. Thinking back to my n00b days, when I had a trusty frostbringer for aggro, I know that mobs hate having their ac lowered, so would this fact, plus the extra 2 damage, generate more aggro than the driver?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, you're right, for aggro your DW &gt; 2H.<br />
<br />
 Second, I'd put the CHSD in mainhand. The effect on the Obsidian is nice, but somehow I don't think it'll equate with the CHSD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your 1-handers are going to out-agro your 2h.  I'd try the OSoW in main hand for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. I'd bet the agro from the procs are similar.<br />
2. A lot more DPS.<br />
3. It's been shown that agro from off-hand damage is significantly reduced.  This probably doesn't apply to procs, but I dunno.  People do say that for EB-like procs, the agro seems the same.  There is a small possibility that the agro from the OSoW may be reduced in off-hand while the CHSD would not be, though I have no evidence and am just speculating.</div></div><hr />

Thats the best way to see what works the best for agro.  Right off, I'd say hammer primairy and scimmy off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd try the VZ weapon in mainhand, see how it goes.<br />
<br />
It's an AC debuff. They've always been pretty good aggro. I'd bet the above poster is right, that it'll be roughly the same as the spike driver in the mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happens to be what I use. I put the OSoW in mainhand with BoC in offhand cause of a bit more dps. I have nothing to back it up but I thinks OSoW is like 500 hate vs. 700 hate of EB, just a complete wild guess though. See my megalo.<br />
<br />
I have Anger III on both and dont have much problem with agro lol... but I just doing LDoN's on easy right now. But I have 3 wizards trying to take agro....<br />
<br />
Sure would like to see some data on the OSoW total agro, how could I test to see if its 300, 400, 450, 500, 550 or whatever hate?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenzyBarbarian</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have recently got the Obsidian Scimitar of War and a Blade of Carnage. I see OSoW procs WAY more than the BoC with my dex at 280 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
I use the BoC in main hand and OSoW in off-hand. I never regret getting it , nice looking weapon , good delay , and good stats.<br />
<br />
It is an excellent weapon =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it looks like I might actually have to try both ways myself, and see which I find works better? You mean I can't have the answers just handed to me? Bah you're no fun.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I guess I'll toy around with them for a bit in LDoN. Thanks for your input all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CaeoenMT</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have both.  I've used both.  I prefered using the Scimitar in my main hand for the dps.  That setup provided enough agro for me about 98% of the time.  This was before the addition of incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They proc the same, you're just not seeing the EB procs. <br />
<br />
No,<br />
<br />
The Obsidian Scimitar was a 25% higher proc mod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best keep in main hand I thinks lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over the Xana hammer? Hands down OSoW goes primary. Taunting Blow isn't as good as that weapon's proc. I'd probably have it primary over a BoC too, because of the better ratio and better proc rate.</div></div><hr />
