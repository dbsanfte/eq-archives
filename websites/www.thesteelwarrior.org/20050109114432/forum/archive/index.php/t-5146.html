I vote for both, really. Most of his stuff is completely off the wall, though it does spring from a kernel of truth. It's kind of like someone mentioning it gonna sprinkle tomorrow, and eventually word gets passed around till it becomes a prediction of a gail-force hurricane come tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Please, take ANYTHING you read on the internet with a grain of salt. Not everything in print is true. And also, consider the source of your inforamtion. There is an entire subculture that exists that thrives off of this kind of fantasy and speculation.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it isn't true, just don't accept it for face value until you can verify from corroborating sources. All it takes is for one person to scream fire in the movie theater to create a stampede. Doesn't mean there is a fire though. Only when you smell smoke and feel the heat of the flame should you believe there is a fire.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those were probably the stupidest bullshit articles I've ever read.<br />
<br />
Lets start with the small pox one.  One accusation is that there will be forced small pox vaccinations.  Yet all of the documents state that it is entirely voluntary.  Second accusation is that they will force a draft of medical professionals.  But you don't even have to provide that information.  Though if a medical professional wouldn't volunteer in a time of crisis, then that is quite sad.  And it's not like a draft, it's emergancy hospitals if we are attacked by biological weapons.<br />
<br />
The other article I have a hard time believing much of.  Most of it sounds like to me a bunch of misinterpreted actions that are exagerated and covered with a layer of bullshit.  I went all through public school, I have nephews and nieces there now.  I have friends and family across the country that are in or close to people that are in public school, and there is none of this.  Though a note, the ability of the government to use martial law has been around since FDR.  It's not for an authoritarian government, it's for when we are openly at war in our own back yards and have no other choice.<br />
<br />
The children in the Milbourne Elementary School have been denied breakfast and lunch while being forced to watch terrifying video of terrorist attacks and archived battle footage. <br />
<br />
Heh.  Denied breakfast?  The only time I've heard of breakfast being provided at schools is before it starts, almost everyone eats breakfast AT HOME.<br />
<br />
As for the videos and such, it's called an assembly.  We had a patriotic one once after some terror attacks back when I went to highschool.  We also had a bunch that were just school stuff.  It's not anything special.<br />
<br />
With lunch, they were supposed to get out around lunch time, but it went long (happened often at my school).  Since they were to get out at lunch, why would they even have lunches there?  The kid got home after 1.  Do you always have to have lunch exactly at 12?  Can't wait 2 hours?  Jesus these are sad.<br />
<br />
The children were then marched outside where flat faced prison-style school buses were waiting. The parents I talked to said their children clearly saw &quot;US ARMY&quot; on the side of the buses. The children were then marched back to their classrooms and the uniformed men (not local police) disappeared.<br />
<br />
So, they were marched outside, just long enough to see that it was the army, then marched back in without reason?  Riiiiight.  I guess they just wanted to show off their buses?<br />
<br />
This is the standard conspiracy theory bullshit thats been going on forever.  Nothing special.  All they do is feed off of fears, misinterpritation, and lies.  Look at the rest of the site, does it really look that sane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can remember when a teacher was fired for showing a video on the halocoast because it was deemed to bad and horrible to show anyone but those in the 12th grade, but its perfectly ok for them to show terrorism videos and anything else just so the kids know they will live under marshal law(everyone under house arrest during a red alert, you have to call the police if you HAVE to leave your house, work stops, if kids are at school they are shipped off to a safty house, that sounds like marshal law to me, and is it really okay for them to make things MUCH worse for people for a indefinite amount of time, providing AS much terror?)<br />
<br />
as i said in my other thread tho, read it with a level head so i called my friend and checked, she said that they were shown videos but the way they showed them was quite a bit differnt, they basically split it up in to 2 days, and there was 2 guys there to answer questions from the army(not to far from the norm, had a RoTC camp near the school so people were used to seeing uniforms) and rather than kill lunch off to make room they just had them do an &quot;homeroom advisory&quot;<br />
<br />
videos wernt to horrific, but they reinforced the line about it being for your on safty with 2 towers footage.... not that it was to effective on highschool kids...<br />
<br />
<br />
about small poks being volentary, read the  documents closly, one mentions a controled release of the virus, another mentions president directive, the president directive is where he can call a state of emergancy and force people to get it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I the only person who noticed that Alex Jones didn't/or wasn't able to name a single source for the information in that article?  The parents were either 'too scared to come forward' or he somehow magically 'got a hold of some internal documents.'  The only source he even remotely begins to name is a caller on his radio show, which information is inherently suspect being that the caller could either have been a kook or downright wrong.  Pure bullshit and drivel is all this kind of crap is.  Don't believe everything you read, while there may be a small kernel of truth in it don't be caught up by the reactionaries without seeing some actual proof that stands up to their claims.</div></div><hr />

In the event of a natural gas leak, a felon in the neighborhood, or a national emergency you better believe you may be ordered to stay in your house, leave your house, or do situps 'til the people in charge get tired of watching you.<br />
<br />
Forced vacinations? How about people being confined because they were ill (Typhoid Mary)?<br />
<br />
I want to help you Homeschooled, so listen up.<br />
<br />
Do you know how to tell who the Captain is in a lifeboat? He's the one with the G-U-N.<br />
<br />
If someone in a military uniform thows pencil-like cylinders in a crowded mall and screems &quot;Nerve Gas. Take off the red cap, put it firmly against your thigh and hit the green cap with the palm of your hand!!&quot; you have two choices - do it and maybe live, don't do it and stand up for your rights. You have about 5 seconds to decide.<br />
<br />
Now if your personal convictions prevent you from co-operating with immunization, use of atropine, etc. that fine. A little weeding out won't hurt us as a species at all.<br />
<br />
School evacuations and parents can't pick up their kids in a severe emergency? You bet.<br />
<br />
There really needs to be a compulsory draft in the US soon - seriously.</div></div><hr />

Teaching seriously has to be the fucking worst job for Risk versus Reward ever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My son teaches at a local school. A natural gas leak occured. The Fire Department and Police came and it was decided to bus the students to a nearby Junior High School.<br />
<br />
A number of students decided they were going to walk home. Some called their parents to get picked up. If students just started walking away or climbing into cars there would be chaos and the school would be unable to insure the safe and efficient evacuation.<br />
<br />
The Police acted promptly. They prevented private autos from entering school grounds until the busses departed and insured all students got on a bus. The one parent and three students that did not follow Police instructions were arrested.<br />
<br />
If you or Alex Jones has a problem with this you need help fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylethe</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah - are people still banging on the great spectre of &quot;smallpox&quot;???<br />
<br />
A little knowledge about smallpox... (and why it is our lone success in &quot;eradicating an illness&quot;)<br />
<br />
A person is only communicable with the smallpox virus when it is visibly apparent that they have contracted the agent. There is 0% possibility of hidden carriers sneaking about in the public arena, infecting the populace.<br />
<br />
The transmission distance of the agent is a mere 3meters (9feet), at which point the agent falls to ground (due to the abnormally {sic. rel} large size of the material). At that point the agent dies - it has no dormancy stage where it can re-infect. Contaminated delivery materials have a short &quot;live duration&quot; in open air.<br />
<br />
A mere 10% bleach solution is sufficient as a decontamination agent on &quot;potentially impacted surfaces&quot; - mitigated by above fact.<br />
<br />
The smallpox scare was just a politically expedient device for the creation of certain legislative vehicles. There is minimal chance that it can be used as an impactive biological device.<br />
<br />
On a further note... delivery vehicles for all biologicals have proven to be the single largest stumbling block on the path to &quot;biological warfare.&quot; This, coupled with the fact that the optimum use of biologicals is typically as a drain upon support resources, as opposed to the impact upon the standing ability of any given force, further lessens the potential impact that biologicals could/would have as a weaponized system.<br />
<br />
We should all fear the botulinum that women are injecting into their foreheads on a daily basis much more than the smallpox threat. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">get up to my age (40) and you will become jaded to all the scare stories. at least hopefully you will. lets give a rundown on a few scare stories:<br />
<br />
1) anthrax ... nothing came of it.<br />
2) sarrs .. or however you spell it. much more scare than actual threat.<br />
3) smallpox .. not very communicable (note bubonic plague requires large infestations of rats to even be marginably communicable and even that requires such poor nutrition that people become infested chronically with the rat flea).<br />
4) aids ... supposed to infect a quarter of the american population by 1990. nothing came of it.<br />
5) ebola .. anyone remember this? supposedly the most communicable disease on earth and supposedly always fatal. 10 years ago it was supposed to wipe out the entire world's population in a month.<br />
6) world will use up its oil reserves by 1980.<br />
7) which wont matter because nuclear power plant meltdown would kill us all before that ever had time to happen.<br />
8) which is probably a good thing because if we didnt die from that we would all starve to death by 1985.<br />
9) the world's oceans were supposed to be utterly dead by 1985.<br />
10) better than dying of the inevitable nuclear war that would surely take place before 1970.<br />
11) dont forget the cancer that would kill us all because of the ozone depetion. oh yeah .. the ozone depletion supposedly caused a bunch of people to go blind and it was just a matter of time till we all went blind too.<br />
12) global warming which i remember a newspaper article saying was proven by the severe winter experienced in the US northeast.<br />
13) but before global warming became all the rage the big scare story was global cooling.<br />
14) worst economic depression in history was scheduled for 1985 as a result of the large budget deficit.<br />
15) nuclear war made inevitable because ronald reagan was elected.<br />
16) Y2K bug was going to cause another economic depression in 2000.<br />
<br />
like i said .. im jaded to it all now. dont worry about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, more people die from the flu each year than did from Sars in the &quot;outbreak&quot;.</div></div><hr />
