<br />
This only regards purchasable haste items, and it regards whether to go haste on waiste or back.<br />
<br />
I currently have Greater Cloak of Pernicity and Runebranded Belt (27%).<br />
<br />
My question is do I go CoF with Blood Runed Girdle (Heavy Rub. is too much cash for me) or Seahorse Hide Belt with Pernicity?<br />
<br />
BTW I'm 33 warrior (restarted so had cash) and I like to solo a bit when I can if that helps.<br />
<br />
Cof/BRG total stats:<br />
Haste: 36%, AC 25, STR+15, DEX+9, AGI+24, HP+90 (and resist)<br />
<br />
SSHB/CoGP total stats:<br />
Haste: 34%, AC 22, STR+29, DEX+4, AGI+4, STA+14, HP+75 (and resists and minor stats)<br />
<br />
RBB/CoGP total stats:<br />
Haste: 31%, AC 17, STR+35, DEX+10, STA+20, HP+50 (and resists)<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  I was leaning towards SSHB/CoGP but not sure now.  !*@&amp;#*&amp;  Maybe just RBB/CoGP?  5% haste makes that much difference when soloing?  No stamina with CoF/RPG option.<br />
<br />
Stats for individual items:<br />

Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt <br />
AC: +10 Str: +4 Sta: +4 Agi: +4 Dex: +4 Wis: +4 Int: +4 Cha: +4<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) CoF + BRG<br />
2) SSHB + Hiero (or CoGP)<br />
3) RBG + Hiero (or CoGP)<br />
<br />
Stay AWAY from RBB, the extra haste isnt worth the stat loss.<br />
If you solo a lot, RBG isnt that appealing. If you group its groovy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shorties</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks,<br />
<br />
I finally spent most of my saved money (and from previous life) on CoF tonight. <br />
<br />
Now trying to find the darn belt.  Someone had it but while trying to sell Pernicity/RBG to get the extra cash, they logged or sold it.  *grumble*<br />
<br />
BTW, does CoF have a level restriction before it kicks in?<br />
<br />
I read that RBG (which I had) was 26.  I'm 35 now and just wondering...  thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
ive been thinking about this choice myself as i currently have  a RBG. my inclination would be to go with the CoF/BRG. The cof is only a few thousand plat more than the seahorse belt - but a couple of points more haste and 25 points more hps. sta doesnt really matter atm as i can max that with buffs. plus that extra 20 points of agility is also useful.</div></div><hr />

I sold my belt (RBG) and cloak (Pernicity) and got the CoF but can't find a darn Blood Runed Girdle !  :P</div></div><hr />

First I've heard of that. My understanding was that you get 1% haste per character level up to item max...so CoF would provide max haste at lvl 36.<br />
<br />
Throw it on a lvl one and parse, I don't think you'll see a difference from it to an fbss. until past lvl 21.<br />

<br />
Haste: 36%, AC 23, DEX+19, AGI+19, HP+115 (and FR / DR resist)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't bother with a blood runed girdle.  Get an Axgoreth's Belt of Defense.  20 AC, 15 STR, 15 WIS.  It's no drop, relatively easy to get with a decent group in Maiden's Eye, you can get one within a couple of hours.  Then take that 9K the the blood runed girdle would have cost you and go buy something else.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying the blood runed girdle isn't a better item, but if you have an Ax belt I'm sure you can find something else better to do with that 9K.</div></div><hr />

They are pretty common drops so it should be pretty easy to get one.</div></div><hr />

http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?threadid=865IMHO a 2% increase in damage is, well.. 1/50 more damage than you would be doing otherwise.<br />
<br />
What you really need to look at the the stats of the items, forget about the haste, they cancel out.<br />
<br />
For comparison's sake, I use a Cloak of Greater Pernicity and a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />

SSHB<br />

22ac 75hp 14sta 29str 4dex 4agi 1svALL<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
23ac 115hp 19dex 19agi 15svF 10svD<br />
vs<br />
22ac 75hp 14sta 29str 4dex 4agi 1svALL<br />
<br />
CoF/PBoRH: 1ac 40hp 15dex 15agi 14svF 9svD<br />
CoGP/SSHB: 14sta 29str 1svM, 1svC, 1svP<br />
(the stats above is what each combo has over the other combo. IE, cof/pborh has 23ac and the cogp/sshb has 22, so 1ac is listed for the cof/pborh)<br />
<br />
We'll say you're 60, and get 6hp/sta. (giving 84 hp from the belt)<br />
<br />
CoF/PBoRH: 1ac 15dex 15agi 14svF 9svD<br />
CoGP/SSHB: 44hp 29str 1svM, 1svC, 1svP<br />
<br />
The 15agi is about 3ac. Giving the top combo ~5 more AC than the bottom. (~5 because sometimes items say 10ac yet you gain 14 or something like that). We'll say that 5ac = 14hp.<br />
<br />
So, here you have it, with the stats fully weighed out:<br />
<br />
CoF/PBoRH: 15dex 14svF 9svD<br />
CoGP/SSHB: 30hp 29str 1svM, 1svC, 1svP<br />
<br />
Note: the 29str bonus could quite possibly make or overtake the dps difference of the 2% haste you wouldn't have using the cogp/sshb combo.<br />

In my case, my SCHW worked at level 21 and my RBG now at level 26. RBB would max at level 30 and CoF at 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never heard of worn haste being dependant on level.  I'd like to see the parses.  And since someone else brought up Magelo, figured I would test with them.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=703312 <br />
Show's 21% at lvl 1.<br />
<br />
If someone has parses though, I'd like to see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">read Kaesorn's post below vvvv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a good breakdown in theory Baadan, but when you start worrying about using CoF for haste, you can't just break down stamina into HP directly because you'll eventually want that capped, in which case you start looking for raw HP.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, since you already said you can't afford a heavy rubi girdle, I think you should go CoF and look to upgrade to heavy rubi girdle down the road.  Hard to get 85hp on your back easily, but it's not a problem on your waist slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spell Haste, which is on almost all haste items, does indeed go up in level, and that formula given for Haste is used to calculate the haste given from an item.  The thing is, it's not looking at YOUR level, but rather a level assigned to the item.<br />
Each haste item is assigned a &quot;level&quot;, which is used to calculate the haste.  A 21% haste item is given an effective level of 20 (since the formula goes level +1 for percentages), whereas a 41% haste item is given a level of 40.  I don't know how you'd actually gather the item's assigned level tho.  The highest assigned level that's known is 40.<br />
I believe this works for all worn items (a level is assigned to the item), but I don't know of any worn effect items who's effects scale up like Haste does.</div></div><hr />
