<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>waza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there is a big DPS difference between a 13 20 weapon and a 16 19 one. I tried to search parse in here, but can't find any. I am currently wielding a CHSD with Anger3 aug and usually a CHOS in secondary. I am looking to upgrade the CHOS. 2 solutions occured to me, either i go aggro and i put another Anger3 on the CHOS or another aggro weapon, or i go with a higher damage weapon (16 19, 16 20, 17 20) with no aggro proc cept aug one which will be Anger3.<br />
<br />
In another way, the question is, what is better solution :<br />
secondary with 2 aggro proc<br />
or<br />
secondary with high damage and 1 aggro proc<br />
<br />
here is some combo i thought of<br />
<br />
CHSD + Anger3 and CHOS + Anger3 (easier one to get since i only need Anger3 aug)<br />
CHSD + Anger3 and Great Blade of Storms (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17368)  + Anger3<br />
CHSD + Anger3 and The Rotting Fist (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17385)  + Anger3<br />
CHSD + Anger3 and Double Edged Stormblade (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17254) + Anger3<br />
<br />
I hope i was clear.<br />
<br />
Thx for ur help.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My first thought is,  &quot;are you sure 1h weapons are effective compared to 2h.&quot;<br />
<br />
That being said, out of your choices...<br />
<br />
Augmenting the CHoS would not suck. It already has a nice aggro proc on hit, so adding another should make it an even better aggro weapon.  I'd go this route unless the GBoS is attainable.<br />
<br />
GBoS looks good for the same reasons as the CHoS.  What is your likelyhood of acquiring one?  If good, then I'd augment this.<br />
<br />
Rotting Fist does nothing for me.  DoT = no mez.<br />
<br />
DESB looks like a great weapon, but I believe will produce less aggro than the GBoS or CHoS.<br />
<br />
For DPS I'd go for a GSoT or a Sot4W, the latter being preferred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no choice here the GBoS has the best agro with only a tiny bit worse DPS. Rotting fist is trash. 13dam 20del is trash.<br />
<br />
I personally would not use a 2H.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would say, if you can get the GBoS,get it, its better than the CHoS.<br />
If not, an auged CHoS works really well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CHSD + Anger3 and Great Blade of Storms + Anger3 is by far your best choice. Very solid agro and very good DPS, as good if not better than GSoT.</div></div><hr />
