New beta up to download. 2.8Gb. 1 day to go with their peer-to-peer patcher..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing for a while.  I love the game, absolutely love it.  My devotion was cinched when I ran up a hill to Ironforge in the snow, noticed that the 7AM game time sun was shining off the snow like it often did for me in South Dakota (heh), I kicked up wisps of snow everywhere I went, and I left snowprints.   I think it's FUN, the world is exciting, the quests are engaging. <br />
<br />
I've felt this way with L2, FFXI, and CoH too, and quickly lost interest with all three...probably because my friends weren't playing.  But WoW has been so hyped for so long that my friends _are_ playing this game and it only adds to the fun factor for me. So far, in my measely 16 levels, I haven't seen much I don't like.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, I'm on Test 5, Central.  Look me up as Ravija or Muse.  It's a non-pvp server.  Even if I were ever interested in pvp I sure as shit don't wanna play it during open beta with all the bnet kiddies.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I'm having a lot of fun with the game.<br />
<br />
One concern I have is with grouping.  The players do so much DPS and the mobs have such low HP's that standard EQ grouping strategies don't really seem to apply.  Everyone tries to go all-out DPS, even the healers.  Because of this, the few times that I've grouped to finish some quest it's been a complete cluster fuck.  I expect this will improve as the game progresses and people learn their roles.<br />
<br />
One of the things I really like about this game is the quest system ... I can literally spend 100% of my time working on fun and interesting quests that actually advance my character.  At any one time you can have 20 quests added to your quest log, and there seems to be a decent level of overlap, i.e. you can work on a coupleof quests at a time.<br />
<br />
But ... because the game is so quest-centric, there really isn't much grouping that happens.  Unless you have a regular group of friends you play with, expect groups to stick together for 30 minutes or less.  As soon as someone accomplishes their quest objectives they leave.  This is different in an instanced dungeon of course, and then you can expect to be grouped with the same folks for a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
The devs recently introduced spell reagents, item durability, and a new death system that reduces item durability upon dying.  So far people really seem to hate it, myself included.  It will be interesting to see if it sticks around for very long.</div></div><hr />

You'll be grouping more once you level a bit higher. When you're low, the questing and random xp killing solo is quicker and easier for most people.<br />
<br />
Once they get higher and can't just overpower all the mobs, you'll find groups.<br />
<br />
I've heard the pvp aspect of the durability loss on death will be changed, i'm not sure about pve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as the grouping occurs at higher levels, this game is gonna rule.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda disappointed that grouping isn't encouraged at any way in low levels, but I can get over that.  Don't plan on being low level very long anyway.</div></div><hr />

Anything i spent hours to get by quests or killing only to have it destroyed in the end is just wrong.  i cant imagine people in raids not wearing their best gear because they are  afraid of dying while wearing it.  Or taking aux gear with you wherever you go in case you dying you can just switch it out before dying.  I wont play WoW as long as this feature is around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From where I'm standing, item durability only looks like a penalty for being fucking retarded.<br />
<br />
You lose 1/10 of an items durability every time you die, they can be repaired easily in virtually any town for literally pocket change, and the item suffers no effects until it reaches 0. <br />
<br />
It's not hard to see that it's an additional death penalty, on top of the already very lax death penalty.  It's not a huge deal at all if you can keep from being a bumbling idiot and dying 45 times a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The items are not destroyed, they are just rendered unusable until they are fixed.  I thought I'd hate the item durability too, but so far I like the way the implemented it.  You do loose durability during combat and if you choose to have the spirit rezz you instead of running to your corpse you loose all durability.  That can get pretty harsh on the ol pocket book, but that seems to be how WoW penalizes ya instead of loosing exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Durability loss on PvP deaths has been eliminated as of yesterday/today I think, they went through patching all the servers.  Atm I can live with it in PvE just doing low level quests(21 shaman) but it's going to have to tweaked or something for raiding/instances where you're most likely going to die a lot.  I could see when learning raid encounters easily dying 10 times(100% durability hit), sucks to having to go to repair in the middle of a raid.  Only thing I've experienced so far that's really been a pain was when I died in a cave type area with respawn behind/on my corpse, dying two times trying to run back out of the cave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the death penalty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the death penalty?<br />
<br />
Well, the original death penalty was basically nothing.  You could run back to where you died from the nearest graveyard and you can self rez yourself for no real loss other than the time it took to run from the graveyard.  Then there's the spirit rez where you ask the NPC at the graveyard to rez you which previously would cause an exp hit but it wasn't too big of a deal if for some reason you really needed a spirit rez.  However these were the two original penalties now it's different.<br />
<br />
Now on deaths you take a 10% durability hit on everything you're wearing and that's in your current bags.  The spirit rez has changed from an exp hit to a 100% durability hit and I think some sort of rez sickness(I hardly ever use the spirit rez so I'm not sure, usually isn't necessary though)  Take into account when you do corpse runs you're in ghost form which means you can't see npcs and nothing attacks you.  Once you're near your corpse you'll be able to see where npc's are just so you can find a decent space to rez in without being attacked right away if possible.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoy the game a lot personally just there are still significant changes being done when it's supposed to be coming out in two weeks.  Paladins essentially got their whole playstyle changed around with the latest patch.  Take advantage of the open beta if you can get in(they're not giving out keys anymore atm but maybe later)</div></div><hr />

This isn't a dis on either the guilds or the game, just an interesting thing I noticed: but does anyone else find it ironic that FoH and AF left EQ to play WoW and now reports are that WoW is more casual?  Maybe they wanted more casual, or maybe they just needed something to fill their time; or maybe it isn't as casual as we think right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to download the client right now.  Got into the Open Beta, but the 2.8 GB client is killing me.  I downloaded it once, and it was corrupted.  Downloading it again, but it's faster since I figured out how to do port forwarding on my router.  Might be able to play tomorrow if it doesn't f*ck up again.<br />
<br />
I've heard a few things:<br />
<br />
1. The game has no end-game content other than a few raids in the Open Beta.  In addition to this, I've also heard that Blizzard is purposely withholding the end-game content until the release date.<br />
<br />
2. The game changes, and is less fun at 30+.  However this statement is coming from people that were there in the Closed Beta, and IMO are only comparing it to how it was before the majority of changes.<br />
<br />
3. Durability sucks, reagents suck, the game now sucks.  Again, from mostly Closed Beta people who preferred it the way things were before changes were made.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were also coming from the B-Net kiddies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well WoW gives you the chance to be a casual player but there are also hardcore aspects of it if you want to find them which is why it will succeed.  The casual player will be able to level to 60 still but the hardcore player will be busy with instances(group and raid) and gearing up for raids and such.  So, I'm sure they'll have plently to do.  Reagents definantly do suck though, hopefully they'll be removed or tuned though.  Durability lose when considering raids is also a pain, guessing stuff will be tweaked though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because the game CAN be played casually doesn't mean that is all it caters to.<br />
<br />
It is still very possible to play WoW hardcore.  The difference between it and EQ is that you can log on and play WoW for an hour and accomplish something.  You can't in EQ.</div></div><hr />

WoW can be played casually or hardcore both.  The reason so many eq guilds left eq1 for WoW because wow is just a plain better game.<br />
<br />

There are quests at all levels that can be solo'd for all classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So can EQ, or at least that is what we've been told for five years from both the staff and the players, so that's a pointless statement.<br />
<br />
The point of my comment was that WoW really does, and I know Haass may disagree, cater to a more casual crowd.  The death penalty, even factoring in durability loss, is minor, the experience grind is easier, many of the MOBS are generally easier (in fact, so easy that people tend to solo and not group), quests often yeild the best returns and pretty much anyone can get and complete the quests.  Yes, there will be raid content for the hardcore, and you can even &quot;play&quot; for hardcore hours, but that isn't what makes a game hardcore.   <br />
<br />
Do I think this makes WoW less of a game?  Hell no! I've been playing it nonstop since I started (Ravija/Moriah/Muse on Test 5, yo).  But I do think that it is generally less challenging and generally more fun.  You can feel free to disagree, but commentary from hardcore and casual alike on official boards and other more unofficial-but-official boards like FOH seem to concur with my admittedly-new-player opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok...I'm thinking of trying WoW...what's the latest news from you beta testers?<br />
<br />
I like it.  I haven't gotten very far, been toddling around on a lowish level gnome rogue (I'M SO CUTE!!!!!) and doing quests.  At first the cartoonyness of it put me off then I totally got into it.  It seems like they put a fair amount of time putting &quot;detail&quot; into each race.  It also seems VERY finished.<br />
<br />
I'm sure other ppl can tell more stories about the game, but let me put it like this:<br />
<br />
I work and I go to school, free time is kinda rare.  I logged on three times in the past week to /lfg on EQ, all three times I spent about an hour just chatting.  The odds and ends of friends who were on were not enough to start the exacting type of group required to 'progress' in the game.<br />
<br />
Now I can just logon WoW and go quest, bumble around for 2 hours and then logoff to deal with life.  <br />
<br />
My only reservations about the game is 1) PvP might suck and 2) EQ still has a very immersive and interesting endgame (at least to me).  I'll still be logging on to raid and for pre-determined xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So can EQ, or at least that is what we've been told for five years from both the staff and the players, so that's a pointless statement. <br />
<br />
Difference is that no matter how much people say that about EQ, it's still wrong, and will always be wrong.  EQ is casual up to a point, and that point is about level 10, and then it's fuckin piss poor game design combined with moron developers.<br />
<br />
The point of my comment was that WoW really does, and I know Haass may disagree, cater to a more casual crowd.  <br />
<br />
I don't disagree with that.  But I also see no irony in people who play to win choosing to play a decent game.  Games aren't about playing 10 hour stretches anymore.  The people that did that are out of college, and not single, it's gotta change if you want to have any sort of subscriber base for any reasonable amount of time.<br />
<br />
If playing EQ for 75 hours to get thru level 59 in Kunark makes you hardcore, and that's how you judge a game, then I guess I don't wanna be hardcore anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After playing around in the wow beta some, that's pretty much the same conclusion I'm coming to.  I really like the idea of not having to spend a minimum of a few hours straight to do anything.  (between finding a pu group, getting to a spot, and getting buffs, etc. done...half of the 3 hours is prep)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So can EQ, or at least that is what we've been told for five years from both the staff and the players, so that's a pointless statement.<br />
Being told it and it being true are two separate things. &lt;shrug&gt; Believe whatever you want, it does not matter to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point of my comment was that WoW really does, and I know Haass may disagree, cater to a more casual crowd. <br />
Total bs, it is a more accessable game absolutely.  EQ1 and 2 both have all sorts of artifical time sinks and blocks in place to prevent players playing the &quot;game&quot; from having fun.  Wow does not, if you want to call that &quot;catering to a more casual crowd&quot; then you're welcome to, I disagree.  Mind you I played eq1 hard core in a cutting edge guild for many years so I have some experience with both sides of the fence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW is simply amazing.  If I could discribe it, it would plainly be just &quot;WOW!&quot;  :D <br />
<br />
Anyways, the game is very casual and seems very fast in the starter lvls.  I was lvl 10 before I knew it, and I was still exploring the maps and getting new warrior skills.  I signed up during the week of the 2nd stress test and it was amazing.  Now with all the Bnet kids on, its pretty laggy.  But what do you expect, its free.<br />
<br />
The game is very quest driven, and solo OR group friendly as well.  Some quests can be done solo, because the mobs are single pull.  Others are more like dunegons and requires grouping.  The longest instance that I had to go thru took about an hour and a half, and we killed tons of mobs.  Even the bosses are unique, programed very well to resemble war3, frozen throne maps.<br />
<br />
You will love the game if you've played warcraft 3.  Everything about it is included, storylines and all.  The good thing about this game is that most people will share the same quests.  So you can usually always find people to group with you to kill the bosses and such.  And the bosses don't take a raid force either, a group of 5 can pretty much do every quest.<br />
<br />
The loot system is impressive in that you dont have to kill the bosses multiple times.  If your group kills the boss, and you have to loot an item (like his head or something), everyone in your group loots it.  It really cuts down on redundency a lot, this game doesn't have many time sinks.  Their loot system is automatic, usually you click on a die to roll a number and wait for others to.  The highest roller, gets the item.  You can abstain from that item as well.  Some good items aren't soulbound (no drop) until you equip it.<br />
<br />
At the higher lvls, there are raid type bosses that take a whole raid force to kill.  They have a raid window similar to EQ's, and each person gains a portion of the exp.  Also there is PvP in a Realm vs Realm type manner.  Theres plenty to do at lvl 60.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I haven't been this addicted to a game in a long while.  Im only not playing much now because its about 1 week from release and our characters will be wiped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone posted about death runs as a ghost, another plus about this is that you run faster than normal when a ghost.  I think it's like 125% of normal speed, but it might be as much as 150%.  So corpse runs are shorter than when you are alive ;)</div></div><hr />

Where do you see EQ going long term?  Mobs with more DPS?  More HP?  Another 5 levels? More AA?  You subscribed to that grind, I don't see why any other game would be any different.<br />

I play WoW because it's fun.  There's no artificial timesinks to keep me playing longer, it's just fun.  I'm never sitting around going &quot;damn, this fuckin sucks,&quot; and when I think about EQ for the last year or 2, I can count MANY times when I've had to sit around and do just that.<br />
<br />
I was having fun last week when I came out of Deathknell and an Abomination told me that he needed my help picking Gloomflowers because his hands are too big, I was having fun yesterday when I looted &quot;A talking head&quot; off an undead gnoll and it started a new quest, and I'll be having fun until they take the servers down today.<br />
<br />
I'm psyched as hell about getting my entire crew into WoW and start banging out some of the Elite content that I couldn't do alone this past week.  I don't even think I was this excited about EQ when I first bought it.  Hell, I got home from work for my weekend at noon on Tuesday, and it was wednesday nite before I realized that I hadn't eaten anything since I was at work.<br />
<br />
I'm really unconcerned about longevity from what I've seen so far.</div></div><hr />

You can get the same challenge you got in GoD Trials/Hard LDoN when they first came out starting around level 15 in WoW dungon's.  That right there sells me on it.  Plus there's the questing and grinding (if you really want to just grind).  AFAIK they only released one raid encounter during the beta and folks we're happy with it.  At least I've not seen a lot of bitchin about how bad it sucked yet.<br />
<br />
Based on what I saw in the beta I think that those of us that loved EQ raiding will find the same thing if not more in WoW.  The amount of thought put into the base game system itself is enough to blow my socks off.   At this point in the EQ(2) vs. WoW battle it looks like the guys on the WoW side care about their game more.  They got the love, if you will.<br />

<br />
So far, I have been wildly happy with the regular content, excited about the instanced elite content, and enjoying the hell out of the quests.<br />
<br />
I do wonder what the game has to offer me on a long-term basis.  But, honestly, I'm having more fun right now playing WoW then I can remember ever having playing EQ so even if WoW doesn't have the longevity it is still worth spending however long it takes for me to run through the content.  And if I never run through it all, even better.</div></div><hr />

This obviously means that there will be some bugs and 'exploring' to do when raiding for those on the cutting edge.  But it does also show that they are commited to providing extensive high end content for those players who are at lvl 60.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I managed to get the client installed and running (Sucks it was just before the end of the open beta).  Here's my impressions.  Please note, this is only based on my experience at the beginning of the game.  I feel the beginning is the most important time, as you could get bored within an hour and never play again if the game sucks.  It annoyed me that in EQ, you apparently couldn't have fun until you were high level.<br />
<br />
  First, I played for just one hour at starting a character.  I had to get used to the system, so I gave myself 20 minutes of learning the interface and such.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact I was starting a new character (Warrior), I could get soooo much done in that one hour compared to being able to do...oh, nothing...in EQ1.  I wasn't missing most of the time either, there was more to do than hit autoattack and wait until the monster died or I died.  I was level 5 at the end of that one hour.  I played for several more hours, just running around the world and doing quests.<br />
<br />
The seamless world (sans instances and death/porting) is just awesome.  I love the fact I don't have to zone to go anywhere usually.  The landscape is beautiful (I personally like the art style of WoW, and prefer it to EQ2, myself) and the world is very much filled with wildlife and landscape.<br />
<br />
There's tons of smaller towns and farmlands where NPCs exist and you can do quests inside.  The world is packed with quests, actually.  Many of which are interesting to do.  You even get very noticeable experience from completing them. <br />
<br />
There's a good variety too.  For instance, you have the regular collection quests (ex: gather 12 Large candles), as well as the slaughter quests (ex: kill 10 Kobold Laborers).  You also have the Fed-Ex quests (deliver items to a person in the Major cities).  You also have exploration quests (ex: Go to the mine and search inside...quest is done by going a ways into the mine), and timed quests (ex: get this poison antidote to this guy within 5 minutes).  <br />
<br />
You even get exp for exploring the world.  Finding a new location, to you, gives you a small bit of exp...I got about 75exp for just finding the town I was headed towards...and I managed to level just by entering the main Human city of Stormwind.<br />
<br />
I only got a chance to look at Stormwind, not the other races main cities, but it's very complex.  It's large, and packed with places to go.  Buildings and stores everywhere, different districts, it's awesome.  There's even instanced dungeons within the city (I ran into one that looked like the Stockades...died in two hits but it was cool).  You can ask guards where certain things are, and they'll mark it on your map.  You don't start in the main city, you start in the countryside nearby.<br />
<br />
That's all I can remember right now.  I'll play a little bit more, perhaps as a Horde member next, or stay on the Alliance side.  I simply love the fact you can log on for an hour, and actually get some real progress done.  This is awesome for a time-restricted person like I'll be.  And if you get bored with the area you're in, simply start up another character as another race and get a whole slew of new experiences.  It looked like you could have up to 8 characters, so you could have one of each race if you wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard got it right, no doubt about it.  The game is beautiful, and a lot of people just have lots of fun.  I was just in awe when I started playing, and before I knew it I was in my teens.  The quests are amazing, and keeps your mind off any kind of grind at all.<br />
<br />
Its hard to express in words how great this game is and will be.  I've only seen a small part of the content, and there's a whole nother world!  If you ever get bored of the alliance side, you can switch to the horde side and explore there.<br />
<br />
They just implemented very smart systems I think.  Raids take places in instances where only your raid force is in.  No one can mess it up or already kill the bosses you are after.  If anyone's finished the VanCleef deadmines instance, you would know how awsome they programmed the bosses.  I was just gitty when we fought the boat boss (you'll know what I mean).<br />
<br />
My first trip on the gryphon I was astonished!  It truely is an amazing game that all should at least try out.  There will be plenty of high end content, raids and such.<br />
<br />
There are bosses taht haven't been beaten yet.  PvP in a large scale similiar to DAoC's Realm vs Realm will keep most people busy.  They will have expansions out later and Blizzard's expansions are usually HUGE!  I hope to be able to go through the dimensional rift to the Orc homeworld, or other homeworlds.  There is so much room for expansion.  I estimate this game will be around for a few years to come.   :D</div></div><hr />

Best part about stormwind is the dwarf district...you move in there and the air gets all smoky...it's fuckin sweet as hell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was sceptical at first too, but i down loaded the open beta to play with some guild mates and i was totally sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best part about stormwind is the dwarf district...you move in there and the air gets all smoky...it's fuckin sweet as hell.<br />
<br />
Hell yeah.<br />
<br />
I wish I got to play a dwarf for a bit though.  Stupid job search though, I had to go roaming.  Never got to see the dwarven city.  I laughed when I saw the very first quest for the Night elves.  I started a Night Elf druid, logged in...first quest I got was &quot;thin out the forestlife&quot;.  Weeee....mass slaughter!<br />
<br />
One small problem I can see is that sometimes there's multiple quests requiring you to kill numerous uncommon mob.  However, you can get multiple people in a group and they all get credit for the single kill, so I recommend grouping up with others doing quests like the slaughter ones as you'll all finish faster.<br />
<br />
Corpses don't poof after being looted, and sometimes you can't see quest items until you've received the quest for them.  (For example, I was given a quest to gather 6 silk bandanas from some thieves.  I'd killed these before and never saw any bandanas.  The next 7 I killed had all the bandanas, and then after I turned them in I never saw any bandanas again from subsequent kills.)<br />
<br />
So therefore, if you're with a bunch of people, gather as many quests as possible before heading out (you can have up to 20 at once), even if you have no idea what they're for, as your group may come across the mob type you need and even if they do everything, you can still get credit for it and get the quest items.  There's even a feature called &quot;Share Quest&quot; which I never got a chance to try out so I don't know what it's about.<br />
<br />
There's also a rather neat type of quest asking you to gather a certain number of items, but these items are in chest-type containers laying around.  The interesting thing is, you can't always tell the containers actually are containers until you pick up the quest, as you can't do anything with them (even target them) until you get the quest.  The flowers that are everywhere around the water in the NE land is one example.  Never knew they were for a quest until I got a quest asking me to gather them.<br />
<br />
Can you tell I'm excited about this game?  :p</div></div><hr />

They opened up a rift and The Buring Legion came out and took over the town for a bit.  Was pretty kewl seeing everyone try to take out the lvl 60+ mobs.<br />
<br />
I got in a LOT of dueling in the game before it went offline.  Warriors are pretty decent, but I couldn't beat my bro's paladin which was -2 lvls.  They have similar stats, a bit lower damage, but can heal 3-4 times.  I got him a few times, but only thru interrupts and luck.<br />

May have to quit EQ because feel like I have to box to play any more and would be nice to look at the trees (rather than smack lots of keys)....<br />

<br />
Oh how the times change, eh?<br />
<br />
Why would you want to multibox?  I'm leaving EQ to get away from that shit.  I'll never play another game again that encourages that kind of stuff.  Besides that fact, it's not even really a possibility.  To play classes effectively requires far more effort than EQ does.  It's not &quot;Autoattack and AFK&quot; in WoW.  You can solo from 1-20 for sure (my wife did it this past week) and from what other people have said, 1-60 is definitely possible, tho I can't say first hand on that.</div></div><hr />

I mean sure as a warrior you *can* hit bash and incite etc. all the time, but for an exp grind it's not really necessary.  I was playing my cleric alone a while ago and thought &quot;this is kinda nice, you get to chat for 10 seconds at a time without having to hit anything&quot;.  :p  Having to pay attention for openings and doing &quot;heroic move&quot; combos (that's eq2, no clue if WoW has similar stuff) would detract from the big 3D chat room that is EQ :).  I find that I can 2-box my war/cleric, talk on the phone (headset) and chat on AIM at the same time and still maintain a moderate level of success at all of them.  Of course if I had to actually stop playing and log off once in a while to get things done instead of doing them while I'm playing, that could actually be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Truth is that in WoW, warriors have a bigger role, and their abilities are more important than slam is.  While I'd wager 95% of EQ warriors don't even bother hitting that 0.8 DPS button anymore, you can't get away with that in WoW.  The more you get hit, the more rage you generate, the more useful things you can do with the rage.  Warriors get battle shouts to increase the attack rating of their party and decrease the attack rating of mobs, they have thunderclap (PBAE 10% slow + minor damage), they have the snare (Hamstring), they have AC debuffs, bleed DoTs, and basically manual ripostes in the form of Revenge and Overpower.  The difference between an Auto attack and AFK warrior and one who's actually being played in WoW is going to be enourmous.  That makes me happy.  Skill should play a part in a game...not just time commitment like EQ tries to enforce.</div></div><hr />

Not helping Haas, guess gotta go to Best Buy on Tuesday. BTW I slam keys cause I 6box, only way to stay entertained any more. Hell I 3-6box in raids up to the EP level now (with 6 being usually VT). OoW cant box more than 3 cause of lag issues with terrain and lack of ability to /follow. If one account could keep me interested then that would rock. But it has been 4+ years and I had 4 accounts in DAOC when I was took a break there so who knows. Would be fun to start with one though.<br />

Now here I am back playing EQ again, behind AA's, gear, flags and such trying to catch up.  I'll be caught up in a couple months but I don't want to take that chance of this being another &quot;FFXI&quot; for me and losing more time on a game that I enjoy playing.

<br />
They left out nearly all of the high end raid encounters (they put in a couple so they could use the information to balance the others), the Hero classes (such as Hunters becoming Demon Hunters), and large sections of the world (Apparently there's even supposed to be a quest where 10 Warlock players get together and open up the portal to the Orc homeworld, and who knows when Northrend will go in).<br />
<br />
If you're only worried about the end-game, and not about having fun getting there, then you will want to wait a while after the release so people can get there and test it out.<br />
<br />
Warriors are definitely fun.  There are no Heroic Opportunities though, but there's something close that Rogues have (Opening and Finishing moves), as well as the Druid when they're in Cat form.<br />
<br />
Another thing I've seen is the WoW Warrior doesn't have &quot;Defensive&quot; or &quot;Aggressive&quot; as 3 minutes or something.  It's a stance you stay in until you switch, with each one letting you use different abilities (Like Taunt is only available in Defensive Stance), and allows you to gain Rage in different ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually the one issue I have with what Ive seen and read of WoW so far. They have localised their servers. How exactly its going to work no one will know till logon, but they are essentially splitting the world up and forcing logon to certain &quot;realms&quot; based (I think) on your countries IP addy. <br />
<br />
This has been causing a huge fight all over the WoW boards due to international guilds being forced to splitup. My guild is predominiently Australian and Kiwi but we have some American members, at least one from South America and we have had a number of Asian players as well. How this is going to affect our membership we currently dont know.<br />
<br />
The long and the short of it is, you may not even be able to see the same servers as your east coast friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt it will be an issue in America.  The people complaining about the localized server issues are the euros who want to be in american guilds.<br />
<br />
I mean come on...that would be absolutely ridiculous business practice.  It's something I'd expect EQ to do about 20 years before anyone else did it.<br />
<br />
We need to know the server list so some of us can play on the same server! I mean, aside from getting yelled at any time I make a mistake, I bet Haass would be a riot to group with. <br />
<br />
I was thinking about it this morning actually, I'll start a server thread on Tuesday morning as soon as I get online.  <br />

Oh, and the plan for the current time is to keep a teamspeak server up for my group, so I might get to yell at you in person rather than just using MightyTalk(TM).  :)</div></div><hr />

Then again, it's been a progression that has become tighter and tighter.  But Blizzard does seem to listen to the playerbase (they impliment changes, thinking players will appreciate them and when players do not, they alter and revise to balance gameplay and players desires) so I would be deeply surprised if we are timezone restricted. <br />
<br />
BTW, same server won't work for many of us as I know plenty of you are playing Horde and I am not.  But, hey, maybe we can make rude gestures at each other and sneer  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played in the open beta and by no means am as well informed as the closed beta testers.  I do have a few concerns about the game at this point.  <br />
<br />
One concern I have is with grouping. The players do so much DPS and the mobs have such low HP's that standard EQ grouping strategies don't really seem to apply. Everyone tries to go all-out DPS, even the healers. Because of this, the few times that I've grouped to finish some quest it's been a complete cluster fuck. I expect this will improve as the game progresses and people learn their roles <br />
<br />
I was soloing well into my 30's in open beta.  If players don't start grouping before level 40 or 50,  the quality or competence of the average group member will be low.  You learn your group roll in groups and their isn't any real reason to group untell very late into the game.  This in conjunction with the target market of the game makes me wonder if it will be fun to play at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Another concern is PVP.  Every server is PvP like it or not,  just a different rule set for PvE servers.  I like pvp but their will be (is) class specific problems/exploits.  Class exploits arise or become more widely known, blizzard has a horrible track record when it comes to stopping these types of things in a reasonable amount of time.  (i remember when eq was fresh and they had no problem shutting it down to fix an exploit, would rather have a short down time to ensure integrity.)  WoW will not just be shut down for an emergency exploit fix, it's not the way blizzard operates.<br />

People with EQ or FFXI experience in groups are going to be a huge asset in higher level groups.</div></div><hr />

I will definitely have a UD warrior waiting in the wings tho for when the time comes.<br />
<br />
By the way, from the tone of your post, do you know for certain if we'll be able to create characters on both sides on non PvP servers?  I know PvP it's definitely out, and figured that it would be fine on blue servers, but hadn't heard anything definitive yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a noob open beta tester myself, I can say I was pretty impressed with what I saw. It depends what you want really at this point. While I enjoyed my experience in Everquest, and doubt any mmorpg will ever again have that complete feeling of awe I had when I first loaded up EQ back in 99, I just am at the point in my life where I do not want to ever spend that type of time in a game again.<br />
<br />
The graphics engine in WoW is brilliant imo. I have an old pos computer (poor college student), and WoW runs better than EQ (and looks a lot better while doing it)  does and I have yet to even hit a zone in the game yet.  <br />
<br />
I like the casual aspect to it, in fact thats my main concern really with the game, from a personal standpoint, that it will sooner or later heavily cater to the hardcore types and make it another EQ. I want a mmorpg where I can see most of it without having to devote my life to the game, all the while having the devs keeping the game entertaining. Its a very hard thing to pull off, and it will be interesting to see if  Blizzard can expand the market. My other concern is I hope Blizzard learn fast who and who not to listen too when it comes to morphing their &quot;vision&quot;. Mmorpg players tend to whine like no tomorrow the second they do not have some advantage, we will see.<br />
<br />
<br />
The gameplay is pure fun imo. Open beta was pretty bad as I am sure most of you know. People ksing left and right (well not ksing in the EQ term, but 5 people charging a mob at once to get the first hit in) and doing just dumb things in general (general chat sucked too, its hard to believe there are people this stupid out there, or trolls that are bored enough to start stupid arguments).<br />
<br />
 The funny part was I did not even care if a named was ksed or whatever, because it would respawn fairly soon again. People were less at each others throats because there were no stupid rare mobs that everyone and their brother wanted. Granted that might change as the times go by and you level up, but it was a ball for me at least even though people were just everywhere. <br />
<br />
I also love the questing system. Far more fun to me than grinding, although like someone else said I do hope there is some more incentive to group a little later, I will have some EQ friends with me though so no matter. <br />
<br />
At this moment I doubt I will be playing warrior at retail. I just feel that its time for a change.  I probably will play a hybrid in WoW. Hunter, Paladin, Shaman, Druid, etc etc. But the warriors do look pretty fun and more diverse from the EQ warrior. I like the rage idea too, but I have grown a but bitter towards pure classes. Other classes will never stop bitching and moaning imo until priests are once again just boring heal bitches and warriors are one dimentional meat shields.  While I enjoyed the warrior in EQ, I think I need a good break from that role for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP... I will play on the server with less pvp. I bought EQ game on the first day Tallon Zek opened and joined it. Was fun for a while, but then I started to realise as I got higher in level that mmorpgs and PvP don't seem to work all that well ( again for me at least, too many people make the game unfun imo, they would rather bring their level 40 cleric friend into newbie territory than have a good fun fight).  And I just don't see the current WoW mechanics in pure pvp being anything else than a gank/zergfest to be honest. But the occasional scruff with the enemy will be entertaining, so I will be joining the PvE mostly server.  I did not have time to test the pvp servers though, so I definately will make a a char on one and test it out at the very least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said in the end its what you want at this stage really. I definately will be buying WoW at release, it has at the minimum months of gameplat for me at my curretn schedule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the PvE (Normal) and Role-play servers (RP), it is possible to have both factions in the same realm.<br />
On the PvP servers, it is not possible for an account to have both Horde and Alliance characters in the same realm.<br />
<br />
So as long as you're not on PVP, it's okay to have characters for both alliances.<br />
<br />
See ya on tuesday :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHA, wife refuse to go ugly?  The best thing about undead was the heavy metal dancing.  But, imo, Michael Jackson night elves somewhat beat that. <br />
<br />
As for the grouping concerns, brutall, I've seen lots of folks start grouping in their late teens early 20's for quests that send them into instances.  Horde have Wailing Caverns; alliance have Deadmines.  Maybe some folks choose never to go that route, but a large number on my server did and I'd say that Deadmines, at least, requires some skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a shaman I noticed that while I could solo the quests I was getting at level 15, but it was much more effective to get a few friends to help.  Plus you can share most quests with anyone in your group that hasnt done it yet.  Thats a big motivator to group imo.  Why fight over the spawn when we can both get the quest done easier by grouping together?</div></div><hr />

Nay, wife is going Tauren actually.  The rest of my group voted down Horde.  Bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As you get higher lvl up, some quests are too difficult to do solo.  Groups make them much easier, and people start to learn their role.<br />
<br />
It's pretty clever the way they do quests.  You can share them with the folks around you if the have done the pre-quests.  Also the bosses drop the quest items, and each group member can loot it.  So if you had a group of 5 people with the quest to kill a boss, and your group kills the boss, everyone in the group can loot the quest item.<br />
<br />
There is less KSing, and easier to raid with instances, and just generally a lot more fun.  A lot of the bad aspects of other mmorpgs are gone, simply due to smart changes made to the game.<br />
<br />
Oh and the warrior is awsome if you get tactical mastery.  That lets you switch between stances allowing you to keep 25 rage points.  I usually switch stances to use one ability, switch back, etc.  Makes the warrior more diverse and fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been in the beta since May and I am having a blast.  Some notes from my experiences -<br />
<br />
1. You can group or solo at any level with any class.  After 2.5 years of logging on to EQ and knowing that I could literally do nothing until I had a group, being able to log on, see that no one in guild or friends list was on, and then go do something useful was AWESOME.  Really, I grouped when I wanted and had fun or went solo and had fun.<br />
<br />
2. There is a definite change to the game as you level.  Quests get a bit harder and often are more time-consuming.  Early on you have a lot of quests packed into small zones.  Later you spend more time travelling.  Not better or worse, just different.<br />
<br />
3. Exploring is fun.  Exploration xp, hidden quest givers, trainers, and merchants.<br />
<br />
4. Instances are fun.  Your first instance opportunities come early (mid-teens for Horde, about 20 Alliance) and are much different from non-instanced gameplay.  There are a number of dumbasses who seem to think that you need perfect groups for instances.  You don't.  If you don't have a warrior, priest, mage you can still do instances.  It may be a bit harder and you might have to play smarter but it works.<br />
<br />
5. Tradeskills are useful.  This will be a big shock to EQ players (it was to me).  You can have 2 Professions/Tradeskills (which I dislike but hey, nothing is perfect) and they are all generally useful.  Mining/Smithing, Mining/Engineering, Herbalism/Alchemy, Enchanting/'whatever you want' are all very useful for warriors.  IMPORTANT - Cooking, Fishing, and First Aid are NOT Professions so you can get those and still have 2 Professions.  This confuses people who are new to the game.<br />
<br />
6. Talents.  You have a lot of customization through talents in WoW.  Some classes are almost like 3 different classes, depending on talent builds.  I actually think that warriors have one of the weaker talent builds, not in terms of power, but in terms of how the class customizes depending on build.  There is not a huge difference between an Arms build and a Fury build although both are different from a Protection build.<br />
<br />
7. Politics.  One of the things that I love about WoW is that it does really cut down on guild politics and interclass bickering.  Most of us remember the huge warrior vs paladin flamewars on these boards.  That just is not an issue in WoW.  For a couple of reasons.  One, everyone can solo so there is not a pressure to fill a limited slot in a group.  Two, any class stacks in a group.  Have 2 warriors in a group?  Fine, one can MT while the other offtanks and snares.  Have a warrior and a paladin?  Great, have the warrior MT while the paladin offtanks and heals while your priest or druid nukes or does melee.  Or have the paladin MT while the warrior offtanks and snares.  It all works.  You could have a group with 4 warriors and a paladin if you wanted, sure it would be weak at some things but it could work pretty well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Common complaints -<br />
1. I can't use all of my skills when I'm grouped!!!  Boo-friggin'-hoo.  My 51 warrior had 3 stances with 12-key hotkey bars that were totally packed, plus sidebars with more skills.  I couldn't use all of my skills on one mob soloing.  Get used to not using everything at your disposal, you just don't have to and later on, you just can't.  Given the choice, I'd rather not be a 2-button chump ever again.<br />
<br />
2. You are always doing stuff so you can't chat.!!!  Never had that problem.  It was harder to chat in instances but for the most part, especially while soloing, you can go at your own pace and chat as much or as little as you want.<br />
<br />
3. What can you do at higher levels???  It is hard to get bored in WoW.  Between quests, instances, raids, hero classes (when that gets implemented) there is a lot to do.  Throw in homeland defense or raids on the opposing faction and there is always something to do.<br />
<br />
4. My warrior can't beat a paladin in a duel!!!  Too bad.  Paladins are tough as hell to kill, especially for a melee class.  Then again, warriors will rip through other classes.  PvP relies a lot on player skill but there is a certain rock-paper-scissors aspect to it as well.  Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

What are you going to be doing in WoW next April?<br />

(I'm not arguing here, I know nothing about WoW, just curious where people see this game going long-term.)<br />
<br />
That's a valid question.  Here's part of a post by one of the Devs:<br />
<br />
We knew from the beginning that players had an expectation going into World of Warcraft for a good raid game. Early on in development, we planned out everything that we felt would make for good raid content. We really tried to go top-heavy with it, to make these raid encounters truly spectacular, because we knew we weren't going to put in a steep leveling curve. We aren't going to bog people down in the normal leveling process, so we expect that there will be a lot of people at maximum level and they'll be anticipating some truly epic challenges.</div></div><hr />

Somewhere out there is a .wvm video of the fight against Onyxia where they got her to 65% and she took off flying.  For those interested in the high end its worth watching.  It didnt look too much different than an EQ dragon fight (that is until she takes off flying).  I saw her gfluxing folks around which is always fun.  There are &quot;eggs&quot; that will spawn a bunch of adds if you get blown into them which adds to the fun =).  Other wise it looked like your standard keep the aggro on the MT while everyone else burns the mob down kind of fight.  And then she takes off and AE's the whole room.<br />
<br />
I figure this is just a beta encounter and it already looks pretty sweet.  I've hoped that they would put as much thought and effort into the high end enounters as they've done the rest of their game.  By all apperances they have. :)</div></div><hr />
