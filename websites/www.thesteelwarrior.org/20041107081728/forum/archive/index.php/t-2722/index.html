<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">August 26, 2003 <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Zone Revamps ** <br />
<br />
- The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule have been partially revamped. Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the content. The changes are not dramatic, but make these zones more entertaining to play in. <br />
<br />
- The Plane of Mischief, home of the trickster Bristlebane, has undergone an extensive revamp. As one of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is a very interesting challenge, if you have a sturdy funny bone. The improved zone is now available on Stormhammer. <br />
<br />
- The Greig's End revamp is now available on the Live servers. The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- /memspellset # - Using this command memorizes one of your saved spell sets. # is the number or name (or shortened name) of the spell set you wish to memorize. Note that if you use a shortened version of the spell set name, it will match the first spell set that has those characters, so /memspellset Dots will find your &quot;Dots and Charms&quot;, or &quot;Dots&quot;, or &quot;Dotsandstuff&quot; - whichever shows up first on your list. <br />
<br />
- A Platinum slot has been added to the shared bank to make transactions between characters on the same account more convenient. <br />
<br />
- Clip Plane - The clip plane slider should work more reliably now. Where before it may not have done anything until lowered to a very low percentage, now the slider should have an effect at any setting. <br />
<br />
- Filters for your own pet's messages have been added. Your own pet's attacks are no longer subject to the Other Attacks/Misses filters. On the options screen there is now a separate button for filtering YOUR Pet attack messages. Also, the ability to redirect your pet attack messages to any chat window has been added to the chat window context menus. <br />
<br />
- /random messages can now be sent to any chat window you'd like. There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, people can't claim that they didn't see the /random that they lost just to force a re-roll). <br />
<br />
- The Journal Window has been changed to make it easier to use and understand. We've merged the the two information windows into a single window. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug in the Looking for Group window. The Get Matches button should no longer grey out at inappropriate times. <br />
<br />
- The Bad Word Filter now filters chat channel text as well as other game text. <br />
<br />
- To make things a little more logical, the /inspect command will allow characters to inspect interactive objects for LDoN, and /toggleinspect allows you to toggle on or off the ability to inspect other player characters using the mouse. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Purify Soul reuse time reduced from 72 minutes to 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Divine Resurrection reuse time reduced from 36 hours to 18 hours. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Regeneration reuse timer reduced from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. We have increased the duration from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and made this a group effect. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Renewal duration increased from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, adjusted the amount healed, and this has become a group effect. <br />
<br />
- Harmtouch has been fixed. There was a problem with the timer for Harmtouch that would make it appear to reset when the character was logged out, even though it does not reset until the appropriate amount of time has passed. <br />
<br />
- Summon Death Charger and Summon Holy Steed have been fixed. We fixed a bug that caused these abilities to fail until the character zoned or logged out. <br />
<br />
- Endless Quiver no longer grants an endless supply of thrown weapons, only arrows. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Unswerving Hammer of Faith has had its mana cost reduced from 250 to 175. <br />
<br />
- Divine Barrier no longer has a damage shield component and has gained three times the healing effect. <br />
<br />
- Celestial Remedy has had its mana cost lowered from 190 to 150. <br />
<br />
- A targeting issue with pets is now fixed. There was a bug that caused pets to be untargetable with the F1 key and with pet spells that target the pet automatically. This was happening only if a pet was summoned and then a mount was summoned. <br />
<br />
- AE Rain Spells were resisted 100% of the time when an NPC was above level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit points left. This will no longer happen. <br />
<br />
- Eye of Zomm would cause a player's pet to kill itself if that pet was commanded to kill the owner's Eye. This has been corrected. Also, the Eye no longer moves at incredible speed under water, but they can now swim up and down in water. <br />
<br />
- PBAoE Songs no longer prevent a bard from singing if used while the bard has himself targeted. <br />
<br />
- Illusions can once again be cast on others while the caster is on a mount. <br />
<br />
- When Invisibility drops due to looting a corpse, the player will be informed that their invisibility has dropped. <br />
<br />
- Pets no longer break enthrall. <br />
<br />
- Armor of the Zealot will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Soul and Focus of the Seventh. Blessed Armor of the Risen and Ancient: High Priest's Bulwark will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Spirit or Khura's Focusing. Also, Pact of Hate and Call of Darkness should stack properly (meaning that they won't stack). <br />
<br />
- Illusion: Guktan was fixed on all servers a little while ago. We just wanted you to be aware that the spell will make the target look like a Guktan, not a male human. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones and Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Bazaar - We have increased the limit on the number of traders in the bazaar. We fixed an issue that would cause the &quot;Begin Trader&quot; button to be disabled if a player tried to use it when the maximum number of traders was reached. And the &quot;Held&quot; slot option was removed from the search, since it is not a valid option. <br />
<br />
- The Coirnav Encounter has been modified to respawn faster when the encounter is failed badly (if the attempt fails to reach a certain depth in the encounter). <br />
<br />
- The Illusion: Guktan quest had some issues. We have addressed them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** New Player Improvements ** <br />
<br />
- After creating a new character, that character is the default selection on the character select screen. <br />
<br />
- At character creation, left-clicking on an attribute displays text that explains what that attribute is important for. Right-clicking allocates the maximum possible points to that attribute. <br />
<br />
- To help reduce clutter for the new player, the Story window no longer pops up when a player first logs in. <br />
<br />
- When a context Tip window pops up, if the Tip of the Day is still open, the Tip of the Day window will close. Again, this is to help reduce the clutter. <br />
<br />
- We've change the name of the &quot;Camp&quot; button in the Actions window to &quot;Camp (Exit)&quot; for clarity. <br />
<br />
- The Inventory Tip window now explains how to read books and notes, how to give/trade items with NPC's, and how to scribe spells. <br />
<br />
- We've added a text message on the screen to inform players when they are loading a zone, and what zone they are about to enter. <br />
<br />
- Added numeric background to buttons in the Hot Button window to make it easier to tell which button corresponds to which number key. <br />
<br />
- The Mousewheel zoom is now enabled by default. <br />
<br />
- New installations of EverQuest will default to 1024x768 resolution. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Misc ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused some equipment to be invisible on characters created recently (since our update on August 6th). <br />
<br />
- Luclin elemental models will now display if selected, regardless of other settings for Luclin models. You can turn these models on with no other Luclin models active, and you will see the Luclin elemental. <br />
<br />
- Hitting cancel on a trade window or using the /consent or /deny commands will now only send you one message, not two. <br />
<br />
<br />

I got two words for Absors PR job, and SoE right now.<br />
F(screw) You. <br />
Thanks for giving casters better AA's and generally ignoring every non casting class. <br />
Pat yourselves on the back boy's you deserve a steel warrior kick to the ass. <br />
<br />
Im so disgusted right now. <br />
You guys couldnt do one melee fix at all? You couldnt while twinking the F out of clericv's and paladins and magicians maybe have reduced Area taunt at all? Or made some of our offensive AA's useful?.<br />
<br />

<br />
Nowdays, I would recmmend they simply stay away, if they get the urge to come to this board, just stay away unless it's to announce a fix.    Warriors for the most part are so angry that it'll be not much but a feeding frenzy.<br />
<br />
I know that if they came here and asked us if we had any questions about LDoN that they'd get jumped all over for glossing over the real issues that warriors want to see dealt with.<br />
<br />
So... my advice to SOE, don't come here till there's been a fix and you're announcing it, or you want to talk about it.</div></div><hr />

I wont defend this patch at all, its full with alot of real improvements and just very few necessary fixes, but nothing of it for warriors. <br />

Oh wait, the divine barrier improvement helps us since we cant root the mob to protect the 10% health divined cleric from low HP agro when he cancels it o_O</div></div><hr />

How long have you been playing EQ?  This is par for the course.  In 3 years, when no one even plays warriors anymore, they'll make a fix for them and then people will be like &quot;Fixed warriors?  Jesus christ, couldn't you have done something important like fix some doors in freeport?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The shared plat slot is handy... I can use it to give all my cash to my mage twink since warriors are never gonna get fixed.<br />
<br />
Pretty typical patch... upgraded clerics, fixed misc. caster stuff, wasted resources tweaking zones that nobody gives a damn about, and not a damn thing for pure melee.<br />
<br />
Although, I do have to admit... the rain spell bug has been an issue since day one of release.  VI steadfastly refused to acknowledge it, but I KNOW mages have been complaining about it for years (my mage's birthday is March '99, so trust me on this one).  Judging by that history... we'll see taunt addressed in 2006 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly I'm as surprised as many others when I saw he started his own thread.  (For those that don't click the link, he was asking if anyone had any questions about LDoN)  Clerics already had the &quot;dev shows up, feeding frenzy&quot; thing...they popped up to advertise for some spinoff EQ thing.  <br />
<br />
It's kind of a vicious cycle...dev shows up and people go into frenzy because they haven't showed up in a while, so the dev doesn't post much anymore, and people scream that they never post here.  It was like that for clerics, and I'm betting it'll be like that here.  Besides, I'm willing to bet they know exactly the questions they'll be asked, and they may not have an answer for you...although just a word would be nice, even on another board to avoid the frenzy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well at least SoE didn't just outright give Knights defensive. Although please note there is room for a level 65 spell in this line.<br />
<br />
As I read this, it won't really help Warriors with high end mobs. A mob like Xegony is capable of hitting for 3000+ without Defensive. Even with Defensive on, the amount and duration of damage smoothing vs. mana cost vs. duration of the fight makes this pretty useless.<br />
<br />
On the other hand it will help with experiance mobs and 1 group mini bosses. But as noted elsewhere, Warriors don't need help in this area. It looks to me like the primary benefit will gained by Knights when doing these mobs and possibly other melees lacking deep HP pools should the mob turn on them momentarily (Rogues?). Translation - it makes Knights a better choice to MT in LDoN pocket dungeon groups and as a by-product better MT's in general.<br />
<br />
I think we can just give up any expectation of an adjustment of any kind for Warriors. We are not only not a priority, I suspect we aren't even on the to do list.<br />

We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes<br />
<br />
<br />
And im planning on winning lotto.. but the chances of them looking at us is about the same as me winning lotto.<br />
<br />
And no mention of any looking into warriors. <br />
<br />
Absor is due to post here soon (seems hes making the rounds this week). When he does its gonna be a shitstorm. People will yell and scream and he wont reply... and we will be right back where we started. <br />
<br />
the #1 tank for 1% of all of the games content and #3 in tanking for exp groups.. followed by monk, ranger, rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe with the dps changes we will increase our dps to a point where people will look at us a good for a group again.<br />
<br />
doubt that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just logged on...other changes not in the patch message:<br />
<br />
* Hitting the up arrow key while typing no longer puts you in autorun.  You can once again activate autorun by just activating the chat line with /, R, or T.  Oh, and while you're on autorun, hitting up again will once again cancel it now.<br />
<br />
* When you zone, the UI stays now, just the connection meter  disappears.  However, a white text message pops up in the middle of your screen saying &quot;Entering &lt;suchandsuch zone&gt;...&quot;, which fades out after you finish zoning.  Looks very nice.<br />
<br />
* The Hotkey bank now has gray numbers on the face of the button saying which number activates it.<br />
<br />
That's all I've found so far.  The shared plat slot looks like a normal plat slot, except it's right under the two shared item slots.</div></div><hr />

Tasso,<br />
There wouldnt be a shit storm if the devs actually paid attention and gave us some fix's, If they could just make a few AA improvements, Like  bringing area taunt down from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.<br />
<br />
But instead they hold this lump of crap in front of us, and Absor has to try and spin it off like its pure gold about saying, Melee fix sometime soon!<br />
<br />
Maybe if the dev's and Abby treated pure Melee classes as more then sacrifical lambs , Then just maybe we wouldnt have a pot of boiling oil to drop him in if he ever came and posted here.<br />
<br />
I dont see it as unjustifable that a lot of us have this attitude either.  I admit they have done a few nice things for us two years ago. But well most people subscribe to the right here, right now point of view.<br />
<br />
Honestly however, I'd be halfway nice to the man if he had the courage to come into the lions den and said guys what needs to be done. <br />
<br />
But hey the chances of that, are around the same as a melee fix. ^_^<br />

<br />
And they never said they'll do both... they ended up doing #1, or did you miss the patch where a lot of 1H weapons were improved significantly (especially for rouges).  Warriors didn't get much, if any DPS upgrade, but our DPS is pretty much inline with where it should be relative to other pure melees.  <br />

Aggro was never mentioned as something they're going to fix besides having a Dev at a Fan Faire said 'we'll look into it' like almost anything else out there.

<br />
 You have an interesting definition of &quot;a lot&quot;. Outside of Time 2 1H got improved I believe. Ifir and Coir Hammer. If that was their sweeping fix to melee damage it was woefully under-done. It was more a small attempt to bring 1H weapons more in line with 2H weapons, certainly not something to upgrade melee class damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The upgrade on rogue dagger increase their DPS considerably, not that rogues were hurting for damage.<br />
<br />
Monk damage still seems under what it should be but improving the Shinai of the Ancients helped (and it has one of the best debuff in the game now).<br />
<br />
Warrior DPS isn't touched but it didn't need to be.  Darkblade of the Warlord didn't outdamage Vanazir to begin with anyway.<br />
<br />
The developers promised very high end weapons would be upgraded.  That was done.  Stop crying.  They're not responsible for you not being able to read what they wrote down.  The only class that needed help on DPS was monks anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2: They &quot;promised&quot; to close the gap between caster and melee damage. They didn't do that. Not &quot;In time there's a problem&quot;. Because no one was fucking in time when they said it. Douchebag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well said, but I think at this point it'll be a lot less than 3 years before people quit their warriors.<br />
<br />
I re-activated my DAoC account because they finally merged the pvp servers.  Been having a lot of fun on there.<br />
<br />
Will be fun to see if the devs quit picking their collective asses and do something about giving warriors some love.  It's not like they can pretend there's nothing wrong.  Whenever I enter a pickup group with any of my toons, and a warrior tanks, everyone quietly agrees that the class is broken.  On the message boards I frequent, every now and again someone posts in frustration how broken warriors are.<br />
<br />
Yet the stupid dev tossers aren't doing anything about it?  How hard is it to give us a boost?  It's been months.  Fucking wankers.</div></div><hr />

I think any intelligent being understand that in a virtual world in real-time, you cant take a nap and wake up 5 secs later like if you had slept 5hrs.<br />

Besides, its on the damn manual, page 17 on the mini manual that comes with PoP or...page 7 in your Kunark manual... &quot;Exiting the game&quot;..... I mean, its not like you press PLAY and you go &quot;OMG! What is all this about?&quot;, you supposely read the manual. And I still think it was a using code hours for an stupid thing...</div></div><hr />
