Based on http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1011967 , is there anything else that I should look into upgrading that's possible 2-boxing wise?<br />

Thanks for any advice given.</div></div><hr />

 Not a damn thing that I can see. Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This one is some little quest, you need to do 10 ring like encounters in the riwwi colloseum of which you probably could 2box the first 6 or 7. Rest is doable by a good group afaik.<br />

<br />
Thse 2 are from ikkinz singlegroup trial #1. They drop off a midi boss at zonein which can be killed by you, 2 clerics + random dps. You already have the earring from one of those trial so it should be perfectly doable for you and some guildmates / friends.<br />

You could also get a neck slot upgrade from arylxir (?) in solro.  100HPs + AoB on it, forgot the name.  Thats all i can think of right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Signet of Might would vbe nice. Legs and arms upgraded to Tak armor. You really need to find new haste, its costing you 17ac 60hp on your BP. Maybe make an LDoN haste item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">o/t: damn wandor; your warrior is really coming along nicely. having fun on prexus?<br />
<br />
to tiejiennie: LDoN points for Tak gear ( like wandor said ) and a new haste item. your kit is pretty damn good; and like you said; only raid stuff is better. I'd go for them points and make some stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look at the Troglodite Neck from EC LDoN Hard's.  Something like 14ac 90hp and some stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Take a group and a half of friends and go whack Arch Lich in Ssra Temple for an 18AC 100HP neck... 1sec cast time Grim Aura on it too, nice crap buffer.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the replies guys. Appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Tried playing around with the LDoN sorting script to see if I could come up with an alternate Haste item, but all I could see was to replace the Helm with a Tak Helm with Haste, and that was quite a big hit in the AC department, so I decided to skip it...... yeah, the BP Haste is kindda restricting me, especially since it's hard and in some cases, impossible to replace my Back or Waist with alternate haste items =/</div></div><hr />

Ancient Sand Gem (Ranged)<br />
AC:9, Dex:8, Wis:8, Int:8, HP:75, Mana:75, FR:12, DR:12, type1,type2,type3.<br />

Unless you use your arrows a lot...then the only other alternative i can give you is to run Tribute haste if you want to wear a better bp :\</div></div><hr />
