<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aratus</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's spell haste, 30%, lasts for about an hour. The buff 'stacks' with other spell haste but the effects do not. You can have Miraculous Visions and Speed of Vallon up at once but the superior haste will take over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pusherman</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand you right the gaunts buff icon will not be overwiten by the spell haste but the haste from the gaunts will not stack with the haste from the enchanter/shammy buff?<br />
<br />
So if I get a 50% haste buff from a shammy/chanter and click the gaunts Ill still be hasted to 50%?<br />
<br />
The reason I asked is I was wondering if the click was like the eyepatch of plunder, and would stack with spell haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND <br />
If this information is right .... these arent as good as SS gaunts...<br />
<br />
blah...<br />

The icons will appear to stack, but they will have no effect other than to eat up a buff slot.  I also have SS Gaunts, but choose to wear the Kizrak's for the moment to get my stamina up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell Haste and Song Haste do not COMBINE when they stack.<br />
<br />
What stacks are the OTHER effects from the spells.<br />
<br />
A fine example of this is the monk epic.<br />
<br />
It stacks with Speed of the Shissar.<br />
<br />
I do not get 108 percent haste from the combination of Speed of the Shisar and Celestial Tranquility.<br />
<br />
I just get the haste from Speed of the Shissar.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I DO get the added ATK and Armor Class from my epic click. And I DO get whatever other benefits Shissar gives (I never paid attention much, Vallon replaced it pretty soundly and Vallons doesn't stack with my monk epic).<br />
<br />
Anyways ...<br />
<br />
A good rule of thumb ...<br />
<br />
ITEM HASTE &quot;combines&quot; with either SPELL HASTE or SONG HASTE. Whichever is higher.<br />
<br />
Spell and Song do not combine.<br />
<br />
Unless it's a specific bard song (what are there like three?), designed to OVER-haste.<br />
<br />
Soooooo ...<br />
<br />
Ornate gloves ... That warrior belt from Luclin ... the eyepatch ... the monk epic ... the ranger Sky cloak ...<br />
<br />
They do NOT &quot;combine&quot; with the haste you receive from Vallon's ... Celerity ... Quickening ... or Shissar ... or whatever.<br />
<br />
Even if the buffs are both up at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are incredibly handy though if you are in a LDoN mision and 5 mins in your ench haste gets dispelled, your slower dies and is low on mana or a bunch of other crazy scenarios.  The utility of having this haste on demnad makes you a little less vulnerable in these kind of situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many uses for these gloves.<br />
<br />
1.  The added AC and stats can make up for the hps you lose from the Myrmidom ones.  If you aren't being healed by a cleric with CHeal is the AC/stats more useful than the 30hps from SS ones?  To me it is.  To others it may not be.<br />
<br />
2.  The 30% clicky haste is very appealing if you have no slower in group or are farming greens for something.  Or to cover you until haste can be re cast on you from the chanter/shaman/bst.<br />
<br />
3.  Another hour duration clicky buff for dispelling mobs that works indoors and outdoors.  Not insta click but fairly short cast time.<br />
<br />
The downside is that it doesn't stack with spell haste and it takes up a buff slot.</div></div><hr />
