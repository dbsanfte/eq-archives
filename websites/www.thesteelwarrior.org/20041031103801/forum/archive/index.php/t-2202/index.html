<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BeeoRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been looking into doing some serious upgrading on the armor I have, but essentialy the slots I can fill with ornate/Kael armor.  I have ornate arms atm, and a kael BP and boots sitting in the bank for when I'm done factioning.  My question is are there pieces of kael that, although aren't better than ornate, can compete with it.  The Kael armor, more or less, is going to take time, I'm in a raid group that spends alot of time in W/NToV, On my server the ornate is on the cheap side I guess, picked up the vambraces mold for 25k, have a GM smith friend, so all I really need to get is the molds. <br />
<br />
So far, I've pretty much ruled out getting the BP, my guild is no where near it, and I already have the kael ready to go.   Helm and gloves I've decided I want to get my hands on (can't go wrong with a perma see invis item on a pvp server), so I've narrowed it down to Legs, Bracers, and Boots.  I have the boots in the bank, but still unsure if I'll quest them or not.  Uhh, so yeah, money isn't too much of an issue, any thoughts would be great, thanks =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Me personally I would go with Ornate.  Has more stats along with some nice effects on them.  Hell thought the Kael BP could last you a very long time if not perhaps the rest of your EQ life.  Would definately be a lot cheaper to camp Kael armor vs. buy Ornate that's for sure.  If you can get your hands on some Ornate cheap or get more lvl's and kill BoT named then more power to ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The good thing is Ornate molds drop more commonly than WToV/HoT drops, so the market will be filled with ornate pieces for sale and many people will be competing with each other to sell them thus lowering prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kael arms and boots may beat out ornate. Ornate legs &gt;&gt;&gt; most armor till elemental or VT though. Definately get those :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kalli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every piece of Ornate is an upgrade from Kael for warriors.<br />
<br />
The only piece that might not be worthwhile getting is gloves, but only if you have eyepatch of plunder, are a gnome, or some other kind of clicky haste already.<br />
<br />
That said, at least on Brell, Ornate Plate isn't dropping in price anywhere near close to the rate silk and leather are, go go class distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your guild is hanging out in NToV a lot you can deal with Eindride.  Heck, if you can do Aary you can walk all over Eindride.  Provided of course you can get the people in to BoT.  BoT keys are pretty cake though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have 3-4 groups of 62+ and a bard/chanter/cleric you can pacify all the way up to the tower bosses without a bot key (you do have to have a tower key, but those are easier than bot keys.)<br />
<br />
Also, most of the regular mini named that pop all over the zone can drop ornate molds/patterns. Just figure out which ones drop the pieces you need.<br />
<br />
Ornate is better than every piece of Velious quest armor with the possible exception of Skyshrine gaunts, and even then, the click on ornate makes them pretty nice for the 30hp trade off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">only peices of Kael that are in competition with ornate are Gloves, and  BP.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the set, Ornate blows Kael out of the water.<br />
<br />
Kael Gloves have the same HP, and only 3 less AC.  Kael BP is inferior to Ornate by a bit more than gloves are, but not much, your looking at a 25hp difference and 6 AC, which isnt all that much for a BP.  Pick up a Vindi or Statue BP then you dont need to worry bout Ornate, they should be pretty easy fights for you now if your in W/NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't forget that ornate BP has a free 350hp buff when there are no shammys around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go kill Vindi for a BP - the rest of your thoughts are spot on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">can you heal yourself with that buff?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Could someone list the full name of the Warrior's Ornate plate armor being talked about in this thread?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shield of the arcen is like a 300ac 30hp and MR buff. from ornate bp , and  having been farming BoT towers for a while now , I don't see how your guild could do NToV  and WToV and not be able to kill Eindride Icestorm for a BP. But /shrug I do it all  its easy for me to do, and easy for me to say also , might be totaly different story for other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grr , I mean 'Shield of the Arcane'*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, the thing about the BoT towers is they seem harder then they are. Even when you do them once or twice.<br />
<br />
But once you develope a strat, they are very easy. 12-18 people own them no probs (at least the easier ones). After you master them, some are 1 groupable even.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The only one I would say is not 1 groupable is that bastard with the leashed pets. Other than that - which is not hard to figure out how to beat the pets - these encounters are absolutely the best RvR in the game. The chance at 4 ornate BPs ever 6 hours is unreal. The other loot that drops is pretty damn nice as well.<br />
<br />
I used to be a nig time Vindi BP supported because of how easy it is to get and how good it is. The effect has lost some of its luster though with the high availability of Vengence items now. I would gladly pass on a Vindi BP for a Kizrak's BP, no question. The additional AC/HP is well worth the tiny ATK/regen difference. You are not even losing that much in the way of resists since FR/CR are easier to buff than DR/PR.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kizrak gaunts have Clickable Haste like the Eyepatch of Plunder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes, except the haste from the gaunts is 30% as opposed to the 20% from the eyepatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sorry for the off topic question again... Do you need to have any flags in order to do the Ornate quests?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, at least on Brell, Ornate Plate isn't dropping in price anywhere near close to the rate silk and leather are, go go class distribution.  <br />
Its probably less of a distribution issue but more of an issue with the fact that many ornate silk / leather pieces straigth out SUCK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Part of the reasons for this is that some pieces are nicer for different fighting types.<br />
<br />
Plate has pure melee, hybrid, and wis caster, so there's a more even distribution of &quot;good pieces&quot; for certain classes.  Like hybrids getting ft3 boots but clerics have ft2 bracers.  This keeps the prices more consistent across the different pieces.<br />
<br />
Now all silk users are int casters, so the bracers are in high demand, but many could care less about getting truesight on a hat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BeeoRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thanks for all the input guys, I'm goin through and readin this, and gettin all pumped up cause I'm thinking I'm gonna come back and start workin on that stuff (went on vacation for a week) come back to find our raid alliance destroyed =/  So looks like it's back to the drawing board</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In regard to Kiz BP I actually like the &quot;shield of arcane&quot; better than focus in some sitautions because of the extra AC (combined with a straight sta buff its a nice combo).  Agree with what you all say above BoT towers is one the best risk vs reward in game atm.</div></div><hr />
