Was our first ever Vindi raid.  Wiped at 9% first try, second we adjusted the rotation half a second and we had a flawless victory.  I was quite excited about it, tanked him even from 50% without defensive.  Its quite the rush finally tanking some bigger hitters.  <br />
<br />
But now I am unsure where to take my guild.  We can field about 4-5 clerics most nights.  All with ft and about 5k+ mana pools.  I am 65, with 110 aa now, all defensive done.  So looking for some advice on what other targets are in our reach to work on.  Currently we are staying out of PoP, to try and gear the guild up.</div></div><hr />

Get Vindi down square..than try tOrmax...then go faction for skyshrine armours. than try dozer. than some of the smaller Luclin mobs like doomshade or rumble or va'dyn.<br />
<br />
the key is to progressively go for newer mobs. i think wandor put up a good post somewhere on mob progression in the library.<br />
<br />
the trick is to learn from the encounter enough to apply and adjust for the next step's encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoT tower minis are a goldmine and you should be able to tank them just fine.  Towers, towers, and more towers. Your guild will learn about rampage, AE avoiding, mob positioning, raid crowd control, and trash clearing all in the BoT towers. Loot is exceptional as well. There is a guide in the library with specific mob, strat, and loot infoz - http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4626</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minna</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally have done extensive raiding in BoT towers on my own with other guilds, and served as MT on those.  So am aware of the benefits as well as strategies.  Problem is atm, my guild members are maybe at kunark level in terms of gear, if that.  Not to mention nowhere near high enough level to get in.  We have been working on getting keyed to BoT, and done Storms nameds, Xanamech,  etc..  and gotten some people keyed.  But a lot of members still need storms and poj.  PoJ being the real holdup, because if my top 4 dps people are not on we can't complete even execution.  Yes the gear is that bad.  They are great players, but need some help.  I know that we could upgrade a lot of that gear in single groups, but they do love to raid and want to provide raid experiences for them.  Atm I am thinking NToV, it is hardly ever killed on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda was figuring that since; as you mentioned; you just took out vindi for the first time as a guild<br />
<br />
my advice still stands tho; but with your experience minna i'm sure the learning time won't be as drastic as the actual time spent equipping your friends. definately HoT for SS armors and when the farming is done mebbe than go hit up north wing and go nuts since not too many people go there.<br />
<br />
i'd stick to more easier straightforward strat mobs; and sprinkle in some PoP and get your guildies during offtime to mebbe do some LDoN for some decent augments and/or start farming them points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan.  Decent pieces of SS are comparable to cultural.  Some pieces are worse, some better.  HoT also leads in to getting Doze and his quest items.  Doze items do require a lot of time / work to get many, so people often advise against them for an upcoming guild.  Also partially to drama that can occur when you try to move on and people still have some of the items.  NToV would ruin faction to do Doze.  But if you can do NToV, you could just get Kael armor which is comparable to SS, farm LtK, Telk, Goz too in WToV.</div></div><hr />

It gets progressively harder the further you go in and its a great training ground for your guild to learn general raiding tactics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree GoS is a good next step.  Do the Rhags and maybe try the Cursed too (do your homework ahead of time).<br />
<br />
Also get your guild the hedge maze and give TT a whirl....although the logistics of this fight are alot different than Vindi (again do your homework).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, although getting keyed for bot and towers may be somewhat painful, I'd say as a guild you would progress faster farming BoT than doing anything in ToV. Ornate plus decent drops would make it worth it in no time. Far quicker than getting quested armor and working on faction IMO.<br />
<br />
To each his own I guess. I have gone through the NToV schtuff and still think pop would have been a better alternative. Getting PoJ can be a pain, but if you enlist some help from friends with better gear it should speed things up. AE'ing it can make it trivial.<br />
<br />
I don't think gear will really hold you back much, it sounds more like you need levels so focus on grinding out some XP for the classes falling behind. If PoJ is rough due to gear/lvls, you'll find NToV to be a PITA.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts, good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on the Bastion of Thunder Towers. Having to key up for Bot by doing the named giants in Plane of Storms will give your guild an excellent challenge. Once you have enough keyed to get into BoT keep keying people up, and have some people gain the Pieces needed to key for the Towers.<br />
Once you can field 24 in the Towers ( takes one person in a group of 6 to key into the Towers ) give them a try. I wouldnt go with less than 24 at first, they can be done with less but only by well geared and experienced groups.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to do POP zones as you said then I recommend the following:<br />
<br />
Vadyn in Akheva is good for some gear, but better than him and doable are Doomshade and Rumblecrush in Umbral Plains. Doomshade regularily drops a 41% haste earring, Rumblecrush drops good cleric BP.<br />
<br />
Grieg is doable if you have the right strategy, but he is a pain to do if you dont know it well. His loot table is excellent, but all too often he can drop real junk when you were hoping for FT 3 items and 60 AC breast plates. ( maybe My guild has just been unlucky on him )<br />
<br />
I also think you should try SSRA temple Glyphed/Exiled cycle.  I wouldnt try the Cursed until you can easily and comfortably take down The Glyphed/Exiled. Another SSRA mob to try is XTC.<br />
Possibly Arch Lich.<br />
<br />
Naralli Ironsmith<br />
Overlord of VoLS<br />
the Rathe<br />

The guide assumes the old paci - which seems drastically different at present.</div></div><hr />

Bards &gt; Auliffe.  They make the encounter SOO much easier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another fun encounter that can also drop some decent loot is Innoruk in Nadox. He is basically the old Hate Inny, though beefed up slightly and dealing with his totally debuffing the tank in a few rounds, and the Grav flux knock back AE makes for a nice challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no way is PoP stuff better than NToV for drops, BoT is basically only BPs and weapons off the tower bosses, ntov is best way to get tons of upgrades pre VT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although for some reason your Magelo link wasn't popping for me, having tanked Vindi and having all your defensive AAs (good wo/man!), I'm assuming you're around 7000 - 8500 raid buffed HP?  Regardless, anywhere in that range and I totally agree that NToV would be a great place to go next.  Frankly, I spent a great deal of time farming ToV (West ToV to be precise, we were on Kael faction) and long story short, it's really not worth the time investment for the outcome.  That's not to say it should be avoided like the plague, but like you said, if your guild wants to raid rather than do one or two group things, it's really pointless to 'raid' West ToV/Halls of Testing.  The drop to kill ratio is much too low, and chances are you'd see a great deal of rotting armor before anything else.<br />
<br />
The other huge factor that most people forget, is farming ToV for armor does not increase your damage output in anyway.  Technically, the longer you last the fight with better armor, the more damage you do, and I'll give into that.  However, you won't see any weapons unless you kill Telkorenar or Gozzrem (and frankly they just drop weapons for your WAR, SHD, and PALs that are equivalent of 2500pp weapons in the bazaar, and I'd argue Gozz and Telk are harder than a majority of NToV dragons).  Long story short, in my opinion the only people who'd REALLY benefit from farming ToV for armor (whether Halls of Testing or West ToV) would be your main tank(s) if it's upgrades to their current equipment, and clerics to maintain longer CH chains.  Everyone else doesn't really gain much benefit save the BPs and Leggings to some extent, and their rarity is way up there.<br />
<br />
That said, I'd strongly encourage you to do as you say, and head into NToV, ESPECIALLY if it's undercamped on your server.  Take your winning force that went against Vindi, and do Ikatiar the Venom - He's really almost a duplicate of Vindi (though I don't recall him rampaging, but better assume he does just in case I forget - there's something about him that makes him slightly easier than Vindi, but it's been a long time and I don't recall exactly what it is.  Either no rampage, tiny bit lesser max hit, less HP; something like that).<br />
<br />
Anyway, he drops a very nice cloak, some mediocre armor (Ancient Wyvern Hide), and a so-so rog (and shd) dagger, among other things.  Not the greatest loot, but he's just an intro to NToV and is good warm up for the raid.  Makes sure everyone's on their toes and what not.  As for the strategy, I'll leave it mostly to you, but he can be corner tanked right nearby his spawn (the stairs leading deeper into NToV) just like Vindi, without adds as long as you pacify/clear his room before you pull him, and watch for agro through the doors on the right where the mini-drakes are and on the left where a large group of wyverns are.<br />
<br />
Anyway, depending how your Ikatiar fight goes and how much mana your clerics had left over, add another group of 6 if necessary, and go for Eashen of the Sky.  He's just up those stairs near Ikatiar and to the left, and he can be pacify pulled out, or monk/sk/necro pulled, once all the mini-drakes are clear.  I'd also suggest pulling him to the corner near the stairs where you fight Ikatiar, because you can easily hide casters/healers from his AEs while fightning nearby, and he can also be cornered so long as you're shrunk properly.<br />
<br />
His loot is quite fantastic; I'd wager you'll be hard pressed to get a drop from him for many many kills that wouldn't be well used by someone.  The big difference is he does 400 damage AEs during the fight, which will only hit your melees if you position correctly, but it will slowly drain them down.  This is a good fight to practice longevity - make sure your melees know it's their job to keep themselves alive, by hoping out of the AE/fight when they hit 40% or whatever you designate (I suggest not much lower, because you don't want them to get low health agro), and to go the 'healing station' for a heal or two.  If you have them, I suggest Shaman's heal over time spell, Quiescence, if you have one, otherwise Shm/Dru are good for healing melees as they need it.  Also remember to get everyone regened before the fight as it helps a bit.<br />
<br />
Then comes Aary, and he's probably the hardest part.  The actual fight isn't really that hard, because he only hits a bit harder than the previous two mobs, and is slowable, but it's pulling him and 'locking him down' that is tough.  You basically have to ensure you pull him in such a manner that his AE doesn't hit your casters (most importantly, clerics), or they'll drastically lose mana and unless you have one or two superior clerics with lots of FT, they won't be able to last the fight most likely.  There's lots of methods to doing this, some better than others, but I will impart that his guards are Pacifiable by a 65 enc/clr, thus making the pull very trivial - it's just a matter of timing and positioning.  Don't forget the small drakes spawn quite rapidly, so once he's in battle, you may have to designate people to offtank the small drakes as they repop on you - it won't be all at once, so just have offtanks grab them when they spawn, and have either all melees or all casters or a combination you deem necessary switch to killing the small drakes.  There's very little chance you'll see two waves of small drakes during the fight.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, since he's slowable, if you keep clerics/casters out of his AE at all times, you shouldn't have any problem keeping your main tank up with one or two clerics, even with minor FT/mana pools.  You can also switch out tanks if necessary with AE taunt - using evasive, you can guarantee pretty much 9+ minutes of evasive tanking on him and still ensure he goes back on your Master tank after the second tank's evasive runs out (first tank starts with evasive, when it goes, second tank AE taunts and does evasive, when it goes, first tank AE taunts to get him back, and evasive will be nearly refreshed again on him.)  Should be a significant portion of the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I could go on and on, and there's obviously tons of guides to NToV out there, but if you'd like anymore detailed info feel free to PM me here and I'll do what I can.  I'd rather not blabber on too much (even though I always do).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

Check my magelo to see one if you want.  Iki is a hard pull if your guild is low on monks.  We used to use 3 monks and myself and another SK as back up to pull him.  He backstabs and it hurts.  Best strat I have seen is clear entrance drakes then have monks (must be ally to CoV) use voidance disc to pull him to entrance.  If your monk is quick enough he can get iki w/o guards and out to the 4 way bridge before FDing.  Then have someone tag and bring in for the kill.  He does Flurry and so do his guards so keep an eye out for that.</div></div><hr />
