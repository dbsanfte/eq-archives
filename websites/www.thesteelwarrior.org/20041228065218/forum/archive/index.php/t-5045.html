Then he goes on to say how great his gods are and that I should be worshipping them instead.  Could it be a quest?  <br />
<br />
Think I heard at a fanfaire that 70% of the quests in EQ are still unsolved.  But if anyone has talked to these NPC's before then youll know what Im talking about...it has piqued my curiousity.</div></div><hr />

to stick its tongue out at the agnostics</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didnt choose Agnostic for the benefits (whatever they might be).  I chose Agnostic because I like to RP and wanted to be a non-evil ogre.  So because I chose to be a RPer I have been punished for playing my avatar the way that I envisioned him.  <br />
<br />
Is it really that big of a deal to me?  Nah.  Things will change as I level up and am able to raid for gear.  <br />
<br />
Would I change my Deity if possible from a RPer standpoint.  Yes for the benefit of gear but....I would secretly be a traitor :p <br />
<br />
I know its been said before but Armor for a non-believer wouldnt be such a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

Instead of asking 'what about Vah Shir', why not ask 'What would make a mass of cats who've never dealt with a diety diety and spent their whole civilization communing with animal spirits want to suddenly throw down for the Tribunal or any other Norrathian god'?<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hi, um, Mr. Rallos Zek, urm, my name's Rrowlz, and I like, wanna worship you, 'cuz a REAL big dude named Smashem came thru, and had like some really SWEET armor and stuffz.&quot;<br />

I think the new tribute system is supposed to do with race</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty big difference right there.<br />
No respect for the big guys .. you kill them instead. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mulberry</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol rping and you chose agnosting? wtf did you play a brain dead person also? how can you deny the existance or belief in a god when you can go right up and hail the fugger? <br />
<br />
Back in the day, much of 1999, there were no gods to hail. I know when I made my character, It was a choice between Rallos Zek and the The Tribunal--they were both just legends at the time. Heck, I don't think Inny or CT were in the game yet at the time to fight.  I thought it would be neat to RP someone who wasn't sure if the gods were real or not.<br />
<br />
Well duh, now they are all over the place! So why shouldn't there be a quest to convert if now you have absolute proof they exist? Just an afterhought :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crumm</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point in EQ, who cares.<br />
<br />
Adding zero religion-based content for YEARS, then dropping cultural armor out of the sky, was one of the stupidest ideas SoE (or Verant actually) had. 4-5 years ago you didn't choose a religion unless you wanted to roleplay. Very few people actually thought &quot;gee, I better choose a religion. They might add incredibly PHAT and unbalanced deity-restricted armor someday!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Sure cultrual armor might not seem all that phat or unbalanced today. Nowadays any 55+ tard can pretty much snag ornate, buy ToV multiquests for a song, etc. But when it first came out it was holy fuck good for most of us. And those of us 2-years+ deep into our agnostic characters were understandably a bit pissed.<br />
<br />
2 years ago it would have made a difference. Nowadays it would only help new players get a full set of raid-quality gear for virtually nothing.<br />
<br />
Though I can't complain too much. The ability to walk thru Nektulos + Katta without being hassled by guards has been WAY more useful than a set of Fierce Heraldic. I thank my lucky stars for this &quot;advantage&quot; every day......</div></div><hr />
