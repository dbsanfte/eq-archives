<br />
wondering what 2 weps I should use.<br />
<br />
Copper hammer + sword of the bloodsworn<br />
<br />
Copper hammer + long sword of freedom<br />
<br />
I had doubt of a 12/19 being as good as 20/29 in offhand unless it would proc a lot...so help ?<br />
<br />
Also wondered about delightful orb in offhand too.  dont see alot of wars with it on my server tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is your best course of action, in my opinion:<br />
<br />
Orb is too slow for a warrior, sell it or give to a ranger alt.  Use CHoS main hand, SotB in off hand for best results in DPS and agro when dual wielding and tanking.  Sell the longsword of freedom or give to a ranger alt.  Get a WMBS for non tanking DPS and a GSoT for a decent cheap 2h agro wep (for raids mostly) if you are over 55.  Dual wielding should be ok for experience groups but some boss mobs do riposte kind of hard and sometimes its nice to have the 2h for that reason.<br />
<br />
That weapon set up will be totally adequate for most experience groups and raids.  If you are raiding something that those weapons are not good enough for, you will probably have access to better weapons anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Longsword of freedom is no drop so you won't be selling it anytime soon.  At level 11 I wouldn;t worry about having the ultimate aggro setup either.  Go with which ever weapons seems to do the most damage, but because of the damage caps not quite sure what that would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ack--11!  I figured you were like level 50+.  Don't pay attention to my post until you get over 50 then it makes more sense.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can sell the longsword if you want (he is on Firona Vie according to the sidebar) but at 11 it might be a good weapon.<br />
<br />
Probably the best agro weapon you can use with a decent proc at 11 is a wavecrasher.  Costs up to 10k or so on my server (FV might be cheaper since everything is for sale there), procs 200 DoT + 20 percent slow and procs at level 1.  Assuming you can and want to spend up to 10k of course since its kind of a lot at level 11.<br />
<br />
Also, ornate sword of the general is a nice weapon for your level.  It is 10 damage and 18 delay but I have no idea what it sells for on FV.  No proc but its fast and better than most weapons normally used at level 11.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ribz</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent seen any wavecrashers for sale but they probably are a lot.  BLoodsworm is 12kisha nd copper hammeris 20k-30k <br />
<br />
Fv prices are insane =(<br />
<br />
Ill keep checking out for that wavecrasher tho, it would be a nice addition.<br />
<br />
I still need to get a 2hs for when Im not MT, which will be often with all the level 40's runnign around in ornate.<br />
<br />
War Marshals any good for that? Or should I go somethign slower that hits harder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is--you are 1/5th the recomended level so your damage will be very low with those weapons right now.  <br />
<br />
For example the CHoS has a recomended level of 56:<br />
<br />
11/56 x 13 damage on CHoS will make it 2 or 3 damage depending on if it is rounded up or down.  I think it is rounded down so I supose you could use it but a 2 damage 20 delay weapon is pretty weak even if the proc is nice.  The proc will be nice when it goes off but it is not reliable enough to rely on for killing a mob.  Get something you can use now and worry about using the ChoS when you get over 50.<br />
<br />
War Marshall's is going to be a similar problem as it has a mid 50's recomended level.  I would look for something like an Argent Protector (not defender btw) which has no recommended level.  That is a very decent 2h sword and will be useful for a lot of levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at level 11ish you need to focus on weapons without level restrictions, and shoot for the ones with the lowest delay.  Your damage is capped, but that doesn;t mean you can;t swing more to make up the difference.  Ornate sword of the General, Mith edged short sword, shadowheart would all fit the bill nicely.  I wouldn;t even worry about aggro weapons till you hit your 50's when it matters.  If you get something like shadowheart, you'll basically out aggro anyone anyway just because you are hitting so fast (well seems like that for my twinked ranger anyhow).</div></div><hr />

Not parsed, but my alt babies hit a lot harder with my hand-me downs than the whittled-down dmg number tells me they should be.<br />
<br />
/agree Tharak</div></div><hr />
