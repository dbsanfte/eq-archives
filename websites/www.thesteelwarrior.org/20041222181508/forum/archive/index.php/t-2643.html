When things get sorted out people like Kreugen will come right back with a vengence to tackle it.<br />
<br />
Kreugen does have a point.  I've said it many places Warrior's woes is a &quot;soft middle&quot; problem.  If you are too weak, you don't see it because the monster being tackled aren't that problematic.  If you are very strong you don't see it either because your so geared out to marginalize the function of Taunt.  Its a strange confluence of events that have conspired to make the middle of the game Warrior very weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">strange confluence of events that have conspired to make the middle of the game Warrior very weak. <br />
<br />
<br />
my thinking exactly. Warriors are way to dependant on gear to hold aggro. And this Middle is 30th lvl - 60th lvl +gear.<br />
<br />
yes we all talk about the chos and the sotbs but what’s a 50th lvl warrior going to do? solo?<br />
<br />
I don’t want eb on a button<br />
I don’t want aoe taunt on a 30 sec refresh<br />
<br />
What do I want?<br />
<br />
Here is One idea.<br />
<br />
Warrior only items with a taunt haste % on them<br />
<br />
lvl appropriate gear starting at 30th lvl and going up to 65th<br />
Start out at 10% reduction in taunt recycle time at 30th<br />
<br />
End up with<br />
<br />
40% reduction on say hot warrior gear and 50 on ornate and then even put some uber 70% drop that 90% of normal warriors will never see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or if that’s to hard to code, get some gear that increases the success of taunt. and not aa's. AA's to fix it is stupid because it does not help the 50th lvl warr that cannot get a group.<br />
<br />
As others and I have said before. A warrior should not be hoping for a proc to get aggro or some insanely rare weapon that they cant get till endgame when other classes have it on demand.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how this change would make us overpowered or break the game. Knights still will be able to get groups as they bring utilities but warriors would have a fair shot at getting into a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what's funny is Frozboz about 3 posts down saying that Kreugen is flat out wrong about warrior aggro.<br />
<br />
You know what, don't listen to fuckin warriors on this issue. We're all biased.  Don't listen to knights either, they're biased as well.<br />
<br />
But you listen to the wizards.  And the chanters.  And the shamans, and everyone else.  Why?  Cuz they've got nothing to gain from picking one side or the other on the issue..they call it like they see it, and THOSE classes see that there's a problem.<br />
<br />
Too many people in EQ can't see big picture.  They only think of their class (cough druids cough) and don't understand how everyone else interacts in the world.  When I see a wizard make a post that says Knight aggro is completely different from warrior aggro and that's fucked up, I get a little reassurance that everything will eventually be okay, because it's not just us whining because we think we're underpowered.  WE ARE underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tools available to a level 30-60 warrior today is way better than they ever had before.  If people in the past survived with infinitely inferior gear (and thus much inferior aggro), so can you.  Level 30-60 isn't exactly PoP ready anyway so you're still limited to either pre PoP content or at least easy PoP content.  I did 30-60 with ratio 1/2 weapons and never had any significant aggro issues (since mobs are pretty trivial at that point).  There's no reason why warriors of today with much better gear needs to cry about their problems.  <br />
<br />
A turbo-fire taunt button isn't what I want, not to mention it'd barely do anything on the high end except for trash mobs.  <br />
Besides, even 50% reduction time on taunt is too powerful.  <br />
<br />
Like Kreugen said, Warriors vastly outdamage Knights so it's not SoE's problem that people are stupid and don't know when DPS is the holy grial of grouping.  Assuming a mob avoids 15% from front using special skills, Tactical Mastery alone lets Warriors do nearly 9% more damage than any other class from the front (85% vs 92.5%).  And he's right about tanking.  The biggest problem with tank switching is warriors having too much aggro right now.  If I want to do DPS I have watch my aggro very carefully so I don't die the instant MT dies.  As ironic as it is, an evade button would help warriors a ton because we can always jump back to top with AE Taunt so you want the uber to wax some unimportant people (like everyone that's not a warrior) when you're doing a tank switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe because a knight with the same gear is 100% more effective and better to have in a group now (thanks to all that better &quot;all plate class&quot; gear and new spells with the last 3 expansions) than they were say back in kunark?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron, the basic problem is not that people 'cannot' survive (and perhaps even prosper) with warrior aggro, it's that it's far easier to simply ignore aggro control using a knight, it doesn't have to be more efficient it just has to be more convenient even if it's only in the short term. <br />
<br />
Why you continue to ignore this simple concept i don't understand, i'm frankly tired of repeating it.<br />
<br />
You likely will tell me that that's their problem since they don't understand the game well enough or whatever but since the end product is warriors being passed over in favour of knights I think it's fair to say it is our problem, no?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason you guys are saying people in the level 30-60 range needs help.  They have always been fine without these tools you need.  So what is it now, 60-65 nonuber warriors?  Stop changing the numbers to suit your needs.  Anyone under level 60 does not need help at all.  And if you were reading the post Kreugen does think Warriors should be better at holding aggro on mobs around their level.  I do think something like innate increased aggro on mobs equal or lower than you would work well.<br />
<br />
And if you actually read the post you'd realize that although Furor's complaints are justified, it has nothing to do with what you're complaining about.  Not one of you are being made obselete by a fully Time-geared Paladin, not to mention such a Paladin will be way better than your pickup warrior in every possible way by the virtue of gear like it should.  The disparity between Raex versus Time gear (i.e. they're essentially the same) which makes Knights huge winners in Time gear is something that needs to be addressed, but it's certainly not a problem any warrior who has trouble holding aggro in a pickup group needs to worry about.  <br />
<br />
At the end I think this from Kreugen sums it up pretty well:<br />
<br />
&quot;The great fear is, warriors will be unwanted in ldon, for those six man dungeon crawls. However nothing suggested will change that, short of completely overpowering the class and ruining a few others in the process. Warriors aren't exactly alone in that boat, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you are so afraid of aggro, not a single one of your suggestions will help you get a spot in LDoN.  I have seen some pretty crazy things people do and any reasonable change to the warrior class will not stop the aggro machines out there.  So you're still useless because super_nuker_01 will still kill himself with you tanking, and since Knights still exist, you're still useless.  You basically assume in a group, aggro weighs infinitely more important than stuff like DPS.  If that's true you will never be chosen in the first place regardless of what fixes they put in for the warrior class.  So you might as well quit now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trick is Phantron is that POP sucks for gear if you aren't in a constantly raiding guild.  There are a lot of who simply lack mobility and don't have any hope of that changing.  Simply saying &quot;get better gear&quot; is like telling someone stranded in a desert all they need to do is find some water.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't tell you what a Warrior struggling in Valor can do to help up their agro.  Where is the better gear they are to quest or kill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all honesty, the real issue is that with the dumbing down of exp that started with Kunark, people don't have to know how to play their char well to get 65 with a bazillion AAs.<br />
<br />
Pre-Kunark, if you wanted to get beyond level 35, you went into L.Guk or Sol. B and learned how to play a controlled, strategic game, so that you didn't end up food to a bunch of frogloks/bugs/kobolds.  Kunark gave us risk free exp, where people could run away from their mistakes a lot easier than in the depths of the old world dungeons. We have people who learned to play in the newbie zone/LOIO/OT/ DL road that required zero intelligence to survive and level up. Every expansion has made it easier to get experience, levels, and now AAs, without teaching some of the early &quot;player skills&quot;: how to manage aggro/push/mana.<br />
<br />
Now we pay the price for the &quot;easy&quot; roads through the levels in the end.<br />
<br />
As far as the mini-debate that Phantron and Valeris are having, our use in LDoN will depend on 2 things: how well we obtain aggro and how hard the mobs hit. If they whack a caster for 700s for overnuking, then aggro becomes the pivotal issue. If casters can survive a few whacks, then our DPS advantage may be enough to make us more desirable than Pallies, but SKs are going to be in the money either way.</div></div><hr />

You may now refer to TOTAL GROUP DPS as TGDPS for the sake of having another acronym to memorize.<br />
<br />
( Yes, that’s right, I had to use a new phrase to get the point across because some peoples skulls are to thick to understand it with the old ones. )<br />
<br />
That means the ALL of the shit the casters do, and ALL of the shit the other melees do, and even that hammer thing the clerics get all rolled up into one lump of DPS.<br />
<br />
That is what kills mobs dead. I may have higher individual dps than a paladin but does the group, as a hole, have more dps using a warrior to tank?<br />
<br />
And for the record those spiffy swing more often +dps AA's add to mob dps via riposte as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why didn't all the paladins quit when they were so far hosed in kunark? <br />
<br />
I think that quotes absolutely correct, in the majority of cases tank DPS is hardly considered certainly not as a balancer to aggro generation. So, having played this character (my first) for 4 straight years i should stop campaigning (in my small way) for some redress to a situation that is not acceptably balanced and just quit? <br />
<br />
Thanks but no thanks. <br />
<br />
I did the raid thing, i have EB, I can hold my own to some extent in exp. should I therefore ignore something that appears obviously out of wack because 'I'm ok jack?' Fuck that.<br />
<br />
as far as 30 -60 is concerned.<br />
<br />
I play a cleric alt in the 30's, far as I can see you can take ANY melee in group (BST and up) and reasonably exp. The 'advantage' of using a warrior is fairly miniscule in this mudflated era and SK's and pallies keep their aggro advantage. I wouldn't say that i really care at that level - except on the occasions when I need a mob taunted off now :p -  but so far as hp's go I'm not seeing a big mana saving nor massively increased kill rate with a warrior tank either. <br />
<br />
/shrug <br />
<br />
Can't say as I'm concentrated upon maximising my efficiency or anything though, I just take a group and heal it, composition isn't of interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN wasn't part of this topic heh. It does appear that this expansion might hang around multiple mobs being tanked/killed at once, anything that gets us away from the one group/one tank methodology is fine with me. Lets hope they pull it off. <br />
<br />
I'm a little concerned with the time limits mentioned as no tank class short of Rallos/Elementals/200 AA can say they have 'great  DPS'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically what seemed to have happened was that Kreugen did a parse and found out he was 30% below warrior DPS instead of  20%. <br />
<br />
That whole FoH &quot;editorial&quot; is pretty much one big whine based on that single point, very easy to see through.<br />
<br />
My opinion on the issue? Sure give them some DPS back so they stop crying, and &quot;tune&quot; the agro gained from stuns(aka remove it from anything immune). See how they like that.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is they would still be a pretty nice class, even if they had to get agro like we do with the good old fashioned taunt button.</div></div><hr />

Actually just kidding.. but I must admit that Kreugens post is a pretty darn nice troll post. Even had me going for a bit.<br />

I am wondering if he is really getting the effect he desires though, all I am left thinking after reading all his poorly thought out bs is.. <br />
<br />
Nerf the fuck out of those whiny paladins and dont look back :p<br />

What is the main point of his post anyway? When I read it again its kind of hard to find.. basically just a mish mash of various stuff.<br />

If I read it correctly he is saying:<br />
<br />
A) I am sick of warriors whining<br />
<br />
And then he begins to whine:<br />

B) Paladins having 30% lower dps than warriors<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Furor's response has nothing to do with the point Kreugen is making because he is not a Time-equipped Paladin that Furor is worried about (Kreugen gear is definitely elemental not Time).  Both have valid points, just not over the same subject.<br />
<br />
When you talk about total group DPS, are you talking about total group DPS over say 3 minutes or 3 hours?  Yes a group with a Knight's total DPS over 3 minutes will be much, much higher than a group's total DPS with a Warrior, but does your XP group last 3 minutes before they decide it's time to call it quits while you're ahead of the total DPS rating?  Over a long period of a time, a caster cease to have the ability to pump out more damage regardless of aggro because mana regen becomes the limiting factor.  At this point the DPS you get from a warrior over a Paladin is significant.  Of course, I guess all you people's groups are so uber that your casters just chain SoS for 3 hours straight without breaking a sweat.  Stop lying to yourself and think your group is all uber.  If aggro is even an issue then your group sucks for DPS because a truly heavy DPS loaded group runs out of mobs to kill well before any aggro related problems can surface.<br />
<br />
And whoever said Kreugen probably does more damage than a good deal of warriors.  Um yeah, that's what gear is for... kind of like a high end warrior does a lot more damage than a lot of low end wizards out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things Kreugen says are very revealing to me.<br />
<br />
Warriors are less desired in groups than pak/sk. So fucking what?<br />
<br />
He admits that Knights are preferred over Warriors for groups, and he isn't particularly bothered by that.  No surprise there.<br />
<br />
About the only GOOD and likely to happen idea is that warriors standard taunt should be more effective IN A GROUP SETTING.<br />
<br />
He admits that he sees merit in a change to Warrior standard taunt in a group setting.<br />
<br />
The rest appears to me to be extreme hyperbole and general belly aching, very much the same thing he accuses Warrior of doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But those warriors that are still using the 1hs aggro combos to do their job,  do not have this wide marging over the pallies that are using some sweet 2handers. <br />
<br />
The balance of my class should not be dependant of ONE drop from a god. A good majority of the warrior population cant seem to get a hold of this item that seems to make some players say &quot;The warrior class is fine, they do uber damage and have no problem with aggro&quot;. Unless I missed when BoW was accesible by handing a rune to some guy in a library. <br />
<br />
If a warrior can pack 300k plat, he might be lucky enough to purchase a BoC (15/20) paired with something else(and the proc rate of BoC seems abysmal at times). Doubt that will outdamage a paladin using a Windblade. A 20k weapon? and can still tank with flawless aggro and outdamage warriors with 1hs aggro combos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much sums it up. Got in an argument with a pally in my guild last night, and all he could do was bring up pre-kunark. Had me laughing a few, but even the guildleader(shaman), Wizard, and cleric that were grouped with us, agreed. Pallies are fine. Once I brought up LDoN the pally didnt know what to say. So I had to point out, my one advantage lies in my slightly higher (assuming the warrior is using little better gear) DPS, and the fact that i have /disc defense. Other then that, I have not one advantage. And another thing. Don't quote me on this. But my 2hb skill is about 100. I was using GSoT last night, for the first time. And was pulling aggro from a pally and warrior bout +4 levels on me, without taunting. I now have decided this is personally one of the better middle higher end weapons for a warrior. And, its warrior only. The stun on it is very nice indeed. Don't think it was ever resisted. But you cant ungimp a class by giving them weapons. Basically once the hp advantage we had got nerfed, and then the all class plates came out. We lost the only advantage we had. I could never understand, how the warrior, trained his WHOLE LIFE, to fight, and kill. Had not one class specific ability, with the exception of /shield, which should have just been a disc. I should get something like rogues/monks have. Think about it, both of these pure melee classes have something. Rogue has backstab. Monk has dragon kicks and all those cool things. Warrior has, you guessed it!! /shield!! I am trained to take a beating, and dish one out. But so far, little god-fearing wimp paladin can take and dish out as much as I can, and heal himself.<br />

Do they like it.... NO.<br />
Do this cost Exp. ... Jes it cost a real bunch of Exp sitting around until the rezzed Chanter / Healer has enough mana for the next pull. Oh wait no Cleric in Group so time is extra for finding a rezzer ....<br />
<br />
The result of aggrolock is lesser death to these chars is lesser waiting time for next mob is the loss in exp.<br />
<br />
So over a time (6 hours ) a normal standard Expgroup in PoV with normal standard Tanks ( non UBERS ) will make more Exp out of the lesser numbers of Deaths of the member. <br />
<br />
Btw. I have often seen these ppl. leaving the group after one or two deaths so these groups lost more time waiting on a replace ...<br />
<br />
Nobody leaves a running group when its not real nessessary. Lots of ppl. leave groups cause of the death of one groupmember.<br />
<br />
So when you want a Pick Up with a steady stream of Exp without death penalty times you choose a Paladin or an Shadowknight but not an Warrior. Periot</div></div><hr />

Kreugen is just trolling. He's damn good at it tho<br />

I was trolling too, if you read the cleric thread.  I'm hoping that was my line that got the bite. :D</div></div><hr />

If anything my guild has an excess of warriors (around 12) and a shortage of knights (3 pallies, no SKs). I also have friends I group with.  Paladins DO NOT tank better than warriors, they just hold agro better.</div></div><hr />

Even the small percentage of warriors with the correct itemisation struggle to hold aggro 'well enough' in comparison with any knight.<br />

There's lots of shades of grey involved but the problem's pretty straight forward really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm always amazed by Frodlins posts, rather thought provoking and not full of class whines and drivel. His post on page 10 of that thread about that myths of the differences between knights and warriors pretty much pulled the rug out from under every single one of the whines that are put forth by paladins and you'll notice that not a single paladin has acknowledged that facts made by Frodlin, the truth scares them. Makes me wish he was a dev working for SoE. I know for sure that I'd buy that dude a beer anytime<br />
<br />
My own thoughts on knights, paladins specifically, is that without a doubt, they sucked for the first 2 years of eq, can't really deny that and it gave every single paladin an inferiority complex and then they started getting upgrades out the wazoo, and that gave them a godlike complex. So on one hand you have the belief that they suck and will always suck compared to other classes and on the other hand, nothing they ever get will be enough, they need more, more, more and what they do get has to be better and they can no longer see that what they do have makes them extremely useful in raids and xp groups.</div></div><hr />

Actually, a Paladin with a Ghoulbane was pretty popular in LGuk back in the day. The first &quot;uber player&quot; I saw was a Paladin with the first Epic on my server.<br />
<br />
Kunark was very tough on Paladins. But in some ways it only seemed hard because they had it so good until Kunark. I think it was Kunark that gave some Paladins the hebbie jebbies. It was an experiance they would do anything not to repeat.<br />
<br />
 I honestly think Knights are not overpowered. The dificulty is that Warriors in comparison are underpowered except when they are MTing a mob with Defensive on. Someone called this three minutes of glory and it's all too true.<br />

So if you want to give warriors triple the DPS of knights then I'll be happy with my crap aggro.</div></div><hr />
