<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have Fleshgrinder, Frostbringer, and as of last night I have Sword of the Bloodsworn. I also have Snowchipper still but I seriously doubt it is even close to these others. I am working on getting the Copper hammer but don't have it yet so looking on advise on what combo and what hand to put them in until I get the Copper hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For aggro, my choice would be Bloodsworn mainhand, Frosty offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sell Snowchipper and Fleshgrinder<br />
<br />
<br />
Put Bloodsworn in Main, Frosty in off<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are not able to group to get one, buy the Copper Hammer with the money made from selling the other weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, it really doesn't matter, but personally i would put copper hammer in Primary, Bloodsworn in off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So the Frosty proc out weighs the extra damage that FG can do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For an off-hand weapon, I'd say no.  The Fleshgrinder proc doesn't do much for aggro, but it procs an so much more than the Frosty.  If you can get it to proc 3-4 times a fight in offhand (what it used to do for me) that should out-weigh the one proc that you might get from the Frosty.<br />
<br />
But if you can get the Copper Hammer, by all means do it.  It is by far much better than any of the other three weapons.<br />
<br />
Picked up a CHoS the other day, and I love it, works great with my CHSD, although I'm still not sure which is better in which slot, but nothing more badass than a Wood Elf weilding a couple of Hammers.</div></div><hr />

I've been using CHoS main hand and CHSD offhand, it seems like CHSD procs more in offhand than CHoS does and any loss of dps due to the 13/20 in main instead of 13/19 ( if there is any with haste etc ) is offset by the DD proc on the CHoS. I switched them out the other day after Kailyn ( /wave ) saw me in game and mentioned my setup, but I seem to be parsing about the same dps and the CHoS doesn't proc nearly as much in offhand so I'm switching back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It has been a very interesting weekend. I am looking for new advise now cause I have gotten a upgrade now. I camped the King on Friday and now have my Copper Hammer of Striking and from our Raid on POI Dragon Sunday I got the Cord Hilted Spike Driver. Now I am looking for peoples options on this setup. Frosty has served me well but its out now and Fleshgrinder is nice but agro wise its out. It would seem to me the best place for the CHSD is in my main hand cause you want the agro proc to happen as much as possible but now which do I put in my offhand. Both the Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer of Striking are close to the same ratio. Both of them proc a DD with a stun. Even though the Hammer has a stun that stun seems to have a limit on lvl of mob it can stun cause I can not think of one thing I hit that was not immune to the stun on the hammer. The Planar Stun does not have as low a limit on its stun so it seems nice cause it has a chance of going off when something casting and interrupt it in case my Slam fails. And the 8 STA on the Sword seems really nice too. So I am looking for peoples opinions on this. Which combo is best? and should I put the Cord Hilted Spike Driver in main hand or off hand?</div></div><hr />
