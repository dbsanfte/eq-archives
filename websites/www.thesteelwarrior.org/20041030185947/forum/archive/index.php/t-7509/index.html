<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to solo the mobs that drop Copper Hammer and SoBS?  I have a non flagged non guilded 65 Necro as my main and I'm trying to get those weapons for my twink warrior.  Is it possible to inviso all the way to them or do I need to kill to get there?<br />
<br />
Also on different note, is Gomdurig a decent weapon  enough weapon for dps and aggro for Piercing skill or shall I invest in something better?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any posts.   I also want to thank everyone on these boards for the fantastic posts.  This is a great site and please keep up the discussions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why do you want piercing? Other than that, no. It's not an aggro weapon, and it probably would have trouble holding a mob's attention. It's only pure DPS and isn't going to be very good for warriors. If you're not tanking you can work on your piercing skill, otherwise keep it bagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes the mobs and camps can be solo'd . I have friend, 65 shammy prolly had about 80 aa, average gear when the zones were revamped. He has been soloing those camps since then, up untill recently. Not that tough for a good player of the right classes.</div></div><hr />

Yes, pretty decent exp and faction and coin to boot.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to inviso all the way to them <br />
<br />
Nothing sees thru invis<br />
<br />
Gomdurig a decent weapon ... &quot;to&quot; invest &quot;in&quot;<br />
<br />
Easier to camp that Gomdurig then the Droga weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you for the info all!!  I appreciate it!<br />
<br />
Just to clarify on the Piercing part.  I just wanted to know if there was a better weapon more for practice than actual MT.  I enjoy trying to keep all skills up thats the real reason and I normally am the tank in groups.  I know that I wont be able to hold the aggro long with the Gomdurig but its just there to help skills and dps.<br />
<br />
I currently farm Veksar for my pp to buy twink stuff so I'm pretty familar with the zone=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The named and quest mobs in droga can see thru invis, so there are a few mobs to worry about. By quest mobs I mean the named that only drop those quest items, there are a few.</div></div><hr />
