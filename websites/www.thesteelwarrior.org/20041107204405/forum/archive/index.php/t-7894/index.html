<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grunmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone bought this AA yet? When it says you end up with less hps than you started with what does that mean? Permenantly? Til u die? Seems like a description that would scare more people away than attract them to buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It gives you a small heal (500 for 1st level, 1k for 2nd, and 1500 for third), but it also leaves an effect that dots you for about a minute (the amount of the dot increases each level).<br />
<br />
Its something you should only consider if you have everything useful done already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its something you should only consider if you have everything useful done already.<br />
<br />
but at this point it becames just a waste of AA because the 3000HP heal (at max AA) is not that great, but the 4500HP DoT in one minute starts hurting a bit. Thus this ability is not preferable to a patch heal in raid context, it's awfull in solo context, so mayge in exp group but I still doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3rd last aa I had left, and now I have it maxed it has its uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mistersparkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone bought this AA yet? <br />
<br />
no one has bought this AA yet even though GoD has been out 4-6 months.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
When it says you end up with less hps than you started with what does that mean? Permenantly? Til u die?<br />
<br />
ya its permanent. ive used it too much and am 2k fully geared now.  :( <br />
<br />
<br />
ok i dont do flames and stuff but this question is not high level at all. any research anywhere could tell you what it does and how it works.<br />
<br />
just curious, how long have you been playing? it looks like you jumped from the bazaar right into potime.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grunmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well thats all i wanted to know thanks Decaillin and Yoda....since everyone already knows what it does, u can delete the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thus this ability is not preferable to a patch heal in raid context <br />
<br />
I would think it might be useful as an emergency patch when there aren't any patches available (aka better than dead).  /shrug I have other things to buy atm that are higher priority though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">like innate wisdom?<br />
<br />
... sorry couldnt resist  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bah  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if at least incresing wisdom7intelligence would help to autofire disc and active AA at the right moment ... :/<br />
this would let us make coffee in less hurry :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use this quite a bit just remember to cure the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, the dot is cureable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">screams exploit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">come to think of it i may get there are uses for this AA. ive lost count of the number of times in raids ive been stuck at like 10 pct health after ae/ rampage / aggro etc and waiting those interminable seconds for the healers to wake up and patch heal u.sometimes they get you,sometimes you get killed by low health aggro.. would be nice to have that ability to insta heal myself..</div></div><hr />

<br />
would be even better in this situation to share the affect with the healer : you get the heal, he gets the DoT :) with a little emote message saying that your anger healed yourself at the cost of your healer :) LoL this would wake him up for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">my anger usually gets me healed np. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">btw one of the earlier posters said max heal was 3000, i thought i twas 1500?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It would be much more useful if the heal was 3k and the dot was 5k or so.  1500 is barely more than 1 hit for a lot of mobs in current content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yoda:<br />
/beer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The DoT is a DoT so yes of course it's curable. Why the heck would that be an exploit? You trade a wussy heal for getting somebody else to cast a PS on you, or just eat the DoT it's not much anyway... the heal itself can be useful to give a healer another second or so to land a heal on you, which can make the difference between victory and wipe in the right circumstances, that's the idea.<br />
<br />
I think of it this way: the DoT was thrown in to make it crystal clear that it's a super-nerfed version of Mend, and useless in soloing. Much longer refresh, wussier heal, and then a DoT to deal with however you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't see it as being an exploit,  it's a detrimental effect that can be cured as Coroq said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The exploit is curing the DOT which is an side effect to using the ability. This is akin to curing rez effects. If it can be cured then all the ability ends up being is a warrior instant mini LOH/HT. You guys don't see the problem with that, especially since you can buy cure potions/items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Normally the loss of a buff slot is more detrimental than the dot itself.  I suggested it be coded as a bard song in beta but that suggestion was not used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">500hp is nowhere near the effectiveness of a lay hands.  as for curing yourself, the dot lasts a minute, if you weren't in a grp with someone who can cast RC, it ain't worth curing.</div></div><hr />
