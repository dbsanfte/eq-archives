IGN is the only place I know of that hosts something like that.  I think you'd have more luck posting on the server (LB)'s boards but one of my guildies is a mod and says they disallow it and funnel all the requests to a specific board.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  Once you go PvP it's really hard to go back.  :D  I have a few friends on Stormrage who have been trying to get me to play over there but it seems too bland now after playing from day 1 on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />

Over the recent weeks we have been investigating the activities of certain individuals who have been farming gold in order to sell it in exchange for real world currency. After researching the situation, we have issued permanent suspensions to over one thousand accounts that have been engaging in this practice. We do not condone such actions and will take decisive action as they are against our policy and damage the game economy as a whole. We will continue researching this matter. If you suspect someone of taking part in said gold farming, please eMail the report to wowgm@blizzard.com. <br />

You obviously missed the point of my post.  I want to TRANSFER gold from one server to the other via a trade with another player, no &quot;real world currency&quot; involved.  If I really didn't care I could sell my gold to someone like IGE and then buy gold on my new server, but I'd never do that because I don't want to in any way jeopardize my account.</div></div><hr />

We aren't gonna be able to help you out here.</div></div><hr />

Just add a server line or make it where you write something like<br />
joe@whispering  to send something across.<br />
<br />
Many people have friends/accts on various servers.    Would make the game funner just from a communication stand point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also have to be careful with Blizzard.  I know you are in no way using real life currency, but if they misread a post somewhere they might ban first and ask questions later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tubbiey</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also wonder if they worry about the economy on the different servers.  It could be that your xx gold would be able to buy much more on server y than your current server.  Trite? yeah</div></div><hr />

That would fuck server economies way up.   A level 60 from a big guild on an overcroweded server sending all their gold to a new twink toon on a low population server will defintaly give that guy an unfair advantage over the people who are starting thier first toon on that low pop server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an (in)famous guy on my server by the name of Lyght who stole 200 gold in a cross-server transfer.   He's pretty well hated and despised on my server, but stands as an example to those trusting enough to try it.  If you do find someone willing to transfer, just be careful and smart - do it in small sums.  Better to lose 5-10 gold than 200.</div></div><hr />

Shrug, color me a cynic but who cares?<br />
<br />
Really, to me if someone earns all this gold/etc or makes this theoretical high level super toon, they have invested the time/effort into WOW to do it.<br />
<br />
If they want to give thier first toon a big advantage, so what?   They earned<br />
the right through thier play time anyway.<br />
<br />
Same thing happens inside a server, my baby 34 rogue is benefiting from my level 60 character a great deal.  I can't see it being that big a deal across.<br />
<br />
Ironically, I just want blizzard and mmorphs in general to make it easier for friends to communicate.   You meet someone, and wow you both realize you play WOW.   but the odds of server/faction matching are what 1 in 50?</div></div><hr />
