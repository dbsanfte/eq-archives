<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all.<br />
I'm an unguilded warrior gimping through my epic fights.<br />
Did vexd 3 boxing, pulling to ZI and zoning.<br />
Did Devourer with 8 people, my RL friend and myself were playing 5 of those.<br />
Did Lord Gal just a couple minutes ago 3 boxing war shm and enc. (Used invis vs undead and cleared about 5 mobs to get to him.<br />
Going to 5 man Champion with my RL friend again.<br />
<br />
The question is, what is the absolute minimum required for Krekk?<br />
Cleric is about 8k mana, shaman 8k, all max OOW FT and all spells up to 70.<br />
Warrior (me) 13khp/2k ac. <br />
<br />
Base group - Cleric, Warrior, Shaman, Enchanter, Bard, Ranger.<br />
What is the least number of people we have to recruit to win this?<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
WITH INFO FROM THIS THREAD, AND MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AFTER I ATTEMPT HIM, I WILL MAKE A NEW THREAD WITH COMPLETE AND COMPILED INFO ON HIM!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've fought Krekk 3 times and everytime we've brought at least 4 groups of Elemental / some Ikkinz equipped players and the fight has been far from a secure win.<br />
Krekk has loads of hp and his dps output is sufficient that you need a few healers to keep up with it. The AE isn't helping things in the healing department either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Krekk isn't as badass as some people make him out to be.  He, like most final epic fights, has about 600k hp on the nose and dishes out a whopping 250 to 325dps depending on how strong a tank you are.  His AE is pretty annoying, and you need to combat it with MGB heals, but it's nothing as badass as like Blazzax or anything.  <br />
<br />
I must make mention though that Krekk does have a 2000 damage proc.  Well, I think it's a proc, though the recast does say 30 seconds.  It didn't even go off until halfway through the fight.<br />
<br />

<br />
When you think Krekk though, think Girplin Devourer with twice the hp and a different AE.  Both their dps is about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ember</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild and I just fought Krekk for me tonite.. and to tell the truth, it was a huge learning experience.  I wasn't really expecting some of the stuff he threw at us.  But maybe this will help some of you who haven't gotten a chance to give him a go.<br />
<br />
We had about 28 people, all pre-elemental, and we've cleared VT a handful of times.  We cleared his area, moved in and I spawned him.   We were expecting a 2k hitter with a knockback / stun AE.  Which he does have, but also every 30 seconds he procs 1500 dd / stun / knockback on his target, and every 90 seconds a 2k dd / slow on  his target, and every 180 seconds a 2k dd / stun AE feign death.<br />
<br />
We got him down to 20% on our first try.  The FD was a killer for us, thats when he started eating people.  The 2nd go round we tried to position him on the wall around the building area he's in... and he went right through it to the other side, summoned me and wouldn't follow back.   Had our positioning been better on our first attempt, we would have won.<br />
<br />
So there's that, he rampages and flurries, but not very often. He is slowable, probably a partial but not sure.  Max hit he got on me was 2235, min hit was 350.  His melee really wasn't that bad. was a bunch of 500-800's and then every once in awhile he'd get a lucky 1k-2k shot.  I was buffed up to 11.8k hps / 1950ac.<br />
<br />
The Whirlwind slice spell was fairly easy to resist with a bard.  My MR was 500 and I resisted it probably 3/4 of the time.  <br />
<br />
I did notice that his agro was really screwy too, we had a hard time trying to keep it on one person.  Every time I got knocked back he'd just turn around and whack some poor defenseless rogue or beasty.  I think next time I'm gonna take some advice I read and pull him to zone in, will at least provide a good solid wall that he wont get pushed over / around / through.<br />
<br />
I dont know if I read anywhere what happens when you fail on Krekk.  So if anyone's worried that they might lose their stuff or whatever, dont be.  I was kinda worried too, but after we wiped on the first try, I invised up and walked up to Krekk, and he was non-agro.   I hailed him and it started the script again, and he proceeded to give me a quick death.  So it appeared they instituted a char flag so you can re-trigger as much as you want.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did Krekk the other night and lost two of our 3 clerics by about 40% health so we just had one cleric and a druid healing.  They had to mostly spam fast heals and were OOM by the end of the fight but we won and the tank didn't die (came very close numerous times however).  This was on a 9k/1800 (unbuffed) warrior.  If the numbers you posted are your unbuffed stats, you may very well be able to get by with just a couple healers (assuming FT20 and 8k mana etc).  If they are your buffed stats you better have at least 3 or 4.  We had 30ish elemental geared people, and the healing required was definitely not sustainable for long so I think you want at least one more cleric, maybe a druid (for the stackable group heal to take care of the AEs and help with healing the tank), and 3 or 4 DPS people.  Probably be possible with 2 groups of high end people, but not easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tubbiey</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few fine folks came out to help me do Krekk recently.  We had 21 total with 2 clerics, no druids, and a couple of shamen.   The fight was much easier than I had expected.  Keys being.... everyone buffs MR since the lame ae is on MR with a low check.  (bards r gud)   Krekk also has a single target slow (thus the MT) so have to be wary of aggro control.   Get your butt off the ground ASAP on an FD proc, especially if your tanking, because you have about .5 to 1 second to stand up before he'll go beat on someone else, and your aggro will be hosed unless ae taunt is up !<br />
<br />
I wish ye luck.<br />

<br />
Edit: as far as one grouping it.....I would guess no, but would love to hear about someone doing it.  I just don't think mana would hold out for that long of a fight.  Also the adds would most likely respawn before you could get him down unless you find a safe area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for the info all. Last question. How does he compare to AoW?<br />
The 5 people I mentioned before gave him a shot and got him to 40% with a cleric and shaman as only healers. Didnt use Divine Res either, mostly because we forgot to :(<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Also, you mentioned he puts out at best 325 DPS? Seems a bit low, as when I was playing around with my parser, unslowed MPG mobs did 300-400 dps on me. Also, I calculated that the most DPS my shaman could keep up with is roughly 315 without relying heavily on critical heals -which therefore means that a shaman could keep up, at least for a while, as the only healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">325 dps may be a bit low, but probably not by much, at least through defensive. His melee really isn't anything to write home about. I've tanked him 3 times, and every time I forget to swap out my invisi-bp, or turn on tribute, or turn on defensive, and i've never really come close to dieing. Just keep your back to the wall so he gflux's you into it, and you shouldn't have much trouble with aggro, either. I don't think i've ever lost aggro on him except when I'm oor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Further research on this event generated a couple more questions.<br />
Anyone know definitively AFTER he was changed these things - <br />
-If we fail him and quit for the day, how much of the quest, if any must I redo?<br />
-The FD AE comes in at a certain % or always there?<br />
-Is the 1000 mana drain AE as deleterious as it sounds?<br />
-If pulled to zone in, will he stay there? If so, for how long approx?<br />
-Lastly, what is his regen if he has no agro? I heard Devourer regens really really slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I tanked him, I took &quot;260.93dps&quot; from him.  We also beat him in less than 3 minutes, so I never took damage outside of Defensive.  I'm over 2500ac buffed though and have max defensive AAs.  <br />
<br />
But seriously, some of these epic bosses don't do as much dps as you would think.  The only real heavy hitting epic fights I can think of is Tarlang and Marshal Histent.  You could argue the 3k+ hitting pally guy in WW for the Sk epic to be a &quot;badass&quot;, but I only took 193dps from him.  High AC fuckin' rules on him though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm im about 2100 buffed ac. But 260 dps is way low, even +100 would still make him 1 groupable.</div></div><hr />
