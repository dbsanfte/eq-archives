<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best way I know for lower levels to make money is killing spiders, spiderlings, bears, wolves and cats. Sell all the droppable, stackable loot (paws, egg sacks, woven spidersilks) to vendors for about 2gp each. Sell the silks and quality pelts in the bazaar. There are always people skilling up tailoring or pottery who will buy.<br />
<br />
Another option, if you're a 'good' race, is to kill the bandits in WK. Sell the bronze weapons to the nearby vendor and turn in the sashes in SQeynos pallie guild. You get 1-12gp and either a bronze 1hb or a shield to sell for each sash. As a bonus, the xp from the sashes is noticeable even up to 30.</div></div><hr />
