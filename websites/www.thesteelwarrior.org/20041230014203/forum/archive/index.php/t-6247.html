<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I experienced some weird taunt behavior in Droga this weekend.  It seemed inconsistent with what we think we know about taunt.<br />
<br />
Here's the situation.  I'm hydra, a 65 warrior and a 65 shammy, no one else with me.  (Exp is crappy that way, but I was afk on and off, so couldn't do a real group.)<br />
<br />
When I am hydra like that, I use the shammy to pull.  The shammy pulls with slow and comes to my camp spot, the mob follows, the dog and the warrior engage, and off we go.<br />
<br />
So here's what happened, pretty frequently.  The mob comes in, the warrior and the dog start attacking.  The warrior taunts, and, if taunt is successful, the mob turns to the warrior.<br />
<br />
Except that, several times, AFTER turning to the warrior upon a successful taunt, the mob turned back to the shammy for several seconds.  The only thing that was happening was the warrior and the dog were attacking the mob.  The shammy wasn't doing anything (other than the slow it had already cast, long before the successful taunt, and other than the dog attacking).  <br />
<br />
So I say to myself, hmm, taunt just puts you barely at the top of the aggro list, maybe I had bad luck, maybe the warrior missed and the dog hit, and the dog put the shammy back at the top of the aggro list.<br />
<br />
Except that wasn't what was happening.  I watched the swings, the hits, and the misses, and it wasn't that the dog was hitting earlier or faster.  Most of the time, the warrior was connecting first (after the taunt), and just as often (the warrior was using a GSo4W, but the haste item makes up for a lot of the bigger delay and the lack of dual wielding).    <br />
<br />
Another interesting observation.  If the mob turned back to the shammy, it usually took until the next taunt for the mob to turn back to the warrior.  Even though the warrior was hitting a LOT harder than the dog (as you might expect).  And, after the second successful taunt, the mob NEVER turned back to the shammy.<br />
<br />
Please note, I was not using incite, because recapturing aggro wasn't all that important, once they are slowed the shammy could tank them himself.  (When I am PLing my rogue in Droga, I root them and put the shammy close, so the mob will concentrate on the shammy and allow the rogue to backstab.)<br />
<br />
This behavior seems totally inconsistent with what we know about taunt.  I thought that maybe it was the fact that I was using a two-hander, but the GSo4W can sometimes steal aggro from even a high level warrior dual wielding, if the other warrior isn't inciting and doesn't get an early proc.  If I can almost match aggro with a high level dual wielding warrior, I should be all over a shammy pet (level 58, iirc).  And, if that was the problem, it should have happened at least once in a while after the second successful taunt.  Except that it NEVER happened after a second successful taunt.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any thoughts about this?  Am I missing something, or is there another (possibly minor) factor in taunt that we have overlooked?</div></div><hr />

<br />
one thing might have been the mobs have been castings, when a mob nukes and melees they dont seem to do it on the same target, so the mob will be meleeing you, turn around to nuke the shaman, then turn back to you to melee</div></div><hr />

you'd think  that doing more damage would do more then a miss</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking that the shammy started with aggro from slow, the warrior steps in (starting to produce aggro, but has to get past the slow aggro level), but the warrior will take a little longer to maintain aggro control since the doggy is attacking and generating some aggro for the shammy.<br />
<br />
At least, that's how I'm seeing it. If it's a big deal, get your warrior to use provoke or one of the others to keep the mob from turning.</div></div><hr />

He wouldn't pull, but after slowing if his dog attacked before I did I would taunt and the mob would turn right back into the shaman even if successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shammy wasn't sitting.<br />
<br />
So, this is a wrinkle in the way taunt works that our simple theory didn't predict.  Hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recall that they changed the rules for pet aggro a while back (specifically aimed at charmed pets).  If multiple people are attacking the mob, then the pet's aggro is aimed at the master of the pet.  I think this is what you were seeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">devist8or</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try turning off the pet's taunt ability and try again. I 2-box a warrior/shammy all the time and see the same issue even in LDoN. Hell,  when I group with a freind who 2-boxes a ranger/cleric the mob will stop to cast on the shammy throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
 I always laugh when a caster mob stops fighting just to cast root on my shaman, like I am running somewhere. Oh well I dont get the odd agro that happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you proc anywhere between? Procs often result in + or - aggro for a person heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone else mentioned, /pet attack has an inordinate amount of hate associated with it.  I two-box a warrior and shaman in Droga frequently, with my wife playing her druid for heals and snares, and one thing I've learned is that the warrior has to pull, set position and start meleeing before I can flip over and send the shaman pet in.  If I do it immediately, the mob will invariably charge the shaman as soon as I hit the /pet attack hotkey.  I give the warrior a round or two of melee to build aggro before having the pet attack and start trying to slow.<br />
<br />
The shaman is only 48, compared to a 62 warrior, I don't know if the level differential has anything to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't watch for procs specifically, but, as you might expect, the warrior's procs are all aggro producers .. Force Shock, Taunting Blow, and Anger 2 .. and the dog doesn't proc.  So procs should only help the warrior keep aggro, and shouldn't explain why the warrior loses aggro immediately after a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
It must be a pet aggro wrinkle.  I'll try it again with /pet taunt off, and see if the same thing happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't call this a new discovery personally.  You taunted, but the pet attacking got aggro back onto the shaman.  Sounds pretty normal to me.  I wouldn't try to be so precise about it that you're trying to watch for individual swings.  At that point you are virtually equal with the shaman on the hate list, so until you get a few good hits or a proc in, or use incite, you're on the hairy edge and anything could make the mob switch targets.  Pets get the caster a significant amount of aggro, more than just the pure melee damage the pet is doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/pet attack adds aggro to the shaman, the pets aggro via melee is seperate from the shaman however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">devist8or</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To sum it up, when a shammy sends in his pet it is basically the same as if he casted a dot on the mob. So you have to work harder because he now has slow and dot like agro. I have seen similar situations in LDoN when our chanter tries to cripple a mob. The mob gets really pissed and my warrior has to taunt like hell to get agro back, even encite doesnt always work.<br />
<br />
Also if by chance you shammy gets resisted and casts slow again that will really gain agro from a mob. So if you are just 2 boxing have your shaman park the mob so he wont get the beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meyni</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok you said that the mob turned back to the shaman, but I never saw you say he actually hit the shaman with melee ( I might missed that though).    Most often , when it is a casting mob, the mob will turn to nuke whoever aggroed him first, but the melee target remains the warrior(or tank)...the mob will turn back once he is done nukin or debuffing.<br />
<br />
I have been watchin target's target box a lot and mobs often &quot;turn &quot; from me (to nuke/debuff), but I am still their target.</div></div><hr />
