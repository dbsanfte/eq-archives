<br />
Anyone heard any new information on the revamp and/or know when its going to go into effect? :) And to make it warrior related... I have heard that a portion of the zone will be able to be exped in by a single group. Anyone have any idea where the warrior epic drops might appear and if they will be harder or easier to obtain? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard that Innoruuk is truly difficult now, Maestro is a real challenge, and that all the epic (and previous maestro/innoruuk/various names mobs) have been relocated.. much like what happened when CT was revamped and the old zone moved just outside to where it is now.. all the same loot is there, just from a different place.<br />
<br />
Also I heard drop rates on epic peices were upped to</div></div><hr />

I hope the new PoH lives up to it's expectations....it really is a fun zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hope it has pathing, not like that god awful 2nd floor of hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megunna</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the items coming out of there (particularly off of Maestro) look promising (see Allakhazam's). Never spent much time in Hate myself, was a Vellious child, and Growth had so much more to offer it seemed. Still, would love to see it become a formidable zone again, instead of the laughable, late-night-exping-just-because-you're-bored zone that it really currently is.</div></div><hr />

That's what killed me for so long!  Was the clearning for 4 hours until you started to get to the Demis!<br />
<br />
that being said, I hope the new hate has some fun things to offer us, both grouping and raiding situations.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully the new one can live up to the original. I only hope that certain epic drops are unaffected or helped in the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grobsmashprexus</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other then the crap pathing I really liked the plane of hate.  Fear on the other hand I can not stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with you. That pathing is teh suck and I HATE FEAR!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear is teh devil! EBIL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually enjoy the pathing on second floor of Hate. Watching the mobs and trying to pull them can be hilarious at times. Mobs that refuse to walk through an open archway even when your sitting 2 feet away on the other side of it, the mobs in the Evangelist house that all stand up to chase ya, then when ya back up three steps they all stop and sit back down staring at ya. Best part is as a Warrior I get to pull up there, because the hard part isnt getting singles, its getting a mob to follow more then 2 steps back to the main force.<br />
<br />
But only time I go to Hate now is if someone needs an epic drop. We keep a ranger with the tinkered eye staffs parked up there to scout for P'tassa for mages, and see if he is actually holding the staff now. If so 2 groups can run up and get him quick and easy, got staffs for 3 mages that way recently, instead of spending endless time camping mobs up there just hoping he will spawn, or that when he does he has the Staff.<br />
<br />
But it sounds like the new hate will be fun to explore to and at least I got to kill Inny once cause it doesnt sound like the new one will be possible for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess it's time to sell the house and look for a new home *pout*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wait wait. so the first guild to kill Fennin Ro (on SH does that count?) wipes to inny. just wandering how mnay people did they have. i bet you need a strategy and probably more people. /boggle maestro hitting for 1k and lifetapping for 1500? chain rune and 6k+ tank with about a 4 second ch rotation. well i wonder how harder our epic is gonna be. and i kind of feel sorry for the people that have to kill Inny now for theres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dobbo : epic items have been moved and difficulty to get them in new hate is similar to old difficulty, at least Alan stated this .... now is it true ?....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebedi</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gosh I hope it's as hard for a raid group of level 65s now as it was for a raid group of 50s when hate opened :)</div></div><hr />
