I have a couple questions.  First, do you need to 5 man Rend Blackhand or can the quest be done in a raid?  Second, which trinket should I get?  At first I was thinking the +2% crit trinket, I only have two items so far with +crit and I think that would help a lot for PvP.  However, I tank instances more than I PvP, and there is a 180 armor and +1% dodge trinket as well.  Which one should I opt for?  I am on a PvP server and do PvP a lot, but I would say I spend 60% of my time tanking instances, 40% PvP, and I'm often the MT for my guild (tanking UBRS and below).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-18-2005, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crit trinket.  There is absolutely nothing that compares, where as defensive trinkets are a dime a dozen.  The mark is &quot;still&quot; the best defensive one out there however.</div></div><hr />

You can not get quests items through raiding an instance.</div></div><hr />

I got the tanking reward, which admittedly was before dire maul came out, and have got very good value out of it. Although the 2% crit trinket was very tempting.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, good info.  Argh, I'm really torn.  I'm trying to maintain my position as MT for my guild by raising my AC/HP and other tanking stats as much as possible, so I think I'm going to go for the tank trinket.  Before I do so, I will look up the other alternatives mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I see what you mean.  There are 3 good defensive trinkets from DM.  I think the 2% dodge is the best trinket, the other two are I don't think quite as good as the mark is for tanking, but they are close enough.  There are just not many +crit trinkets, so I see your point.<br />
<br />
So the Codex used for one of the trinkets is random.  One is a tribute drop.  I've done DM north twice, haven't seen it drop from tribute.  It's been awhile, but I don't remember seeing that Immol'Thar boss, am I just brain dead and forgetting we did him or does he need to be spawned?<br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />
