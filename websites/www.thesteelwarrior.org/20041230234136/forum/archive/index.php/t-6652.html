Then I turn on AC5 HP5.  Other than that I usually dont run anything.  For Plane of Water type raids I'll turn on EB tribute also</div></div><hr />

If I do start using it, it'll only be to put up HP and AC during raids.  I don't see any reason to use tribute for xping.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ErnieARo</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't spend a whole lot on Tribute.  I will spend a little time in the bazaar looking up cheap items for sale on Lucy to buy where I can get a 3 to 1 investment on my Plat for tribute points, then run to my tribute guy and turn them in.  So, I usually have a pool of 3k to 5k tribute points sitting around.<br />
<br />
I ALWAYS have at least Bulwark of Honor (AC) 2 running - an extra 16 AC for only 3 points every 10 minutes is great!  It costs nearly nothing and well... why not  :D <br />
<br />
If I know we are raiding and I may be tanking, or I am going to hit a hard LDoN or do some hunting in GoD, I'll take the extra time to run to the tribute vendor and crank it up.  Usually to Bulwark of Honor 3 (extra 24 AC) and umm, whatever the HP one is to 3 (extra 50 HP), all for only 14 points every 10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Sure, I could crank it up all the way on the HP / AC but man, that would just chew through my points to quickly and I don't spend all that much time / money for Tribute points.<br />
<br />
I think the way I do it is a good balance for the frugal tribute user hehe  :cool: <br />

<br />
 :eek: <br />
<br />
Haha, screw that!  While I probably put together 100k every other month or so, I currently buy stuff with that cash :)  Saving for a Crystalized Acid Bracer now :)<br />
<br />
However, I can well see a point where there is absolutely nothing I could buy in terms of upgrades (although currently if you gave me 1 million PP I could proably spend every copper of it on gear).  After that time tho, and after you got all your tradeskills to 250 then yeah, sure, just blow it on Tribute   :p</div></div><hr />

Sure it's like 120 Points but that's nothing when I can get 25k Tribute Points for 7k  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Should be able to get ~16k for 1-2k or so worth of farmed/collected stuff, even with a 50% yield it's still a good deal.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. I run AC/HP alla time, kick in one or two resists (esp. for chromatic/prismatic) and cha for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run max HP</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I tank an open raid I run max HP, AC, CHA, Haste, and maybe vengence</div></div><hr />

Just curious...why do peole bother with CHA?  Does it help with taunting or something?<br />
<br />
Check back for the inevitable correction if I'm wrong, I don't raid much with my guild and so I've never checked this.  But my understanding is that the higher the CHA on the tank, the greater the chance that Divine Intervention (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1546&amp;source=Live) will fire.  After all, she or he is trying to get the attention of a deity, and that should take as much presence of character as can be had *heh*.  I've got no guess whether the CHA is checked at casting or at triggering.<br />
<br />
CHA should help with taunting, IMO, but it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I run nothing cuz I am a cheap bastard trying to hoard plat (the house dr00d keeps levelling and we need more spells!), and too lazy to run to town every time I want to turn something on.  I also have a hard time doing the math on how long X points will last me for Y benefit (the laziness thing again).<br />
<br />
EDIT :: Removed a red herring.</div></div><hr />

Id get the ac one but i dont like paying pure plat for tribute and i havent farmed any good tribute items lately</div></div><hr />

<br />
I run max hp and ac. I'd turn them off during non-raid times but I'm too lazy to run to Halas that often :p <br />
<br />
They need to put a tribute master in the PoTranq bank and I'd be much more active hehe.</div></div><hr />

But I'm a GM Barb smith, so I can make cultural boots for 500pp and turn them in for 9300  :D</div></div><hr />
