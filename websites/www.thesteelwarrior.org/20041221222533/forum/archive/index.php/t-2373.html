<br />
And while you are playing in only single knight groups these may not be very useful, I think they will shine when you have 2 or mroe knights. Since you only need so much mana to stun/agro a mob, and you have 2 knihgts, they can easily keep the new Hp for attack or mana for attack spells up, while getting a buffed attack.</div></div><hr />

I'm ready for the next big mmorpg to come out. Unless there is something there for warriors or pure melee specifically, I'm not buying the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was checking the new 63 Pal spell Aura of Divinity which gives +50 attack for a cost of 4 mana per tick.  Now, it has been a while since I skilled up any melee skills, but for some reason I seem to recall that each skill point = 2 attack.  Now knight melee skills cap 25 points below warrior skills (except piercing but I won't rant at the absurdity of warrior piercing being capped at 240).  So this spell would boost a paladin's attack to match that of a warrior.  I know knights have been bitching for a long time about lower dps than warriors and missing on a lot more melee attacks.  A boost to attack would in some way close that gap.  Now perhaps I am making a mistake and don't understand the mechanics of the game and raw attack won't make up for the lower skill caps, but it seems to me that knights are getting yet another boost to their power which will put them at a dps figure closer to warriors while whoever is in charge of development for pure melees is still asleep at the wheel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just don't understand VI. I mean I am sure you are right and all Hyard, but I just don't understand why VI thinks knights need more upgrades at all.  But then I am just too exhausted about this issue to care about it. <br />
<br />
It is probably a spell to go along with the new expansion. However, i see only more of the same getting kicked while your down for us warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Hyard, each point of weapons skill adds about 2.7 atk. Each point of effensive skill adds about 1.1-1.2 atk. <br />
<br />
(25*2.7)+(25*1.1)=95<br />
<br />
The atk from the spell would be 67 (raw atk*4/3=66.5)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that weapons skills and offense increase the hit % while raw atk adjusts the damage curve. They do 2 different things. Knights are still going to hit about 6-8% less often than warriors do.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that spell would have an effective cost of 2400 mana an hour. Compare that to the ranger atk buff (which it doesn't stack with) that costs 300 mana for 20 more atk to keep an entire group buffed. It is the most mana intensive atk buff. <br />
<br />
That being said, I sure as hell will use it if there isn't a ranger around. An expensive atk buff is much better than no atk buff.</div></div><hr />

So often warriors forget to check...  if you are threatened by this spell, then you are only showing every spellcaster in the game how inept you are at using lucy.<br />
<br />
Think warriors dont have to know this stuff???  this is probably why you are here whining instead of raiding the Planes.  this might be why YOU are sitting /lfg because the group is tired of carrying you as a player.<br />

Wow, attacking someone who doesn't even deserve it, nice move jackass.  You're right, it doesn't stack with ranger buffs.  But do you have a ranger with you at all times?  Shaman haste doesn't stack with chanter haste, but does that make shaman haste not worth mentioning?  Same idea, you can't always get the best.  Anyway, keep feeling so full of yourself, since you are in the planes omg.<br />
<br />
Edit: guess I should note, I really don't give a damn about the spell, I just get sick of people who flame people who don't deserve it, and act so high and mighty.</div></div><hr />

From the post right before yours let me pull another quote:<br />

<br />
Do you even bother to read before you post?  If you had, you would have seen that it was in fact mentioned that it did not stack with ranger buffs.  <br />
<br />
two words....READING COMPREHENSION<br />
<br />
Learn to read what has been written before you come in here acting the ass and insulting people.  The stacking had been mentioned, and the person who mentioned it pointed out that, when no ranger was around, it would be usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And my point was to either:<br />
<br />
A) understand what you are taling about through experience or data of some kind<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
B) have half a second to look at the WHOLE effect of the spell by examining lucy competely.<br />

When I started the post, graals had not registered on my screen.<br />
I was interrupted in writing as well.  Of course, I posted to point out the absolute ignorance in the whines these posts make.<br />
<br />
I will ignore your foolishness based on the fact you didn't understand.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is necessary to be the guy who points out someone is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
When since release has it been hard to find a ranger Red?<br />
The spell is not useless, but it is not a threat to warrior power by any means.<br />
<br />
Brik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giving you the benefit of the doubt that in fact you did miss that it had been pointed out, I will let that matter go, but...<br />
<br />
Notice a huge difference in tone between you and Graal.  One pointed out that it did not stack, and commented a bit on the spells usefullness when not groupoed with rangers.  One gets insulting and holier than tho over the fact.<br />
<br />
When since release has it been hard to find a ranger Red? <br />
<br />
I would go so far as to say that in at least 1/2 of exp groups there is not a ranger present, and as such, ranger buffs will not be readily available in those situations.<br />
<br />
The spell is not useless, but it is not a threat to warrior power by any means. <br />
<br />
It is not a huge threat(and it is on test only, may never go live), and you will notice a lack of comments on the spell itself by me.  I will say that it will in fact cut into that 20 % more melee damage that warriors do over knights that you like to point to so often in groups where there is not a ranger present.<br />
<br />
I will ignore your foolishness based on the fact you didn't understand <br />
<br />
What foolishness?  I was not the one coming here looking like an ass, that was you.  I was not the one throwing a fit about no one noticing something that was noticed before I posted, that was you.  You made your post 6 hours after Graal's, if you where in fact making your reply before Graal posted his, and had to come back for it, and after 6 hours did not think to look and see if anyone added anything, do you not think that makes you look foolish? <br />
<br />
 And when it is all said and done, the fact it does not stack with ranger bufs is minor.  I have ranger buffs up in exp groups only when grouped with rangers, and as Graal mentioned, he would in fact use it in just those situation.  You came here, looked like an ass, pointed out something that had already been mentioned, all over a minor point.  Good job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where was the ignorance?  He was comparing warriors to paladins, not warriors to paladins when both have ranger buffs.  Where did someone say it was a threat to warrior power?  They said it would increase their dps to closer to ours, which is true, it would be closer when neither have ranger buffs.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is necessary to be the guy who points out someone is wrong. <br />
<br />
Thats why I posted, because you are acting like a jackass.  I didn't see anyone whine about that one spell specifically, they just posted what they thought it did.  Most likely to discuss it, like what boards are made for.<br />
<br />
I will ignore your foolishness based on the fact you didn't understand. <br />
<br />
I read no foolishness from Red, and I see no where she didn't understand.  All I see is you proving you have a 12 year old mentality by acting like you're superior to everyone while making extremely stupid rationalizations.<br />
<br />
And to quote Red on something that rings very true here:<br />

I just it odd that you did not see the post immideately before yours unless it took you 6 hours to compose your post. 08-07-2003 07:39 PM and Yesterday 01:33 AM<br />
<br />
If nothing else it is an increase in utility, in a meaningful way when you don't have rangers around. Spendy? Yes. Worth it...maybe. As bad as the first impression of paladins is? I don't think so. Then again I thought it was a lame spell when I first saw it too, it was only later that smoe possible uses for it occured to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh.. balance issue made moot now...<br />
<br />
Red, ever read your own posts?  Aren't you doing to me exactly what you are bitching at me for?<br />
<br />
only I was short and to the point and you are trying to prove how bad my taste is while only making sure to show the rest of us how much of an ass you are?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just gonna leave the whole warrior-angst thing at the door and let you be as bitter as you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
lets sum up:<br />
<br />
1) look at what the spell actually does before going for the whine.<br />
(or you will get deserved razzing)<br />
<br />
2) Spells that don't stack aren't really an upgrade for players who will find the buffs they need period.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never have trouble finding a ranger to pred me... and make a point of finding them...  kinda like casters do for KEI/VoQ.  Might just be that whole ATK-needing thing...  Knights tend to pay a lot of attention to this due to being weak in this.<br />
<br />
Note, I can cast a mana regen spell... but frequently get VoQ due to that spell being inferior.<br />
<br />
Perhaps your bitterness towards hybrids is the problem.  you may be pushing the rangers away like you are trying to push knights away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor...  do less whining and get the right buffs.  You should have more ATK than the pally... and be beating him for melee DPS by about 20%.  If you aren't, you are doing something wrong, or your equipment is not on the level his is.<br />
<br />
