<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assumptions:<br />
Our current dilemma as warriors is the fact that our agro abilities are vastly inferior to those of knights' barring high-end weapons, while our tanking ability is only somewhat superior. As a result, warriors are not desired for exp grouping over knights because once you weigh the pros and cons, in the end the scales are still in the knights' favor. The once-untouchable high ground for warriors, raid tanking, is slowly being encroached on by knights as well (it's often to have a knight tanking all the mobs up to the uber on a raid, with the warrior reduced to only tanking the uber mob itself, it being the only one which requires defensive).<br />
<br />
Reasons:<br />
I'll focus on stun here, but for shadowknights simply replace &quot;stun&quot; with &quot;snare&quot; and you'll have a comparable picture. The reason for such a high disparity between warrior and knight agro generation is that knights have an entire line of spells - stun - which generates tremendous agro. They can cast nothing but their pre-50 stuns and still lock agro over a tank any day without every worrying about running OOM.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
Nerfing stun agro would be bad. Not, I couldn't care less about a paladin shedding crocodile tears over being unwanted; I myself use CHoS/SotB, and they both proc stun. Hence, I wouldn't want to nerf stun agro. No, what I propose to do is this:<br />
<br />
MAKE STUNS GENERATE NO AGRO IF THEY ARE RESISTED OR CAN'T AFFECT THE MOB<br />
<br />
How would this help? It would reduce the agro disparity between warriors and knights by cutting off their cheap-on-mana, fast cast/recast lvl 20 or 30 stuns and restricting them to using high lvl stuns to taunt high lvl mobs. Paladins have 2 stuns which can affect mobs all the way to 65, and 2 which can affect mobs up to 61. By making the low lvl stuns not agro mobs too high to be affected, they'd be forced to use the two high ones and actually work for agro, IE taunt. Most importantly, their edge over warriors would go from vastly superior to somewhat superior - kind of like what our tanking is to theirs.<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
Knight agro would still be superior to warrior agro. When OOM, they'd be the equals of warriors as far as being reduced to DPS/taunt for getting agro; when with mana, tier2 and up knights (fighting 62+ mobs) are down to 2 stuns: lvl 64 one (200 mana/24 sec recast) and the 62 one (65 mana/12 sec recast). This retains the snap agro since they can chain cast 2 stuns as soon as a fight starts, but removes their ability to take agro at will from anyone by being casting stun after stun, non-stop till the cows come home, making everyone exercise agro control. I mean, I did it with my cleric once when he was 62, chained stuns without ever swinging, and kept agro over a 60 warrior (did it in PoD where mobs are gimp and won't kill cleric). The agro advantage thus retained equals the hp/ac advantage a warrior brings without being superior to the point of making it meaningless.<br />
<br />
Currently, a warrior in a group often means the group working at less than peak efficiency (with a knight, they can do anything with NO regard for their agro) - monks hold back, rogues bs later, slowers can't chain malo or mez/slow/cripple because they'll get attacked. This is one way the hp/ac advantage gets buried in the long run. Cutting back on that recklessness a little brings the knights more in line with warriors as far as group desirability, while retaining the key agro-at-will advantage knights have always had.<br />
<br />

Why do you think this wouldn't nerf warrior aggro as well? Not to mention it does little to nothing in respect to SKs<br />
<br />
And I hate to break it to you, but paladins can keep up with the mana usage of high level stuns just fine. Many paladins over level 62 only use low level stuns to pull. It would have a far more detrimental effect on warriors than on paladins.</div></div><hr />

The disparity between warriors and knights is mainly due to ureliability vs. reliability in agro generation.<br />
You can either make warriors just as reliable at agro generation as knight, but it might really EQ trivial then, or you can make agro generation of knights more unreliable, so its somewhat like warriors agro.<br />
<br />
I have already suggested a change, that could make the agro building of tanks somewhat even without making the other classes with same spells (clerics and SKs) much better.<br />

All it would do is piss off paladins, further overpower other classes that can stun, and reduce our pool of useable aggro weapons to only those that have EB.  Paladins would still hold aggro better than we do and SKs would still be aggro control gods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bad idea, many mob's are stun immune and that would also kill warrior agro, i think the solution is putting paladins on a new stun line that only they can use, that way it can be tinkered with with out fucking up warrior and cleric stun lines, so the dev's dont have to worry about making it fair for all 3 classes</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stuns and other spells NEED to be changed, so there is a randomness in it, because thats the core of the balance problem.<br />
Some weapons might not be as good agro weapons then, but it then opens up for other weapons to be used.<br />
Stun was NEVER meant as an agro building effect, but as an effect to interrupt melee damage and spell casting. The agro buildup was supposed to be a bad side effect.<br />
<br />
Changing spell agro might lower the agro value on some warrior weapon, but a warrior is relying on procs and knights on both proc and spell casting, so the hit will be harder on knights and thereby actually make the tank classes more even.<br />
The change compared to all other classes, besides the tank classes, is pretty much unimportant, because they HAVE to follow the tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerfing stun (or flash of light or any other spell) so that it has no aggro effect on mobs that the spell cannot affect isn't a bad idea: its ridiculous that these spells have the ability that they do. What should be done to compensate for it is 1 of 2 things:<br />
<br />
1) code it so weapon procs are not subject to the nerf, or<br />
2) rename/rework the weapon procs so they affect higher level mobs<br />
<br />
This may not help all the woes we experience but it would be a start.</div></div><hr />

A bit crude approach but there's nothing better *I* could come up with I think =\<br />
<br />
Or, I have an idea. Seeing as knights have infallible agro - ya a stun may not work, but 5 stuns and 3 heals will - nerf their mitigation. Just use the old bat collecting dust ever since it was used on monks. Or put warriors on a better defense table...<br />

<br />
The reason why group choose knights over warriors are ue to knights superior ability to generate agro in an instant, so tash, slow and CH can be cast without pingpong, which result in a faster kill.<br />
<br />
Changing the warrior's defense table will just mean the warrior can fight a bit longer before the first CH lands, but the tash and slow will still be cast later as well as all other harmfull things done to the mob.<br />
Only thing that will be changed as a result is a little less mana used on healing the warrior.</div></div><hr />

Stun can then be used to keep mobs pretty much &quot;mezzed&quot; without any agro at all.<br />
You need to make the stun spells give exactly that much agro, so its not worth to use it as agro building and its still dangerous to use it too much.<br />
This is pretty much impossible if you do not add some randomness into it, so players can not be sure about the effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See how often they'd be used to generate aggro with THAT modifier.  It's even RP; amnesia from a traumatic blow and all that. ;)<br />

p.s. no, I'm not serious, would be quite... interesting tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem is not just stuns...<br />
and the answer isnt as easy as nerfing stuns, Which, BTW removing aggro from stuns that CANNOT affect a mob is not a NERF, IT IS COMMON SENSE.<br />
and saying, We cant nerf stuns, it will make all of our aggro weapons suck...<br />
<br />
Well guess what, relying on 'stun' aggro weapons and then complaining about pally 'stun' aggro lock is a little pit hypocritical to me. I understand thats the only tools SoE has given many of us, but it is wrong just the same.<br />
<br />
What needs to happen to fix this problem is a complete revamp of the magic/spell line/aggro system, <br />
<br />
Spells have spell lines- Why? newer spells re more effective, cheaper, last longer,affect higher levels, etc This needs to be taken into account in aggro.<br />
<br />
spells have level, this needs to be taken into account also. I find it funny a level 9 stun or flash of light, level1? spell can generate more aggro than a level 65 warrior attacking hasted for 6 seconds.. WTF is up with that? <br />
<br />
Here is my solutions...<br />
I know these are not perfect, and some modifications need to be made, and there will be spells that must be exceptions to the rules...<br />
<br />
if a mob is IMMUNE no spell should cause aggro ( 1 point of aggro) , period no discussion, no if and buts. It does enough to get the PC on the hate list, no more no less.<br />
<br />
if spells have spell lines, ex. the stun line, root, etc.. they need to be ONLY allowable to be cast on mobs of level (spell level +XX). where XX is the level to the next spell in the line + 1-5. this  prevents casting low level spells on high level mobs, limiting their usage for stun lock/ aggro lock etc. This is NOT hard to do, they make it so that you cant cast high level buffs on lower levels, why not the reverse.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I really think aggro generated from a spell needs to be scaled by the level of the spell, this mostly just applies to 'detrimental' spell not dot/nukes as they scale by damage inflicted, but it seems that as far as aggro goes, a slow is a slow, a stun is a stun, a debuff is a debuff and there is no real difference from a level 9 spell and a level 65 spell aggro wise.. <br />
<br />
Fix these things, and aggro will change but, may just be more in line with what makes sense</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem here is that hybrids are made from 2 classes and given spells inferior to a parent class of same level.<br />
A level 52 Pally has the same stun spells as a 34 Cleric.</div></div><hr />
