<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, as you can see in my magelo, I'm right at the 7k unbuffed mark (a bit over when I'm leader w/ leader AA's).<br />
<br />
The problem is, what is the fastest way to get to 8k? I have sturdiness 4, so only 100 more HP are to be gained in AA's. All of my gear is what I consider decent, but I need advice on where to concentrate. My main sticking point is that I am not in an Elemental Raiding Guild so I have little opportunity now to get Raex gear. <br />
<br />
So, should I focus on GoD stuff? I need sewers 2-4 to be KT flagged, but will I be able to tank there? I was able to tank the Tipt boss with a good cleric, druid and a charmed pet cranking out silly dps. But, I was unable to get his bracer   :mad: <br />
<br />
So, should I stick to Hard LDoN's for more Points and HP augs....or focus on more sewers, and gettin to KT. By the way , I have no clue what type of armor upgrades are available in KT. <br />
<br />
Any advice is much appreciated! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aww, but you're such a get MA on pu raids, Furo!   ;)  .. if certain people don't train rz raids *cough*. <br />
<br />
Steel Rings of Earthen Re something or other. A new mask. Rage earring could be upgraded too. Hard Ldon gear. I dunno what else...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can look at my magelo, I am pre-elemental and getting close to 8k unbuffed. almost 7.7k at the moment.<br />
<br />
Besides more HP augs and sturdy5, you have alot of slots that are easy to upgrade in the bazaar. 1x ear, 2xrings, helm, face and hands being the most noticable. Get steel rings of earthen resisliance, helm of rz or WDH. Warlord's steel guantlets (hard EC drop 90 hp) and amygydlan chain mask is 85 hp, or do nro hards for a 90 hp mask. <br />
<br />
That should be getting you real close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kheldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Getting to 8k unbuffed ghetto style (without elemental gear) takes time.  You need to get all the 40hp augs you can from LDON.  Plus you need to go back to Tipt, not just for a shot at the bracer, but also for the two 30hp augs that drop of the cragbeast mother.  Then work the rest of the pre-KT trials for their plate drops.  <br />
<br />
Then try to do the new VP, KT, or hope something comes out in OOW.<br />
<br />
I am a firm believer that people can skip the elementals to advance, just like they could skip VT and hit the elementals, but it ain't the easy route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All the kizrak gear is killing you.  Helmet of rallos zek.  40 Hp augs on helm, arms, boots, bp. A new mask, mask of sky from ikatiar in ntov, or the mask from one of the zek boys in drunder.  good bracers are hard, until EPs.  The quests off of Dozekar in halls of testing will take repeated trips, but the results are nice, silver bracelet of speed, and silver charm of tranquility.  Another option is Crystallized Acid Bracer from CT.  Do the coldain ring quest, for 10th coldain ring.  Ring of Destruction from AOW rocks, with 30 AC.  I see you are wielding stormblade, so your guild must be able to kill some decent targets.  Start doing keys to VT, and watch your HP total climb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good stuff there Omus, thanks. I guess maybe I need to find a way to gear up in SSRA  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Replace ornate with Tak ldon armour with 40 hp augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PinaduzRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tormax boots (Boots of Storm), and augment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're going to want to be an effective tank in GoD, you will need to scrap HP and start going AC.  sub-1500 AC = owned in GoD, especially in KT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As far as upgrades for armor goes, how far into GoD do most upgrades drop ?(assuming I will be KT flagged in a week or two)<br />
<br />
In other words, can you pick up decent upgrades in experience groups in KT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kavariel Baenre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can get a ring, range, and earring with single groups once you are in KT. Misc mobs drop some lesser 110+hp jewelry, face items.  You will have to work for them, and are not easy to acquire.<br />
<br />
If  I would to recommend gear it would be:<br />
 <br />
crystallized acid bracers<br />
Pitted Vambraces (sewers 3, extremely common)<br />
Stonemite Carapace Mask (sewers 3, extremely common)<br />
iron cog earring (100hp one?)<br />
Turepta Spine Ring (sewers, again I've seen them rot enough to make me cry)<br />
Trueborn elite Ring (LDON  Hard adventure in mistmoore i think )<br />
Gauntlets of the Myrmidon or I think there is 90 hp Ldon droppable gaunts, infact i'm almost positive there are<br />
and there's always Helmet of RZ for head, but it has a graphic :P<br />
<br />
If you get into KT you can acquire these with 1 group, again not exactly easy, depending on group:<br />
<br />
Glyphed Prayer Ring<br />
Resonating Earring of Battle<br />
Carved Vrex Totem<br />
Guise of Seething Satisfaction<br />
Reflective Orb of Energy<br />
Dauntles Muramite Ring<br />
Earring of Destructive Essence<br />
Dark Belt of Wrath<br />
Incantor Mask of Death<br />
<br />
there's more but I think i've listed a bunch to get you going, also keep in mind there's litereally TONS of augments that drop in GoD. I mainly did all the trials and stuff before the nerf so I have no knowledge on the difficulty of them now but supposively they are easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Try to get your VP key, then build up your Ring of Scale faction, and get some of the questable armor there (can be solo/single grouped for 125-150hp gear)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Check out my magelo for some stuff. It is all single groupable drops (I am guildless) and I'm at 8300 unbuffed with tribute and and leader aa. <br />
<br />
KT/Ikkinz is the best place to get your stats up without taking a raid force. If you get a group that can kill well at the zone in of KT, you can pick up 2 different 20 ac, 35hp augs, 50/50/50 aug, as well as a nice ring, earring, mask, and range slot items.<br />
<br />
If you can get an Ikkinz group together that can beat the trials you can pick up another earring, ring, range, and wrist (yes, it's lame all the drops are the same slots, but they are good). Just be prepared to die a lot because it isn't easy with your gear.<br />
<br />
Some easier upgrades would be Cape of Broken Enchantments from Hard EF and then upgrade to a Heavy Rubicite Girdle. Steel Rings are always good.  Pitted Vambraces from Sewer trials. Once you get a good piece in each visisble slot, put 40hp in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Loyalist Shield of Honor is an easy quest and would be a nice ac upgrade for back slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">stat food can prolly eek out a 100 hp depending on what you buy.</div></div><hr />
