<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widjit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have now reached the level of 52 as a gnomish warrior.  I believe I have a good setup for my agro weapons.  I have the Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana with an anger2 aug in my primary, and a BoC in my secondary. I am now looking for a good dps combo for when it's not my job to keep the agro.  What I have in the bank for weapons is:<br />
<br />
Architect's Scepter<br />
Mace of Focused Flame<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana<br />
Blade of Carnage<br />
Dathor Great Hammer<br />
<br />
<br />
Or if I should look for some other weapons for DPS.  Thank you for any advice.  Remember I am on the Firiona Vie server and can get ahold of a wide variety of weapons since there is no no-drop.  I was told for DPS to look for a 2h weapon too.  Is there any merit to a war using 2h?  Later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Out of those weapons I'd think Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana + BoC would be the best DPS, although substituting the Mace of Focused Flame for the BoC would be ok if you want to cut down agro more.  At 52 two handers are starting to get a higher damage bonus, but I don't think it really kicks in into 55+, when something like a Greatstaff of the Four Winds would start outpacing you dual wield damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless I'm missing something the Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana aren't good for aggro, you'd be better of using BoC + CHoS.  For DPS you could look for a 2-hander, not sure what is available on FV since I'm not an expert on no-drops yet, but a War Marshal's probably isn't a bad idea.  The thing about getting a nice 2hander is that it will be an investment, even if you do lose a couple of DPS now, you'll have it in the near future.</div></div><hr />
