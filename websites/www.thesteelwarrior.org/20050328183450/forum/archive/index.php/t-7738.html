I still think it's a really good place to farm but, the I have to cross over a zone that ai'm REALLY kos in to get there and there is a room that has like 5 nobles in it who have killed me on many seperate occastions. I tryed farming gems in Dulak once but i couldn't handle the mobs very well with out some sort of healer with me and the gems didn't drop to often for me.<br />
<br />
O yea here is the gear i'm tryin to work with http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1019745</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest farming spiders, spiderlings, wolves and bears. Tradeskillers tend to pay very high prices for those drops, and they're very, very easy to get. Acrylia pieces or velium pieces also sell well.</div></div><hr />

I farm Mammoths in EF, their tusks sell for  10pp a piece, and almost always drop, and theyre very easy kills.  Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Geonids for gems<br />
Spiders for crystalline silks<br />
Orcs for velium, 'lower' value gems, pages, runes, velium (and the uncommon frozen) weapons<br />
<br />
The big plus to this (despite the pain-in-the-ass maze the zone is), is that the dorf town is so close to sell to and to hit the banker to move the velium to your mule in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Invis clicky item highly advised though.</div></div><hr />

You can solo your way in there and kill him fairly easily. EQ Atlas has a map with his spawn point. He drops a weight reduction bag. He's on about a 25 minute timer, sometimes has a PH. Whack mammoths on the way in and out.<br />
Step two: get Virtue, Fo7, SoW. Get a SoW potion or two for emergencies.<br />
Step 3: go to Grimling caves in Ten. Mountains. Be careful of adds. It's a bit of a run out there, and you have to pay attention on your way there (you run by some grimling villages in the Grimling forest and some sonic wolves in Ten Mnts.--you can handle one or two sonic wolves, but three would be nasty).<br />
You'll loot acrylia, pp, some other stuff. Don't bother with the picks--they don't sell well and are heavy.<br />
If you see the grimling runner, kill him. He drops the pattern for the rallic pack. I see you have one already, but you can have a pack and a pattern at the same time.<br />
You can get 200-600 pp per session doing this. Don't try it if you're KoS in Shar Val.<br />
One of my characters is a 52 warrior and this works for him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Provided you have a way to leave a bazaar trading running, farming regular spiders silks in the karana's is totally the best bang for your buck. It's a nasty hike out there, but you could befriend a druid, or take the nexus scion out there. You shouldn't need to worry about dieing at level 52, either. I forget which karana has the crag spiders, but it's the one with the border to hhk. The crag spiders spawn on both sides of the path to hhk, right before it enteres the mountains. Kill them, they drop up to 8 silks. On my server, each silk is worth about 10pp. Combine them into swatches and sell for 25-29pp. Clear it twice and you've easily made 500+ pp.<br />
<br />
PoJ basement is good for gems too, but you'll need a solid full group to hold it down at 52. I cleared it 4-5x last night with a group of low 50's friends and ended up with a 950pp split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, East K. Spiders (both kinds) and the lions (HQ, MQ &amp; LQ pelts) are all tradeskill items in demand. I think the fastest way to get there is to go to the Misty Thicket book, run through the top level of Runnyeye, then down Beholder's and into EK.<br />
At 52 you can easily solo the evil eyes in beholder's and EK. They drop ivory fairly often. The going rate for ivory probably varies a lot, but it is a component in Tribunal cultural armor and as far as I know it's not a regularly sold item by vendors.<br />
In theory, getting to EK is fastest through the Nexus, but I always arrive seconds after it has fired and have to sit there for 20 minutes. Grrrr. I'd rather be running than sitting.</div></div><hr />
