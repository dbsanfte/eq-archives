Just how meaningful are the saves REALLY? My experience with fighting in MMC dungeons at this level is that, even with resist gear on and my PR at 117, I was still getting clobbered by the venon traps. So, has anyone run any tests to determine just how important these saves are?<br />

I can tell you this, traps in ldon will clober you anyway, some of them are unresistable.  The ones that do direct damage like  I resist, I very rarely resist a dot/disease and have never resisted a curse.  Where the resist does shine though is when you get the necro/mag/cleric/shm/wiz mob that wants to nuke/dot/snare the shiznit out of you, I resist 99% of those.  Another good thing for resist is when you need to swim in lava for a bit for whatever reason.  I only wear the resist gear on raids these days where AOE spells and other such nasty things  are gonna be present.   On my 55 war, I just let the dots/dd/snare hit me..</div></div><hr />

I can assure you, however, that you'd be much, much better off discounting saves and maxing your hp/ac. You will be getting hit by mobs far more than any spells, and hp helps vs any damaging traps anyhow. Raise them if you don't have to sacrifice hardly anything for them.</div></div><hr />

for raiding saves are a big deal. even more so if the stories of GoD mobs using spells that check resists on the prismatic range.<br />
means that your gonna have to get above x in all saves at the same time to have a chance to resist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like in Everfrost adventures you'd have mobs proc cold based DD.  In Takish you'd have mobs proc fire based DD.  Rujarkian poison, Mistmoore disease, Guk magic (etc..).<br />
<br />
The average potential DPS of mobs would be the same, but high resist-based characters would mitigate the resist-based DD's as if they had accordingly high AC.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to have some more stats to worry about, not just HP/AC in my opinion (I know, we have a lot to worry about already buuut)...<br />
<br />
In GoD it seems like most mobs proc something, but I don't think I've ever resisted one of those 650 dmg procs in Ferubi.  Are those procs pretty much unresistable/require significantly high resists?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are main tanking in raids, and the magic damage is minimal (relative to your hps and raiding status) then resists arnt nearly as important as hps, and buffs / bard songs will cover you.<br />
<br />
The only place I would say that resists are an issue are when you are not tanking, but in a situation where you would be exposed to AE in raids.  In that case you are taking damage that has to be healed that wouldnt normally be healed, thus &quot;wasting&quot; the healers mana.</div></div><hr />

Odds are, if you're in a raid where resists are that big a deal, you'll have buffs and bard song to cover what you may be deficient on.  If you're grinding, most stuff doesnt nuke/dot hard enough to notice it anyway.</div></div><hr />

Chromatic goes agains your lowest resist, which may make Chaos Claws (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4570&amp;source=Live) awfully hard to resist, depending on how your resists are. :p  Prismatic resistance is against your average resist level, so again it becomes worthwhile to have them all as high as they can go.   If you have the luxury of focussing on that.</div></div><hr />

At that point they become critical and nearly evenly important to HPs/AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I'm going to have to disagree with this statement. If you're tanking, you'll be taking far more damage from melee than from any spell/AE. So when you're tanking, hp/ac are still king. If you're just DPS on an AE mob, resists ARE important, but often can be taken care of easily with buffs/bard songs. While I won't pass up resists ever, especially compared to nothing, I would never put them in the same ballpark as hp/ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malikae</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye AC/HP are king regardless. When you start raiding, thats when you get the good stuff with resists on it. Until then, you dont need to worry too much about it. When you start raiding, resist buffs will be easy to come by, and when its critical bards can add hundreds to each save when it counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chaos Claws is really hard to resist.<br />
<br />
GoD tanking seems to be heavy melee + heavy procs.  Spellshield is the way to go.  Failing that, having good resists help, but not nearly as much as having spellshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple people have mentioned that when you are tanking on a raid, you're getting healed anyway, and the damage is minor compared to the melee damage you're taking.  That's true, when you're talking about something that is purely a damage based AE... <br />
<br />
But a lot of AEs also include such nasty things as slow or major stuns.  In the case of these types of effects, healing has nothing to do with it - if you don't resist, then your ability to maintain aggro has just been hurt, and hurt badly.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can make a blanket statement about how important resists are to a raiding warrior.  For some encounters, they really don't make much of a difference.  For other encounters, it is either resist every single time or fail.<br />
<br />
For the original poster... in the 50s I really wouldn't worry too much about resists.  Focus on AC and HPs.  But (there's always a but) I would also have a bag of resist gear, to have handy when the situation calls for it (like if you're fighting mobs that AE a lot and you are not the MT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spellshield &gt; raw stats by far in GoD.<br />
<br />
Take Guardian of Transcendence, vanillia 2k+ hitting unslowable GoD mob.  Procs 3K unresistable knockback.  I have got proced 3 times back to back (and died, obviously).  With 15% spellshield that drops 3 procs damage to 7650 instead of 9000.  Now in that case I still died, but as you can see I saved 1350 HP with 15% spellshield with 3 items.  Now items with Spellshield usually aren't bad, but even if there are superior items in those slots, no way those items can give you 1200 HP more.<br />
<br />
Here's something else to think about, 5% spellshield knocks about 20 damage off every Chaos Claws you'll be taking.  With how frequent everything procs Chaos Claws, that's a lot of damage saved, certainly more than whatever meager extra AC/HP would've got you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was in my late 40s, I wanted to go on Vox raids, so I invested in resist jewelry.  Unfortunately, very few of the hapless horde that showed up for the pick up raids I attended had even minimal resist gear, and all of those raids were frustrating failures, as the raid had a tendency to lay down and die to Vox's AE.  <br />
<br />
Then I joined a raiding guild, and my focus shifted to AC and HP, since I wasn't going to get a tanking job unless I could actually take a hit.  My standard gear's poor resists were made up for with all the buffs I got on raids, and even more, by the levels that I gained to be on a par with the rest of my guild.  Going into HoT at 53rd, I was getting cooked, and was probably nothing but a mana sponge for the healers.  By 55th, I was doing a lot better, and by 60th it was just about easy.  <br />
<br />
Somewhere in here, SoE decided that the monsters needed some help in all of EQ, and jiggered resists, making blue and higher con casters truely fearsome, while greenies became much less of a threat.  I began actively looking for disease resists in the mistaken belief that this would protect me from the shaman slows in lower Chardok.   Still don't quite understand why its magic resist, but cured by cure disease...  At the same time, they changed npc casters so that they had a more sophisticated AI and a bigger spell book.  (I really wonder if any of the SoE devs every took an appropriate, non-twinked group through SolA, or Lower Guk.  One wizard is a serious threat.  Two probably means someone is going to die.  Three, and you are looking at a wipe.)<br />
<br />
As my guild started working its way into PoP, I found that my resists were both beginning to take care of themselves from my standard gear (this trend actually started when I got my Vindi BP) and to become less significant as the dependence of our raids on Bard resists became more and more pronounced.  So I continued to look at AC and HP first.  As we entered and progressed through Time, a new standard emerged - high enough resists so that you could hit 500 without a bard in your group.  <br />
<br />
Now we are in GoD.  And I am stuck with a bit of a problem, because of this prismatic resist stuff - my cold resist sucks ass.  Everything else is 200+ unbuffed, Cold is about 130.  Guess thats what all those unused augment slots are for...</div></div><hr />
