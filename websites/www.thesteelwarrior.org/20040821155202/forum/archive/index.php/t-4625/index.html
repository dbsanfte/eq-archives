<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering of someone out there actually has a clue what these mean in some of the new skills?  The unknown and (##) numbers vary of course.  At least I think they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Furor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">#193 is a melee attack, the middle number denotes the damage base.<br />
<br />
For a (100/10/0) its a hit with a 10 damage weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just curious, Furor, if you come back to this thread.  <br />
<br />
Where do you learn things like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">By trying it and talking to developers. Why they talk to him after the shit he spews I dunno, but apparently they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How about &quot;Unknown #193 (100/15/75)&quot;? (from Head Bash (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4598&amp;source=Test))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The damage seems pretty obvious.  Make a L 25 character on test, and do a few backswings and flurries, you'll notice they look a hell of alot like 5 and 10 damage weapon swings.  You don't need no dev help to figure it out, trust me.<br />
<br />
I haven't done enough head bashes yet to figure out what the 2nd number means.  Possibly &quot;damage bonus*10&quot; (ie, 75 means a damage bonus of 7.5) as a wacky groundless theory.<br />
<br />
The one head bash damage I do remember was 30, which matches up with the damage-peak of a 15 damage weapon with no damage bonus, and makes the &quot;damage bonus&quot; interpritation less likely.<br />
<br />
The type of damage you do (ie, crush/slash/bash) is determined by the &quot;skill type&quot; of the &quot;spell&quot;.  So, flurry is crush, backswing is slash (for now).  Ideally they would be tied to your weapon.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wished they had tied it more to the weapon in your hand, but I can't figure out a way to do that and stay balanced.</div></div><hr />

Why start now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They changed the 15/75 to 15/0, it doesn't seem to make any difference so I guess it was just a typo.</div></div><hr />
