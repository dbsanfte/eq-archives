<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pretty straightforward; I've got around 50kpp to spend on some new gear, and was wondering where I would get the most bang-for-the-buck. Possibilities I'm considering are Tear of the Rainmaker, Ear Symbol of the Vet, a new cloak, or rings of some sort. Also, ornate gaunts + bracer might be decent, but I'm not sure I want to spend all that plat with the chance that I may get a raid drop in the future and basically lose all the plat I spent on them.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? Magelo is in the sig, and accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your bracer and gloves are fine, ornate would be a negligable upgrade. You're basically at a point where the worthwhile buyable upgrades are going to cost you a whole lot for very little impact. Your earring suggestions are solid, but you might also want to look into getting a Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience. It's a very decent ring if you can afford it. Other than those, you'd be best off saving your money to buy one of the more expensive items like an AoW helm or a BoC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ear of the vet on veeshan right now is 150K in the bazaar. just a FYI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mana-threaded Bone Bracelet or somesuch wouldn't be a bad choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, on nameless, the 2 earring i was looking at are 40-60k, while Steel Ring of Earthen Res runs 70k+. After spending more time in the bazaar, I'm probably going to just bank the cash for now, and either keep an eye out for new GoD items, or save up for a SRoER.<br />

Thanks guys,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just bought an Ear Symbol of the Vetaran for 39k on the Rathe.  Was pretty happy with that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In your case, I would not bother with either earring you mentioned. Neither is that much of an upgrade over what you already wear. I would look for rings before anything else, those seem to be your weakest spot. It would also be a pretty good idea to wait a bit while people explore GoD. The loot I have seen so far is pretty stout, maybe you can get your hands on a new drop.</div></div><hr />
