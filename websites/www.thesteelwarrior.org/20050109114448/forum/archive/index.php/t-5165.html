<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a guildleader of Cruentus, an Aus/NZ playtime guild on EMarr. We have recently(thanks to server-screwups and the 5000 subsequent patches) obtained Vex Thal keys for over 80 percent of the guild and began to kill smaller named. <br />
<br />
My question is this: I have a keyed cleric that is a retired friend of mine, been retired for ages, and I want to use him as a coth link. Where should I position him for maximum efficiency in the zone?<br />
<br />
I have been told to clear our way into mini-Aten area and park him there for coth purposes. Would this be the most efficient spot? Allowing us to clear the majority of the zone with the least clearing possible?<br />
<br />
One other thing, since we are there and will be taking out serious named soon(inclusing AHR I hope). I was wondering if some of you VT experienced guys could take a look at my Magelo and recommend some pieces to be on the lookout for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have rogues drag peeps to Blob1, rez with cleric then kill B1 to claim cycle (That's how it works on my server...whoever kills Blob1 will always win a GM decision if VT is contested...) then COTH to DXXT and continue from there.<br />
<br />
Definately interested in hearing about strats for this zone tho. :)</div></div><hr />

Invis up to the palace, clear the  first 3 rooms and yer there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
after dxxt we do tvk, then one of the wing named...dxvt or the bp of speed guy (tend to do him least) then mini aten, then blobs upstairs if we have time, then AHR...like some1 said earlier, we miss out the wing bosses...<br />
Usually takes 5 hours to do all that with no wipes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that my guild has left VT, I am more than happy to give you some info, Kogur.<br />
<br />
First, you don't really need to camp anyone anywhere.<br />
<br />
Put a Bard, Necro, and Rogue in a group together at the zoneline.<br />
<br />
Bard buffs necro/rogue with selos.  Rogue takes off running with SoS and heads to Blob1 room, opening doors on the way.  Necro follows a few seconds behind.  Long enough that he doesn't catch the rogue, but soon enough that the doors are still open.<br />
<br />
This takes a bit of practice, but is very doable.<br />
<br />
Necro gets to Blob1 room, FD in a corner, /q to clear agro.  Rogue drags in mage corpse.<br />
<br />
Nocro logs back in, rezzes mage, CoTH raid to blob1, kill.<br />
<br />
Same group, Necro/Rogue run to DXV area, to one of the &quot;side rooms&quot; up the stairs, on either side of DXV's pedistal.  There is one roamer mob in each room, however, these mobs do not see invis.  Necro fd, /q in the corner of the side room.  Rogue stays in room,  and watches the roamer.<br />
<br />
Necro is in communication with rogue, either on an alt, or via IM or phone or whatever.  Necro gets to char select screen, waits till rogue sees the roamer pathing away, then logs in.  Invis, med up, watch pathing.<br />
<br />
Rogue drags mage corpse.  Mage should already be in VT, so rez is just a &quot;same zone&quot; hop, with no load time.  Mage should have a mod rod, and invis spell memmed, as well as be fully geared. (ie: rez naked corpse)<br />
<br />
When necro sees mob pathing away, pop up, rez mage, re-invis.  Mage pops in, eats mod rod, invises self, sits and meds.<br />
<br />
This will be a hot-CoTH.  Mage should have MA, slower, CHer in group, plus coth anchor.<br />
<br />
When mage has enough mana to CoTH three people in a row, and the mob is pathing away, he CoTH's the MA, the Slower, and the CHer as quickly as possible.  These drop group to make room for others, and the mage continues to CoTH in the raid force.  Get Enchie/Bard early on to help replenish mage mana.<br />
<br />
Roamer will path back right around the time the third person is CoTHed.  MA engages, slower gets it slowed, CH'er heals MA, slower helps with patch heals as needed.<br />
<br />
Once the entire raid is CoTH'ed in, buff and kill DXV (pull him into the side room and corner him by a torch)<br />
<br />
Move raid to DXV's platform, and do the exact same Necro/Bard run, to one of the side rooms by DXXT.<br />
<br />
Do the same &quot;hot-CoTH&quot; strat, buff, kill DXXT, again, pulling him into the side room and cornering him by the torch.  Healers can stand at one torch, with DXXT cornered by the other torch, and be out of Silence range.<br />
<br />
Move raid to the &quot;pole&quot; room behind DXXT, and deal with loot, etc.  Re-buff, have a rogue click the pole and pre-target the two mobs in that room for your MA and an offtank.<br />
<br />
Have the raid click up and engage the pre-targetted mobs.  Kill, pull and clear to TVK.  Pull TVK to the port up room (don't move the raid)  Corner AoW style (gnome MA if needed)<br />
<br />
Do loot fast, and move the raid into the hallway &quot;T&quot; where you decide if you want to go north to TXD or south to DXVT today.  Have this decision made in advance.<br />
<br />
If you have good dps, you can move the raid and be pulling the trap mobs that spawn in the n/s hallways behind the locked doors before the port-up room mobs respawn.  Your first few times, this won't happen, and ye'll have to spend a little time re-clearing from the port-up room to the n/s fork.<br />
<br />
Be prepped for about 2 hours of intense clearing at this point.  It will drop to 45 minutes as your froces get stronger and better geared.<br />
<br />
Clear to TXD or DXVT, AoW corner them right by their spawn points, kill, and put your rogue in a group with a mage.<br />
<br />
Send the rogue up to the third floor, where he'll be pre-targetting 4 mobs for your MA/OTs.<br />
<br />
He'll have to target a mob, then get CoTH'ed back to the raid force for them to /assist, then click up, get second target, etc.<br />
<br />
(If your rogue is skilled in using the &quot;toggle target&quot; key, he can pretarget 2 mobs per CoTH, speeding this up dramatically.)<br />
<br />
Once your MA and 3 offtanks have all 4 port up mobs pre-targetted, and slowers, healers have been assigned, have the raid force click up and engage.<br />
<br />
Kill these four mobs and then prep for mini-Aten.<br />
<br />
AoW corner Mini-aten in the portup room. Kill her, then move the raid to her room to distribute loot, as the port-up room mobs are liable to sapwn while doing loot unless you have a ton of DPS.<br />
<br />
Clear to the LEFT Aten-Blob, AoW corner him inside his room, then clear a path and PULL the right (Southern) Aten-Blob to the same room you killed the northern Blob in.  (An agro bug makes it possible that courtyard mobs will agro your raid if you fight the southern blob in the south room.)<br />
<br />
Clear to the pole, click up, and prep for Aten.<br />
<br />
We used a ranger to WS pull TVK, Mini-Aten, and the aten blobs.<br />
<br />
Individual boss strategies I leave up to you, but I've outlined the general path to take to clear VT in ~ 5 hours.  You miss DXX, and either DXVT or TXD depending on which path you take on the 2nd floor, but you only have one section to clear (the 2nd floor mobs) and save a ton of time, once your necro/rogue crew get good at the runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turbosilk Boomstick</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no place to send a necro/rogue ahead and coth to TXD or DXVT?<br />
<br />
I haven't tried yet but I want to coth to the large room with TXD or DXVT in one of the corners.  Have to test agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the most detailed maps for VT I've found yet. The purple dots are the trap mobs. You can see there are 2 near TXD and DXVT. I was running my friends rogue around seeing how close I could get to the walls before spawning them and basically you would have to stand in the very center of the room to not spawn them, but at that point you would also agro the named.<br />
<br />
You can have 4 mages on the first floor and just skip the twins. You can skip the wing bosses too since they aren't associated with warders. So just kill blob1 and dxxt, then tvk, one of the wing bosses and that will put you in candy land. 2nd floor (or I guess 3rd?) has better loot anyway :).<br />
<br />
You could come back another day and take out the twins if you wanted. They drop 4 pieces of loot each which is nice for minimal effort.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the thing that noone is explaining that the origional poster doesnt seem to get is about warders. certain mobs in VT harder akhevan warders attached to them. these warders DT and randomly port people around if you go into a warder area without killing the warder linked mob beforehand. for instance, blob1 has some warders so that you cannot just skip it, if you try and CoH past blob1 without killing it youre going to have some problems. the other warder mobs are DXXT, TVK, DXVT and TXD share warders, and mini aten. you cant put CoH people right before mini aten because the warders from DXVT and TXD, among other mobs, will kill you when you log your mage in.<br />
<br />
with all that said my guild always had CoH people at blob1 and in DXXT side halls. and the wanderer in the side halls of DXXT gave us so many problems. it seems simple enough but it was such an obstacle for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A tip for this, have a monk run up with the coth grp, place him in the oposite end of the hall were the coth going to take place, and when the coth starts, make him aggro the mob if needed, and keep him on his side. <br />
<br />
When enough people are up to kill it, just tag the mob and kill.<br />
<br />
And oh if Im not totally senile, necros also memwipe after staying fd for 2mins, so no need to /q out. Wish that was live when we did VT   :p</div></div><hr />

A beastlord pet can tank the mob up there indefinitely without any problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not overly worried about sharing info as we are the only guild even interested in VT on our server atm(that can access it anyways). <br />
<br />
To answer your orginal question....<br />
<br />
You asked where to place the cleric for maximum effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Well, you will first need to kill Va Dyn Khar, Thal Va Xakra, &amp; the mobs behind the rooms of the Thal Xi Va/Thall Xi Diabo, to obtain all the keys you will need to move your rogues around.<br />
<br />
I would place the cleric in the side room of DXXT, this cleric will want to be stocked FULL of invisi potions. How it will work is this, when the walker paths away it will be gone for 1 minute. So before this one minute phase begins you have a few things to get in place, mage needs to be in group with the CoH anchor,  the mages corpse needs to be drug up via SoS rog and the mage needs to be in zone with a rod made so that when he is rezzed cle heals him then he rods, loots, and invisi's and cle re-invisis ASAP also. Med the mage up,  and then you have 2 choices of the way you can do things.  You can send a monkey to the opposite side to FD tease the mob while you CoH up, or you can get 2 or 3 mages up invisi and then CoH in a Tank/Healer/Slower Combo.<br />
<br />
*IMPORTANT* - Never risk the cle's life.  If the mage gets aggro and the cle is invisi, STAY INVISI.  9999/10000 times the cle will just die then the mage follows.  Let the mage die and start from scratch. Keeping the parked bot alive is priority #1! Also note you don't wanna use mounts of any kind anywhere in VT.<br />
<br />
As for the items you wanna look for....<br />
<br />
-Gloves of the Crimson Sigil (awesome aggro proc clicky, gives an additional proc to weapons, with augs you will have 3 procs per weap.)<br />
-Crimson Runed Mask (awesome AC, and stats are very nice to boot)<br />
<br />
Those are the 2 items from VT i would absolutely NOT SKIP.  The gloves can be hard to get to drop I have heard, but my guild has seen 3 pairs now in only about 4 months farming or so.  BTW, both those drops are aten drops.<br />
<br />
As for good warrior pieces in general...<br />
<br />
Great Shadow Platemail<br />
Umbral Vambraces<br />
Spiked Shoudlerpads<br />
Pauldrons of Seething Darkness<br />
Cloak of Destruction(VT version, not RC version)<br />
Helmet of Shadow<br />
Earring of Erradication<br />
Ring of the Crimson Bull<br />
Cord of Midnight<br />
Earring of Battle<br />
Belt of Mastery<br />
Cloak of the Black Wind<br />
Umbracite Plate Legs<br />
<br />
All of those are worth looking at, not sure how your guild does points so thats the decent warrior stuff I remember off hand. Could very possibly be some stuff I missed<br />
<br />
And of course the Talisman of Vah Kerrath is very nice, but not essential for a warrior.</div></div><hr />
