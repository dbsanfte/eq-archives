<br />
HP and gear are the only factor we warriors have in determining wheather or not we are good tanks. Skill plays a small part, but lets face it, we are only as good as our gear and Im sick and bloody tired of people who cast spells ignoring this. <br />
<br />
Ive sat out on thousands of parchment drops because I realise casters need theyre spells. Fine. But I will not sit there and have a stupid caster tell me Warriors dont need good gear to do theyre jobs. Nor will I tolerate hypocrite casters who roll on Iron Cog earrings, and then cry when I roll on a mask that is all/all but has clearly caster stats. Fack that crap. It has HP? Fine. I will bid /roll on it. You punks wanna bitch and whine about getting all your damn Runes? Fine. Know your role and respect the fact we need gear to do are fuggin jobs well.  <br />
<br />
Too many casters in this game are hypocrite fruit monkeys.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />

Thats always the threat, &quot;I can solo and you can't&quot; (said with an air like they are better than you, cause their junk TOON can solo thus making them a superior person). I quit EQ over all the crap Warriors have had to put up with, Sony has had PLENTY of time to unfuck warriors and choose not to, I was a multi-account player, no money for Sony, won't even buy Playstation 2 to deprive them of income. If every warrior reacted that way, Sony still wouldn't care, cause NONE of the Devs play a warrior. Blizzard will be happy for your business though. &quot;WAVE&quot; Furor! You had the point early on, as did I, I was told to &quot;shut up, we can get any warrior to replace you&quot; by my guild. That guild can't even do a Hate raid now, maybe Mistmoore and some would die (seriously is likely to happen)!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took one back for the melee's today. Yes. I rolled on a Spectral parchment and won. I happily took my parchment only to be countered with cries, hollers, and rants from the casters. And you know what? It felt fucking great. I suggest you all try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always roll on parchment.  I am in a guild with my necro and we were in thurg a silvery belt of contention dropped.  A druid insisted on rolling on a haste item just because of the +5 wis on it.  Ridiculus I tell you luckly we talked sense to him and forfeited the belt that he won to a beastlord that was second highest.  Atleast the beastlord could of used it.</div></div><hr />

Only people intereted in it were the wis casters cause every melee class had same or better.<br />
Always depends on your situation.<br />
I dont roll on parchments, its simply too late in game for that to make a point.<br />
Try to sell a eparch spell for more than 50pp and you have a hard time.<br />
Specs might be better but not by much.<br />
I mostly bought my clerics 63-65 spells except Armor of Zealot (won a rune in BoT).<br />
It wasnt cheap but compared to a few months ago i got the whole bunch for less than a Hand of Virtue did cost back then.<br />
Its always fun to see casters veto pure melees rolling on parchments and runes just to find some reason why they would wear a bloodmetal earring of engagement when a highly polished gem drops.</div></div><hr />

Had a Shaman with epic take a lamentation I needed from me, that was okay right? Since a caster did it I mean, casters have been the greediest toads of EQ. <br />
I reported a &quot;Stars&quot; Necromancer who camped the FBSS for 96 hours straight, sssuuurrree he didn't pass the account info to his guildy buddies to play for him, and that was okay?<br />
Let me fill in what was told to me by a caster in my guild, &quot;do pick up groups, pay the price&quot; he was of course soloing as always. BTW, last time I was with that guild some got killed in a Mistmoore raid, LOL&lt; last time I played EQ I was MA in a Elemental Plane raid. <br />
Don't expect melee to give up caster loots when the casters have rolled on melee loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naubi, that is rather easy for a hybrid, just look up itemisation in end luclin and tier 1 to 3 PoP.<br />
The last pally only weapon off Vallon Zek went for 4 or 5 dkp, (minimum bid) and your own blade of angles off xtc or AL went for like 9 dkp (knight only).<br />
My bloodfrenzy cost me 45 dkp, so assumed you raid as much as i do you have a lot of dkp to spend on armor and spells that i am forced to dish out to do my job (and cause one of our other warriors insisted on bidding max on it although he knew i could outbid him).<br />
And guess who has more dkp in the end when loots drop that either knights or warriors may want ?<br />
Due to the fact that we have twice the numbers of knights in guild as we have warriors guess how long it will take the warriors to upgrade ?<br />
I wont repeat the comments from warrior channel when you won the first BBB that dropped for our guild but right now there are some rather hard feelings toward knights and they are only in part due to agro issues.<br />
My comment on casters rolling on melee loot was referring to pure casters btw.<br />
What use is a bloodmetel earring to a druid or mage ?<br />
And of course the druid who claimed need before greed on the 3rd highly polished gem that dropped in one session sold it in bazaar (bad move to put your main char as trader up), the first 2 went to me to upgrade my second earring and the other one to a bard (who gave me first after winning roll due to need before greed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats whats wrong with EQ, my roomies new guild does it this way:<br />
<br />
DKP is set on an item<br />
If no one pays it, it is DESTROYED, DKP is not lowered, Knights have been getting over for to long. DKP on Knight and Warrior equivalant weapons are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DKP is compared to see who gets the item, if with in 5 pts, a roll off occurs, if not within 5 pts, sorry no lewts for joo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like our DKP system is somewhat different, we set minimum bids according to its relative value (both vallon zek 2hb and bloodfrenzy are at 4 dkp minimum) and a member of the lootcouncil takes anon bids from everyone who can use item (alts only if no main wants and at a +1 dkp penalty).<br />
To make sure that you get an item you have to bid relative high with this system.<br />
But the number of knight only weapons (its not that bad on armor) that drop end luclin first tiers of pop makes every other knight only weapon only a minor upgrade.<br />
With no bids items are destroyed(which is very rare still).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess that's what I deserve for posting on another classes board.<br />
<br />
I hope I haven't been the cause of any bad feeling toward knights. I think our warriors do an awesome job. For example, nearly all our offtanking (and all our clearing of trash mobs) is done by warriors and I don't see how a knight would do any better. In VT I try and help a little by aggroing mobs on me on a big pull till a warrior gets them... not sure if this even helps much. Last terris-thule kill we used warriors to tank the gargoyles with no problems at all (they didnt go splat like me :) ).</div></div><hr />

I keep the Spec I looted on a gold plague, right next to the photo of your mom going down on me.<br />
<br />
Random insults online make peeple feel gud aboot demselves! wewt wewt.<br />
<br />
All joking aside. I was pissed. A chanter rolled against me and won on an Iron Cog Earring - 10ac 5str 100hp. Thats enough to get anyone pissed off. So don't playa hate. I stopped rolling on Specs to avoid all the controversy and &quot;eq politics&quot;. Not worth the hassle. <br />
<br />
Trina Anderson wont go to the prom with me. Instead shes taking Jimmy Miller! Can you believe that???!?! I must cut some people down online to make myself feel better. So in closing I say FACK J00 deegreef. <br />
<br />
I think I need a disclaimer attached to my signiture stating all comments and posts by Spinetwist do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Moderators and the owners of the Steel Warrior forum. Can someone help me write that?</div></div><hr />

Gear is nice but dont overlook skill. <br />
<br />
Unfotunately; 10x the gear makes 5x less the idiot wearing it.<br />
<br />
(for clarification: not directed at you. just that the more gear some random idiot has; the less likely they are to be weeded out from a darwinian point of view)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no difference between looting an item for selling to buy an upgrade and looting the item directly. The only way to be fair is for every dropable item to be on an open roll (including parchments etc which are effectively dropable). The winner is of course entitled to gift looting rights to someone else.<br />
<br />
If the item is nodrop let anyone who wants roll, but the winner can be vetoed by a majority vote of the other party members. This is the idiot clause.<br />
<br />
Obviously these rules need to be agreed in advance and would generally only be required for pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solution:  Make them tank.  Sit back and click your blazing bracer of Fennin Ro every 5 seconds.  Comment on the fact that having X more hp on the item they won just made them live .0005 seconds longer!</div></div><hr />

I dunno, he just struck me as a total lootwhore.. maybe i'm off base here.  Take that thread to any other board besides this one and he'd get flamed like there's no tomorrow.  But alas, this is not another board, so good day *takes hat off and steps out the door*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for parch's and stuff, meh. I sat through kunark when my caster friends got jack shit, sat through alot of velious with the same deal (not just items, most spells were jack shit too). I may not like how horrid tier 1-3 itemization is for the warrior caste, but i'd go after the devs who make rotting knight and mnk / bst drops off almost every mob out there before a caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I'd add this to the caster rant.<br />
I participated in a 8th prayer shawl raid with some allied guilds last night.  Knowing the large number of tanks that would be required for the raid (at least one per mob in each wave of attacks) I knew the odds of me winning a roll on a snowchipper or spiked velium mallet would be slim.  Both of those, and several moderately high end research items dropped.  EVERYONE rolled on the melee weapons (both of which would have been upgrades for me), but only the casters that could use them rolled on the research drops.   Both weapons went to casters.  Snowchipper went to an enchanter.  I didnt even know how to begin to communicate my disgust with such an unfair arrangement, so I got a TL to bind and walked away from the keyboard for a while.   Wasn't my raid, wasn't my guild's raid, so I let it lie.   I was firmly convinced that to play a caster you have to be an egocentric, greedy, loot-whoring shitbag......I at least felt that way for a few moments.  The fact that I didnt win anything didnt bother me, but the glaring inequity of the situation did.  Then I drug a bunch of my caster buddies to LoY to help me get some quest drops and felt better about the whole thing.....And I'm dragging them back this weekend too. :)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the 'perfect' solution..<br />
<br />
When a parch drops, have the melee loot it.<br />
let the casters rool to see who turns in.<br />
turn in to that class in library at end of group.<br />
ask that caster what spells they need...<br />
<br />
if the spell you get is not on the list, open roll it for all for VT..<br />
<br />
THAT is 100% fair to all in a group, see how far it flies with casters. Then see who needs to be called loot whores.<br />
<br />
IF, SOE would just FIX the god damn ornate drops... <br />
<br />
Come on, its so damn easy...<br />
 any mob that drops a Parchment should drop a damn ornate mold/pattern with the same frequency... Needing to kill named mobs that are rare spawns and have the armor be rare drops from named mobs is just so much utter BS, it is hard to talk about and remain civil...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stratys</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry that happened to you, Beornegar. Seeing something like that always makes you wonder what that person is thinking... of course, now we know he was thinking &quot;I just got screwed over by that #$%#$% spinetwist rolling and winning on a parchment in my last group, no way am I sitting on this melee weapon -- I need it to sell so I can buy the spell I didn't get from that parchment!&quot;  :D  Just kidding of course... but there's an element of truth to it -- we've all seen loot distributed in ways that we thought were unfair, and it makes it that much harder to be fair and unselfish the next time you have a chance for something. <br />
<br />
No class or category (&quot;caster&quot;, &quot;melee&quot;, &quot;hybrid&quot;) has cornered the market on outright greed; it's spread pretty evenly among the EQ population. Unfortunately, greed multiplies. It only takes one or two people acting out of greed to taint a whole guild/group/raiding party.... once people see that loot is going to the selfish instead of those who would truly benefit most, there is little reason for them to continue being selfless and abstaining when they don't &quot;need&quot; the item.<br />
<br />
I play primarily a chanter and cleric (I do have a 50 warrior, and my wife plays a 65 warrior), so I have a pretty good chance to see all sides of the loot issue. Let me assure you that for every story you have about a caster rolling for melee items, I can trade you a story about a tank doing the same on a caster item.  This is aggravated by the fact that most camps don't have an even distribution of loot for the various classes; NBG seems a bit less fair if you KNOW that nothing will drop that your class &quot;needs&quot;.  It also loses a lot of its appeal when you see people abusing it: I will never forget the warrior who called NBG on a pair of boots, and when asked to link his old boots claimed he was wearing *nothing* in that slot (sure enough, he was suddenly barefoot -- funny he hadn't been a few minutes before!); It was eventually pointed out that one of the other group members had been present when he had claimed the very same boots a short time before.<br />
<br />
In general, I'm in favor of any system which gives everyone a decent chance to get something nice, and spreads it out as evenly as possible. I would agree that NBG works best when you like and trust the people you are with; otherwise, /random is often much less prone to stir up resentment.... but above all else, have the discussion and settle the issue of how loot is to be resolved BEFORE something valuable drops. If you don't agree with the system, don't join the group.<br />
<br />
Landrain's idea has some merit -- if you are going with a NBG system, there's no reason why the duplicate spells that often result from parchment turnins shouldn't be /randomed among all parties.</div></div><hr />
