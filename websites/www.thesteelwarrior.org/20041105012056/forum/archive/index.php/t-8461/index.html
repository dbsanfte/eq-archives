<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I picked up Drape of the Agile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=15864) last night, replacing my Loyalist Shield of Honor (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=7398&amp;slot1=0), hoping that the dodge modifier plus the other stats would be the win over the loss in AC giving up the shield.  What do you guys think?  Anyone done parses on dodge to see what kind of impact it really has?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">skill mods do close to nothing, their aren't melee focus.<br />
 this 8% skill increaser will give you 205 insteed of 190 in doge skill ... what a relief ...<br />
<br />
katta shield is good enougth to wait PoT+ to replace it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sure hope you didn't take that over any other classes that can use it. It is obviously more fitting to an aviodance class. Shield all the way, AC is much better than some stats and a % dodge mod. I seriously doubt 15 to dodge can beat out 31 AC, but thats my opinion. However, grats to ya, its still not a bad cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got awarded this cloak a looong time ago.  I can't speak for the loyalist shield.  Perhaps some parsing would better answer your question?  I do like the extra hp's on the cloak though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">32ac &gt;50hp.<br />
<br />
It's pretty easy really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In GoD or EP+ definently.  I am however curious of how close they compare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">since he didn't maxed sta yet, the calcul is 15TA, 18AC, 125HP vs 50AC,75HP<br />
<br />
but still, the 32 raw AC increase is much more important than 68HP increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My DEX wasn't maxed either, so the +20 from the drape helps out with proccing, and the +25 CR/MR doesn't hurt.  So for me, it was really:<br />
<br />
15STA/20DEX/50HP/60END/25CR/25MR/8% Dodge <br />
vs.<br />
32AC</div></div><hr />

Whatever you need to tell yourself to keep the cap on the pills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ah well, maybe was not a good use of DKP I guess =P<br />
<br />
Anyway, if anyone can PM me with some good parser tools and mobs to use them on I would appreciate it.  I wanna see crunch some numbers =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">do you log your fight ?<br />
if yes, you would be able to see what the difference between 32AC and 15STA/20DEX/50HP/60END/25CR/25MR/8% Dodge very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Yalp &amp; EQCompanion are both popular parsers. You can find both w/a google search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Ditto.<br />
<br />
Never actually tried to parse anything have ya Yoda?  One gear change isn't going to be detectable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is the answer he would have get...<br />
and he would have been obliged to accept it...<br />
<br />

self results are always preferable when they give bad news :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got my Drape of the Agile cause it was gonna rot, and they kinda forced me to loot it.  I had an auged Loyalist Shield of Honor (60ac 75hp) beforehand.  Well, being that my AC was so ridiculously high, I took the aug out of the Loyalist Shield and put it into the Drape in favor of the extra hp and resists.  I lost AC, but I'm still over 2200ac anyways raid buffed (2226ac atm).  <br />
<br />
The plan is, once I start tanking Time gods, I'll put the aug back into the Loyalist Shield in favor of the massive AC again.  For elemental mini tanking... eh, anything over 2000ac is golden anyways.</div></div><hr />
