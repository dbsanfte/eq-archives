<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think this would work good? I have a 62 War, 59 Cleric and a 55 Shaman. Recently they just lowered the #'s needed to do a LDoN group. I am sure I will not win any but would be nice to get a zone to myself and a chance of some Augments. Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i did a 3 man group LDoN with my brother and our boxed cleric. all 65 and he plays a Bst. we did a collect 29 mission from EC since those are the easier dungens. generally, the pulls were a bit easier than with a full group, the most we got was 2 at a time. boxing the cleric really slowed us down since we had that extra character to lug around. it took us about 80 mins to get our drops. the mobs were just as hard as if we had a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Getting singles with that Set-up will be very, very difficult I imagine.<br />
<br />
Tanking two at a time three-boxed may be quite difficult as well.<br />
<br />
I have never played a sub-65 adventure though, so ymmv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh, I tried a guk 3 box crew. I was running me, my cleric and my friend's shaman. I generally tend to be decent at botting and ran out of time with 8 or so mobs left in a 60 slaughter. It was intense, a real challenge for a change. With some practice, I imagine it could be done. The exp wasn't as good as if I was in a full group because of the lack of dps, but it really was fun. If you can't find anyone else to group with and have the means to 3-box, it's a better option than sitting lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did one 2 boxing my cleric with a friend. We won, but it was pretty close. Was a blast though! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And Guk is the hardest of the camps, you should have an easier time beating say, Miragul, or  mistmoore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mintar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done eight 3 man crawls with my boxed cleric and either a shammie ( 5 of the crawls ) or Mage ( 3 of the crawls )<br />
<br />
1 Loss, and that was mainly due to the fact that the shammie popped 40 and I didnt have the right pacify line spell to get it to stick anymore.<br />
<br />
Stick with collection or slaughter ( pref collection ) , lets you micromanage time alot easier ( 30 bones = 3 a min , and so you can tell if your behind or ahead )<br />
<br />
Record was 58mins so far for completion.  Closest was the first while we were trying to get a handle on tactics ( 4mins at end )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Man, three boxing LDoN, you really are a glutton for punishment. I two box and have been told the only way people know is sometimes I answer with the wrong char. I could three box if I leveled my Necromancer. I am pretty sure I don't want to three box. A Shaman is enough with cani, Warrior will get harder with the patch on the 16th (YEAY), I can't imagine it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kruscher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No harm, no foul if you are playing with yourself (no pun intended).  Those of you who do hydra in groups should let the rest of the group know that you are hydra-ing.  Yes, we can figure it out quick, and yes we get pissed if you suck at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I 2 and 3 box on a regular basis and occasionally4 box if i'm not moving.  I've thought about 4 boxing in LDON for the exp after a friend of mine mentioned 3 boxing in LDON for the exp.  I'm just not sure I want the headaches of doing it.  BTW I don't use any hydra programs.  I just don't pay much attention to the 4th computer much.  I don't have too many problems as I only multi box with guildies and they are used to grouping with me doing this type of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wife charmed Orcs for extra DPS <br />
<br />
Odd...since I believe only the wolf models are charmable in EC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">does it take fewer kills or do the mobs have fewer hit points if you have less people in the group?  I just don't see how even for a normal mission some of those 3 person groups talked about here would have enough dps to finish in time.  Unless you have elemental or higher gear... then maybe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Minna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I commonly 4 box ldon's.  Over 100 wins so far doing this.  65 chanter, 65 war, 65 bst, 65 druid.  All closing in on 100 aa's now.  I like the challenge, and the ability to farm points consistently.  Sometimes I have friends join me on my adventures, but not all that often.  I typically finish with 30-40 minutes to spare.  The secret is to have hotkeys for anything you could possibly need to do.  As well as a different mindset.  I set up camps at open spots I find and pull 3-5 mobs at a time back to my little group.  I would think your 3 box would have a bit of trouble with this though.  Lack of mezzing means you have to take the time to constantly pacify or rely on root.  As well as either way mana will be an issue at some point.  Not to mention you will find yourself lacking greatly in dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I may try to 3 box some again now that my ench is 65.<br />
<br />
I run Warrior/Cleric/Ench and when the ench was 62 I simply could not get the DPS needed to finish in time.<br />
<br />
But at 65, charm and the buffs may give me the edge I need, hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for being able to tell, yea you can normally tell when a group member does not talk....ever. Some folks can multi-box well, others can't. Just like some single boxers can play well, and others should just quit EQ. <br />
<br />
I can 3 box in full groups in LDoN on Hard, and even charm on the ench. It does take alot of work though ;)<br />
<br />
And no, I don't use any programs to help with the bots. Hotkeys are the secret :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Crumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The 55 character will gimp the difficulty.<br />
<br />
I 3-boxed a 65 war, 65 cleric, 58 shammy. The mobs hit for significantly less than a normal difficulty all-65 adventure (200ish max). XP was worse, and a win only got me 34 points. So it really wasn't worth it. <br />
<br />
On the bright side, the cash was nice. I did get some augs (but they were also gimped by the difficulty of the encounter - +5's). Having a zone all to yourself is nice.<br />
<br />
The big challenge for you will be pulling. If you can figure out how to pull singles, or can handle more than 1 mob at a time, you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />
