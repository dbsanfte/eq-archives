<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nfef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I couldn't decide between making a warrior or a SK?<br />
<br />
I have roughly 200k or so for gear and most likely will be ogre no matter which class.<br />
<br />
Going to post this on the SK board as well just to get maximum responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would ask you what your goals are.  If its to solo then make an sk.  If its to pull then make an sk.  If its to tank normal mobs then make an sk.<br />
<br />
If you want to tank raid bosses or the hard stuff then make a warrior hands down.<br />
<br />
If you want to see the end game or get in an end game guild make a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">do you like casino ?<br />
if yes, roll a shadowknight and pray that it gets warrior disc.<br />
if not, roll a warrior and laught at paladins and shadowknights because they don't have our disc.<br />
<br />
In a more informal sence : what do you plan to do ? <br />
if you want to be raid MT/SA then roll a war.<br />
if you don't plan to raid that much and want to focus on exp content then roll a SK.<br />
if you like to solo, either roll a SK and face even con mobs, or roll a war and fight only light blue.<br />
and so on ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nfef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Copied from the thread on the SK forum:<br />
<br />
Well at this point i'm burnt out on my main's class role and purpose in the game(more lack there of), so i'm retiring him and instead of making a alt, this character will be my new main. I've never played a tank class before so maybe my view is skewed, but as I always understood it SKs and warriors had the same basic role in the game, just a different way of achieving it. They both are normally the main damage-takers in the group, warriors holding aggro through fast quick weapons with procs, taunt, and aggro discs, and SKs rely more on spells and slow heavy hitting weapons with aggro procs as well. Is this not the way it is?<br />
<br />
I intend to take this character at least as far as the EP, maybe time+ depending how long my interest in EQ holds out with all the new games coming out soon. As I said before though I've never played a tank class or even close to one, so I really have no idea of what would help me decide between warr and SK.<br />
<br />
I do love raiding and will be doing it as much as possible once able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've never played a tank class before so maybe my view is skewed, but as I always understood it SKs and warriors had the same basic role in the game, just a different way of achieving it. <br />
<br />
NO !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
They both are normally the main damage-takers in the group, <br />
<br />
Not exactly. <br />
Warriors are the most domage takers because they can acheive bigger AC than knights (a knight will need armor from futher expension to match the gears of warriors).<br />
knights use their spellbooks to turn off a part of the incomming domage (stuns for paladins and snare+fear for SKs). because of game design this doesn't work on every mobs (resistances immunities and lvl) especially on yellow con and +.<br />
warrior can use different disc to help him out. discs are separated in four family,  only one disc can be used at a time and only disc of different family can possibily be chained. I mean, the is one time per family, when a disc is used, it runs its liked timer for its duration and its cooldown. and untill then no other disc that are on the same timer can be used. a list of disc ordered by timer is here. because there is no lvl intervention in disc system, it can be used on all mob in cluding red one (actually mob that can avoid disc are countable in one hand). thus we are the more likely to survive one round of melee from a really bad hiter.<br />
moreover warrior tend to have more HP than knights (from gears), thus we are more effective to survive heavy DD or EA, and  are more heal efficient.<br />
ex : defencive disc is 3min of effect and 10 min of cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
 warriors holding aggro through fast quick weapons with procs, taunt, and aggro discs, and SKs rely more on spells and slow heavy hitting weapons with aggro procs as well. Is this not the way it is?<br />
<br />
Not exactly. <br />
knights have a melee aggro malus, and warrior a melee aggro bonus, this make us not so bad at holding aggro before lvl 50. thus we have to get the best dps weapon to hold aggro, not the fatest one.<br />
knights can chain cast, or cast on need, aggro spells to help them keeping aggro very well.<br />
after lvl 50 we have access to procing weapon (actually few procs before but it isn't usefull due to poor proc rate at low dex). Procing aggro spell (stun, hate, dispell, slow, not dot, not DD, not lifetap) make our life much easier and we can start to compete with knights on the aggro generation. proc rate depends on DEX only, it goes up to 2 proc per minute at 305. innate proc mod, Weapon Affinity (AA) and Combat effect help to increase it futher.<br />
and to complete this we have from lvl 20 to 65 a line of skill (not disc, but still use endurance) that throw a DD+DoT of hate not domage : it's the incite line.<br />
<br />
<br />
I intend to take this character at least as far as the EP, maybe time+  ... I do love raiding and will be doing it as much as possible once able to.<br />
<br />
then roll a warrior without any hesitation !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nfef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Extremely useful post Yoda, even though there were parts I had to look at a couple times to figure out what you were saying, hehe.  :) <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol<br />
<br />
sorry for my poor english and my even worse expression.<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe now you understand why all my friends call me yoda ...<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : BTW the disc list is here, the above one is the AA list. sorry for this dehavior.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2 : all pure melee get the skill 'thowing stone' at lvl 1 in the tutorial. it's on the same timer of the incite line and does 1 domage to the target (radius 40 feet), but it can critz letting you potentially, with the correct AA and situation, scoring a finishing blow (32 000 domage) from it !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a strong, unfair bias against knights. My old guild *frequently* used knights to tank trash mobs on raids in the EPs. Knights can't tank the boss mob; they can tank everything else. Remember: KNIGHTS HAVEN'T BEEN NERFED. Warriors were upgraded. It's a very, very different thing... the PoP content hasn't changed. <br />
<br />
  Knights can use spells to hold aggro, and to get initial aggro on incoming, much more than warriors can. In addition, they do have spells. Warriors tank better but as a tradeoff have less options. The degrees of these tradeoffs is up to debate, naturally.<br />
<br />
  Summation: If you want to tank *everything*, be a warrior. If you want to tank but have other options, be a knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">since he asked on SK board too, I din't expend myself on it. but I said :<br />
knights use their spellbooks to turn off a part of the incomming domage (stuns for paladins and snare+fear for SKs).<br />
<br />
and not getting hit is allways better than being hit but being able to stand it. see this thread to convice you.<br />
<br />
because of game design this doesn't work on every mobs (resistances immunities and lvl) especially on yellow con and +.<br />
<br />
so yes, it works on trash. but it doesn't help when facing the boss.<br />
<br />
knights can chain cast, or cast on need, aggro spells<br />
<br />
this makes them the best emergency tank because if taunt fail, we have to rely on incite if available (30s cooldown) but it doesn't work great if we want to recover aggro from a nuke, while knights can chain cast two or three spells relly fast to get aggro ASAP when taunt fail.<br />
<br />
Moreover, knights are great dispeller because they can start dispelling on inc and start to tank the mob before the warrior gets a succesfull taunt, then better dispeller and debuffer can finish his work.<br />
Knights have much more versability that allow them to take another place in the group when the better option isn't available. SK are very good puller for exemple, and their tap can be usefull to the whole group. in none cutting edge content, where warrior isn't the only one to be able to survive, their are often prefered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's old advice from The Knight's Watch: If you have to ask, roll the warrior, the paladin, the ninja shark with laserbeams, not the SK. If you're an SK, you don't have to ask. <br />
<br />
In every good SK there is a core of absolutely unshakeable confidence, often even arrogance. He -must- be willing to push the absolute edge of his limitations, in every way, and he must play very aggressively. If he does not, he's a gimped over warrior diddling around with spells. If, in the course of acquiring 200kpp and a burned out mage, you have not watched a good SK in action and thought to yourself, &quot;That kicks so much ass that I want to do it, damn the torpedoes!&quot;, you probably don't have what it takes to be a top notch SK.<br />
<br />
That said: While much of what's said above is largely true, pay particular attention to the first paragraph of Fitemore's post above. It's very, very important. Both classes will have their moments of incredible frustration with their limitations. Also note, that on mobs over 55, the Fear/Snare combo is automatically invalidated. (And often of little use anyway.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've heard all that from people at the SK board, from people who play trolls, people who play iksar, etc, and personally I think it's a huge load of horse shit. There's nothing special about Sk players, or troll players, it's just another class with some arrogant people that play that class and think they're something special. Note: I am not talking about that classes players in general, don't misunderstand me.  But you weren't just born with this &quot;innate SK leet jedi powers&quot;, it doesn't work that way. It's a game, you play a class in it, get over it. Half of the people on the SK boards have their hidden level 65 beastlord/mage/monk/rogue magelos tucked away anyway i'm sure.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's our asshole way telling you to pick your own class for your own reasons. You already know what the classes do and a rough idea of how they do it. Pick the one you want. If you want it, you're going to be good at it - desire creates skill, which creates confidence, which creates skill. If you have to ask someone else what you want to be, you don't want it. And a bad SK ruins my day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you want to raid, and you can't decide between a warrior and an SK, then go play a paladin.  Paladins are more popular on raids, have an important buff, and do very well at off-tanking.  I am concerned that this class actually appears to tank better than sKs (what class balance?) but they appear to.   Necromancers can summon corpses and pull and all the other things that an SK would (only better).  <br />
<br />
Playing a warrior is boring, especially until level 60.  Your job isn't glamorous, and until the high end, folks are gonna frequently pick another class instead of you in grouping.  You cannot effectively solo, though if you waste lots of money and gear and potions you can pretend that you can after you are 65 and have 200 AA and VT+ gear when you go to Umbral Plains or Fungus Grove and get one half of one percent of a level each mob.<br />
<br />
At the high end, warriors are quite AA and gear dependent.  When everyone on the raid is trying for the killshot and cheering you don't even bother.  When the situation starts to go bad, it's your job to AE Taunt, hit a disc and make everyone else get out while you die.<br />
<br />
Being a warrior is a dirty job.  If you aren't rabid about doing it, don't bother.  There are plenty of us out there who love it and can't hardly imagine doing another class.  Why give yourself the competition?<br />
<br />
If you eventually decide to try the warrior for a bit, and if you're just itching to play an ogre go ahead, but honestly you'll have less aggravation and be a better warrior as gnome, a halfling (ugh), or a woodelf.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if your burnt out switching to a tank wont fix it. you will do the same thing on differently.<br />
<br />
it might be enough to keep you playing, but it wont fix the disarray you currently feel twards the game.<br />
<br />
and in that case make a pally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love being a warrior. Back to playing Rheven again since I got guilded and have an easier time finding groups (not to mention a cleric or two I could trust). Last night we killed that Paladin in Greig's and it was a blast. One thing I sure love about my lil redhead wood elf is that it's easy to maneuver her and get right in the fight, up close and personal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Voltana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a fairly well equiped 65 SK. I &gt;&gt;LOVE&lt;&lt; playing him. BUT, lately I have found that the content that the people I hang with want to do he can no longer handle effectively. He has all his defensive AA's and could only upgrade his equipment by raiding in the EP's which he is not flagged for. So I switched to a Warrior I had access to. She is 65. Has slightly better equipment but only 1/3 of the AA's the SK has. She still has 600 more HP than the SK without having any of the +HP AA's. With aggro weapons and augs she can hold aggro almost as well as the SK could (although it IS dependent on the roll of the dice on those procs) but even in her current AA-lacking state can seriously out-tank the SK.<br />
<br />
If you are looking towards being main tank on 65+ content the Warrior excels and the SK falls a bit short. If you just want to be a melee class that is versatile and fun to play pre-65 content go with a Pally.<br />
<br />
Knowing what I know now, as much as I love playing the SK I don't think I can recommend that anyone start one due to their lack of value in the high end game content. If you are going to spend the time and effort to level a character to 65+ you would want to be useful and needed until you no longer wanted to play anymore. SK's seem to top out much sooner than Pally's and Warriors remain viable right to the end of the game.<br />
<br />
Something else to consider though, Knights are much more fun to play until they reach content they can't effectively tank anymore. For me, the War didn't really hit his/her stride and become fun until I started doing stuff the SK couldn't do as well.<br />
<br />
As always, your mileage may vary. :)<br />
